<p>Everybody knows it: Putin is a dictator and a mass murder who is committing terrible crimes. I would be very happy if Putin would be killed, because Putin's Russia (a fascist country), has become the worst threat - besides China and the militant Islam - for the free world today. This is just self-defense, not murder. And those who defend his actions (such as the user abakharev) are no better than those who justify any other crimes against humanity and should severely be punished, if not by the state or the international community, then by any resistance fighter who could do it. - A Voice from Free Europe.</p>

<p>is it possible that someone close to the government was so stupid to kill her, right now that previous attempt failed and were denounced, thus risking international isolation and despise? or is it a foreign attempt to discredit Putin's rule and mount another "orange revolution" against him? -- You can take a part in these discussions all over the runet, there's no point trying to talk about that in wikipedia. --GolerGkA 21:52, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And as for whether its is possible... yes, but unlikely because Russia is trying to join the WTO. And if you think someone who don't want Russia to join the WTO killed her, you are a conspiracy theorist. Anyways this is not the place to talke about this. <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudoanonymous_d8a1.html" title="User:Pseudoanonymous">Pseudoanonymous</a> 01:18, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Er, conspiracy theory or not, you deigned to comment on it yourself. She riled enough people in the country that anti-WTO parties with grudges themselves would just be in with the rest of the wash of complaints against her.</dd>
<dd>Anyways should we change the title from Death to Assassination or not? Even though it is very likely a hit, Wikipedia does not like to engage in speculation. Therefore if we changed the title to Assassination, then we leave out the possiblity of somekind of bizarre suicide or just random street crime/violence, which would be POV. But still...very likely Assassination. <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudoanonymous_d8a1.html" title="User:Pseudoanonymous">Pseudoanonymous</a> 22:47, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Murder or homicide would be appropriate given she was shot twice (not a suicide), assassination would be a very loaded and POV term to use. --<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeil916_fb6c.html" title="User:Neil916">Neil916</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil916_0ff9.html" title="User talk:Neil916">Talk</a>) 05:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Assassination" is only a loaded term if there's any significant doubt as to the manner of death. When a person is shot three times to the body and once to the head, and the gun is left at the scene of the crime, I don't think there's really any doubt that "assassination" is the most accurate term to use. This murder had "contract hit" written all over it. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 19:17, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know an 'Assassination' is when someone is killed for political reason. While I have no doubt that she was killed due to her journalistic work, I don't think it has been proven without doubt. It would then probably be safer to change 'Assassination' to 'Murder' as that is the correct legal term. Kytok 07:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The unsourced claim at the end of the Career section that Politkovskaya wrote "flattering" articles about Chechen Rebel/Terrorist leaders, including those responsible for Beslan, seems dubious. Maybe a deliberate attempt to discredit? Although I can't claim to have read these interviews, which I assume are likely to only be available in Russian language, I have read an article on the Observer (Sunday version of the Guardian) website which would directly contradict this. Tom Parfitt writes "Critics accused her of being partisan in her damning reports on the cruelty of Russian federal forces, but Politkovskaya did not hold back on criticism of the Chechen rebels' brutal tactics either." <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html" class="external free" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html</a> So I propose to change the article to suit and cite the above as a source.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarveyspeed_44e3.html" title="User:Harveyspeed">Harveyspeed</a> 20:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, you seem to have tagged every other sentence with citation needed, many times in the middle of the sentence, in the middle of a phrase, even. It makes me think you just kind of splashed them on there. On another note, how does the lack of citation add up to POV? that is, why is the tag necessary? <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorgo_c293.html" title="User:Torgo">Torgo</a> 05:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dead3y3: Adding "citation needed" to nearly every claim is ridiculous. It makes the article look very ugly and is, in most of the cases you marked, not even partcularly necessary. I spent about ten minutes adding several citations to the parts you indicated needed attention. Why could you not have done this instead of splashing cite tags to every second sentence? Contribution is far more valuable than criticism and takes about the same amount of effort. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 07:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Τhe uglyness of the article isn't an encyclopedic issue. I marked the points which needed attention (which <u>were not</u> every sentence in the article). Didn't this help you to understand what type of citations were needed? And I don't think that what I have done is criticism. I provided a base for the addition of proper citations. I obviously didn't splashed them in there; this is because I spended time to explain with a comment what kind of citation was necessary for each {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}}.</dd>
<dd>Also I had nothing to do with the NPOV matter. I just transfered the NPOV tagging by an other editor on top. I didn't comment on that, and neither did the formentioned editor, although it was his responsibility to explain which parts he found POV and for what reasons. Which unfortunately he didn't. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDead3y3_5da7.html" title="User:Dead3y3">Dead3y3</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDead3y3_897c.html" title="User talk:Dead3y3">Talk page</a></sup> 18:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You missed the point. Citation tags are generally not desirable and should be avoided if possible. Citation tags every second or third sentence throughout the article should never happen. It ruins the presentation of the article and makes the information useless to <i>the reader</i>. If you have an issue with accuracy then you can either bring it to people's attention here or, like I said, spend a couple of minutes finding an adequate citation. Splashing cite tags all over the article is not a reasonable solution.

</ul>
<p>Also this: "Anna Politkovskaya is stoical about threats to her own life. Appearing on this week’s SBS Dateline report, 'Putin’s Media Wars', she said that she is gradually getting her children used to the fact that any moment they might be left without her. ‘They have all my instructions for that scenario’, she said. Also on the program was the editor of Novaya Gazete, Sergei Sokolov, who said that four of the newspaper’s journalists had died in suspicious circumstances in the 11 years since it began operation. Overall, we were told, 148 Russian journalists have died of unnatural causes since 1992." <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1324511.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1324511.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Some on the threats from Ramzan:</p>
<p>"While on one of her fact-finding trips to Chechnya, Anna Politkovskaya was brought two times to the house of Ramzan Kadyrov in Tsenteroi, where she was verbally harassed and threatened by Kadyrov. On 10 June 2004 she was supposed to meet the then presidential candidate Alu Alkhanov, but while Alkhanov, who was attending the funeral of his father, was not present, Kadyrov was, and he behaved very aggressive vis-à-vis Politkovskaya, telling her with raised voice “You are defending bandits! You are an enemy!” The next day, on 11 June, Politkovskaya received a phone call from Taus Dzhabrailov, head of the Chechen state council, who invited her to come again to Tsenteroi in order to interview a captured commander of the armed insurgents, who allegedly had given his agreement to the interview. When she arrived in Tsenteroi, it turned out that Kadyrov had arranged for her to meet Ibragim Garsiev, whose story she had covered in a Novaya Gazeta article a year ago. He had worked as a guard in the Malik Saidullaev election campaign, and had shown Politkovskaya traces of beating on his body, telling her how Ramzan Kadyrov personally tortured him, demanding that he should blow up Saidullaev. Moreover, Garsiev wrote to the general procuratura asking to initiate a criminal case against Kadyrov. Now, a year later, in Kadyrov’s house, Garsiev refuted his own allegations and claimed that he never wrote to the procuratura, since he cannot write at all, and that he had only signed a paper given to him by Saidullaev’s brother Rustam. He further stated that the traces of beating were only marks of a car accident that took place under influence of alcohol. The head of the Urus-Martan police, who was present during this meeting, confirmed the fact of the mentioned accident. In Ramzan Kadyrov’s presence Garsiev then dictated and sent to the procuratura a letter rebuffing his first one. Kadyrov and the people surrounding him were again aggressive towards Politkovskaya, yelling that she should have been shot back in Moscow.5" <a href="http://www.ihf-hr.org/viewbinary/viewdocument.php?download=1&amp;doc_id=6093." class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ihf-hr.org/viewbinary/viewdocument.php?download=1&amp;doc_id=6093." rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<dd>Also, her last story. Anna Politkovskaya was working on an article on torture in Chechnya which was almost ready to be published. She had especially collected some graphic photo material (bodies of a Russian and Chechen men who were kidnapped by Kadyrov's men). The police took away Anna's personal computer as "evidence", but NG says that they have parts of the article and the photos and will publish what they got. Also, via AP: "In a recent radio interview, Politkovskaya said that she was a witness in a criminal case against Moscow-backed Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov, whose security forces have been accused of kidnapping civilians and other abuses." --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 14:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One aspect of Politkovskaya's personality and reputation in Russia that should be adressed in the article is that she was a.... ehm, OK, maybe she was not a pathological liar but, to put it it mildly, she would not stop at publishing outright lies if she felt it would advance her cause. (If she'd participated at Wikipedia, quite a lot of of her edits would have been commented out as being totally POV). Here's a couple of links on the subject by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Kirill_Pankratov" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Kirill_Pankratov" rel="nofollow">Kirill Pankratov</a>: <a href="http://russ.ru/comments/114827349" class="external autonumber" title="http://russ.ru/comments/114827349" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (in Russian), <a href="http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/8220-15.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/8220-15.cfm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (in English). Initially I wanted to edit the sentence in the intro section - the one about critics accusing her of this or that, bla-bla-bla - and add the second of the two links above but then I just thought we'd better discuss it on the talk page first.

<p>P.S. For the Sherlock Holmeses among you: word in the Russian journalism community is the last story she worked on was on Government funds allocated for the reconstruction in Chechnya being stolen. Incidentally, that seems to be the topic <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Abramov_2acb.html" title="Sergey Abramov">Sergey Abramov</a> investigated before a couple of assasination attempts put him out of the game (and put Kadyrov Jr in his place). --10:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Provided the source is credible it is certainly reasonable (if not essential) to mention that her reporting has come under fire with regard to accuracy. However, "credible" is the operative word here. It would be very unreasonable to insinuate that she played fast and loose with the facts based on sketchy reports from sources which themselves are questionably honest. I haven't checked out the Russian article you linked but the English one has no citations of any kind, simply saying that the story it discusses "was thoroughly investigated and covered in Russian press (in particular, in several lengthy articles in Izvestia)." On politically charged subjects like this one we need to take great care that we're not simply creating doubt where no <i>reasonable</i> doubt exists. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 10:47, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh geez, this <b>again</b>? It was already given by the other guy ("mixer") in the "Some things to be covered section" above, and there you can see my response (unanswered). Looks like her critics has obsession over this letter - and it shows how little can they even accuse her of (after dozens of investigative articles and several books, they can all try with only one single sentence). And this tells volumes.</p>
<p>Now - no, you are mistaking her with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Khlebnikov_95cb.html" title="Paul Khlebnikov">Paul Khlebnikov</a>, murdered in Moscow in 2004 - and also Kadyrov Sr's former deputy Yan Segunin, also shot dead in Moscow around this time. Anna was working on article on the kidnapping, torture and murder of two men, a Russian and a Chechen, by Kadyrov Jr, who were later shown on TV as a "fighters killed in combat" in Avtury (she said she had graphic photos of tortured bodies). Also, she was to be a witness in a criminal case against Ramzan. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 16:59, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't see mixer's post and you reply when I posted this. The point is not that "critics has obsessions with this letter" or "how little thay can accuse her of"... Have you read the other two links I provided above - from your familiarity with the subject I gather you'll have a working command of Russian? Even her close personal friends like Divov admit she shouldn't have gone into journalism due to her inability/unwillingness to check facts. And note how matter-of-factly he mentions this - it's a well-known fact in Russia and needs no dwelling on when you write for a Russian audinece as he does. Does this merit inclusion into the article? But, please, without all this bullshit about anyone criticising AP being pro-government or anti-something. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApoivre_4ada.html" title="User:Apoivre">apoivre</a> 02:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm rather surprised she didn't take more care of her work. At least in TV, whenever journalists are working on a story which may piss a lot of people off they tend to make sure there are several copies of their work in different places. For example, perhaps one with the editor, one in a secret safety deposit box (that may be a letter to be given to the editor upon death for example). Obviously there is a timelag between when the information is obtained and when it is back-uped somewhere (although with the internet and computers we would assume much less so) but I would have thought all of the important info will be somewhere even if it's difficult for someone to actually be able to understand it all (since we can assume there is a lot of short hand etc) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:44, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't really know much about this subject (i'm only here 'cause she was in the news just now), but i have two issues with the article.</p>
<p>Firstly: I don't speak Russian at all (or know this person's history), but the name 'Politkovskaya' sounds like a very artificial name to me given this person's occupation. As in, it sounds like it has something to do with politics, which is basically what she reported on. If that's the case, i think a mention should be made in the article as to the intentions she had when choosing that name for herself. I mean, the article doesn't make it clear at all. Is it a pen name, or did she legally change it? Is it a 'real' surname in Russia, or is it a personal statement? Et cetera.</p>
<p>Secondly: I notice that the words 'Mr' and 'Ms' are used in the article. I thought this was frowned upon in Wikipedia as being sexist (since the 'Ms' commonly signifies a woman's marriage status, whereas 'Mr' doesn't). Am i wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as I know, Politkovskiy (feminine form Politkovskaya) is just her former husband's surname. It was her real name and the name of her daughter, it is not a very rare name in Russia. Her maiden name <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazepa.html" title="Mazepa">Mazepa</a> has much stronger historical associations. The English speaking title problem Mrs vs Miss vs Ms has no analoug in Russian, we have probably have to google her most common title in the English speaking press. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 12:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the title 'Ms' was invented specifically to avoid reference to marital status in women...but in any case, I think it's bad form to use these titles in an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellemichelle_f867.html" title="User:Bellemichelle">Bellemichelle</a> 12:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>To the person who asked the questions: As abakharev says, "Politkovskaya" was just her surname - she didn't choose it herself! That it sounds somewhat like "politics" is purely coincidental. My own surname translates as "goat herd" but if my job was to herd goats that would just be a coincidence.&#160;;) As for the Ms/Mrs stuff, you have it backwards: "Mrs" signifies that a person is married whereas "Ms" says nothing about marital status. However, Bellemichelle is right that there's no need to use either in a Wikipedia biographical article. We should stick to using her full name, surname or pronouns where appropriate for the flow of the article. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 12:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Speaking of her family. Do you think that her x-husband, Alexander Politkovsky, <a href="http://www.vid.ru/programs/_ved/Politkovsky.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vid.ru/programs/_ved/Politkovsky.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://www.aif.ru/online/aif/1161/23_02" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aif.ru/online/aif/1161/23_02" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and his opinion on the murder <a href="http://www.isra.com/news/73684" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isra.com/news/73684" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> (The murder is certainly connected to her work, she received many death threats and at some stage even hired a bodyguard) is relevant to the article? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 13:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm kinda doing this out of order since i'm replying to everybody but whatev. (1) Regarding the name: I'd assumed it was a chosen name, my mistake. I think then that it'd be appropriate to include something about her marriage in the article, even if it's just one or two sentences, since as far as i can tell it doesn't explain anywhere else why her name changed. (2) Regarding the ex-husband's opinion: Yeah, i imagine that would fit in perfectly fine in the 'reaction' section. (3) Regarding 'Ms': Er, you guys are right, that doesn't denote marital status. I'm an idiot. I knew that.&#160;:( Anyway i don't think the existence (or lack) of an analogous problem in Russian really matters. Those titles appear in non-quoted material (as in, original article content), so it's just a matter of some Wikipedia user's wording decision. I'm gonna go ahead and remove the titles in any case. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a> @ 16:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I noticed that the Cyrillic version of Anna's name (as listed on the main article page) doesn't match the accepted Romanized version at all. You can check, rambler, pravda, etc. for her Cyrillic name (for example: <a href="http://www.pravda.ru/filing/Ann_Politkovskaja/t" class="external free" title="http://www.pravda.ru/filing/Ann_Politkovskaja/t" rel="nofollow">http://www.pravda.ru/filing/Ann_Politkovskaja/t</a>)</p>
<p>I was preparing to edit the article to fix this mistake, and then i noticed that on the edit page her name is correctly entered in Cyrillic, however, on the article page it appears incorrectly.</p>
<p>Does Wikipedia have a problem displaying cyrillic characters? What is the problem here? I'm puzzled...</p>
<p>Moreover, this needs to be rectified.</p>

</ul>
<p><br />
Of Course. If you go to the webpage I referenced above (one of the main Russian news sources), you will see a different Cyrillic name than what appears on the 'article' page. However, as I noted, if you look at the text on the 'edit' feature of the main 'article' page, everything is in order.</p>
<p>As it appears now (I am running the newest version of Firefox and using 'Unicode' character encoding, it would read as: Anna Smepanovna Polumkovskaya, which is clearly wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is an 'encoding' issue with my browser, but I have checked on three independent computers now and it is showing up a bit wonky. Even though, as I have mentioned, the Cyrillic on the 'edit' screen is correct.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Are my computers just not reading this correctly?</p>

<li>Thanks. It was a standard problems. Italic Cyrillic letters (e.g. <i>т</i>) in most fonts looks different from the non-italic (e.g. т). Thus, we recommend not to italize Cyrillic.

<li>May be this is not for Wikipedia, but the birthday is highly relevant. When FSB wants to eliminate a political figure or a journalist, it selects the method of murder carefully. For example, Artem Borovik died from a powerful blast on the plane (“just an accident”), and Yurii Shekochikhin died from poisoning (“a disease”). Both criticized Putin and FSB/KGB. Both were very famous journalists in Russia. But since they were not openly assassinated, you will not find their names in the lists of journalists killed in Russia. In the case of Anna, Putin thought that she is not that influential, exactly as he said during his last trip to Germany. Therefore, Anna was murdered openly, in the contract killing style, and on the Putin’s birthday. This was done to send a powerful message to all other Russian journalists who might challenge him as Anna did in her book. The message was: “This is ME. I can kill anyone and at any moment. So, be afraid and do not dare to tell the truth!” Of course, they are not going to explain this to the foreigners. Only people who were victims of KGB “active measures” understand too well their methods.--<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:16, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know what I am talking about. I was involved in one of first "free" election campaigns in the former Soviet Union during late "perestroika" as a member of a grass-root organization. My phone was tapped by KGB, and when I talked too much, they simply turned off the phone line. My boss at work was at their side insisting to stop those political activities. One of my friends turned out to be a KGB agent and actually promoted KGB candidates, but I found this out only much later. No wonder that the election to the city council and the parliament was won by an army of undercover KGB agents who pretended to be very nice and liberal citizens. But after the election (not right away but when someone from the “above” made an order), all the elected to the posts KGB members simultaneously changed the behavior and started doing completely opposite things. The KGB/FSB in Russia is not a security organization. It acts and works as a political party of the kind described by Orwell. Right now, FSB actual and "former" members and "friends" represent an overwhelming majority in Russian Duma (the parliament), there is a KGB president (“there is no such thing as a former KGB man”, he said), almost all members of government, gubernators, etc. And as you probably know, KGB/FSB has formal membership, military discipline, support of Russian population, and an army of undercover agents (“stukachi”). Thus, this is a truly "totalitarian" organization that simply replaced the Communist Party (it actually struggled for the power with Communist Party from the moment when Stalin was poisoned by Beria). But unlike the Communist Party, it works in secrecy; it does not tell “I am the boss”. This secrecy helps FSB government to fool around “useful foreign idiots” (as Lenin said), from US president to foreign investors. Those foreign “idiots” invest money to the pockets of FSB elite who own almost all important assets in Russia, such as Gazprom. These are not my original ideas. Please read books about KGB by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Barron_%28journalist%29_e164.html" title="John Barron (journalist)">John Barron (journalist)</a> and especially “The state within a state” by Yevgeniya Albats (she was mentioned in article about <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Karr_65d3.html" title="David Karr">David Karr</a>). So, I know how those people work and even how they think. I am sure, the death of Anna was a birthday present for the president Putin. Any proofs? We will never have them. Read <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_apartment_bombings.html" title="Russian apartment bombings">Russian apartment bombings</a> and the "Darkness at Dawn" by David Satter.

<p>Sorry,pal,but your latest posts sound paranoid.I do not live in Russia,but I have never heard of political repressions in that country during the post-Soviet period,exept for the "controversial" Khodorkovsky case (in the USA he would have got a longer sentence for NOT PAYING TAXES).<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 18:30, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let's stop this discussion. This is not a chat room. I referred to many books, Wikipedia articles, facts, quotes, and my personal experience. Almost <i>every</i> article by Anna tells about terrible repressions in Putin's Russia (and she wrote more than 500 of such articles). That is why she became herself a victim of political repressions. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 00:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You forgot that the likes Berezovsky and the goverment of Ichkeria (Umarov,Zakaev) could have been interested in her death.<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 12:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, you are telling me that Zakaev and Berezozovsky could kill Anna to harm the President. Indeed, this version can be found in many state-controlled Russian media. They follow hints from Mr. Putin himself who said that murder of Anna "inflicts much greater damage to the government than any of her writing". I think your opinion is an excellent example of brainwashing in the modern “Putin’s Russia”. When Stalin ordered murder of Kirov and then blamed “the enemies of the people”, this at least was logical since Kirov was one of Stalin’s closest friends and associates. In contrast, Anna publicly criticized Putin and Kadurov, so they both are obvious suspects. Death of Anna is indeed a certain blow to Russian authorities. But they can easily afford this. After killing so many people in Chechnja, poisoning the hostages in the theater, burning children alive in Beslan, and exterminating other journalists, Putin’s FSB government can be sure that Western leaders will tolerate anything. So, they decided to open a hunting season on the dissidents. In doing so, they went further than Andropov and Breznev who did not dare to murder openly Sakharov and Solzenitsyn.--68.43.173.3 05:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly,I am not Russian.Secondly,your opinion is driven by stupid extremist and russophobic propaganda.Notorious characters (like Berezovsky or the Ichkerian goverment) often sacrifice their 'defenders' (like Politkovskaja) to put the blame on their opponents.History proves this thesis.</p>
<p>P.S the poisoned hostages and the fate of the children in Beslan are 99% fault of those Ichkerian jerks (Basayev,Mashadov,Umarov).<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 12:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please tell me about at least one example when "Berezovsky or the Ichkerian goverment) sacrifice their 'defenders' (like Politkovskaja)" in Moscow. Dear Dimts, please read articles about Beslan and the theater written by Politkovskaya and many others. The children were burned alive because Russian special forces attaked the school with the flame throwers ("Shmel'"). There are many unsuccessful operations to free the hostages in the history. But usually the hostages were killed by the hostage takers, not by police. The fact remains that almost all people in Beslan and Dubrovka were killed by Russian special forces <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spetsnaz.html" title="Spetsnaz">Spetsnaz</a> (see book “Spetsnaz” by <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Suvorov_c686.html" title="Victor Suvorov">Victor Suvorov</a> where he describes their brutal tactics and the flame throwers), not by Chechen rebels. Also look Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 13:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But those people would have been alive now if the Chechen rebels weren't taking hostages.

<dd>So, what are you telling is this: if someone has taken people hostages, just order to kill them all, and blame the hostage takers, as Putin did? I think that under such circumstances, the president who gave such order, and the serviceman who executed the criminal order and physically killed the children are even more guilty than the hostage takers. But Putin did more: he established a complete information blockade during the mass murder in Beslan by ordering to poison Anna on the board of the plane, arresting Andrei Babitsky and a group of Georgian journalists, and a lot more. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In your opinion the hostagetakers are saints?You're saying it's not their fault?!The special forces at least tried to save the hostages,but the Chechen terrorists would have just executed those hostages if their conditions were not met.<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 12:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, of course, I do not like islamofacists of the kind 9/11 in US or the gang in Beslan. That's for sure. But there are many different opinions who was behind the hostage takers. I do not know if you can read articles by Anna about Dubrovka and Beslan (from Novaya gazeta). Sure, the hostage takers are guilty. But it was so terrible to see these young Chechen women killed without mercy at Dubrovka, just as at the hostages killed by the poison gas. They all were killed together by the same people and the same system... <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 23:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You mean those young armed Chechen woman who were part of the group...which took over the theatre?I agree that pumping gas into a building full of people was not a good idea.But,on the other hands,killing the hostages was not a part of the special force's plan (that was sleeping gas).<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 08:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. These Chechen woman did not deserve to die like that. Let me clarify. A hostage taker who did not kill anyone yet (as most of these women) is guilty in kidnapping and putting other people's life in danger (this is a serious crime that deserves a serious punishment in a court). A serviceman from <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spetsnaz.html" title="Spetsnaz">Spetsnaz</a> who physically killed a hostage by pumping the gas or otherwise is guilty in murder (and the person who gave such order is also guilty). A servicemen who kills an incapacitated suspect (like most of these women) is also guilty im murder. You suppose to know the laws of the country you are living in. Of course, things are very different in Russia, where there is no working justice system (see "Putin's Russia" by Anna). You should also know that each of these women could easily pull the trigger and blow out the building, because most people remained concious for a few minutes after filling the smell of the gas. But they did not do it, because they were not going to, exactly as Anna said (or perhaps they could not do it, because the wires were disconnected by their leader, or their bombs even were fake, as some other people believe). <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I did not answer your question about the "sleeping gas". I think they knew how it works. Or maybe you are right, and they had no opportunity to try this gas previously on a large sample of people. I would recommend you to read the book "Perversion of knowledge" by Birshtein, who describes early years of a secret KGB lab, where each new poison had to be tried on many people of different age and etnicity. Right now they are probably doing such experiments in Chechnya, as described in several publucations by Anna in "Novaya gazeta". The poisons have very long and proud history in Russia. The list of poisoned people is very long and probably includes such prominent figures as writer Maksim Gorky, Stalin, and more recently another jurnalist from "Novaya gazeta" Yuri Shekochikhin, and possibly even Anatolii Sobchak, who suddenly died from "heart attack", a few hours after drinking a glass of mineral water given him by Mr. Putin <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe she needs her Wikipedia article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a tribute to the slain Umazheva, award-winning Russian war correspondent Anna Politkovskaya wrote in the December 5 issue of Novaya Gazeta: "<a href="../../../m/a/l/Malika_Umazheva_5646.html" title="Malika Umazheva">Malika</a> was a true heroine, a unique and marvelous one. She became the head of administration of one of the most complex Chechen villages--Alkhan-Kala (a 'Baraev' village, the subject of endless 'cleansing operations,' executions and disfigured corpses) after the former head had been murdered. Reason would have told her: 'Sit quietly. Be careful.' But she did the exact opposite--she became the boldest and most committed village head in that murderous zone of military anarchy which today is Chechnya. By herself, unarmed, she went out to meet the [Russian] tanks that were crawling into the village. Alone, she shouted to the generals who had deceived her and, on the sly, were murdering the residents of the village: 'You scoundrels!' She relentlessly fought for a better fate for Alkhan-Kala. No one else permitted himself to do that in present-day Chechnya. Not a single male."<br />
<br />
"She, a humble village head who had been elected by a popular assembly," Politkovskaya continued, "earned the wild hatred of the chief of our General Staff, the much-decorated <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatoly_Kvashnin_c472.html" title="Anatoly Kvashnin">General Kvashnin</a>. He hated her so much that he invented the vilest stories about her, using his access to the television cameras to spread them. And she? She continued along her chosen path and, in response to Kvashnin's lies, she sued him in court, knowing perfectly well that almost everyone is afraid of him.... But Kvashnin does not forgive those who do not fear him."</p>

<p>It's in Russian, so here's translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Murderers of Politkovskaya May Be Hiding in Siberia // Local police officers are under suspicion// Former officers of Nizhnevartovsk's police could be involved in the murder of Novaya Gazeta's columnist Anna Politkovskaya. The journalist helped to put one of them in prison while two other officers were placed on the international wanted list and six more are still under suspicion. The investigation team of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya went to Nizhnevartovsk, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area in Siberia last week. They received information that two former police officers Major <b>Alexander Prilepin</b> and Lieutenant Colonel <b>Valery Minin</b> were seen in the city. <b>The men are wanted internationally for crimes they committed in Chechnya.</b> The investigators, however, did not find the men in the city but they interrogated Prilepin and Minin's relatives and former colleagues. Between 2002 and 2005, Anna Politkovskaya wrote several stories in Novaya Gazeta about the murder of Zelimkhan Murdalov, 30, from Grozny in January 2001. The journalist learnt that the Chechen was detained for no clear reason by police officers who went from Siberia to Chechnya. The men killed Murdalov, hid his body to cover up tracks. Politkovskaya was the first to name possible perpetrators of the crime – Senior Lieutenant <b><a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Lapin_8270.html" title="Sergei Lapin">Sergei Lapin</a></b> from Nizhnevartovsk and his commanders, Major Prilepin and Colonel Lieutenant Minin. She wrote later that these officers and some other employees of the Interior Ministry were involved in the killing of Zelimkhan Murdalov and dozen of other Chechen civilians. Sergey Lapin was sentenced to 11 years in prison last March. His accomplices are still on the wanted list. "I cannot say that articles by Anna Politkovskaya influenced the trial and the subsequent verdict," Stanislav Markelov, lawyer of the relatives of the slain Chechen, says. "Still, the officers believed that she was the motor of the case, and they put the blame for all their problems on her." Journalists from Novaya Gazeta recall that Anna Politkovskaya received letters, emails and phone calls with threats during preliminary investigation and even after the trial of Sergey Lapin. Politkovskaya was shot dead on October 7, and officers from Nizhnevartovsk also came under suspicion. Lapin is not among them – he is currently serving his term in a prison in Nizhny Tagil. Moscow investigators, however, keep an eye on his relatives. They have already interrogated Lapin's father and sister. It is no accident that the investigators questioned the officer's sister. The latest theory of Politkovskaya's murder has it that at least three people were involved in the killing, including a man and a young woman who were following the journalist. They appeared in footage of close circuit cameras at the Ramstore shop. The perpetrator of the crime is believed to be a tall ethnic Slavonic man who had sporty or army bearing, as witnesses say. Investigators have already drawn the portrait of the suspect. It has not been published, though, due to security reasons. The Prosecutor General's Office hopes that the man will be recognized by military men or police officers from Chechnya without publicity and will be caught soon.</p>

<p>Do you mean this passage by Politkovskaya: "I will not go into the other joys of the path I have chosen, the poisoning, the arrests, the threats in letters and over the Internet, the telephoned death threats, the weekly summons to the prosecutor general's office to sign statements about practically every article I write (the first question being, "How and where did you obtain this information?"). Of course I don't like the constant derisive articles about me that appear in other newspapers and on Internet sites presenting me as the madwoman of Moscow. I find it disgusting to live this way. I would like a bit more understanding."? But this is not the accusations in "unwilingness to check facts before reporting them" (a serious offence for a journalist). What you are doing is misrepresentation of references, exactly as in article about <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a>.

I may call as discreditation any claim of NGO about trial of racist and fascist Boris Stomakhin. You may keep your personal opinion, but if you cite POV in Politkovskaya article, you should give a place fro all POV accordingly, so as not to distort the real image of POlitkovskaya. You even don't know simple facts about Politkovskaya, such as she was a US citizen.

<p>Sure. I will translate it and will include in the article "Critics accused her of being partisan in her damning reports on the cruelty of Russian federal forces, but Politkovskaya did not hold back on criticism of the Chechen rebels' brutal tactics either. Her speciality, however, was exposing the horror, corruption and chaos wrought on civilian victims of the first war in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996 and the one that followed from 1999 onwards".<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html" class="external free" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html</a></p>

I will not go into the other joys of the path I have chosen, the poisoning, the arrests, the threats in letters and over the Internet, the telephoned death threats, the weekly summons to the prosecutor general's office to sign statements about practically every article I write (the first question being, "How and where did you obtain this information?"). Of course I don't like the constant derisive articles about me that appear in other newspapers and on Internet sites presenting me as the madwoman of Moscow. I find it disgusting to live this way. I would like a bit more understanding.</p>
<p>And here is additionally <a href="http://compromat.ru/main/prismi/politkovskayaoderzh.htm" class="external free" title="http://compromat.ru/main/prismi/politkovskayaoderzh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://compromat.ru/main/prismi/politkovskayaoderzh.htm</a> К сожалению, статьи Политковской изобиловали непроверенными и непроверяемыми данными. Это мой опыт, как человека, пытавшегося несколько раз пойти по следам ее публикаций. Это нормальная журналистская практика: кто-то упоминает о каком-то событии или явлении в своей статье, кто-то из коллег подхватывает эту линию и развивает ее дальше. Вот со статьями Политковской часто выяснялось, что на самом деле она этого не видела, а ей только рассказали об этом — и тому подобное… Все, кто работал в Чечне, слышали об этих самых ямах, в которых якобы федералы держали задержанных чеченцев. у меня у самой было несколько очень подробных интервью с молодыми мужчинами, которые рассказывали, что их в таких ямах держали. Я этим ребятам верила и верю. Но сама я таких ям никогда не видела, и никто из «нейтральных» людей — то есть журналистов, правозащитников — их не видел (во всяком случае, по состоянию на три-четыре года назад — может, с тех пор кто и видел). То есть все о них сообщали со слов жертв. А Политковская написала, что видела. Потом оказалось — неправда. И так довольно часто: друзья-правозащитники жаловались, что не могут подтвердить данные, опубликованные Политковской». Другие коллеги-журналисты, даже близкие к Политковской и считавшие её деятельность полезной, говорили и говорят — стеснительно или прямо — то же самое. С фактами у Политковской всегда был швах. Постоянно получалось так, что журналистка регулярно путала ситуации «я видела своими глазами» и «мне говорил один чеченец с честными глазами». И совершенно спокойно писала «я сама видела» — когда речь шла о «рассказали».</p>
<p>Существование самих рассказчиков, впрочем, тоже вызывало сомнения. Например, Анна Степановна публиковала статью с «исповедями российских солдат, воюющих в Чечне». Исповеди она, по её же словам, принимала из солдатского сортира: то есть она сидела в этом сооружении, а с внешней стороны к этому сооружению подходили какие-то люди, называющие себя солдатами срочной службы, и через щели в досках «говорили правду». Думаю, всем понятно, чего стоят такие информаторы — даже если они на самом деле существовали. Впрочем, воевавшие в Чечне люди писали по этому поводу на Интернет-форумах: «все сортирные откровения — бред».</p>
<p>Пиком профессиональной востребованности Политковской стал «Норд-Ост». Террористы, захватившие заложников, изъявили желание видеть Политковскую среди людей, с которыми они могли бы вести переговоры. Честь сомнительная, но Политковская так не считала: возможность выступить в роли транслятора требований бандитов вдохновляла её. Это было бы сильнее любой благотворительности – стать ангелом-хранителем несчастных заложников и рупором «свободной Ичкерии».</p>
<p>Справедливо ли это? Увы, да. Политковская всю жизнь тусовалась среди людей определённого типа и сама была их частью. Она делала пиар на трупах – отдавая себе отчёт в том, что делает, и считая это нормальным. Теперь для того же самого дела понадобился её труп. Что ж, те же люди, которые платили ей деньги, проплатили два выстрела, контрольный в голову.</p>
<p>Here is more interesting information about financing of Politkovskaya <a href="http://compromat.ru/main/novayagazeta/a.htm" class="external free" title="http://compromat.ru/main/novayagazeta/a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://compromat.ru/main/novayagazeta/a.htm</a></p>
<p>Как передает "Интерфакс" (цитируем без изъятий), региональный оперативный штаб по проведению антитеррористической операции распространил в среду заявление, в котором утверждается, что "Новая газета" и ее корреспондент Анна Политковская стремятся использовать поездки журналистки в Чечню "для разрешения своих финансовых проблем и разногласий с некоторыми фондами".</p>
<p>И.Шабалкин говорит, что в 2000 году Фонд Сороса (Институт "Открытое общество") подписал с руководством "Новой газеты" соглашение о проекте "Горячие точки" на сумму $55 тыс.</p>
<p>Газета в декабре 2000 года в соответствии с этим проектом получила первый транш примерно в $14 тыс., за который необходимо было представить промежуточный отчет в июле 2001 года и окончательный отчет к концу 2001 года.</p>
<p>По его данным, это не было сделано. И.Шабалкин отметил, что Фонд Сороса письменно поставил "Новую газету" в известность о намерении прекратить финансирование и предложить это другим организациям и фондам в связи с невыполнением газетой своих обязательств.</p>
<p>И.Шабалкин считает, что попытки А.Политковской вызвать вокруг своего имени в Чечне скандалы связаны именно с желанием заставить фонд списать указанную сумму.</p>
<p>И.Шабалкин напомнил, что 9 февраля А.Политковская прибыла в Чечню, не имея аккредитации, нарушив инструкцию о порядке пребывания работников СМИ в зоне проведения антитеррористической операции. Она направилась в Шатойский район без охраны, а предложения местной военной комендатуры переночевать на ее территории, а утром в сопровождении охраны выехать за пределы района попыталась преподнести как ее задержание.</p>
<p>Here is about taking of Award by Politkoskaya and not paying taxes</p>
<p><a href="http://compromat.ru/main/prismi/politkovskaya.htm" class="external free" title="http://compromat.ru/main/prismi/politkovskaya.htm" rel="nofollow">http://compromat.ru/main/prismi/politkovskaya.htm</a></p>
<p>История получения одной из премий весьма красноречиво описана устами персонажей скандальной книги Андрея Мальгина «Советник президента»:</p>
<p>«-- ...Она приехала в Берлин, чтобы получить премию Вальтера Гамнюса. За гражданское мужество якобы. Вы к тому времени из Германии уже умотали в Москву. А я еще там поболталась немного, и вот стала свидетелем такого скандала. Короче, приезжает Поллитровская, ей с помпой вручают 30 тысяч евро...</p>
<p>-- Нехило, - искренне позавидовала Валентина.</p>
<p>-- Чем менее известна премия – тем она больше по размеру. Это закон, запомни. Но ты слушай – дальше самое интересное. Между Германией и Россией соглашение</p>
<p>об отсутствии двойного налогообложения. И аккуратисты-немцы у нее спрашивают: где желаете платить налоги. «А где меньше?» - естественно интересуется Поллитровская. Ей отвечают: «Сколько у вас, в России, не знаем, но у нас 40 процентов!» Ну то есть полная обдираловка. И посоветовали вообще-то платить в России. «Ну, в России так в России», - согласилась хитрожопая Поллитровская. Разумеется, в России она никому сообщать о полученных деньгах не собиралась.</p>
<p>«Очень хорошо, сказали немцы, так и запишем. А теперь не соизволите ли вы сообщить свой ИНН?» - «А зачем вам ИНН?» - «А это чтобы поставить в известность ваши налоговые органы», - спокойно так ей отвечает какой-токлерк из гамнюсовского комитета. Что тут началось! Как она орала! Что потом несла на пресс-конференции!</p>
<p>-- Ну что она могла нести?</p>
<p>-- Валь, я сама не слышала, знаю в пересказе. Но типа орала, что получила премию от общественного немецкого фонда за то, что в поте лица борется с тоталитаризмом в России, а немецкие бюрократы фактически львиную долю премии прямым ходом отправляют российскому тоталитарному государству, и там на эти деньги, собранные честнейшими немцами, русское правительство будет строить тюрьмы для диссидентов..И все в таком духе...Помнишь, как она в самолете блеванула, и из этого целое дело выросло – что ее спецслужбы специально отравили, чтоб она до Кавказа не долетела.»</p>
<p><br />
«Валентина стала считать в уме: 1.000 (пулитцеровская) + 30.00 евро (какой-то Гамнюс) + 20.000 долларов (ОБСЕ) + 5.000 долларов (премия сахарова). Итого: 26 долларов и 30.000 евро!</p>
<p>За что?!</p>
<p>Разумеется, Валентина сразу же набрала номер Анны Бербер....</p>
<p>- Так вот, дорогая моя Валентина, через минуту я тебе зачту полный список всех ее премий... 12.000 фунтов стерлингов.... Премия в 50 тысяч евро... премия «свободы прессы» размером 7.600 евро...»</p>
<p>- Ладно, Ань, хватит. Я просто в шоке.</p>
<p>- Да брось ты. Девушка сделала себе имя. И теперь стрижет купоны. Есть только одно неудобство во всем этом: она теперь вынужднеа без конца изображать, как ее преследуют. Без этого ей теперь никуда. И уж, разумеется, ни на шаг не отступать от своей позиции. А позицию ты знаешь.</p>
<p>- Ну да. Типа долой агрессоров из Чечни.»</p>

<li>OK, I put a reference to Arutyunyan from The Moscow News as a source that AP was criticized over fact checking. Still most of the above data picked by Vlad are an obvious crap. A notorious internet personality, Konstantin Krylov calling AP's reputation dubious is a typical case of the Pot calling Kettle Goebbels. $14K is hardly enough to send any journalist for a week-long trip to Chechnya, you are not expected to make miracles for this money, pages from a yellow-press about a fictious heroine named Pollitrovskaya are hardly a reliable source about the real life figure, etc., etc. Still do not see any point in denying she was strongly criticised <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 08:19, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, it is O'K to say that she was criticised. But to be fair, we then have to present her reply to such criticism in the most objective manner, that is using her citation from the corresponding article. Current version does not properly reflect her reply. In addition, the article by Arutunyan was published after the murder, not during "last years of her life". So, a different reference might be required. But if to remove "last years" as I did, your reference can be just fine, except that Arutunyan was strongly criticized for this article (interview with Albats). <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:29, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The assassination section here should be shortened – again – because there is a sub-article, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Politkovskaya_assassination_459d.html" title="Anna Politkovskaya assassination">Anna Politkovskaya assassination</a>, for that purpose. It was created so that this main article wouldn't become oversized and overshadow everything else, mainly her biography section. After I created the assassination article on October 23, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Politkovskaya&amp;diff=83694528&amp;oldid=83343380" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Politkovskaya&amp;diff=83694528&amp;oldid=83343380" rel="nofollow">shortened the assassination section on this main article to 5 paragraphs</a>, but someone <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copypaste.html" title="Copypaste">copypasted</a> the whole <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Politkovskaya_assassination_459d.html" title="Anna Politkovskaya assassination">Anna Politkovskaya assassination</a> article back to the main article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Politkovskaya&amp;diff=89893541&amp;oldid=89869172" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Politkovskaya&amp;diff=89893541&amp;oldid=89869172" rel="nofollow">one month later</a>.</p>

<p>With regards to the earlier dispute on this talk page about the reliability of the "compromat" vs. reliability of non-governmental organizations, should the targets of both be considered? The "compromat" information discredits (or criticizes, depending on your camp) a murdered pro-human rights journalist and activist (whom critics suspect in anti-government subversion), while the Russian non-governmental organizations along with Western figures and organizations are criticizing the Russian government bodies and the president, suspecting them in letting such murders occur (subverting the Russian government, according to the other camp). Mind that Politkovskaya did not have official power to persecute the brutality of Russian government bodies while the objects of her criticism did. Therefore, letting the pro-government non-academic sources in this biography should be weighed according to the scale of the criticized targets.</p>

<p>The after-murder accusations brought by Arutunyan against Politkovskaya take one third of the "Career" section. In my opinion, this is inappropriate. Arutunyan claims Politkovskaya "admitted that she had never actually seen the pits herself", while both pro-government and human right news services cited Politkovskaya's answering negatively only to the question whether she saw people in the pits.<a href="http://www.smi.ru/text/01/02/27/161028.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smi.ru/text/01/02/27/161028.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a><a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/2001/02/27/annapolitkov.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gazeta.ru/2001/02/27/annapolitkov.shtml" rel="nofollow">[17]</a><a href="http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/N-Caucas/ch99/010226/no0226a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/N-Caucas/ch99/010226/no0226a.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>

<dd>На такие нерадостные мысли меня навела нашумевшая история с корреспондентом "Новой газеты" А. Политковской, которая в августе 2000 года сопровождала гуманитарный груз для дома престарелых в Грозном. Военные, как и положено, сформировали колонну, выделили усиленную охрану (любое продвижение людей по городу небезопасно). Но журналистка, похоже, об этом не думала. По пути то и дело требовала непредусмотренных остановок для решения каких-то своих проблем. В очередной раз остановив колонну, приказала военным ждать и растворилась в одном из городских кварталов. Почти час солдаты и офицеры торчали на улице в качестве отличной мишени для боевиков. Командир весь извелся: всего одной гранаты в борт БТР или снайперской пули из окна хватило бы для трагедии. Именно это и высказал он вернувшейся журналистке, которая тут же выплеснула на военных ушат оскорблений. Позже в газете появилась ее статья, где она повторила обвинения военным во всех тяжких грехах: мол, и трусы они, и бездельники.</dd>

<dd>Vlad Federov: Two things - first, Wikipedia talk pages are not the same as Internet-based forums. Please could you post your comments as a single block rather than inserting them line by line into other people's postings? The latter makes the conversation difficult to read and also disrupts the original poster's comments, which is not reasonable. Second, please try to remain civil - your comment, "If you are not sure, don't try (Russian proverb)", is needlessly combative. (And FYI, since English is not your first language, "I'm not sure..." in that context means, "I don't think...", so your proverbial advice doesn't apply anyway.)

<dd>I don't understand the relevance of your last comment there - my previous post was not intending to enforce any particular Wikipedia policy. It was simply a request for you to be more civil and to add your comments in a way that does not disrupt other editors' comments. Further, given that I'm a native English speaker and you are not, I was attempting to help you by pointing out that your interpretation of the meaning of, "I'm not sure..." is wrong. Once again, in that context it means, "I don't think...", i.e. it's a polite way of saying, "I think you're wrong". I presumed that, like me, you would want to know when you're using a non-native language incorrectly. Instead you seemed to have simply transferred your belligerence from Ilgiz to me. This is disheartening. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 06:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Ilgiz. Vlad inserted the following segment:</p>
<p>"According to journalist Anna Arutunyan, 'During a reporting trip in 2001, Politkovskaya was detained by military officials in the Chechen village of Hotuni. When she was released, she wrote that she had uncovered pits dug out in the ground where military officials would allegedly keep Chechen hostages for ransom, directly accusing General Baranov, then commander of the Chechen federal troops, of these crimes. The publication was followed by a criminal investigation based on the allegations, but a delegation of official human rights envoys was unable to find any such pits. At a later press conference in Moscow, Politikovskaya admitted that she had never actually seen the pits herself, but that witnesses related seeing them to her. In another account she had said the ransoms was $150, while in another - $500'.<sup id="_ref-Arutiunian_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Arutiunian" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another telling example was Politkovskaya's recent allegations that special forces were preparing an "escape" for jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, in the course of which he was to be killed. Her source was a retired KGB officer who had served time in the camps. While the article was published in Novaya Gazeta this spring, these allegations went nowhere.<sup id="_ref-Arutiunian_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Arutiunian" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hence, Politkovskaya was primarily viewed as an activist rather than reporter. When terrorists held an auditorium hostage during the Nov. 2002 production of Nord-Ost, she spoke to the hostage takers and made their demands public. In Sept. 2004, terrorist in the Beslan school siege had also demanded her presence.<sup id="_ref-Arutiunian_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Arutiunian" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Against this backdrop, it would seem that despite a brave and sincere commitment to unraveling corruption and atrocities wherever possible, Politkovskaya's priorities as a journalist focused more on accusing and less on reporting.<sup id="_ref-Arutiunian_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Arutiunian" title="">[3]</a></sup>"</p>
<p>All these segments criticize Anna Politkovskaya (to say the least). These accusation have only one source: Anna Arutynan who has no good credentials, experience, or journalist reputation. Moreover, <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevgenia_Albats_183a.html" title="Yevgenia Albats">Yevgenia Albats</a> hinted that Anna Arutynanyan made this up on the order from the "above" (which seems to be very likely after reading the entire Russian text of the interview at <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echo_of_Moscow_405c.html" title="Echo of Moscow">Echo of Moscow</a> - see <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/programs/albac/46950/" class="external autonumber" title="http://echo.msk.ru/programs/albac/46950/" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.
