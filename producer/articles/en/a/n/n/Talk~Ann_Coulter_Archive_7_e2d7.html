<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter and McVeigh</span></h2>
<p>During an interview with the New York Observer Coulter said that she was ok with what McVeigh had done; "My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is that he did not go to the New York Times building." She has explicitly stated that she supports McVeigh's brand of terrorism... and suggested another place to hit. She doesn't regret that McVeigh blew up a building. She doesn't regret that he killed alot of innocent people. She doesn't regret that there was a daycare center in that building. She just has a 'better target' in mind. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:58, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Use the quote"? Uh huh... I take it you have missed your fellow conservatives screaming bloody heck about the use of quotations? Including that one? This is ridiculous... whether we describe her position without the proof that she holds it, paraphrase what she said, or quote her exact words someone insists on excluding it. My 'POV' is that Ann Coulter supports anti-american extremists, white-supremacists, and terrorists. There is quite alot of evidence backing up that view... and one way or another you ARE going to allow that evidence to be included in the article. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 22:10, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please READ the 'original research' guidelines. The idea that Ann Coulter is a right-wing extremist is HARDLY a 'novel interpretation'. I assure you that I am not the first person ever to come up with this 'radical' suggestion. The 'original research' guidelines do not prevent someone from adding 'the Earth orbits the Sun' without finding a quotation of someone else saying that. I CAN quote other people making the point which most recently got pulled out;</dd>

<dd>"Although the article is sympathetic to Coulter, it doesn’t make Coulter look good—namely because it uses Coulter’s own words. First, it has the already notorious quote: "My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building." This is a depraved, moronic statement. It’s one thing for a foo-foo babe from New Canaan to go native and develop militia chic, but when she expresses sympathy for the activities of racist criminals like Randy Weaver, the mass-murdering Branch Davidians, and McVeigh, it should raise serious questions to her advocates. As far as I know, it hasn’t." <a href="http://horowitzwatch.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_horowitzwatch_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://horowitzwatch.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_horowitzwatch_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<dd>The point is... I shouldn't HAVE to. We don't NEED quotes to say that the Earth orbits the Sun... it has been pretty well established that this opinion exists... we can just throw it out there and let any Flat-earthers who are around put in their objections. Filling an article with quotations of other people expressing opinions doesn't make it "encyclopedic"... just messy. Number of quotations, type of quotations, describing views without quotations, quotations from the wrong people... this is all nonsense. Every which way someone tries to include what they see as wrong with Coulter it gets yanked. Enough already. The excuses are getting increasingly silly (e.g. saying, 'some people think Ann Coulter is a right-wing extremist', is now "original research"). --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 10:13, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I vote B. She's obviously a right-winger and self ID's as that. But the first thing I think when I see Ann Coulter is - Damn, that's the hottest looking woman over 40 I've <i>ever</i> seen...including Demi Moore! My next thought is I know I'm gonna laugh my butt off at how she incites liberals. And she <i>never</i> fails to deliver:) So, while she would probably be delighted to be called a right-wing extremist, I think we should be smart enough not to fall into her little trap.

<dd><b>BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN?</b> Think of the poor 6-year old that has just learned to read coming on wikipedia looking up Ann after seeing a lifteime worth of her on Fox (he's only 6). He reads this article and sees she is just a harmless jester who writes bestselling books, engages in hyperbole, constitutional attorney, who doesn't ever insult anyone and righteously supported trailer-park good Christian girl Paula Jones. Sure, she has a few critics but all they have are unfounded "allegations" about her. Oh and her legs are 10 feet long. The kid grows up accusing everyone of slander and treason and calling teachers to the mat with accusations of liberal bias and eventually blows up the N.Y.

<dd>You have taken sarcasm literally. It is an elementary mistake. Don't worry, a lot of Ann's detractors fall into that trap; it's why she uses such language -- so she can claim "how stupid liberals are" -- she loves to think that (even though it is not true). She uses hyperbole, she's a polemic. It's what she does. <b>The fact that you are here discussing it, saying, "how is that anything but support?" <i>is making her point.</i></b></dd>

I agree with gator and paul klenk. If that's the only basis for a claim of timothy mcveigh support, it's a travesty this even made it into the article. I'm taking it out. If you can find her specifically praising McVeigh that's another story. What she said was similar to what Howard Stern said the other day on his often hilarious program "I wish (hurricane) Katrina would have swept away Jennifer Anistion and Oprah Winfrey." This was not an homage to life-destroying hurricanes. It was a sarcastic shot across the bow at Oprah and her 'pal' Jennifer.Big Daddy 15:09, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Is it possible you failed to read his reasons on the talk page? You need to do that, and make an honest effort to understand it. He made a good point.

<dd>Smear? I think not. I read the discussion, it sounds like an attempt to whitewash support for a terrorist. And to answer your other question, no again. If I had lived here ten years ago, if I considered Oklahoma home, I would have to take a very careful look at my own POV. But I was in Michigan at the time. My comment was meant as an observer, not as a participant. I'm by no means convinced by the whole joke angle - commentators reverse themselves all the time...some, like Pat Robertson are shameless enough to claim that they didn't use a word that's on tape, but most of them claim that they were either taken out of context, or joking. We cannot speculate about what people meant, only report what they said. Coulter has expressed her support for McVeigh. It's a verifiable fact. So she supports at least on terrorist. Maybe she supports others, maybe she doesn't. But it isn't the place of a Wikipedia article to speculate about this. You can report serious, verifiable information that "explains what she meant". But removing it because "we all know it's a joke"...that isn't really in keeping with the standards of a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 01:06, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good afternoon, I took out that prepsosterous suggestion that she supports Tim McVeigh. The only thing more prepsosterous is the absolute <i>tortured</i> logic that supports it in this talk section.</dd>
<dd>But, if someone wants to carry on in that vein, be my guest. The logic supporting it is a textbook case of the 'selective' outrage that occurs when someone simply wants to slime Ann Coulter. If Ann's joke means she <i>supports</i> Tim McVeigh than Bill Maher's joke means he <i>supports</i> <b>murdering</b> Katherine Harris (see below) Howard Stern <i>supports</i> people being drowned by Hurricane Katrina and <b>countless</b> comedians <i>support</i> Dick Cheney dying of a heart attack! IOW, this is a dead end ridiculous and pathetic attempt to smear her for absolutely no reason. It may not be funny to you but neither is Hurricane Katrina to others. When someone tells that crude joke in the movie 'The Aristocats' does that mean beastiality, incest and necrophilia are a <i>huge joke here in OKC</i> or anywhere else? BOTTOM LINE: If you want to make a statement of fact that Ann Coulter supports Timothy McVeigh, you're gonna have to have more than a wisecrack.

<p>Anonymous dude: You've got a point, but you have no idea what it's really like editing in Wikipedia. Not only do the Ann-haters fail to see the forest for the trees (whole sections are created merely to damage her reputation) they will fight you on every...little...detail if they think it is a positive for Ann. The McVeigh fight is a classic example but hardly unique. And, you know what, people have a right to express their opinion. That's how Wik works. It doesn't mean they'll prevail if their opinion is based on faultly logic, or as in this case, an obvious attempt to smear someone. But sometimes you just have to edit articles one line at a time. Maybe someday it'll be better. Just not yet...Big Daddy 18:37, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guettarda, your insistence on adding the misleading McVeigh wording in light of the discussion on this page is beyond the pale. You are going being factual editing to making subjective and inaccurate characterizations about what she says.

<dd>Paul, you're hilarious. I comment on heartless bureaucracy, and you characterise it as a "screed against Bush". Which illustrates my point exactly - <i>you need to look beyond your POV</i>. Having an opinion does not mean you cannot edit neutrally. I despise <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Williams_4f33.html" title="Eric Williams">Eric Williams</a> more than I despise Bush, but I have written most of that article very neutrally. Lots of people here have written neutrally despite strong POVs. You should try it. It doesn't matter what criticisms you have of AC - if they are documentable, put them in the article, if they are your personal opinion, keep them out of the article. That's simple enough. There's a quote of her supporting McVeigh. It's verifiable, so it's legit. Calling it a "joke" is not verifiable, so it's personal research (or mind-reading).

<p>Good. I think we have it about right. Support for McVeigh? Nonesense. Support for Joseph McCarthy? Absolutely. In fact, I propose we eliminate the word 'allege' to "unwavering" support for McCarthy. Ann Coulter is an admitted (and apparently quite proud) Joseph McCarthy apologist. Much of her book Treason is an attempt at resurrecting his image. I don't know if she actually supports Nixon. My guess is not but the claim is not nearly as ridiculous as to suggest she supports McVeigh. What I think we'll probably find out is that she thinks Clinton makes Nixon looks pretty good by the standards of relative comparison. Anyone even remotely familiar with Coulter's work is aware of how much she utterly <i>loathes</i> Bill Clinton. So, it's probably not true that she supports Nixon. I think the following line probably sums it up "Not all Republicans are good, but all democrats are bad." I actually heard her get booed on Jon Stewart when she made that declaration. :) Big Daddy 04:44, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Bill_Maher" id="Bill_Maher"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bill Maher</span></h2>
<p>Here's how I re-worded the Bill Maher piece:</p>
<p><i>Coulter has appeared several times on Bill Maher's cancelled program "Politically Incorrect". Maher has referred to her as "a friend of mine" yet often ganged up on her with other liberals when the conversation turned serious. While on the show she has been deliberately provocative, comparing, for example, actor <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Belzer_d343.html" title="Richard Belzer">Richard Belzer</a> to <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a> and saying the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote should be repealed.</i></p>
<p>It's better because it eliminated the cheezy 'pretend sex' line that's useless and only feeds the ann-haters already frenzied antipathy (see above for a user comment that illustrates this perfectly.) Plus it ADDS useful, and relevant info regarding one of the reasons why Ann became such a darling of the right - Her ability to withstand <i>withering</i> attacks from Maher and 3 other liberal guests (Ann being the token conservative) on a regular basis before a national audience.Big Daddy 09:24, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hear you. I changed it again. Perhaps you can make it even better. What I was attempting to describe was what frequently happened on PI. Maher would invite just ONE SINGLE conservative guest along with 3 others who were either far left or left-leaning and then <i>joined</i> them in their attack on the conservative. Now, to be fair to Maher, he has improved as reflected in his HBO show, but it was truly despicable the way conseravtives were treated on the old ABC program. One was even spit on by Sandra Bernhardt. Anyway, Coulter would often be that token conservative 'punching bag'. But she'd acquit herself quite well. True, she definitely played the "I'm hot" card, wearing the tightest of tops and shortest of skirts (for which I was eternally grateful) but she also did held her ground and it was duly noted by Maher.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What an Improvement!</span></h2>
<p>This article is TREMENDOUSLY more balanced than it was just 3 short weeks ago. Applause to everyone. Most of what pops out to me now are just little tidbits that can be tweaked without a full scale war breaking out.</p>
<p>I haven't done anything to the passage below, but to help everyone see why it's laughably ironic as it's currently written, I highlighted a couple snippets...</p>
<p>"<b>...that Coulter is only joking</b>, or that she is engaging in hyperbole. However, Coulter herself has never stated that she doesn't hold these views when responding to the controversies about them. Indeed, when asked about a comment she made suggesting the New York Times building should be blown up, Coulter took the opportunity to clarify that <b>she meant this should be done only with the newspaper staff inside.</b> Big Daddy 15:16, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wrote it, and it's <b>deliberately</b> ironic. Yes, it looks like hyperbole... yet the point stands. All of this, 'she does not really mean it' is an INVENTION of her fans. Coulter herself makes no such claim. All the, 'you liberals just do not GET it' stuff is painfully obtuse in it's own right. We DO get it... what YOU are failing to see is that by playing this 'does she mean it, does she not mean it' game Coulter presents horrifically unAmerican, pro-terrorist, fascist, et cetera beliefs and then turns it into 'hide and go seek' on whether she is really a nazi or not. We don't CARE if she is as evil as she lets on or just 'funning'... either way her actions support sickos who hate this country and crazy 'liberal' ideas like freedom, justice, and equality. Maybe Coulter ISN'T really in favor of blowing up day care centers... it does seem rather unlikely. But the fact is... she said she was. When Ann Coulter went on about the evil government "murdering" those "harmless American citizens" down in Waco who just wanted to enjoy their god given right to buy illegal weapons and rape little girls... it had consequences. That kind of ridiculous slant helped to create people like McVeigh - who actually believed the nonsense (hell, he was practically quoting her). So again, I don't CARE if she doesn't really mean it. There are people out there who DO... and she is helping them. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:13, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As of today, this article is as good as I've ever seen it. Quite frankly, I'm almost proud. But in the Wik-spirit of CANI, (Constant And Never-ending Improvement)I propose a couple additions -</p>
<p>1)I want to add something about Ann and Max Clelend. She caught a <b>tremendous</b> amount of flack for pointing out that Max Cleland wasn't actually injured <i>in combat</i> in Vietnam (as the democratic myth machine had intimated). However, it turns out that she was right and her critics wrong. That's noteworthy and relevant. Especially since, as is the case for Wik articles on any conservatives, there's usually a litany of allegations where the conservative was said to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>2) We have a lot in the Ann Coulter article about what Al Franken thinks about Ann Coulter. Yet I don't think we've returned the favor to Al! But, in lieu of that, I think we owe it to fairness, to share a little bit of Ann's take on Al. After all, it is <i>her</i> article, no? Big Daddy 08:31, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Speaking of Franken, I corrected what I considered a poorly written charge that he considers Coulter a hypocrite. Here's how it looks now:</p>
<p>"Franken claims that Coulter treats any comments found in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> as reflecting the official opinion of the newspaper. He says that Coulter's statement (in <i>Slander</i>, chapter 'The Joy of Arguing with Liberals: <i>You're stupid <b>)</b></i> <b>"If liberals were prevented from ever again calling Republicans dumb, they would be robbed of half their arguments" can be viewed as hypocritical, because in the same book she uses similar characterizations to critique others."</b></p>
<p>The previous version seemed meandering, rambling and disjointed. I think the same point that a liberal is calling a conservative a hypocrite ( I know, newsflash!:) is made much more succinctly with this edit. Any comments? Big Daddy 04:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes! The previous version was not meandering, rambling, nor disjointed. I'll be reverting it for just that reason. Also, you've been Referred for Arbitration, based on a month of vandalism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ann is shrill?</span></h2>
<p>She can be but I'm gonna take out the quote from the very first paragraph because it's misleading. First of all, the Ann-haters apparently can't get enough of this quote. It's used TWICE in this article. That's wrong to begin with. Secondly the only readers who are alleged to find her 'shrill etc' are those from that Arizona paper and we have only the words of it's editor to back this charge up. (Not that we couldn't find others who agree! :) In conclusion, if you want to include it, use it only once and in relation to her being unfairly censored by that Arizona paper. Big Daddy 19:16, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The editor said "many readers", not "many readers from Arizona". Changing this is a misquote. As he is not making an accusation against Ann, this is no allegation -- its a cited fact. --<a href="../../../1/5/5/User%7E155.91.19.73.html" title="User:155.91.19.73">155.91.19.73</a> 00:05, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sources make the intro look bad and this problem is why. He can add context without misquoting (quite the opposite!), and what you suggest he would do is not what he proposed.

<p>For the record I had an email conversation with this editor right after it happened. I was curious how he <i>knew</i> the letter writing complainers were republicans. He said he didn't know but only that they <i>said</i> they were. It stands to reason we don't know for sure where the letters emanated from either. So to infer that this Arizona editor was claiming they came from all over because he didn't specifically say they were from Arizona is faulty logic. It's a moot point anyway. The context was a local Arizona paper. It's not just a stretch to START her article with the implication that readers <i>around the world</i> wrote the Arizona Republic. It's flat out dishonest. NOTE: To those reasonable people who are wondering why I even have to make these obvious points in here...don't ask. lol! Big Daddy</p>
<dl>
<dd>hah. no one alleged readers around the world wrote the arizona republic, but it's a misquote to say the readers were *only* in arizona. i'd bet good frozen chicken that readers around the world DO think she is shrill (peeps in olympia, washintgon, ann arbor, and the greater eastern and southern hemispheres, in any case) but that would require some original research to prove and would be deleted immediately. so i guess all that makes sense is stickin with the quote --<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.112.11.220.html" title="User:71.112.11.220">71.112.11.220</a> 06:27, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A bunch of numbers wrote -"I'd bet good frozen chicken that readers around the world DO think she is shrill." Well, you'd probably be knee deep in frozen chickens then as that bet is a sure winner. Of course, I'd bet a year's full of weekend dinners at <i>The Tribute</i> that I could find readers saying all that and a lot worse about Al Franken etc. The question is, can you back it up? And a quote from the editor of the Arizona Daily Star, one of FORTY newspapers in Arizona and two in Tuscon, doesn't qualify as a back up. So my guess is that, in the absence of supporting evidence, the quote gets cut out. And even with back up evidence, it's appropriateness at the beginning of the article is suspect.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">more McVeigh fun and excitement</span></h2>
<p>since my dynamic IP address confuses Guertedda so much I will repeat what is needed to reach a concensus here (plus engage in some nauseating legalese): either someone provides a source that proves a critic said Coulter supported McVeigh or the claim must remain removed.</p>
<p>I really assume one can find a source saying just about anything these days, but must insist it is provided for this case. In fact I will move the disputed text here as encouraged by the official policy on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. Since you disagree with my neutral rewording of some of it, I will instead ask you to adhere to the requirements of verifiability for your preferred wording.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Critics have taken issue with comments by Coulter which they perceive as indicating support for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, President Richard Nixon, and Senator Joseph McCarthy. They also accuse Coulter of stating the following views: women should not be allowed to vote; women should not be allowed in the military; women understand how to spend money but not how to earn it; Muslims smell bad and should be killed or forcibly converted to Christianity [12]; juvenile delinquents should be publicly flogged; liberals should be threatened with death; terrorism is acceptable as long as it is directed against liberals; the way to prevent school shootings is to allow students to carry guns; environmentalism is against God's wish that we "rape" the Earth; fascism can be a good thing when properly applied; and many other similarly contentious views.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Demanding that those who disagree with an assertion prove the negative is not a reasonable approach (hipocrite). The policy on verifiability states it is to be moved here until made verifiable so that is what we will do. It can remain here and only here until someone provides sources worthy of an encyclopedia which state that:</p>
<p>1. critics claim Coulter supports McVeigh (I doubt anyone cares about Nixon and McCarthy is covered later in the article).</p>
<p>2. critics accuse Coulter of stating each of the listed views.</p>
<p>Or, a reference to an actual noteworthy critic making these accusations work as well, though then the statement must be properly attributed to the critic in the article.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, blogs are not acceptable as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Reliable sources</a>. Also, Wikiquote references to Coulter's words do not prove a critic said anything.</p>
<p>Please restrict any replacement of the disputed content until there is a form which all can agree, even if grudgingly, that accurately represents the content of sources provided. Please stop reverting anons who remove that statement just because they are anon. Many of them are me going back to the 22nd, where I might add, I made this same point in the discussion repeatedly asking for a source which remains unprovided. You aren't running some anon vandal away with such behavior, you are failing to assume good faith. I'm also eager to hear other suggested Neutral ways to reword these unsourced statements. 71.128.137.211 06:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC) p.s. Guettarda: none of those anons in the frozen chicken and AZ discussion are me.</p>

<dd>Either you are being dishonest in youe edit summaries or you don't understand what "neutral" means. Please read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <i>carefully</i>. You take the conetent out of the statement and leave something that is meaningless and almost nonsensical. "Critics have taken issue with statements by Coulter regarding: Oklahoma City bomber <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_McVeigh_0621.html" title="Timothy McVeigh">Timothy McVeigh</a>..." says nothing about <i>what</i> statements. People are upset because she had expressed support for a terrorist (seriously or jokingly, we have no way of determining; see CBDunkerson's comments above). Similarly, removing the fact that people have shown that a lot of her footnoting is spurious. To what end? You cite the fact that bogs are not reliable sources. That's utterly irrelevent in this case - the article says what bloggers have found, it doesn't say "X is the case" (and Y's blog is my source).</dd>
<dd>I am not reverting anons, I am reverting the removal of sources information from the article. You have not made your case <i>in the least</i> as to why referenced information should be removed.

<dd>We continue to descend further into the absurd. It isn't possible to include 'critics object to Ann Coulter saying women should not be allowed to vote' without a quotation to that effect from the mainstream media? Conservatives really can't wrap their minds around the possibility that someone might object to Coulter's view that just over 50% of the population should be denied voting rights? It's just too radical a concept for you to accept? You need proof?

<dd>Mainstream journalist. Calling Coulter and McVeigh comrades. Saying she is an apologist for him. Like the thousands of other people you are pretending don't exist. Because see, you don't need a 'reliable source' to prove that an OPINION exists. If I am just saying 'critics accuse Coulter of supporting Tim McVeigh' then the fact that I can point to lots and lots of people doing exactly that makes it an established fact - that opinion DOES exist. It doesn't require that someone employed by a massive right-wing news corporation actually share the same opinion... it can exist even without that. Reliable sources are required for 'facts' which cannot otherwise be confirmed. I don't need a 'reliable source' to confirm that the Sun is a yellowish color... I can direct anyone who doubts my claim to look out a window during the daytime. Ditto the 'unsourced' claim that some people object to Coulter's view that women should not be allowed to vote. Anyone with a functioning brain is going to take that as OBVIOUS. If they don't... a Google search will turn up thousands of examples proving it. This, 'I am taking it out and you are not allowed to put it back in until you quote Bob Novak saying it is so' game is just pathetic. --12.42.50.51 12:51, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all please do not revert my changes en masse over a few weasel words and phrases; I did a great deal of other work trying to improve the article's flow and accuracy (for example the removal of "falsehoods"). Secondly, indeed I took the content out Guettarda becuase that content is not verifiable by a reliable source. Blogs are not reliable sources. Sorry about the confusion, this is a new issue I am introducing with the recent discussion to include with the previous issues on the Criticism section. I am quoting official wikipedia policies and style guides here. To be specific:</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia:Reliable source</a>, a style-guide:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you can provide useful information to Wikipedia, please do so, but bear in mind that edits for which no credible references are provided may be deleted by any editor.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A personal website or blog may be used only as a primary source i.e. when we are writing about the subject or owner of the website. But even then we should proceed with great caution and should avoid relying on information from the website as a sole source. This is particularly true when the subject is controversial, or has no professional or academic standing.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Personal websites and blogs may never be used as secondary sources.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>That is, they may never be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The reason personal websites are not used as secondary sources — and as primary sources only with great caution and not as a sole source if the subject is controversial — is that they are usually created by unknown individuals who have no one checking their work. They may be uninformed, misled, pushing an agenda, sloppy, relying on rumor and suspicion, or insane; or they may be intelligent, careful people sharing their knowledge with the world. It is impossible to know which is the case. Visiting a stranger's personal website is often the online equivalent of reading an unattributed flyer on a lamp post, and should be treated accordingly.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>From <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a>, a non-negotiable official policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The goal of Wikipedia is to become a complete and reliable encyclopedia. Verifiability is the key to becoming a reliable resource, so editors should cite credible sources so that their edits can be easily verified by readers and other editors.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by a reputable publisher.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>For an encyclopedia, sources should be unimpeachable. An encyclopedia is not primary source material. Its authors do not conduct interviews or perform original research. Therefore, anything we include should have been published in the records, reportage, research, or studies of other reputable sources. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: outlandish claims beg strong sources.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Personal websites and blogs are not acceptable as sources, except on the rare occasion that a well-known person, or a known professional journalist or researcher in a relevant field, has set up such a website. Remember that it is easy for anybody to create a website and to claim to be an expert in a certain field, or to start an "expert group", "human rights group", church, or other type of association. Several million people have created their own blogs in the last few years. They are not regarded as acceptable sources for Wikipedia. See Wikipedia:Reliable sources for more information.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As I read it, the blogs, at best, were being used as <i>sole</i> <i>primary</i> sources to include the opinions of the authors, named as "critics". At worst, they are <i>secondary</i> sources which is even less acceptable.</p>
<p>Yes we do require reliable sources anon. This is an encyclopedia not a summary of internet gossip. Please refer to the policy and style pages if you think I am in error in my interpretation of them, again <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia:Reliable source</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a>.</p>
<p>As to "the issue at hand" Guettarda, I will repeat: no <i>reliable source</i> (blogs are out now) provided in the article states that critics accuse Coulter of #1 supporting Timothy McVeigh, or #2 holding the listed beliefs. There's probably a lot of room to agree in #2 of course, please let's discuss it here. Or we can agree to strengthen some or all members of #2 as just paraphrasing of Coulter's quotes, so please deal with those individually here in discussion or of course in the article if you must, but not by massive reverts.

<dd>excellent points except you should have waited until I was done editing before starting the insults. Your mass-revert caused this difficulty. 67.124.200.240 17:39, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact they were also weasel words before I touched them. "critics accuse Ann Coulter of ____" is weasel-worded sir. However I'll be glad to address that style problem in time, I can't get to it right this second. where is there a coherence problem? I'd be glad to fix that also. 67.124.200.240 18:10, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know who's responsible for this (I have some good guesses) but <i>every time</i> I pop in here, I discover this article gets <b>better and better.</b> More fair, less tawdry and more civil to Ann which, contrary to some people's sensibilities, is a good thing. A <i>very</i> good thing. Nice Job! Big Daddy 20:23, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just had a brilliant idea. Don't bother trying to claim critics or Coulter think or believe one thing or another and just paraphrase the controversial quotes. That really is the source of all this isn't it? Then just add context, with sources where disputed. How about the following for paragraph 2 in Criticism:</dd>

<dd>Ann Coulter has made a career of controversial arguments, many of which infuriate those on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Coulter's supporters often suggest that many of her comments are taken out of context, that Coulter is only joking, or that she is engaging in hyperbole, though Coulter herself has never stated that she doesn't hold these views when responding to the controversies about them, apparently enjoying the consternation they cause to her opponents. Supporters also argue that she uses satire to illustrate her points and for intentional, if controversial, comic effect. Some examples include Coulter's statements to the effect that: it would be a better country if women didn't vote (because Republicans would almost always win); Muslim countries should be invaded, their leaders killed, and their citizens converted to Christianity (referring to the countries with crowds cheering after <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a>); conservation is against God's wish that we "rape" the Earth; the solution to school shootings is for the other kids to have guns also; and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarians.html" title="Libertarians">Libertarians</a> don't appreciate the benefits of local <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> (<i>whats the point?? someone help here</i>). However, the editor of the <i>Arizona Daily Star</i>, in dropping her column from the publication, said that many readers from both political parties "find her shrill, bombastic and mean-spirited."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_shrill"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_Archive_7_e2d7.html#endnote_shrill" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_Archive_7_e2d7.html#endnote_shrill" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span></dd>

<dd>I removed those issues that are repeated elsewhere in the article or in the quote list at the end (McVeigh is covered in detail in the next para). I dropped Nixon because I don't see where that came from. Granted it is turning back into something of a quote list, but I'm trying to be neutral and non-weasely, and at least it's much shorter. In fact it serves to illustrate the back-and-forth regarding her style. I welcome suggestions. 67.124.200.240 03:37, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just an FYI, if you find Ann repugnant, feel free to be bold and say so! Its well within wiki policies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Morally_offensive_views" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Morally_offensive_views" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<dd>Morally offensive views</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd><i>We can certainly include long discussions that present our moral repugnance to such things; in doing so, we can maintain a healthy, consistent support for the neutral point of view by attributing the view to prominent representatives or to some group of people. Others will be able to make up their own minds and, being reasonable, surely come around to our view. Those who harbor racism, sexism, etc., will not be convinced to change their views based on a biased article, which only puts them on the defensive; on the other hand, if we make a concerted effort to apply our non-bias policy consistently, we might give those with morally repugnant beliefs insight that will change those views.</i></dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd><i>Please be clear on one thing: the Wikipedia neutrality policy certainly does not state, or imply, that we must "give equal validity" to minority views. It does state that we must not take a stand on them qua encyclopedia writers; but that does not stop us from describing the majority views as such; from fairly explaining the strong arguments against the pseudoscientific theory; from describing the strong moral repugnance that many people feel toward some morally repugnant views; and so forth.</i></dd>
