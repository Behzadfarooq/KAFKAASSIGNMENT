<p>I think the article is too long and bulky. I know that Vissi is the ultimate pop star in Greece but still, the article is overdetailed. It would be better if someone would clean it up and part the whole bulk of text into sections (one for career, one for life, and them further into 'years after karvellas', 'years after eurovision', 'present time' etc. See for example <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna (entertainer)</a>.

<p>People crazy over Anna Vissi, should perhaps remember that Nana Mouskouri is 1) Greek and 2) the world's number one selling female artist, at least according to Wikipedia. Madonna herself will have to try for some more years to reach her sales. Vissi, the Madonna of Greek pop, is NOT the biggest selling Greek female artist, although she may be that in Greece, or in her genre. Please, remember to qualify assertions. I do respect Vissi, but one is talking about great Greek female voices they should not forget two names: Maria Callas and Nana Mouskouri.</p>
<p>We are talking about inside of Greece, and currently. So please do not change this. Also if you are so sure of yourself, please email ifpi as I have. I have gotten the facts straight.</p>

<p>I'm adding a template stating this may not be totally neutral; read the article and see why.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but someone took it off. I'm putting it back now. Anna Vissi is HORRIBLY overrated, the whole article reads like a fan magazine's rant and as for her... international carreer, well, singing to the Greeks of the diaspora is NOT an international carreer. <a href="../../../e/l/p/User%7EElp_gr_edf7.html" title="User:Elp gr">Elp gr</a> 13:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Vissi needs to find/develop/invent her own style, if she wants to have a chance in international career. Immitating Madonna to the last detail creates only laughter, not fans.</b></p>

<dd>Reverting, this was removed by anonymous editor (24.189.105.140 - checking his/her contributions reveals somewhat of a theme...presumably one of the fan club...!) <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 07:53, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't know about the article but just because it's someones POV that Anna is overrated doesn't mean that she is. I agree that the article has to be toned down but as far as overrated that's just personal opinion and doesn't have to do either for or against the article. Also she does have an international career. I am aware that in the US people assume if someone isn't famous here they aren't "famous" but Anna is well knowned in many spanish speaking countries as well as Europe, especially in the 90's. Just my two cents&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailyn_f4b6.html" title="User:Mailyn">Mailyn</a> 01:19, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reverting again. The last revert notice was deleted by User:Omega100 , who added comment&#160;: "Anna Vissi Is the best thing to Happen to Greek Music. She started a revoloution in Greek Music. She has done what others could not. She is a Icon." Presumably another member of the fan club. No-one is disputing the significance of Anna Vissi, we're just after a NPOV article... <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 09:59, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>24.189.105.140 I think we need to try and work together to make this article better. right now the career part needs some major cleanup and by removing the cleanup notice you aren't helping. also removing her greek name doesn't accomplish anything. we are trying to make this a good article so people who don't know Anna can get to know her and right now this article is a big mess, not at all what Anna deserves! so please don't delete the revisions we've been doing since all you are accomplishing is to leave the article as messy as it is.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailyn_f4b6.html" title="User:Mailyn">Mailyn</a> 03:16, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've reverted the article once more, but will soon give up on this. Both the fan club users and the Vissi-haters seem hell-bent on continually ruining this entry. Good luck to those Wikipedians who are trying to make this article NPOV and useful. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 10:45, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey everyone. Anna Vissi was born in Cyprus, but moved to Greece when she was young. She made her career in Greece. She is considerd GREEK. Even in all the publications it says "The GREEK beauty". So whoever keeps on changing the article stop. Ive now put "Greek-Cypriot". ALSO I will try to get the pictures back up that were once there and made the article look great. I dont know who took them off.</p>

<p>I just reverted this article back a couple days because it was filled with uncorrected vandalism. Unfortunately, that involved removing some legitimate edits as well. If you are interested in this performer and are familiar with the <b>facts</b> about her, feel free to go over those edits and reinsert the good information. I'm afraid I don't know enough about her to do that myself. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 13:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Also since 1995 Anna Vissi has gone 24 times platinum. Add up the platinums. One more thing NYLON IS CURRENTLY platinum, but at 70,000 copies. 10,000 more copies to go til' it gets 2x platinum.</p>
<p>WHO IS SAYING TRAVMA SOLD 310,000 AND IS ONLY 3X PLAT, GO TO ANNA VISSI.INFO ITS SAYS 175,000!!!!!! AND KRAVGI IS 6x!!!!</p>

<p>You are not allowed to have rumors in the article. It does not live up to the wikipedia standard. If you put the rumors back in, I will contact the Wikipedia customer service.</p>
<p>It is not vandalism at all. There really were such rumours and they were pretty wide spread. You can not deny that there were no such rumours. There are many such rumours in Wikipedia about celebrities. Would you explain which standard it does violate? If it is written here it does not mean that we say that it has happened, merely we are putting the fact that there were such rumours and the existence of such rumours can not be denied. Therefore, what you are doing is vandalism as you are removing a text without backing it up and I will revert it back. Thank you. --24.42.120.3 22:12, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I contacted Wikipedia dispute center and they said that they consider it: <b>Attention-seeking vandalism</b> Adding insults, using offensive usernames, replacing articles with jokes etc. (see also Wikipedia:No personal attacks) Please do not put those rumors in again, or I will be forced to warn you.</p>
<p>Oh, please go ahead and do whatever you are forced to do. This has nothing to do with attention seeking vandalism. It was not me who has put that there in the first place. I am only reverting it because of a vandalism by you. Second, merely mentioning that a certain rumour existed is not insulting or offensive. Again I am stating my position: The article mentions a well spread rumour, rumour by its nature is far from being a fact. Just because an article mentions this rumour it does not mean that it conisders that it is fact, it merely acknowledges the existence of the said rumour.

Oh, please, show me the ruling. Just give me a link OK? Who gave the ruling? I guess you do not know that Wikipedia does not work like that. It is not a court that you get a ruling on a certain issue ant it is binding. This issue has not been even raised in dispute resolution. So, on top of vandalising this page you are lying too. If you remove this info once more I will have to request attention for vandalism. --24.42.120.3 02:23, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Umm...no. I emailed the dispute center, and asked them if it was considered vandalism.. They told me it is, becuase you are not alowed to post stuff, that hurts someone's reputation. And seeing as Wikipedia is an American based company, the constitution says (amendment) that you are not allowed to post something on a public database that hurts there reputation. You can get sued. If YOU put it back in there, I WILL request vandalism issue with Wikipedia.</p>

<p>For example: 'Paraxenes Eikones' and 'X' never sold 120,000 copies. 2 x Platinum, their official status, means 80,000 copies (Platinum = 40,000 copies in Greece), and they haven't been officially announced as selling 120,000 EVER. The same applies for 'Nylon' which stands at Platinum and no OFFICIAL announcement has been made regarding its sales, so why does somebody keep editing it as 2 P? Also 'Agapi Ypervoliki' stands at 80,000 sales. If it was 100,000 , it would have been officially announced as 5 P. Officially its status is 4 P.

Most of the information is farce, the first lines clearly say it all. Mild success in the USA, I take it then that if you go up to at least a handfull of non Greeks in the States, you have a chance of at least someone knowing her. Trust me, none of my friends in the USA have ever heard of Anna Vissi, unless Greek. Update&#160;: I notice that the author of the page, has now reverted and taken the phrase 'mild success' out, and replaced with success in the usa, thus meaning she has had many hits on the billboard charts, and I can assume be refered to as one of the greatest musicians in USA. Once again a complete farce, but if her fans need to believe and hear this falisified hype, then who am I to argue.</p>

<p>The nationality tag in this article should remain as 'Cypriot' for the following reasons: Vissi is a Cypriot; Vissi was born in Cyprus; Vissi has Cypriot citizenship; Vissi's origin on the infobox is correctly stated Larnaca, Cyprus; 'Greek Cypriot' refers to an ethnic group (which Vissi belongs to) in Cyprus (although should not be used because ethnicities are not emphasised in the introductory paragraph in accordance with Wikipedia's manual of style); thus 'Greek' need not be placed anywhere in the opening paragraph as it is not even in her infobox (if her origin were Greece then perhaps there would be a chance of using 'Greek', but since it (rightly) is not, then we must use her nationality at the time she became notable (Cypriot)).</p>
<p>The only way this case resembles Elena Paparizou's is that, like Paparizou should be just 'Greek', Vissi should be just 'Cypriot'.</p>

<dd>But you forget the fact that she moved to Greece over 30 years ago, owns a house there, got married there, raised her child there, and lives there. I know for a FACT that Vissi also hold Greek citezen ship from a person that is close to her. And also Greece does need to be placed in the opening as she is most notable in both Greece and Cyprus. In Greece her CD's go platinum in less than 24 hours. Her first 'official' CD was released in Greece, by a Greek record company. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreekboy_a57b.html" title="User:Greekboy">Greekboy</a> 14:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't forgotten this fact at all; and please note I said 'Greek' need not be in the infobox, not 'Greece' (there is a difference between the adjective and the country).</p>
<p>I think <i>you</i> are forgetting the facts <i>I</i> stated. <b>Since her origin, birth place, nationality (current and also at the time she became famous, which <i>is what Wikipedia's guidelines advocate as the nationality tag</i>), there is no reason to put 'Greek' as her nationality.</b> Despite the fact she lives in Greece and has done for many years bears no significance here, just as Elena Paparizou's inhabiting (and birth in) Sweden didn't. In fact, if you want to get right down to the nitty-gritty of it, the argument favouring the putting of 'Swedish' in Paparizou's biography makes more common sense than putting 'Greek' in Vissi's. The latter's infobox does not state her origin or birth place as Greece, therefore the citizenship (country) which holds the most significance to the beginning of her career is placed - she was born in Cyprus, she is a Cypriot national, she is of Cypriot descent, her origin (meaning career debut, as per the infobox) is in <b>Cyprus</b>. I'm sorry but placing an ethnicity in the biographical paragraph is totally unnecessary, especially when a perfectly comprehendible citizenship equivalent is supported and available.</p>

<dd>Anna moved to Greece at about 16 years old, and finished off her high school there too. She gained Greek citezenship around that time. About 4 years later she released her first "official" CD with the Greek label. Anna Vissi became most notable while in Greece, and with a Greek citezenship. There is no denying the fact that she held Greek citezenship at that time. According to my source that is close with her, she did infact hold Greek citezenship at the time, as she does now. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreekboy_a57b.html" title="User:Greekboy">Greekboy</a> 22:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again you are ignoring what I said. I don't doubt the fact Vissi has Greek citizenship (after thirty years in Greece, which is not considered by many a foreign country to Cyprus, what do you expect). Her origin lable states 'Cyprus', for which more can be said than Greece. Yes, I know that Vissi has a very successful career, but then again, what she gains in Greece, she gains in Cyprus too (and vice-versa). All of the most famous singers in Greece most definitely share that notability in Cyprus, too. But, her origins on the tabe are Cypriot, amen.</p>

<p>No, I'm not ignoring it; that's what I've been telling you since the debate started! And of course the Wikilaw covers origin too; the nationality tag should be that of the subject when s/he <b>became notable</b>, which happens to be the same rule for the origin box on the infoboxes. I'm sorry, but she is a <b>Cypriot</b>. There is no logic behind putting an ethnicity in the opening paragraph.</p>

<dd>This is straight from wikipedia. For the origin field in the box at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_musical_artist_a77d.html" title="Template:Infobox musical artist">Template:Infobox musical artist</a> it says <i>The city from which the singer or group originated (that is, the city where the group was founded; or the city where individual performers started their career, should it not match the location of their birth).</i> which would be Cyprus since she started singing in parks and a couple of competitions according to her interview with Greek Boston. However, this is NOT when she became notable. That is a big differance. She may have started singing in Cyprus, BUT she became notacable when she moved to Greece, and started started releasing CD's (while having a Greek citezenship). Now, according to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_010f.html#Opening_paragraph" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)#Opening paragraph</a>, <i>Nationality (In the normal case this will mean the country of which the person is a citizen or national, <b>or was a citizen when the person became notable</b>. Ethnicity should generally not be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability.)</i> Anna was a citizen of Greece when she became popular. However, the Cypriot part should also be noted since it is relevant to her notability. So it should be "Greek-Cypriot" following Wikipedia rules. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreekboy_a57b.html" title="User:Greekboy">Greekboy</a> 22:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All your points are fair; I know you mean well, however Vissi's origin box says Cyprus, which clearly states that she became notable whilst a citizen of the island. That is to day, all those things you said apply, in actual fact, for 'Cypriot' to be used, not 'Greek', εντάξει?</p>

<dd>Have you not read any of the wikipedia articles posted. It CLEARLY states that the nationality tag DOES NOT have to match the origin box. I think you got origin and nationality mixed up. The origin field in the side musical artist box is where the singer started singing (which would be Cyprus). The Nationality tag in the opening paragraph is for where the singer was a citizen when they became notable. Anna Vissi may have started singing in parks and a singing competition in Cyprus, but she became NOTABLE when she was living in Greece, and as a Greek citezen. The opening nationality tag should be "Greek-Cypriot". <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreekboy_a57b.html" title="User:Greekboy">Greekboy</a> 19:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that the origin section needs to actually be corrected. Although there is a valid point of her doing some singing in Cyprus, in accordance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_musical_artist" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_musical_artist" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> it says "<i>where individual performers started their career</i>" which seems to indicate Greece in accordance to the article and information out on the web. A Musical career is when the singer starts to do professional singing. The information stated seems to indicate that the singer in question started her musical career in Greece, thus the origin section should state Greece. Planecrazy22 20:09, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, at least this is now cleared up. Greekboy, what I was trying to say was that, since Vissi's origin box said Cyprus, that meant that she became <b>notable</b> in Cyprus, thus her nationality tag needing to read just 'Cypriot'. And, actually, although it doesn't say it in words, the origin box (<b>WHERE THE SUBJECT BECAME NOTABLE</b>) should be the same as nationality tag (<b>WHERE THE SUBJECT BECAME NOTABLE</b>). I don't know how many times I have to say that to you; I'm afraid it seems <i>you</i>, in fact, lack the understanding of the origin field, not I.</p>
<p>Anyway, now we have cleared up that her origin (notability) was in Greece, which therefore gives a need of 'Greek' to be mentioned in the opening paragraph, however, sorry to be pedantic, I would suggest that 'Greek-Cypriot' change to 'Cypriot-Greek', because, firstly, she was initially a national of Cyprus, and secondly, 'Greek-Cypriot' is very easily confused with 'Greek Cypriot', referring to the ethnic group. So, to make it more clear that the 'Greek' in the nationality tag is a noun, not an adjective, I propose 'Cypriot-Greek'.</p>
