<p>This article has a few statements that maintain Coulter takes criticism from conservatives, but there are no quotes or cites to back this up. A link to a Washington Times article is mislinked to the Smoking Gun link about "Al Pieda." If there are conservative critics, they need to be cited along with her numerous liberal critics.Rebochan 17:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's very interesting. You seem to be making a statement that we shouldn't include claims calling any particular organization "liberal" or "conservative" without backing it up. However, your labelling VVAF as "liberal" shows of what material your stance is made. Isn't labelling VVAF "liberal" a <i>matter of opinion</i> as well? Or is your opinion <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MPOV" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MPOV" rel="nofollow">worth more</a> than others'?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Back to the quotes</span></h2>
<p>Wherever they wind up (and I still say someone more experienced like Kate should be able to make a call as straightforward as that) I object to this opening sentence: "The following quotes are examples of Ann Coulter's flamboyant and often inflammatory polemical style, for which she is well-known."</p>
<p>I object because this ignores the fact that Ann's comments are MOST notable because they are Laugh your A$$ off funny! I'm adding a few more quotes to this section to demonstrate that she's a very clever &amp; funny writer in addtion to being a provacateur.Big Daddy 18:37, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, y'all know my opinion on this one, but there is no <i>strict</i> policy on this score and my inquiry on the Village Pump made it clear that there are varying views. So until a policy can be made for it (which may never happen), it'll have to go by consensus on individual articles. Since there's a consensus on the section as it stands currently, and especially because it was the result of long, hard negotiations, I'm inclined to leave it alone for now. I am thinking, though, of drafting a policy proposal in this arena soon. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 21:20, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, the <b>irony</b>! That sentence is in there at the demand of <b>Rex</b>, the most firebreathing, flesheating, hellacious conservative POV warrior of all time, with 3 arbcom judgements against no less. (Not to insult you big guy, but you're just not in Rex's league; he's a hall of famer.) I thought the sentence actually improved the article, one of Rex's few decent points. But, I'm glad to take the sentence out, if it will make BD happy. I'm not too worried about it at present, since I suspect we'll find this page much more congenial in a <s>couple weeks to a month</s> <i>holy shit, it only took 3 hours</i> .... However, I am heartened that you are willing to listen and defer to more neutral and experienced editors such as Katefan0. I trust you'll show the same deference when her opinion differs from your own? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">@</a> 21:38, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Coulter is an extremist hate monger, unworthy of any serious discussion. If you are conservative and actually read or listen to her idiotic temper tantrums you are an embarrassment to conservatives worldwide. Coulter is conservative hate rhetoric for white trash losers with IQs of approx 20.</p>

<p>Hello there fellas, I was searching for some comments about Coulter and her plagiarism and I didn't see any. So before I make any changes (which will be after I type up something significant) I just wanted to see if everyone either A. Heard of her plagiarizing or B. Would just erase what I wrote just because they disagree with it. I have heard this on the radio several times and here is an article about it after googling it. <a href="http://whyareweback.blogspot.com/2005/07/ann-coulter-writes-like-jeff-gannon.html" class="external free" title="http://whyareweback.blogspot.com/2005/07/ann-coulter-writes-like-jeff-gannon.html" rel="nofollow">http://whyareweback.blogspot.com/2005/07/ann-coulter-writes-like-jeff-gannon.html</a> Please take a look.

<p>Thanks for the insult. Since my work on another case of right wing plagiarism was "reliable" enough for two Congressmen to cite it in a letter to the GAO <a href="http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/304829.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/304829.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/304829.htm</a> I would think it's good enough for Wikipedia but if you prefer you can link to the article I worked on for Raw Story about it (though my blog entry is more comprehensive) <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2005/coulter_caught_cribbing_column_720.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2005/coulter_caught_cribbing_column_720.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawstory.com/news/2005/coulter_caught_cribbing_column_720.htm</a> I back my work up with links so it certainly should be "reliable."

<p>To reply about the plagiarism: The source may not seem credible, but I know what I have heard, of course there will be that one person that says, "Don't believe everything you hear." but I know this is true. Like I said before, I will do my research first and I suppose submit it here first so other can review it before I make a wiki edit. I know she has plagiarized because she has done it more than once and she gets her sources from very old books hoping no one will realize where she got it from. Obviously you can tell I have a huge distaste for this woman. That link I provided above I agree is not too credible, it is just so you can get a feel for what I am talking about. Does anyone have any sources they do trust that they would want me to use? I would appreciate it. I will not get to this right away I am a busy college student. I will do this in my spare time.

<p>There were several additions to this section that resulted in a revert war which which only ended when one side was bullied off the page (in a mess that got sucked into an arbitration before being brushed aside from it for being meritless). Now that that is over let's not forget that the section is still not in a concensus state. In particluar, the following problematic statement started it all:</p>
<p>Crinkley old bitch 138.88.176.73 19:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Coulter "expressed what some consider to be support for" terrorists.</i></p>
<p>There is no source provided that uses the word "support". The closest thing is "apologist" which is already present in the article anyway. Of course the same source also says she "joked" when she said it, so paraphrasing him all the way to "support" is a stretch. Someone needs to either find a better source, or else I think the fairest resolution is a direct quote of the source provided.</p>
<p>Also, the allegations of racism/anti-feminist views sections contains no actual allegations of aynything by anyone, except possibly Coulter herself, making the titles not only inflammatory but misleading. <a href="../../../6/7/1/User%7E67124etc.html" title="User:67124etc">67124etc</a> 05:02, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Setting aside the 'spin' on recent events... There are people in the world who don't like Ann Coulter. Indeed, there are rather alot of them. This is an inescapable fact... and unquestionably a large part of why she is noteworthy at all. Somehow that fact and the reasons behind it WILL be included in this article. And that's the problem I have with this page. If the reasons people criticize Coulter are paraphrased that text is removed with claims that her intent is being distorted. If exact quotations are used they are removed on the grounds that there are too many quotations. If partial quotations are worked into the text with explanations of what might be considered wrong with them we get nonsense about how it is 'original research' to claim that someone might be offended by Ann Coulter saying women are not as bright as men (which silliness I see you have repeated above) - rather than it falling under the category of 'common knowledge' / 'complete obvious'. Any way it is presented some yahoo comes along and yanks it out on the flimsiest of pretexts.</dd>

<dd>I'm not referring to quotes of Coulter's, but of critics. Attributing the criticism to some unknown ephemeral weasel makes it difficult to defend against. Consider the following counter-agrument which is equally verifiable to the argument itself: <i>Critics say Coulter supports terrorists, but critics actually don't say that because they agree Coulter is joking.</i> or how about this counter <i>Plus supporters argue that those critics are hypocrites.</i> Would you prefer that "paraphrasing" of Cloud? Or how about we put our personal opinions in as counter arguments in the form of "common knowledge"? What makes your opinion so special that it gets to avoid the rules? Multiple people right here have disputed its veracity, therefore it isn't <i>common knowledge</i>. Simple as that. If its so completely obvious it should be easy to find someone stating it, name them so they can be examined. And let's not forget the hack and slash pruning job that Elee and others recently did to this article removing any pro-coulter statement that wasn't sourced, quoted, and officially notorized. This subject isn't being treated fairly. <a href="../../../6/7/1/User%7E67124etc.html" title="User:67124etc">67124etc</a> 19:41, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For a start, the phrase "expressed what some consider to be support for them" needs to go unless a source can be provided. We have both critics and supporters quoted as saying she was joking when she uttered CDBunkerson's favorite quote, so if you are going to include a argument that disagrees with those sources it needs to be named as well. Then readers can judge the veracity and political bias of that critic for themselves. Alternatively, the waco/ruby ridge stuff and the McVeigh stuff can be separated (as has been tried in the past before being reverted), and people can claim she supported the former all they want. If you just want to reword it into some different weasel-words, phrases like "made controversial statements regarding them" are grossly overused but at least neutral. <a href="../../../6/7/1/User%7E67124etc.html" title="User:67124etc">67124etc</a> 05:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Well, someone managed to skip a weasel term here, but earned a reputation from who? Wiki is lacking in guidelines for articles like this. There is AGF -- but everyone seems to be acting either to promote one view or another or, worst of all, promote wikiquote.

<dd>That you would even pretend that sentence about, "Her conservative commentary has earned her...", is controversial shows the impossible standards which are being applied to this page. Heck, I had assumed that was written by one of her FANS. Isn't that what you LIKE about her? Coulter describes HERSELF as conservative. She proudly proclaims her strong criticism of liberals. Yet you treat this as 'NPOV'? The nonsense about how, 'you have to quote someone saying that some people dislike what she said about women being less bright than men so we can put in five paragraphs about how stupid that person is and why they should be ignored', is equally absurd. NOBODY can tell me that it is controversial to say that Coulter's statement that 'women are not as bright as men' makes people angry. If you REALLY believe that's a shocker then I invite you to go up to your wife, girlfried, mother, sister, or any other woman and tell them that women shouldn't be allowed to vote because they aren't as bright as men. Think they'll be angry? Please, go ahead... you can verify for yourself. It's like refusing to accept "The Sun is bright" in an article unless you can quote an astro-physicist saying so... and then have 'Dim Sun' proponents post a bunch of stuff about how the astro-physicist is really evil and knew the bright Sun comment was a joke all along. Ditto the whole, 'it does not count if she was joking' defense. Yeah... so long as she thought it was FUNNY it's all good, right? If you believe that then I invite you to go to an NAACP meeting and start telling 'coon jokes. Hey, so long as it's a joke what could be wrong about it, right? So Ann said that she wanted a terrorist to murder a bunch of people at the New York Times building... she was ONLY funnin'! Tee hee. And that one about returning all the blacks to slavery? Oh man, what a side splitter!</dd>

<dd>67124etc, so are you trying to say that Ann Coulter's comments regarding women's suffrage and slavery are not self-evidently controversial? Because there's quite a lot of evidence that they are, Ann Coulter even refers to her own statements as such: <i>"I am a polemicist. I am perfectly frank about that. I like to stir up the pot. I don't pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do."</i> Also there is clearly quite a lot of consensus on that issue. The only people pushing your POV was BigDaddy, and now you alone.

<p>The male bump, or Adam's Apple...Not something you'd see on a woman's neck - 3DogSound</p>
<p>DEFINITION: Definition of Adam's apple</p>
<p>Adam's apple: A familiar anatomic feature in the front of the neck that is due to the forward protrusion of the thyroid cartilage, the largest and most prominent cartilage of the larynx.</p>
<p>The thyroid cartilage tends to enlarge at adolescence, particularly in males. Enlargement of the Adam's apple is considered, like pubic hair growth, one of the secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>Origin of the term: It is usually said that Adam's apple takes its name from the biblical story about Adam, Eve. the serpent and the apple. A piece of the forbidden fruit stuck in Adam's throat and created the anatomic Adam's apple. So the story goes. However, it may be wrong.</p>
<p>Adam's apple in Latin is "pomum Adami." This may have been a mistranslation of the Hebrew "tappuach ha adam" which also means male bump. Between Latin and English there's many a slip.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tangential: tapuach adamah in Hebrew really means "apple of the earth" (as in soil, ground, etc.) and means potato (as in pomme de terre). Which brings up the relationship between the name given to the first man, and the word for earth; as in being made from the dust of the earth. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 04:28, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alternate term: The medical term (which is rarely used) for the Adam's apple is "prominentia laryngea" (prominence of the larynx) <a href="http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2137" class="external free" title="http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2137" rel="nofollow">http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2137</a></p>
<p>I find this discussion very, very inappropriate. We do not go around speculating on the actual sex of any person, in any form. Speculating on the sexual practices of any person, especially when it is motivated as political retribution, is repugnant and highly unethical. People make these accusations against people from time to time, and giving it any credence by claiming "parisans" make this attack is a often used trick. "Some accuse Fred Schlep of devouring unsuspecting children. The claim the proof of a photo of a discarded child's shoe next to a soiled napkin, left in his front yard."

<dd>I agree from a personal perspective that this particular situation is base. But just because something is rumor doesn't automatically disqualify it from being notable enough for inclusion... I take no position personally, but it is a question that should be answered. Some speculation gets so widely discussed in the public street that not mentioning it would be tantamount to censorship (i.e. rumors that Richard Simmons is gay -- pretty widely circulated). The question is -- does this meet the same threshold? Is it well enough known that people would find it curious if some discussion of the issue weren't present? · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 23:24, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just some thoughts. As a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a>, even though it hurts my wittle feewings how she talks about us, I'm still a huge Ann Coulter fan. Even got her to autograph some books one evening. &#160;:-) I think the "discussion" of the transgender derision is appropriate for this page. There shouldn't be <i>any</i> topic we can't discuss....Regarding putting a mention of it in her actual article, it's obviously intended as an insult and has no factual basis. When would it be appropriate to include something like that in someone's article? Only if it became so talked about that the fact that "something so ridiculous was being talked about all over" was in itself news. An example, might be the urban legend that was popular at one point about Richard Gere and gerbils. But I don't see that mentioned on his wiki page. I also totally disagree that this transgender insult has taken on some prominence in public discourse. What mainstream media is mentioning it? - <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 02:09, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Folks, when a woman says ""It would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact."", transgendering becomes a perfectly legitimate topic. Slander it is not.</p>
<p>It seems legitimate to me. People DO speculate that she may be a transsexual, and because this speculation exists (and not in small numbers, either), it's legitimate. Add to it the fact that she DOES have a pronounced Adam's apple, a husky voice, and is an obvious misogynist, it brings the question into the realm of possibility.</p>

<dd>People speculate on lots of things. However, uninformed speculation for the purpose of insult isn't encyclopedic or noteworthy. And she doesn't have a comparatively pronounced Adam's Apple. By Wikipedia's own definition, the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam%27s_Apple_8e35.html" title="Adam's Apple">Adam's Apple</a> is the laryngeal prominence, which is not particularly pronounced on Coulter. She has a fairly pronounced thyroid cartilage, but no more so than say <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torri_Higginson_e334.html" title="Torri Higginson">Torri Higginson</a>. Many very skinny girls do. Some people who don't know what they're talking about think that's the Adam's Apple, but they're simply mistaken. Instead of letting them turn that into an offensive insult in somebody's page, we educate them. As for her allegedly-misogynist statements; do her statements against blondes indicate that she hates herself, too? I rather doubt she'd be willing to get a sex-change operation but unwilling to take the giant leap of not bleaching her hair anymore. They're jokes. She's a polemicist. You might be offended by the jokes, and she means you to be offended; but they don't necessarily indicate anything about her personality other than a feeling that offending people is a good way to make them think. There is no actual evidence that she's transgendered; just a combination of uninformed speculation and anger. Present Ann's writings and let them speak for themselves as to her character. If people want to draw from them the conclusion that she's (insert speculation here), then let them. Now, if you have eyewitness testimony or photocopies of plastic surgeon bills from a reputable source, that would be Wikiworthy. -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 14:22, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maher has joked about their sexual relationship in public. He may have later denied it, but that doesn't mean we rewrite history. "We're just friends, but I make jokes about us having sex that are unfounded." See, its just not that funny...</dd>

<p>If Condi's page makes mention of her romantic relationships or lack thereof, then you have to include it for other figures in the political world. Its silly to suggest that such information is only relevant if the person is a hollwood star. By that rationale, we couldn't mention Laura Bush!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been blocked for a while, but I disagree. Let me try to break it down. Marriages are often of note on Wikipedia. Hence, we will mention the spouses of our articles' subjects. "Boyfriends" (just mentioning the term takes me back to middle school, though I understand it isn't limited to that age level) are much more trivial in many more cases. Exception: Hollywood stars, where lots of teenagers care about breakups, fights, and scandal. Not every boyfriend/girlfriend of every person needs to be mentioned on Wikipedia. I'm open to further discussion; just trying to be clearer on my stance. - <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElAmericano_1aa7.html" title="User:ElAmericano">ElAmericano</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElAmericano_bc88.html" title="User talk:ElAmericano">talk</a> 04:51, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good god. Leave it out. No one anywhere in the world goes to the tabloids in the checkout line hoping to find out who Ann Coulter has dredged up now. It's simply not on the radar at all. Don't even try to force some nonsense standard like "well, the article on celebrity x does it so this one has to, too!" <i>Puh-leeze</i>. Sometimes it's appropriate, sometimes it's not. For instance, it would be appropriate to list boyfriends in the article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a>, because the only reason anyone anywhere cares about Paris Hilton is to find out who she's sleeping with this week. That's not an interest people have when they research Ann Coulter. They want to know what she has said and what makes her say it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why's there no paragraph on her new book?</span></h2>
<p>Thought I might ask why there's no paragraph on her newest book, How to Talk to a Liberal. Anyone mind me writing one in, or someone else? Is there a reason it's not mentioned?</p>
<p>And how long is it going to take for people to understand the difference between controversy and criticism? There's a HUGE (I think too long) section on the Paula Jones <i>controversy</i>, and then a section called <i>criticism</i>. THEN, under that section, there's a billion other sections titled "controversy"! How does that happen? Can someone perhaps explain to me (since I've been missing for a while) if there's been a consensus on this or something?</p>
<p>And why is there even a huge section about Al Franken's book? I realize he's criticising her in the book, but it's not just about Coulter, it's about many "Lying Liars" and I doubt every one of their pages has a huge section about Franken's book on it. I don't mind a mention, but it is HIS book, shouldn't the majority of it stay on HIS page?</p>
<p>Oh, and I plan on making a slight edit to the books section. Books are written about in the present tense, not past, i.e., "the book made a case" becomes "the book makes a case."

<dd>Cho is not just "any public figure." She is an award winning comedienne, and the book in question which contains the chapter on Coulter is a best-seller. This isn't just idle chatter, it is published content in a #1 selling book. Furthermore, Cho is hardly a "standard kind of comic." Besides the fact that her first live-stage-film, <i><a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_the_One_That_I_Want_a850.html" title="I'm the One That I Want">I'm the One That I Want</a></i>, is currently the highest grossing film of all time (in relation to the number of screens it was shown on,) Cho has also become a highly respected/loathed (depending on which group of people you ask) political activist and commentator.

<dd>You've convinced me. A section on Franken's squabble with Coulter is out-of-place, too. This isn't an important feud like, say, the dispute between Newton and Leibniz. Franken is simply one of many commentators that criticize Coulter. A few words about his criticism might be in order, but not a section in an article on Coulter.</dd>

<p>If you search the internet for "Ann Coulter", you'll come across a huge number of articles/opinions etc about her being a man, a transsexual etc etc. I think the volume of public debate on this issue makes it relevant. It's one of the main talking points associated with her. It's also componded by the fact that she has a very prominent adam's apple. It would be like writing an article on Michael Jackson and not even mentioning the word pedophilia. If this was a view held by a small number of people, I would ignore it and delete it from her wiki, but it seems to be one of the top five things people say about her.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, it's hard for anyone to discuss her without personal bias creeping in. Coulter enrages many people with her political rhetoric. Enraging people is how she makes a living. Enraged people have a tendency to say unkind things, and continuous repetition of things can make them seem more true (the echo-chamber effect). I agree with Phiwum and Pacian that it's not appropriate to repeat slander on wikipedia. It reminds me of Republican partisans who - I'm not kidding - went around saying John Kerry looked "French". The truth is, there is no one "right" way for a woman to look womanly, or a man to look manly, or whatever. And it's certainly way too damn subjective to be NPOV. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 00:47, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">critique/study/allegation</span></h2>
<p>I disagree with the claim that "Slander" is a <i>study</i> of alleged liberal misconduct. That sounds like an academic examination of the allegations. Similarly, critique doesn't work for me, since one doesn't critique "alleged misconduct". One critiques what has actually been done, but of course whether the conduct she discusses really occurred is what is at issue.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems to me that the easiest description is this: Coulter claims that liberals have behaved badly. That's the point of the book and thus the book is neither a critique nor a study but a lengthy (perhaps tedious) allegation.</p>

<dd>I have one thing to say about Coulter, she references everything. Much better than wikipedians do. She refers to periodicals and makes references throughout her books, that one can check at the library. I put in study, in the sense of Merriam-Webster definition: "a literary or artistic production intended as a preliminary outline, an experimental interpretation, or an exploratory analysis of specific features or characteristics". She is an analyst, and a commentator. A study does not have to be academic, or meet an unstated standard of literary merit. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 16:47, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ann Coulter is a guerilla right wing terrorist (to use her people own language).</p>
<p>By focusing on her sucess in the american media through the sales of her various publications, Wikipedia is underminding who she is as a person.</p>
<p>She has endorced terrorist attacks, within the United States ("My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building. ")</p>
<p>I could go on, if need be. But I hope that this will be corrected.</p>

<p>"Ann Hart Coulter (born December 8, 1961) is an American syndicated columnist, bestselling author, and television pundit. Her commentary has earned her a reputation as a strong critic of social and political liberalism, to the point of endorcing terroist activities agianst her political opponents. Her speaking and writing style is provocative, aggressive, and in most cases offensive, with heavy use of sarcasm, and hyperbole. Through her carrer in the media she has been very vocal in her stance of American Imperailism, cultural hegemony, and coersive international relations."</p>

Apparently that doesn't take into account the other contriubtions of her well-rounded character, which are still waiting to be posted here.

<p>I think that it is necessary to include the fact that she has been caught lying to support her position. If she had done so while speaking it might be dismissed as due to her “shoot from the hip style” but I think it is very revealing in print. It shows a disconnect from reality when a person makes the facts fit their argument. You may simply dismiss these lies that she was caught in since they were pointed out by a liberal Al Franken. However, things that are stated as a matter of fact can often be proven true or false. In this case it was proven that they were lies that she invented to support her position. I think that the revisions in her paper back version are an admission of guilt on her part. This reveals that she is not always an honest person. -- <a href="../../../m/_/s/User%7EM_stone_b823.html" title="User:M stone">M stone</a> 13:36, 11 February 11, 2006</p>

<dd>Finally, during a May 1997 episode of Politically Incorrect she responded to the question, "You're talking about [repealing] the Emancipation Proclamation?", with "That would be a good start."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I assume it is <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">User:CBDunkerson</a>. I only know of a source from a Washington D.C. magazine website, which quotes her answer, not the question. I did a google search and that mostly consisted of the quote listed in blogs with a series of other Coulter quotes, some taken out of context. I don't think this meets the verifiability threshhold found at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</p>
<p>The Washington D.C. magazine website, which also deliberately distorts the context in some of her quotes, suggests the question she was asked was, "How far back would you go? You're talking about about the Emancipation Proclamation?", but because of a lack of context, we don't know whether the question should be interpreted as "How far back in time would you go?" or "How far back in <i>laws</i> would you go?"</p>
<p>As I stated here earlier, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_M._McPherson_8097.html" title="James M. McPherson">James M. McPherson</a>'s <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> winning account of the Civil War era, <i>The Battle Cry of Freedom,</i> says that the Civil War era was an era of legislative activism (floating the currency, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead_Act_6655.html" title="Homestead Act">Homestead Act</a>, spending on federal transportation projects) and thus a very good <i>time</i> for an proponent of governmental restraint to go back to, because before that time, that principle of restraint was mostly observed. Coulter is a constitutional law expert, and it's quite reasonable to assume that she would be familiar with the periods of history when U.S. governmental authority was extended to such a degree. McPherson went on to say something like "what Congress did in this era formed the pattern for our modern system of government."</p>
<p>Suspiciously, there is no context to the quote that would help us decide what she meant, such as what was being discussed beforehand or the reaction of her hearers to what she said and Coulter's response to that. But we do know in February 2000 she wrote "Does anyone [support slavery] apart from a few demonstrably insane losers?" <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter020100.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter020100.asp" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 03:03, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh, CB, there is no source given for the interpolation of the bracketed word "[repealing]" in the phrase "You're talking about [repealing] the Emancipation Proclamation."

<dd>Finally, during a discussion about rolling back laws on a <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> episode of <i>Politically Incorrect</i>, she responded to the question, "You're talking about the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emancipation_Proclamation_d12b.html" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>?", with "That would be a good start."</dd>

<dd>Setting aside for a moment the reliability of the report of this transaction, you now seem to be <i>implying</i> a context that reported remarks can't provide.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The remarks are placed under the heading of "Controversial statements about minorities," when, again, that is the issue in dispute, due to a lack of context: Whether they are "controversial statements about minorities" or not. If she only intended to say the Civil War era was a good <i>time</i> to start repealing laws, then it was merely a statement about laws in general.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly you mention the particular discussion was about "rolling back laws". What you fail to mention is that it was also about various points to begin rolling back all laws, not certain ones in particular, so even someone with a familiarity with the history of constitutional law would not understand that she had been refering to eras that introduced laws that a liberal would tend to praise. Need I add you also fail to mention that the reported conversation also appears to have begun with an air of levity?</dd>

<dd>Again, I am not citing a secondary source (Washington D.C. online or otherwise). I am citing the primary source... 'Politically Incorrect'. That should have been absolutely clear from my prior response. The '[repealing]' added to the text (to provide context without quoting the full transcript) was my wording... as is the longer context phrase I have now replaced it with. I think the context is obvious and find the claim that there is a dispute about whether the statement was controversial or not completely illogical in the face of the hundreds of citations of it as such which can be found on Google. You speculate on what her 'intent' was ('maybe she meant rolling back all the laws to that time... <i>except</i> the one cited') and imply that the 'levity' of the exchange is relevant... both issues were discussed at length months ago and similar defenses are already included in the article as general justifications for her more provocative statements. If you want to reverse the earlier decision to state the boilerplate defenses once for all instances and instead return to repeating them after each that's your call. Given the radically different world-views people subscribe to, it is certainly possible to interpret what she said in very different ways. That's why it is listed as 'controversial' rather than 'proof that Ann Coulter is a bigot'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 02:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quote is actually a misquote. What Coulter actually said was "I think we had enough laws about the turn-of-the-century. We don't need any more." Asked how far back would she go to repeal laws, she replied, "Well, before the New Deal would be a good start." Someone in the background is speaking simultaneously and says "the Emancipation Proclamation" at the same time. It was a joke. Someone answered facetiously for Coulter. --64.81.228.202 16:44, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where is the source that says that Coulter was "booed off the stage" at a University of Connecticut event? I read a contrary report at Free Republic that says she ended the speech she had prepared early, but that she continued on stage with a question and answer session.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Controversial statements about minorities" section</span></h2>
<p>The "Controversial statements about minorities" section definitely needs some cleaning up. Basically, someone lumped her statements about Arabs in foreign countries, Arabs here, and blacks together under the category of "minorities." Certainly, we can't call Arabs in the Middle East a minority. This needs to be separated out into two sections. - <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElAmericano_1aa7.html" title="User:ElAmericano">ElAmericano</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElAmericano_bc88.html" title="User talk:ElAmericano">talk</a> 23:04, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

The paragraph on Canadians in Vietnam seems muddled, unfocused and hard to interpret.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">quote creep</span></h2>
<p>we now have two different sections essentially devoted to quotes. (a) quotations (b) criticisms, with the 4 controversial statements sections. this article has been criticized _numerous_ times for piling on by listing every outrageous quote. it's really not necessary to document every time the woman has upset someone by being over the top. while i have previously argued <i>strenuously</i> for the inclusion of quotations, we really ought to use either just (a) or (b). my strong preference is for (a), as the quotes need no additional commentary beyond that some view them as outlandish. they are examples of her style, and why she is a polarizing figure. this is an encylopedia article, not a documentary, so this is just excessive detail for a main bio. perhaps a sub-article on controversies surrounding her comments would be useful, but this is too much, in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 20:42, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note that unlike some other pundits, Ann has no career in politics behind her, no law or medical practise, as far as I know no personal scandals. She has no real <i>actions</i> to speak of, outside of her writings. When it comes to Ann Coulter, there's really only one thing worth talking about: what she has said. I think it's appropriate to include a good deal of quotes, since talking and writing are what she does for a living. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 05:36, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with your last sentence, and I have been a very strong proponent of that view. However, there reaches a point where it's no longer helpful to include it every time she says something outrageous ... which she does every week it seems. This has been a subject of continuing debate on this article for over a year and a half now. Every time a compromise is reached, editors new to this article and unaware of the previous interminable debates start adding more quotations. That's not a criticism; but it does illustrate the seemingly irresistable pressure in this article to "pile on", as some of our more conservative-leaning editors have complained.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest the usual procedure in such cases of producing a sub-article Ann Coulter controversies dedicated (obviously) to lengthier discussion of the various controversies surrounding her, including discussion of the circumstances surrounding these quotations. For the main article, we need two things: (a) a short list of quotations illustrating her style (as already present) (b) a brief discussion under criticisms that she is viewed by some as outrageous &amp; why, with a link to the controversies article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This would serve the dual purposes of keeping the main article cogent &amp; npov, and providing an outlet for more detailed criticisms. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 18:11, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, I don't think including them in the text will solve the problem. There will still be pressure to include more, whether or not they are inlined.

But, I'll just state my position once for the record: I do think that's a case where less is more. Do we really have anything both neutral and valuable to add?

<dd>Bill Maher joked about it repeatedly on his show in her presence and her response was to smile -- sheepishly in my opinion. Maybe Coulter just thought it was a cute joke, or maybe it was the truth. I guess I can't be the one to judge that but my experience is that most women do not like repeated jokes being made about non-existend sexual relations. There are few "reputable" sources that report on <i>anyone's</i> sex lives, let alone the sex lives of political pundits. Ann Coulter sleeping with Maher just wouldn't sell many mags in the check out line. If I did manage to dig something up it would be dismissed as a non-encyclopedic tabloid or somesuch. I've found an odd tendency at wikipedia to keep out interesting, documented material that gets beneath the veneer of a political or entertainment personality. There are few articles where muckrakers go unscorned. 21:45, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you can't source it beyond a joke, why should we include it? Unless there's some truth to it, an off-hand joke has no notability at all.

"Perhaps the easiest way to make your writing more encyclopedic, is to write about _what people believe_, rather than _what is so_."<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010416035757/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/NeutralPointOfView" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010416035757/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/NeutralPointOfView" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> So, only a widespread &amp; notable belief of this need be documented for that <i>belief</i> to be acknowledged in the article, along with any evidence (or lack thereof) supporting the belief. I don't think you have much to worry about though, because I don't see any evidence that this is believed by more than a "tiny minority", which does not meet the notability requirement stated in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 19:39, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You and I read Wales's advice differently. He is saying that, if X cannot be confirmed, then X should not be alleged. However, the fact that people believe X may be alleged. But that doesn't mean that <i>everything</i> people believe should be included in Wikipedia. Some, perhaps many, people believe that Coulter is "genetically" a man, but thankfully this article doesn't discuss such nonsense. Any more. Beliefs regarding Coulter's sex life are similarly non-notable, no matter how widespread. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 08:20, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're probably in a minority equating information about Coulter's boyfriends to information that she is genetically a man. Articles commonly have information about folks' personal lives, rather than just an endless stream of quotes... <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 17:47, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Of course, not "everything" people believe should be reported; who said that? <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">Straw man</a>. I said that J needed to establish a widespread and <i>notable</i> belief. That's what policy requires. Obviously, a liason with Maher <i>could</i> be of interest, even from a purely from a professional standpoint. I haven't looked, but I'd be surprised if the fact that Rush's girlfriend is a CNN anchor isn't included in both articles, as it surely should be. Is it notable that Mary Matalin is involved with James Carville, hell yes, even if they didn't get married. So, whether or not it's actually true, if it is an important part of the public's perceptions of this woman it most certainly should be included. I just don't think it is. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 18:20, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is the issue that only a small number believe it, or that some editors just don't want to see it? It sounds like most people make objections like "we shouldn't include stuff about boyfriends" not that she's never had one. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 03:47, 2 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can't speak for anyone else, but that's not my objection. I think a liason with Maher would be suitable (though exceptionally disturbing and downright icky), especially since they are in related businesses and have interacted professionally. We have a list of well-known people John Kerry has dated, who have nothing at all to do with politics; I can't see why this would be less suitable. But, you haven't proved a liason; and you haven't proved that the belief is widespread (or of any notability) either. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 04:59, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">controversies and criticisms</span></h2>
<p>the previous section "quote creep" has gotten sidetracked. i would like to start a sub-article to handle the <i>detail</i> of the various criticisms, conflicts, and controversies swirling around coulter. usually, these revolve around something she has said. this would <b>not</b> replace a basic discussion and summary in this article, but would supplement it. the idea is that there is pressure to add a detailed account everytime she is outrageous, as she often is. this is excessive for a basic biography, and tends to lend a hint of POV to the article. one useful strategy to avoid "censorship", while keeping main articles concise, is to add sub-articles. successful examples of this approach include bill clinton, bill frist, al gore, george bush, john kerry, and so on. does anyone object to this? does anyone support this? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 19:14, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the anti-Coulter comments and bashing are quotations from other people and not wikipedia editors, then they deserve their fair share of our time (NPOV). However, the point of this is to move the controversy to a seperate article so that this one can focus on Coulter herself. That would give this article more space for non-bashing things. What's not to like about that? -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:52, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive me, I'm butting in without having read <i>everything</i>. But I think <i>overlisting</i> negative things <i>can</i> create a POV. A few quotes should be used, but there should by no means be an exhaustive list. Fair treatment doesn't mean listing everything; and crying "censorship" does have limits. Sub-articles are often nausiatingly over-focused and undesirable, and there are beginning to be too many already as far as I'm concerned. Their creation shouldn't be based on being a place to house things like criticism. If there's too much criticism, some of it probably needs to be axed. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 02:49, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Umm, do I have to explain this? There are no "positive" quotes because they can't be found. I've already challenged Ruby to do this and she has not replied. It is not biased to fail to report nice things a person has said <i>if they've never said anything nice</i>, it's just reporting the facts. Demanding "balance" in that case would mean removing all the negative things as well, since nothing can be found to balance them. That's taking NPOV to an extreme of interfering with reporting the facts. Anyone disagree with me? Then take me up on my challenge and find something positive, nice, or constructive Ann Coulter has said. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 22:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, I will. I think some of the things already there are positive things. I find Coulter one of our times most amusing and entertaining personalities. I only wish I could have seen her on the Daily Show, as Jon Stewart is another of my favorites. Coulter engages in hyperbole and rhetoric to fire up her base... much like some liberal speakers. She speaks her mind and likes to piss off the Left. It's rather funny. I find just about all of it positive. But that's just my opinion. And the day she goes on the Colbert Report is the day I don't leave my house in fear of missing it.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 22:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a note. In cases regarding categories, the preferrable thing to do in controversial situations is "do no harm". The categories are meant to help people find material, not label material. We don't know if the woman's serious about many things she says anyway, as she's often sarcastic/cryptic (and this may be an understatement). As such, it could be adding POV to put her in such a category. She's primarily an <i>entertainer</i>. She uses such statements primarily for their <i>effect</i>, not for their primary meaning (though that doesn't excuse them). Yea, she says racist things, but people aren't going to go to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Category%7EPersecution_7432.html" title="Category:Persecution">Category:Persecution</a> to look for her. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 17:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know, given her wild accusations against others about their lack of patriotism ... seems to me it IS news if she does something that constitutes voter fraud! The Democrats are the party that is frequently accused of voter fraud (can't say I'm an expert on whether those accusations have merit), and here you have a woman who has done as much damage as she possibly could to Democratic politicians (remember the title of her book on Bill Clinton, anyone?). Why on earth should she be let off the hook? If she cheats, she's fair game, folks. And as for guarding her privacy, I can understand how someone who has repeatedly advocated murder of political enemies (and then claimed to be kidding) might be afraid of reprisals, but frankly I'd have more respect for her if she lived with her notoriety more forthrightly. But I agree with you that she has made mistakes.</dd>

<p>I cannot fathom why this is not in the main article. I've heard it discussed in the mainstream media, and was reported by a reputable source...the local paper. I perceive the concensus here as adding it to the main article and only a minority trying to remove it. Given her position in "High Crimes..." that a crime is a crime, black/white, I think this is appropriate for the article. The only contrary argument given here is that it is a non-issue. Anything can be characterized as a non-issue. If it is a non-issue, why is it being reported in the local publications. User: Agrippina Minor</p>

It is being reported in the local media. She has made a career out of taking a hard-line stance on criminal conduct. She was a staunch advocate for the impeachment of the President fo the United States for lying under oath (what she is accused of here). The fact that this is being buried in the talk page when the majority of people here want it on the main page is ridiculous. This site is a place where people come to reference historical information in concert with current events. This issue is an excellent example. Your stifling of this information is contrary to everything this site stands for. This is reputable, mainstream information that you are suppressing against the consensus. When you look at the edit history numerous individuals have attempted to link the Palm Beach Post article to this site, and it is systematically removed by a single person citing the discussion page.</p>
<p>Nothing said in the article as protected can be shown to be untrue or based on POV. It simply states that there are allegations and that if true, she "could" be found guilty of a felony. User: Agrippina Minor</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's being reported in the local media, not the national media, because it's a non-story. Yes, she's being accused of something that is technically a felony. And every time a Wikipedia editor puts an unauthorized image in an article, he's doing something that's technically a felony as well; but we don't add it to their user page as "may be charged with a felony" unless they get indicted. "Being investigated" means no more than "somebody called and complained". This is a non-story unless she's indicted. Until then, it's of no more interest than the similar allegations against Michael Moore, which are relegated to no more than a one-line footnote in his article. If you follow the edit history, you'll notice that this is being removed by more than just me; you just happened to decide to start an edit war instead of seeking consensus for a change. You'll perhaps note that the information is not currently in the article, and that I did not remove it. Finally, you talk about "majority". You clearly have not read Wikipedia policies; this isn't a Democracy, it's not "majority rule". This is a commons. Things are done by consensus. A majority is not necessarily a consensus. Consensus exists when a solution is reached that nobody objects to strenuously enough to continue debate. When one side has absolutely no interest in seeking consensus, things dissolve into edit wars. The current consensus is that if Coulter is indicted, this information will merit inclusion. Everybody agrees that in that case it would be worthy of inclusion. The disagreement is on whether it's worthy before that happens. My side is participating in the debate; why are you opposed to doing so? -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 13:01, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's your basis for saying that "every time a Wikipedia editor puts an unauthorized image in an article, he's doing something that's technically a felony as well...."? It might be a violation of the rights of the copyright owner, but not every act that violates someone's legal rights is a felony (or even a lesser crime). I don't think this is hugely relevant to the question of including the point in this article, because part of the argument for inclusion is that Coulter has made herself a prominent public spokesperson on related subjects, which wouldn't be the case in your analogy. Nevertheless, I'm curious because I think your statement is probably inaccurate. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 19:20, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me preface this by saying that I am not a lawyer. It's my belief that since Wikipedia contains more than 10 such things, it constitutes a federal felony. However, it may be that a individual would have to do it ten times and that Wikipedia wouldn't be considered commercial, in which case I'd be completely wrong about it being a felony. I'd love pointers to anything that would help me understand this aspect of copyright law better. -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 19:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Violations of intellectual property laws are not criminal offenses.

<dd>Since 1990, 10 or more instances of commercial violation are a felony punishable with jail time.

<dd>I am an attorney who practices criminal law in California. I graduated lawschool with a concentration in Intellectual Property (thought I'd be a copyright attorney until I realized how boring it is). I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Infringement of a copyright is a civil matter. I have never heard of a "commercial violation" or even a "commercial infringement." If a court in a civil proceeding orders that an individual no longer infringe a copyright and the individual continues to do so, they can get jailtime for contempt of court...but even this is not a criminal offense. I'm completely unfamiliar with what you are referring to. For a real-life example, the owner of NAPSTER was never threatened with jailtime, merely losing his company.

<dd>That law would not apply to Wikipedia. That law deals with theft of intellectual property for the purpose of profit. Wikipedia (and it's users) generally, are not posting information for the purpose of financial gain. Additionally and regardless, under the rubric of intellectual property, there is a common defense to infringement known as the "fair use doctrine" which consists of a complicated, multi-prong balancing test (conceived of my Justice O'Connor) which allows for uses precisely like those on this site.

<p>It is being reported in the local media as well as the national media, I heard it on CBS yesterday. She is being accused of something more than a simply a felony. There are two important distinctions. This is the woman who said "high crimes and misdemeanors" included simple misdemeanors, and beat the war drum for the impeachment of a President of the United States for lying. She's allegedly lied here. Secondly, she was relentless in her criticism of the locals in Palm Beach County for not knowing how to fill out a butterfly ballot. Now her only defense to these allegations is that she made a mistake voting in Palm Beach County. There have been articles and editorials written in the Palm Beach Post citing this history. I have not mentioned posting them because I think they carry a certain point of view that some might find objectionable. As far as what I've posted, I don't see how it is objectionable. One witness, a former candidate for mayor, said he saw Coulter running out of the polling place when questioned by workers. I haven't included that. When I look at the edit history I see you, Syberghost, not only removing my edits, but other individuals who have attempted to post or link the article in the Palm Beach Post related to this incident. Please refer me to where you seem to see someone else engaging in the conduct. I did not seek an edit war, it appeared to me that the consensus was for including the link, and you were the only person against it. There was never expressed consensus that this information should only be included if she is indicted, it is important regardless of whether she is charged with a crime. Cynthia McKinney hasn't been indicted, and I'm sure there's a lengthy account on her page. This is not a dictatorship. You will notice that my entry is not titled "Coulter To Be Charged With a Felony." It is simply titled "Allegations of Voter Fraud" not "Coulter Commits Voter Fraud." I haven't posted anything that isn't true, and that anyone here on the discussion page hasn't already conceded is true. There is absolutely no POV included. User: Agrippina Minor</p>

<dd>before you came along, people started discussing it, instead of putting the edit in there. That's why you don't see it reverted; nobody was so rude as to put it in there without discussion until you came along. The fact that something is true does not make it suitable for inclusion, especially without consensus. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV Policy</a> specifically mentions <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">Sensationalism</a> as being an example of bias. The official policy on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a> includes "# News reports. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> for examples." Whether or not Ann Coulter is one of the millions of people who have on occasion voted in the wrong precinct is not of historical significance. If she is indicted, that would be. What you're attempting to add here (without discussion and despite lack of consensus) is appropriate for Wikinews, but inappropriate here. -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 15:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is your opinion. I guess you choose to ignore the opinions of some of the others above. There were others who tried to edit the page after discussion on this page, and you unilaterally removed their edits. The fact that Coulter went to two separate pricincts before she voted in the wrong location, after making a career of criticizing others for voting errors is highly relevant because it's hypocritical. This information is appripriate here. As I said before, look at Cynthia McKinney's page...she hasn't been indicted yet, and that's not only on Wikinews. I sense a double standard. Agrippina Minor</p>

<dd>For there to be a double standard, I've have to be editing McKinney's page too. I'm not. I am not in any way responsible for other people's errors. However, McKinney is accused of assaulting a police officer, a very serious crime, and police have asked that she be charged. That would seem to pass the "historical significance" test, and fail the "Sensationalism" test. The extent of Coulter's "investigation" has been an editorial against her in a newspaper followed by an elections official sending her a letter asking for clarification. They do this every election with lots of people; none of them get indicted, and nobody in the elections commission has yet asked that she be indicted. To say "Ann Coulter may be charged with a felony" here is just about as accurate and newsworthy as saying "Agrippina Minor and Syberghost may be charged with felonies". Fails the historical significance test, passes the sensationalism test. As for ignoring people's opinions; how exactly is it that you come to the conclusion that disagreement means ignoring? The "others" who edited the page are all you, working without a login, so they don't really count as "others". Don't bother trying to deny it, you signed one of the talk page posts you did from the IP.

<dd>My personal opinion is that considering the nature of the crime and the fact that nobody has announced any intentions of charging anybody with anything, this does not belong here at present. It might belong on Wikinews; I don't contribute there so I don't know much about their policies. If somebody from the Florida Election Commission announces an intent to file charges, this becomes of historical interest and should be included in the page; but every random diatribe against a political figure doesn't belong in their page.

<dd>I would be willing to leave the F word out. This is a significant piece of news about Ms. Coulter and deserves to have at least some reference on this page, given her line of work. It is more than a random diatribe, it is a pending investigation. This is perhaps the ONLY recent news about her. I'm willing to leave "felony" out, because it is the least relevant part. I tried to minimize that on the original post by not putting it in the title and stating that they are only allegations. We can take that part out. as far as I'm concerned I think that's an appropriate compromise. Agrippina Minor 19:38, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "rag head" comment was undebatably racist. It is a term specifically used for Arabs. I'll add a source that justifies the use of the word 'racist' in this context.

<dd>Well, I think there is an implicit problem with automatically deeming anything "racist". My guess is that she says things to raise ire and spark reaction. I think there needs to be some driving force behind a comment to really make it "racist". It may well be controversial or offensive, and still not be racist. It is like Chris Rock using the word "nigger". Just using the word itself may not be racist. I think Coulter is just using these words to get a reaction. She knows people will take offence and react and get her more publicity. It would be another thing if she truly felt this way. It is her job to piss people off. That's how she makes her living. She won't get much press if she writes something like, "People from the Middle East are bad" than she would if she writes, "Those towel-heads spend their time covering up their women, while they turn around and fuck their camels." Now the second thing here would be racist, if that's what she truly believes, but how do we know she just isn't using these words to get a reaction? That's why I am more than happy to call them "controversial statements" and let the reader decide for themselves if they qualify as "racist". We don't need to be drawing reader's conclusions for them. But like Rhobite said below, you are more than welcome to find Coulter critics saying she is racist and write something like, "Because of these remarks, some critics have deemed Coulter a racist. <a href="http://link" class="external autonumber" title="http://link" rel="nofollow">[17]</a><a href="http://link" class="external autonumber" title="http://link" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="http://link" class="external autonumber" title="http://link" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>" Oh well, like I said, this is just my opinion. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 00:50, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's unlikely someone would make a career out of saying these things if one didn't believe the essence of what those comments say.

<dd>Who is labeling her a racist? My edits don't include the adjective 'racist' to describe Ann Coulter herself. She has made racist comments, tons of them. Those individual comments are racist. And yes, your opinion matters less than the average person out there. When a Wikipedia editor injects his own opinion in the form of an entry, that's original research. I don't need to tell you about that, do I? In your case you're using your own opinion of Ann Coulter to censor verifiable information. BTW. dismissing her comments as 'sarcasm and hyperbole' is POV. That line should be removed. There is plenty of evidence to support the claim she has some strong hate issues when it comes to Arabs and Muslims, amongst others.

<dd>It's very simple. There are a large number of people who find her comments to be racist. Those critics include both those who allign themselves with the 'right' and the 'left'. The fact that people hold that view must be represented here. My edit to the entry doesn't have the entry itself stating she's in fact racist. They point to the fact that OTHER people do see her as such. To simplify the point further for you, nowhere in my edit does it say or directly imply 'Ann Coulter is a racist". Since the information added merely intends to point the reader to how many others view and recieve Coulter's commentary, the addition of such information isn't POV. It's simply factual. To CENSOR that information because in YOUR mind you've determined she doesn't really mean it all, THAT is POV. The difference between all that and the 'sarcasm and hyperbole' phrase is that an editor on Wikipedia made the judgement that her speeches were sarcastic. The entry itself is stating that her comments are sarcastic. If the comment read "her comments are seen by so-and-so to be sarcastic.." (ie if they pointed to other sources where others found her comments to be sarcastic) that would be acceptable. This entry is effectively an endorsement of Ann Coulter and an attempt to advertise her in the best light possible. On the 3RR crap, my last several edits were in response to criticisms (albeit disingenous) to what I posted. My last edit was meant to add sources other than the blog previously cited. I'm reverting back to the last edit I made, since you cannot make present a credible justification for excluding it. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 04:00, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Amibedhrohi. If the "racist" claim is cited is is superior to the uncited "sarcasm and hyperbole". Furthermore, it doesn't require any analysis to conclude she is making racist statements. Chris Rock use of the n-word, as ridiculous as it sounds, is not, because of not least his ethnicity, <i>racist</i> by American tradition. Coulter has no such defense for her use of "raghead", "old arab", etc. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 06:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed. As I've said, I feel LV is being disingenuous. He's pretending to be more clueless than he actually is. I didn't bother responding to that Chris Rock analogy because the answer was so obvious. As a rule in urban street talk, black people can say "the N word" while white people cannot. Chris Rock exploits that weird rule and turns it into humor. Surely you can see the difference it would make if instead on some occasion, on stage, Trent Lott or Bill O'Reilly referred to black people as "niggers". <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 07:35, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think it's best to just call her remark controversial. Those who find such remarks racist will draw that conclusion anyway, making it redundant to put it in the article. Some people are arguing that it is "obvious" to any "reasonable" person that her "raghead" comments are racist, so calling it such is NPOV, not POV. However, if that's really so, then all "reasonable" people would conclude that they're "racist" just from the quoted comment, making it unnecessary to deploy that adjective. And calling them "racist" won't convince the "unreasonable" people, who will just join in a revert war. This article gives a full hearing to Coulter's critics already, I think it's anti-Coulter as it is. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWacoKid_d7ce.html" title="User:WacoKid">WacoKid</a> 06:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And let right-wing devotees like you run the show? I'm not pushing an agenda. There's a whole host of people who find her commentary racist.

<dd>The fact is that there are people who consider Ann Coulter's remarks racist. That is what the edit states, nothing more. It doesn't state that she is in fact a racist, since that would be editorializing. The only bit of information that is certain is that there ARE people who find her comments racist. Alot of people. That fact is supported by 7 sources. How is this disputable? If it's disputable, I'd like to hear the content of that dispute. I'd like to hear the arguements against adding this information.

There is not consensus on making that change, and it is inappropriate of you to continue making it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">...Some things need adjusted in this article...</span></h2>
<p>I read the article on Anne...good job at the beginning--but at the end, the paragraphs got to be a bit POVish...</p>
<p>I'll now suggest some edits be made and they are as follows:</p>
<p>1. "[The book] Slander claims that many American journalists have ties to the Democratic Party and are extremely liberal, which biases their reporting. Coulter argues that George W. Bush has faced a difficult and unfair battle for positive coverage in the media from the moment he decided to run for president, and that a similar battle for fair coverage has been waged by practically every Republican presidential candidate since Calvin Coolidge."</p>
<p>The problem with this paragraph is that it needs to go with the article about the book "Slander"--NOT with the article about the author! It's talking about what the book says so therefore, that paragraph needs to go where it belongs.</p>
<p>2. "David Daley, who wrote the interview piece for the Hartford Courant recounted what followed (need to add "and you can find the interview piece at (link)."</p>
<p>There is no need to paste the article at all--just link to it and let the folks read it from there.</p>
<p>And for coherancy, cut out the paragraph that starts with "According to the Coulter Watch website."</p>
<p>3. Cut out everything else afterwards. Trivia section needs to be provided with its proper links or removed (in other words, it needs to kind of have the format of the "Quotations" section. Making the statement--then providing the link.) Leave the Quotations section and edit the reference section accordingly.</p>
<p>There is no need to continuously bring up what the critics have to say. If the reader wishes to examine what the critics have to say further, then he or she will do so via an encyclopedia or internet resources.</p>
<p>4. The book reviews section can go. You already have a critical section on her--we need to be fair and balanced here. A little time for those who approve of her and a little time for those who disprove.</p>
<p>5. And finally, for the "Interviews" section, rename it "Randomly Selected Interviews" or something to that affect. If you're going to have a section named "Interviews", you must list every single interview she has ever done.</p>
<p>Everything should at least be fair and balanced now...</p>
<p>--JJ</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I'll bite...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First off, what makes you think that quotes from a pundit's writings are not relevant to the article on the pundit herself? The entire reason why Ann Coulter is noteworthy enough to merit a Wikipedia article is due to her statements, opinions, and writings. Wikipedia has a duty to show why she is worth having an article about. By your standards, everything she has said in a book should be confined to the articles on those books. This is nonsense; quotes from her books serve an important purpose in helping this article explain - neutrally and fairly, since we use her own words - who Ann Coulter is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, whether an interview is worth merely linking to, or quoting from and linking to, is an editorial decision that needs to be made on a case-by-case basis. I can't believe you would suggest that Wikipedia cease quoting from all articles it links. You definitely couldn't mean that, so my question is, what criteria <b>are</b> you using for deciding that interview isn't appropriate to quote from - and why have you not stated your criteria as justification?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>then he or she will do so via an encyclopedia or internet resources.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely hilarious. <b>This IS an encyclopedia, AND an internet resource</b>. And if you're one of those who thinks Wikipedia isn't a "real" encyclopedia, then by all means, quit wasting both our time here, and don't let the door hit you in the backside as you leave. Still here? Good. So since you agree Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, I guess we'll let them look up the critics right here, won't we? &#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You're also mistaken in your remark about "a little time" for each side. The reason quotes from critics vastly outweigh quotes from supporters is that <i>critics of Ann Coulter vastly outnumber supporters</i>. It's as childishly simple as that. Let me put this simply: It is not a violation of NPOV to report the truth. It <b>is</b> a violation of NPOV to deliberately misrepresent the balance of public opinion to create a false appearance of balance where in reality there is none. If your theory were correct, then the article on the Holocaust should have exactly the same amount of links to holocaust-denial websites as it does to holocaust-information websites. Want to go there and try making that change, and see how fast an admin blocks you? Didn't think so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you're going to have a section named "Interviews", you must list every single interview she has ever done.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More patent nonsense. Nowhere on Wikipedia has there ever been such a rule, and no admin would be insane enough to enforce it. Readers of Wikipedia are bright enough to know that "Interviews" means "Selected Interviews", because of course this encyclopedia didn't write <b>itself</b>, did it? <i>Someone</i> had to have selected them. And please, don't be insulting. No one here selects interviews at "random", so that label makes no sense at all. If you're so desperate to underestimate our readers' intelligence, then fine, call the section "Selected Interviews", but it'll probably be reverted within a month for stylistic reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, keep in mind that an article on a polarizing subject like Coulter - a person who deliberately attempts to create as much controversy as humanly possible - is going to automatically generate NPOV issues, and that therefore it's best to remember to assume good faith of your fellow editors.

<p>It's not non-sense--any encyclopedian knows that if you pay special attention to going more in-depth about the contents from a book, then create an article about the book and insert that in-depth look about the book WITH the article about the book. If you are THAT desperate for people to see what her book is about, you can even INCLUDE A LINK to the book (with a phrase that goes "For more information, see 'Slander' " or something to that effect.)</p>

<p>Hopefully, you read my "edited version" of the Anne Coulter article before changing it back to what it was. Neutral and balanced was all it was. All I did was make it look more professional...leaving out the extras and keeping the necessary stuff that gave the article its professional air.</p>
<p>"This IS an encyclopedia, AND an internet resource.

<p>I never said Wikipedia isn't a "real" encyclopedia...just because critics exist, doesn't mean that you have to make them the majority of the consistency of the article--it makes the article lose its professionalism. A professional-looking article talks a little bit about the critics and then, the people who applaud the idea brought out by...whoever. It's professionalism at its finest that gives a Wikipedia article its flavor and glow.</p>
<p>"You're also mistaken in your remark about "a little time" for each side.

If your theory were correct, then the article on the Holocaust should have exactly the same amount of links to holocaust-denial websites as it does to holocaust-information websites."</p>
<p>First off, it's the focus that you put on a person (be it negative or positive) that decides how you write about a person--if you were writing about your greatest enemy, you'd hardly say anything good about them. Right? Of course...and if you keep focused only on the negative or only on the positive about someone, then usually you start wearing "rose-colored" glasses. There's a BIG line between telling the Truth and painting the truth the way you want it to look.</p>
<p>...And putting a negative tint in an article on someone isn't going to help matters any either--and you can't justify negativity by putting a label of "truth" on it.</p>
<p>Lastly, who says that it's popular opinion that everyone hates Anne? Where's your proof? (And just because there are a lot of negative things about her doesn't mean that everyone dislikes her.) Do you have an independant site that can give me poll numbers on this? Or something to that affect? If not, then please...don't go around telling folks that the majority of people dislike her--if you can't prove it.</p>
<p>"Readers of Wikipedia are bright enough to know that "Interviews" means "Selected Interviews", because of course this encyclopedia didn't write itself, did it? Someone had to have selected them.

If you're so desperate to underestimate our readers' intelligence, then fine, call the section "Selected Interviews", but it'll probably be reverted within a month for stylistic reasons."</p>
<p>You misunderstood what I said, friend...By "Randomly Selected Interviews", I meant that the writer picked out certain kinds of interviews on Anne (and as far as I know, those interviews are posted there to cast a negative light on Anne.)</p>
<p>"In any case, keep in mind that an article on a polarizing subject like Coulter - a person who deliberately attempts to create as much controversy as humanly possible - is going to automatically generate NPOV issues, and that therefore it's best to remember to assume good faith of your fellow editors."</p>
<p>"A person who deliberately attempts to create as much controversy as humanly possible"? Really? You know, I hardly know her at all--all I knew is that liberals and democrats didn't like her. However, she shouldn't be causing this kind of hysteria among liberals.</p>
<p>Al Franken doesn't make me go into hysterics--even though I don't care for what he says.</p>
<p>"Assume good faith of your fellow editors"?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I've mentioned several edits be made to several editors of various articles--having good faith that they would at least consider what I have to say. Know what happened? They didn't even consider what I had to say! They made excuses for their style of writing and totally ignored me!</p>
<p>...And this has been a pattern for a while now, and frankly, I'm losing faith in my "fellow editors"--they aren't listening to what I have to say and they leave stuff in the articles that don't even need to exist! Of course, if your definition of having faith in my fellow editors means to not question what they have to say and just sit back dumb and mute and let them put anything and everything in their article (in the name of "truth"), then no way will I have faith in them to run me over like that!</p>

<p>I know as a general rule one isn't supposed to edit another person's talk page comment, but I really don't think your response, as well written as it is, deserves to be categorized as an entirely separate section. Someone here noted the irony of the entry on a polemicist being polemic. If you hold a handful of feces to a mirror, what will you see in the reflection? Ann Coulter's made a career of bashing and insulting. That's what she does. The names of her book are "Treason" and "Slander". If she wrote a book or two that had more 'positive' messages or tones, we could've referred to them. The entry can only mirror what she actually is and how she is actually viewed. If there's something positive about her that's noteworthy (and noted) that you know of, by all means include that too. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 02:26, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>...I'm not going to address rabbit trails.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think the Holocaust deniers ought to be mentioned in this or any other encyclopedia at all. Maybe as an obscure article that states that they deny the Holocaust but nothing more.</p>
<p>They are entitled to their opinion however and if they wish to provide "evidence" for the holocaust never happening, then they can do it on their user page and not as a part of an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>However, folks can claim that this is hindering free speech and that Wikipedia is prejudiced--so the admins will let them provide links for their "evidence." And well, that's the way things are...</p>

<p>This is directed towards the person who claimed the image replacement was "unflattering". I personally disagree, but is it really the place of wikipedia editors to try to only use photos of celebs looking their best? Isn't that kind of like pandering?</p>
<p>Not that I'm saying the other one should be restored. But isn't it just a matter of personal opinion as to which photo she looks better in? I think our goal should be to find a photo that shows the subject as they most commonly are, not their "best" or "worst" day. This is rather difficult to expect, though, since we don't have time to examine that many photos. I'm only bringing this up to mention that the can of worms you're opening is highly subjective, and arguments could go on endlessly about whether she looks "better" in one photo or another. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 05:45, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think if the entry for a person has a top image, that image should be one that is generally agreed to be representative of the person's appearance and, within that restriction, the most flattering image available of a PG-or-better nature. If discussing a specific event related to that person, unflattering images that are representative of the event would absolutely be appropriate. I'd say a valid exception to this would be if there is a particular image that is most associated with that person in the public consciousness, but care should be taken to make sure that this doesn't go to far down the road of turning an NPOV encyclopedic entry into a parody. In other words, we don't have to dig around and find somebody's glamour shot, but there's certainly no POV taken in merely looking for an image in which they look their best doing what they normally do. In this case, Ann spends a lot of time on TV. An image of her on TV smiling is appropriately neutral. Also, there is the principle of discussing major changes and seeking consensus before making them. Humans are visual creatures, and changing the top image on an entry is therefore a pretty major change, and should be done as a matter of consensus. -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 14:22, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to JJ by Kasreyn</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><i>...if you pay special attention to going more in-depth about the contents from a book, then create an article about the book and insert that in-depth look about the book WITH the article about the book.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>But that's the thing, the point of <i>this</i> article is, "Who is this Ann Coulter lady and why do so many people find her noteworthy?" That is our readers' question. To answer it, we must provide examples of her writing. To be fair to her, this sample should come from all aspects of her career, which means columns, interviews, and books. It's not about going in-depth into the books. It's about going in-depth into Ann Coulter, the subject of <i>this</i> article.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>All I did was make it look more professional...leaving out the extras and keeping the necessary stuff that gave the article its professional air.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>So to you, removing the entire criticisms section is removing "extras"? To me, it's partisan bias. Coulter's importance is almost solely based, as I have said before, on her outrageous (or, if you prefer, bold) comments which are notorious for having offended many. If Wikipedia fails to report on this, then the entire article becomes a sham.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A professional-looking article talks a little bit about the critics and then, the people who applaud the idea brought out by...whoever.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I've already dealt with this point. The reason why the article hosts so many more criticisms of Coulter than praises is because <i>that is the ratio of beliefs regarding her among the public.</i> The public debate on Ann Coulter is heavily weighted towards criticism of her comments. Again, for Wikipedia to fail to report on this facet of Coulter (her widespread opprobrium), we would again be failing to report on the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>and you can't justify negativity by putting a label of "truth" on it.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not calling <i>what people have said about Coulter</i> the "truth". That's just reporting on sources, the proper task of an encyclopedia. <i>I'm calling the fact that far, far more people criticize her than praise her</i>, the truth. It's self-evident by the simple fact that far, far more sources of criticism exist than sources of praise. Unless you'd like to go begging the bias question.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>By "Randomly Selected Interviews", I meant that the writer picked out certain kinds of interviews on Anne (and as far as I know, those interviews are posted there to cast a negative light on Anne.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Then they certainly weren't random, were they?!! If they were selected maliciously, then call a spade a spade. Call the section "Maliciously Selected Interviews" or "Slanderously Selected Interviews", and I'll revert you, and we'll be done with it. <b>OR, go with the NPOV approach, and call it "Selected Interviews", since to do anything else fails to assume good faith</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>However, she shouldn't be causing this kind of hysteria among liberals.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Ann Coulter has repeatedly claimed that she believes liberals to be the evil scum of the earth, that their sole goal in life is to destroy everything good in the world, and that liberals deserve to be universally put to death. I am not fucking kidding you, read her books if you don't believe me. That is her message. If you don't call that "polarizing", you really shouldn't be editing an encyclopedia for grown-ups.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Al Franken doesn't make me go into hysterics</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, Al's just trying to make you go into hysterics of <i>laughter</i>, you see. &#160;;) Maybe you just don't find him funny. Hell, I sometimes find his jokes to be duds as well. But the difference here is clear: Al makes it clear <i>as he says something</i> that he intends it as a joke, so you play along in the joke with him, and have a laugh at its absurdity together. Coulter, on the other hand, merely says something hateful, and then later hides behind the "just kidding" excuse, such as when she publically called for the assassination of Supreme Court Justice <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_Stevens_2c94.html" title="John Paul Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>. So you tell me - does saying "I'm kidding" really put you in the same league with a <i><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Franken_2e2d.html" title="Al Franken">professional comedian</a></i>? Who would have known it was that easy to be funny!!</p>
<p>In general, if you haven't read much of a pundit's writings, I really suggest you shouldn't be editing the articles about them on Wikipedia. Go read some of Coulter's writings, then come back here. At the very least, it might give you ideas on better ways to improve the article.</p>

<p>"Coulter is very fond of wearing short skirts."</p>
<p>POV; "short" definition varies from person to person, and all-around unecessary. The remainder of the line in the article should stay about being satirized for vanity, but not this.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>Someone is continually reverting this. I've noticed a lot of those who are against Coulter want to make some point about this in order to make her seem immoral to Christian conservatives. I think this does not belong here. It IS POV.</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Bleh, whatever. I really don't care one way or the other; I once rewrote the section to try to make it more NPOV.

<dd>Personally, I find it ironic that people dislike Coulter for her regressive statements in support of patriarchy, but then attack her for wearing sexually liberated clothing. When exposing hypocrites, it's best to avoid becoming one. &#160;:P</dd>

<p>I am a bit puzzled by how a lot of people are insisting on saying that Coulter belonged to a "woman's fraternity" instead of a "sorority" or "woman's sorority."</p>
<p>According to the wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorority.html" title="Sorority">sorority</a>, "Fraternities are all-male or mixed-sex; the female-only equivalent is called a sorority, a word coined for Gamma Phi Beta in 1874."<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGiles22_f139.html" title="User:Giles22">Giles22</a> 22:08, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

So if we leave this saying "sorority", we've got a link saying it's a fraternity and then, a couple of words later, an assertion that it's a sorority. The only fair thing to do, in my mind, is call it what they call themselves; a "women's fraternity".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One more point on "allegedly racist"</span></h2>
<p>I should note that it may seem fine and NPOV to say that it's merely an <i>allegation</i> of racism (which is as far as we can go, since (thank god) we don't live inside Coulter's head), but this isn't good enough. We have to provide some sort of corroboration that there has been an allegation against her of racism, such as a line saying "Coulter's remark was called racist by organization x (link)". Otherwise the section heading ("allegedly racist statements") would include original research - the unsourced claim that there have been such allegations. We cannot call Ann Coulter racist ourselves, but we can note that others have done so. However, what the article currently is doing is effectively saying "someone somewhere called her a racist once", and leaving it at that. This is original research. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 09:43, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
From the sources I've quoted in the article: "If Ann wishes to write condemning remarks about those responsible for terroristic acts, she has the support of the rest of the Conservative Movement. If she wishes to write inflammatory disparaging remarks which can be easily classified as racist or prejudicial – she's on her own." "At CPAC, Borchers reported that Coulter "rules the far right roost with racist speech death threat 'jokes.'" " Lust: Ann Coulter Makes Racist Remark About Reporter Helen Thomas; Occurs During Ann Coulter's Contrived Defense of Prostitute "Jeff Gannon" "Instead of scorn, Ann Coulter receives royalties. Instead of being written off and ignored as racist, essentially no different than a Knight of the Ku Klux Klan, she appears on the idiot tube, making repulsive comments about Muslims, Arabs, Asians, liberals, and now Native Americans."</p>
<p>How often is the burden to provide 8 independent sources for a single statement? The phrase "allegations of racist.." is appropriate because that's precisely what is alleged. Syberghost, there's several people who support the inclusion of the use of the word 'racist' in this context. My edit doesnt state she's racist, it merely points to the allegations of racism. The fact that you're an apologist for Ann's bigotry doesn't itself justify exclusion of the use of the word when obviously appropriate. You keep stating there is a dispute about it when you can't actually express your side of the dispute. If a paragraph focuses on allegations on racism, it's absolutely reasonable to have the header read as 'allegations of racism' <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 17:17, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not really all that strange, or uncommon. People get the precinct wrong in every election, and it only becomes a big deal if they're celebrities.

I found out when I posted my change of address downtown, which was easy for me to do at the time, I found out I had voted out of precinct. I was informed of this and that was that.

<dd>Yes, we are; on purpose. Because it's not news. People vote in the wrong precinct literally every single election. It's not even illegal in most places, and even where it is it's ignored unless they're doing it to vote twice. The ACLU's current lawsuits against the law are likely to get it struck down. It's a nonstory about a nonissue, and unless somebody decides to take the incredibly extraordinary leap to prosecuting it, it's neither newsworthy nor noteworthy.

<dd>It wouldn't be news if she hadn't furthered her career by berating the stupidity of Palm Beach County voters for the 2000 election. Ann has made a carrer of "smear attempts" so I think it's clearly relevant here. If she dishes it, she needs to take it. It is news, that's why it was reported in the first place.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Profanity?</span></h2>
<p>Question: does a recent entry in the trivia section referring to a NOFX lyric violate the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfanity_526b.html" title="Wikipedia:Profanity">Wikipedia:Profanity</a> guidelines? From the guideline: "Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate." It's trivia, so it seems like it contributes little to relevance, and nothing to accuracy. I guess the question is how informative do we consider trivia to be? It would seem by definition to be <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">trivial</a>. I propose removing it, or editing it to merely say "The song foo on the album bar by punk band baz contains a reference to Coulter." Let's discuss. -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 13:53, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>the profanity is completely relevent because it is in the lyrics of the song. the deletion of the profanity takes away from the meaning of the song. The profanity is an integral part showing the message of the song. it is a direct quote from the lyrics.</p>
<p>much like the sean hannity quote in the same song, it shows some liberal public opposition to Coulter's perspectives</p>
<dl>
<dd>Two things. First, to the anonymous editor above, please sign you comments with 4 tildes (~). Second, such use of profanity has no place here on WP for many reasons. First of all, the lyrics of a fringe "punk" band are irrelevant to a biography, even more so when they use such profanity, which could just as well be for shock value (to sell records), not the singer's "liberal opposition". Secondly the anonymous editor used this reason to include the lyrics:
<ul>
<li>"the deletion of the profanity takes away from the meaning of the song. The profanity is an integral part showing the message of the song."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The purpose of this article is to present a biography of Ann Coulter, not to convey the meaning of a song. If the consensus is that the song is even noteworthy enough to be mentioned, it is enough to simply mention it and cite a link to the lyrics that the reader can follow if so inclined.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 23:11, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, sorry, I must have read your original comment too quickly. If there is a legimitate controversy, that's fine. Which brings me to another point - a TIME cover shouldn't be used unless the article is actually discussing the TIME article or cover, in which case moving the image was entirely appropriate. However, the book cover should only be used where the book is discussed... whatever happened to the FOX News screenshot - or is that only acceptable when the subject is her commentary on FOX News?

Charles Potter of Michigan sat on the Army-McCarthy hearings and the censure committe.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Edits by Skywriter</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the Philander Smith incident, I'd say by removing the bit about what Coulter was arguing about (making the SCOTUS more conservative), you remove some needed context which provides insight into her character. The crack cocaine quip, and the note that she was booed, also do not seem to be worthy of removal to me. Can you defend these removals?</p>
<p>Regarding the CJR, removing " claiming it contained" and replacing with "for" needs more justification than just improved compactness. You've added a POV tinge to the sentence, specifically an assumption that the CJR was correct about mistakes in Slander, which Coulter has vehemently opposed. It's not appropriate for Wikipedia to imply through our choice of language that one side is right by default. "claiming it contained" should be reinstated.</p>
<p>Also, according to Wikipedia's own article on punditry, the term has recently gained a negative connotation in the United States. This is why "commentator" was used. I suggest reinstating "commentator", and for fairness's sake, adding "comedian". You also removed "what he believed were", which once again inserts a structural bias, assuming that Franken was correct and Coulter was wrong. Whatever our personal opinions, it's not right to give one side greater approval through choice of wording. The facts must speak for themselves, and "what he believed were" should be reinstated. You also removed a note that several of Coulter's errors had already been corrected, which removes a positive point in Coulter's favor in an article which has revealed her negativity in great detail. (Not that I'm rehashing a certain tired argument oft found on this talk page; the article mirrors its topic, nothing more.)</p>
<p>I hope you'll reply in a few days. I appreciate your efforts to make the article more compact, and good job on catching that dead link. But it's very important to avoid throwing the baby out with the bath water. Sometimes extra verbiage is required to avoid structural biases.

</dl>
<p>WilliamThweatt, why do you doubt I would reply?</p>
<p>There is well-documented danger in citing a Wikipedia article as an authoritative source. Most librarians and information professionals view Wikipedia as a source for tips, not the final say on any matter.</p>
<p>Pundit, for example, is a fine neutral term, not negative at all. Check with Merriam-Webster (11th edition), the dictionary used most often by the U.S. publishing industry: <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=pundit" class="external free" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=pundit" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=pundit</a> Or other standard dictionaries: <a href="http://onelook.com/?w=pundit&amp;ls=a" class="external free" title="http://onelook.com/?w=pundit&amp;ls=a" rel="nofollow">http://onelook.com/?w=pundit&amp;ls=a</a></p>
<p>If by insight into her character you mean Coulter favors Republicans and the conservative body politic, that point is made in the lede and throughout the article. It is made explicitly, for example, in the section on reversing the 19th amendment (and states it factually without the extra verbiage.) re: the Justice Stevens quip: She says it right there "That's just a joke, for you in the media." Coulter covered her tracks on that one. She doesn't need help from a Wikipedian explaining that a joke is, well, a joke to make a political point. If you disagree, would you say exactly what extra insight into her character the extra verbiage provides in the SCOTUS section? (Insight that does not permeate the article.)</p>
<p>I think you can trust readers to "get it" once a point is made. I fail to see how beating readers over the head by making the same point again and again helps the reader, or the article.</p>
<p>As to the crack cocaine bit, why is that relevant to anything? It is an out of context remark that seems to come out of nowhere. I am sure there was some context when she made the speech but here it sticks out like a bruised thumb. I have no opinion (or knowledge) on the claim of whether or not crack is popular. But I do know this: including that throw-away line adds nothing to my knowledge either of crack cocaine or of Ann Coulter. Why would you include it? Is she an expert on this topic?</p>
<p>Encyclopedia articles do not usually contain the subject's opinion of everything in the galaxy. Coulter is an opinion machine. Biographical details are most relevant here and her opinions when they make news. Throw away lines can safely be omitted.</p>
<p>My editing philosophy is that articles should be clear and easy to read and the various viewpoints should be presented fairly. That often means turning passive voice into active voice and avoiding weasel words. It is the opposite of "Mistakes were made. Others will be blamed" school of public relations writing.</p>
<p>Further, everything written turns on a point of view. CJR has a viewpoint as does Coulter and Franken etc. As to the CJR element, sure, change it to "claimed." Then change every single quote by everyone else in the article from "said" to "claimed." Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Re: the Coulter vs. Franken bit. I don't prefer one side over the other, except to object to density and unclarity in writing. My eyes rolled when I read this section because the wording is so dense. The link to Franken's profile makes clear he is a comedian. If you wish to add it here for clarity, please do so.</p>
<p>I have removed the Canada/VN segment because it is not the sort of thing found in an encyclopedia. If you think it should be included, then would you summarize it to point out that she is human and sometimes factually inaccurate (and even stubbornly so sometimes)? Previous to its removal, the section was a restatement of a he-said/she-said that is not particularly enlightening, especially in an encyclopedia. My further doubt on including this section is you can make the point that she gets into pissing matches without providing the blow by blow of each incident, which loses readers. I read this section and thought, okay she screws up sometimes. So do I. So does everyone editing Wikipedia. Should a federal case be made of it, or is it okay to move on?</p>
<p>All of this said, do as you wish. My goal was and continues to be to tighten an article that is flabby and difficult to read. I will not engage in an editing war but will return from time to time to tighten the language, to make it more pleasant to read.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism of Treason and Slander</span></h2>
<p>"For instance, President Dwight Eisenhower's chief of staff Sherman Adams wrote a memoir in 1961, <i>First Hand Report</i>, that makes clear the hostility the Republican administration held against Sen. McCarthy. Further, two Republican Senators wrote memoirs excoriating McCarthy. Sen. Arthur Watkins of Utah chaired his censure committee and wrote <i>Enough Rope</i> in 1969, sparing no detail in his fury over McCarthy's conduct. Sen. Charles Potter of Michigan sat on the Army-McCarthy hearings and the censure committee. His 1965 memoir, <i>Days of Shame</i>, is equally harsh toward the Wisconsin Senator."</p>
<p>This paragraph sounds like it is <i>in</i> the book, not criticism of the book. I said it before, it sounds POV and should be removed. ---bamonster</p>

The comments are thoughtful and verifiable. I don't think it crosses the line or "bashes" her, as you say. It is valid commentary of a person who deliberately attracts attention to herself only by making personal attacks on individuals and groups. Look at the first letter. It is from an editor of the editorial page at the <i>Seattle Times</i> complaining about Coulter's statements about him in one of her books. His is a reasoned, dispassionate complaint. He complains not only of her attack-dog style but also of her factual errors about his work in her book. Do you know what it takes for a newspaper person to write in a public place that is not his newspaper? Let me tell you-- it is extraordinary.</p>
<p>The next longer item comments on her column on Muslims, which the author calls "a racist diatribe against Muslims. Not just radical Muslims, but Muslims everywhere.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Last two Revisions Self-praising her Factualness</span></h2>
<p>The last two revisions are unsourced viewpoint. The opposite is true. Coulter has even been accused of plagiarism and that is not yet in this article. (I've been meaning to get to it-- and I will.) That an author uses footnotes is not noteworthy. That an author is accused of getting the facts wrong, as this author has been repeatedly, is news. This is not a public relations site for Coulter. It is already over the top that the page is providing PR (with the photo) for her next book. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkywriter_749b.html" title="User:Skywriter">Skywriter</a> 17:46, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is a fact she is proud and touts that she uses a lot of footnotes. Many other authors have far fewer notes in political genre books. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 17:47, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The following is unadulterated baloney and an embarassment to Coulter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ann prides herself on the copious footnotes in her books where she backs up her statements and often cites them in this criticism. <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter100903.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter100903.asp" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact of footnotes is not news and not worthy of inclusion in Wiki article. One would hope a nonfiction writer uses footnotes. When one does is NOT cause for comment.</p>
<p>As to the following, how can anyone know what "most people" think? While this may refer to your personal sense of humor, one can not make this statement for "most people." <b>But most people find them to be very funny.</b> <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkywriter_749b.html" title="User:Skywriter">Skywriter</a> 18:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no dog in this race and zero opinion of Coulter, except today, seeing as how she feels she has to defend the adding of footnotes. That's sad, but I guess you are right. It tells volumes about the sort of person she is. My extensive work restructuring this article which you can revisit by looking at the history focused on removing the in-fghting and making the article easier on readers.</p>

<p>I reverted sourced material that somone else hamfistedly blanked. It is a commentary that footnotes and sources are remarkible in this field. We have more data today, and we reference less and less of it. It speaks volumes of the pundit industry. I think the unreferenced slogan had it's roots in the 60s and 70s, IMHO. I think this article needs to be mostly moved to wikiquote, have things like how shocking she is removed, and focus on Coulter.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Franken on Coulter books</span></h2>
<p>I'm pretty sure I remember this line differently. The line as it currently stands reads, <i>In his book, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, liberal pundit Al Franken pointed out some factual errors and misleading statements in Coulter's books, which were corrected in later editions.</i></p>
<p>This seems to imply that every error pointed out by Franken was corrected. I've read "Lying Liars", and Franken's laundry list of Coulter errors and (he alleges) lies is quite long. I find it very hard to believe that Coulter would go out of her way to fix every statement Franken had a problem with, especially since Franken is, in her words, a godless liberal who hates America.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a source on how many (if any) of the errors pointed out by Franken were, in fact, corrected in later editions of Coulter's books? Perhaps I'm wrong, and she really did fix them all. Perhaps I've misjudged Coulter. But... I doubt it.

<p>Why does the article have two book covers at the top?

<p>Sorry, for not being more specific. I just wanted to point out what should be very obvious. Lookup Maureen Dowd or Al Frankin on wikipedia. You'll actually get a cing "biography" section on the Coulter article leaves you wondering why she's famous. The remaining sections read like the desultory result of a highly polarized debate. Again, I don't think this is necessarily avoidable with Coulter.

<dd>I agree that the style and layout of the article have suffered greatly from the constant wars over content. This happens a lot on articles whose content is highly controversial; people focus on adding or removing sources or claims, and not on making the article readable and well-written. If you point out the problems, I'll help out if I can.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One point I might add. You note that from the bio, it's hard to understand why Coulter is famous, and you're right. I'd say this is because the reason - which is that she is highly controversial and notorious (or is it infamous?) for her hyperbolic rants and accusations - is constantly removed from the article by her supporters because they feel it's unfair to say she is hyperbolic and accusative. However, they never bother to add any other reason for Coulter's notability, so the bio section is left with that "who is this woman?" feeling. I really don't know how to fix this problem, aside from heavy-handed interference from admins, which should always be a last resort. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:51, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"they never bother to add any other reason for Coulter's notability" -- but this seems to be not very difficult.

<dd>Well, I didn't mean to imply that there was no other possible reason for notability, just that some editors take things out without putting anything in to replace them with. As to Time etc., most of their coverage of Coulter is in language acknowledging her extreme controversiality; Time's cover is captioned "Miss Right", a commentary on both her conservatism as well as her polarized, I'm-always-right-you're-always-wrong attitude. Time itself seems to be saying that Coulter's fame is due to her attitude. So her attitude may not be the only reason she is famous, but there seems to be evidence that it is chief among the reasons.

<p>We had "As an undergraduate in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>'s College of Arts and Sciences, Coulter helped launch a conservative newspaper, The <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_Review_89c6.html" title="Cornell Review">Cornell Review</a></i>, with funding from the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_Network_e5a4.html" title="Collegiate Network">Collegiate Network</a>, which in turn receives its core funding from the conservative philanthropist <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Mellon_Scaife_b102.html" title="Richard Mellon Scaife">Richard Mellon Scaife</a>."</p>
<p>Interestingly, our article on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_Network_e5a4.html" title="Collegiate Network">Collegiate Network</a> does not mention Scaife! Do we have a source which would show that the Cornell Review was launched with funding from the Collegiate Network in the first place?</p>
<p>It seems plausible to me that the claims are true, although I should point out that this sort of chain strikes me as pretty hackish writing. She "helped launch" a newspaper (in what capacity) which got funding (how much, was it primary funding, or simply a small grant?) from a non-profit organization, which in turn receives funding from Scaife. That is a pretty stretched chain whose sole purpose seems to be to imply a connection between Coulter and Scaife which probably does not exist.</p>
<p>So even if the claim did turn out to be true and verifiable, it is not clear to me as a matter of editorial judgment that it belongs in the article anyway.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am editing in this case as an ordinary editor, not acting in any special capacity. I met Anne Coulter recently and she brought this tidbit up to me as an example of a flaw in the Wikipedia biography of her, and I have to say that I agree with her criticism on this point.</p>

<p>Okay, I received a response (amazingly fast!!!), but was unable to get many specifics. It was confirmed that The Review receives funding from the Collegiate Network. CN operates under the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI), which does in turn receive grant money from the Sarah Scaife Foundation. "Scaife's three principal foundations gave [ISI] and its affiliate, the Collegiate Network, $880,000 last year. Since the early '60s the two have been granted more than $7 million from Scaife sources." <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifegraf050299.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifegraf050299.htm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> However, as none of this <i>really</i> applies to Coulter, I'd say this point is fairly moot.

<dd>Unfortunately, I know a lot about Jimbo's integrity. Or lack of it. While he may support someone like Ann Coulter (who rants on at length about ragheads, camel jockeys, jihad monkeys etc), and share her opinions, I don't think it's right that he imposes his views on Wikipedia. Whenever he starts "editing as an ordinary editor", very soon afterwards his sycophants make sure the article becomes the embodiment of his opinions. The history of Wikipedia is replete with incidences of this nature. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 18:06, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps, but did you ever stop and think he and "his sycophants" were correct? I know you have taken issue in the past, but perhaps what they are doing is actually <i>helping</i> WP. This is afterall an encyclopedia, not a blog or diatribe-ranting medium. We just try and explain the topic at hand and give the best possible description of the article's subject. We do not add or remove things willy-nilly either. We <i>have</i> to remain NPOV and especially verifiable. Just because he met Coulter does not mean he shares her views. I would be shocked if he did, in fact. He isn't "courting her", he's trying to make the article better. I can't see why you would take exception with trying to make articles batter, or is that not your goal here? --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">You Know Who</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 18:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The selectivity about how he chooses which articles to "defend" is notable. All are ferociously anti-arab. I won't pretend this is a coincidence, and I respect your intelligence enough to know that you won't either. So, this leads his interventions to become more and more like a blog or a diatribe, rather than less. Let's not be naive. If Jimbo had met David Duke, and he came onto Wikipedia and suggested Wikipedia should be more sympathetic to the man, would you support him? Let's maintain some integrity, and resist the need to support Jimbo simply because he leads this project. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 18:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know about "anti-arab" (and this isn't really the place to be debating this anyways). Perhaps "Pro-Israel", which is <i>vastly</i> different. And to be frank, sorry Jimbo, I don't really think Jimbo leads this project much. He has some control, but in the vast majority of decisions around here, especially in recent times, Jimbo has had no role. There are many others that have contributed more to the actual content around here. Jimbo plays a role, yes. But an increasingly diminishing one (as it should be, really). He hasn't even touched on Arab-related material in some of the articles he has, as you put it, "protected". If he had wanted a "anti-arab" wiki, he would have formed one; not one based on NPOV.

The first clue one might get is that I am in vehement disagreement with all of them. To make his case, Xed has to blank out almost completely on the facts of reality.

<dd>Yes, but I'd say that Coulter's fascination with McCarthy is quite notable. I've seen her on many talk shows discussing McCarthy's philosophy, and much criticism has arisen about her supposed praise of his blacklisting Communists. For me personally, when I hear the name "Ann Coulter," my first thought is "Oh, she's the one who built her entire political manifesto around McCarthy's"--whether or not that's true is debatable, but I think it's worthwhile to mention in the article. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't personally care about the rifle one, though it does seem odd that an unmarried woman who is a successful pundit, political agitator, lawyer, and apparently amateur markswoman, should consistently argue that women should not be allowed to vote (apparently having better things they need to be doing in the kitchen). Somehow I get the feeling Ann doesn't intend for these restrictions to apply to herself.</dd>

<dd>As for McCarthy, most leftists (and many others, I'd expect) find her support for such a completely discredited figure as McCarthy to be just one more example (as if more were needed) of how out-of-touch she is with mainstream American society. Standing up for McCarthy today is as bizarre and outlandish today, socially, as standing up for someone called before HUAC would have been fifty years ago - and a hell of a lot less justifiable. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 22:08, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you look at the <a href="../../../v/e/n/VENONA_project_ecab.html" title="VENONA project">VENONA project</a> and cables, a lot of what McCarthy did had grounds but got politicized.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Worth noting</span></h2>
<p>Since Xed seems to be launching a smear campaign against me based on vague allegations about my political positions, it is probably worth saying a few words about this.</p>
<p>First, I am not a fan of Ann Coulter. I have never read any of her books. I may have read some of her columns now and then, but mostly people people of my own ideological persuasion tend to hate her with a passion and send me links when she has said something which I would find particularly offensive.</p>
<p>Second, when I met her I was very impressed that her primary complaints about the article were about simple matters of fact that apparently we got wrong. She was fully expecting and fine with the article detailing various controversial things she has said and done. Xed wants people to believe that I would have a goal of whitewashing articles about conservative political figures, which is bizarre on the face of it, but made even more bizarre if you look at this article, and my edits to it... which I made with full disclaimers that I am editing only as an ordinary editor. If you think my edits were mistaken, revert me... or better yet, let's keep doing research and get to the bottom of the factual question.</p>
<p>Why is Xed claiming these things? I do not know. He has always been anti-Jimbo from the time he first showed up here, and he has always been prone to radically misrepresenting the facts. Nothing new. But it is well worth a few minutes of my time to say: stop it, Xed, you should be ashamed of yourself.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 23:16, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a stretch between what Jimbo said, and "courting racist celebrities", a stretch that seems to have been covered by your personal opinion of him. Tossing off witticisms like "or his lack of it" (re: integrity) also isn't very fair. If Jimbo came in here and tried to gut this article of its balance regarding Ann based on a request to him, hell yes I would say something to him. But the section he removed was unsourced. Original research is fair game to any editor that spots it. Frankly, I wouldn't have minded it if Ann herself had come on this talk page and requested it be removed. I personally prefer to apply a cite needed tag and leave it for a week, but that's not required by any WP policy I'm aware of. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 10:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wales meets Coulter, a racist celebrity known for her talk of camel jockeys, jihad monkeys and ragheads. Perhaps they mix in the same social circle.</li>
<li>Coulter complains to Wales about her article.</li>
<li>Wales gets personally involved in sorting out her article for her.</li>
<li>Referring to the <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Cole_474e.html" title="Juan Cole">Juan Cole</a> article, Wales tells me <i>"I think some brave editor ought to go into that article and make a stub of it and insist on rigorous sourcing and 'no original research' throughout. Will you take on that challenge?"</i> The article is of course locked, meaning I couldn't make the article a stub even if I wanted to.</li>
<li>Wales attacks me for questioning his methods, using the cult-like language of "anti-Jimbo"</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Refactoring...</span></h2>
<p>I recently refactored this page, but it got mostly reverted. Let me explain. The Fox News screencap is grainy and out-of-focus. The book cover better shows who Coulter is (especially since she is first an author, secondly a Fox News guest). Using the SC in the lead leaves no image for the "Media career" section, and multiple ones in later sections. For these reasons I feel the cover should be in the lead, and the SC should be lower. The list of books should be higher in the article, as this is the main reason she is notable (although they would probably be better suited in some sort of paragraph form, not just a straight list). Some of the "Controversies" mention the book, but we haven't even identified what she wrote before jumping right into critiques of them. I know there is still some refactoring left to do, but thought it wise to discuss my changes here. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">You Know Who</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 23:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the books should have pride of place; they are the main reason she is notable. I really don't care about which picture is used as long as the images are all acceptable for our use. And you're right, it's probably jarring to a reader who hasn't heard of Coulter to be told criticisms of "Slander" or "Treason" before even being told that such a book exists! Those of us editors who have studied Coulter should keep this pitfall in mind: just because <i>we</i> know about Coulter is irrelevant. We must assume our readers know <i>nothing</i> about her, and present the information in a logical order.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverted edits by Joeldpalmer</span></h2>
<p>I think these were a clear example of POV. He removed the description of the Washington Times as "conservative"; this is not controversial. It is common knowledge that the Washington Times is owned and carefully overseen by the Unification Church of Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a prominent Republican Party donor.</p>
<p>He also added a description of Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation as a "liberal anti-war group". Try as I might I can find no reference to VVAF's political beliefs. As far as I am aware they are an apolitical organization. The attempt to paint them as "liberal" is therefore an attempt to cast inappropriate aspersions on the validity of their commentary on Coulter. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 20:38, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To LV, I have to disagree strongly with the removal of "conservative" before the Washington Times line in the section in dispute. The paragraph is discussing conservatives who do not agree with Coulter. If Washington Times is not "conservative", what the heck is it doing in that paragraph? Only conservative organizations belong in that paragraph. If it removed from the paragraph, there's nothing left <i>to</i> the paragraph and the entire paragraph should be removed. Removing the descriptive word "conservative" requires removing the entire paragraph, <i>or</i> adding further examples of conservatives disagreeing with Coulter. I think it's noteworthy that even organizations widely accepted as conservative - such as the National Review and the Washington Times - have chosen to distance themselves from her.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To wit, on the page <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Times_50df.html" title="Washington Times">Washington Times</a>, in the section on Political Leanings, there are no less than eleven individual sources supporting Wikipedia's flat pronouncement (on that page) of the Washington Times' conservative leaning.

<dd>Well perhaps you are right. But we should probably not just say "the conservative Washington Times". We should say something more along the lines of "the Washington Times that some have identified as conservative (insert cites to people claiming the conservatism of the Times)". Not exactly right, but you get the point. There is a difference in us simply labeling it conservative, and saying that others have labeled it conservative.

<dd>I typically give unsourced claims a week, as a courtesy to whoever added them. Of course, if it's something offensive or obviously loony, there is no grace period; vandalism does not require courtesy in return. Note that I mean a week <i>from when the cite tag was applied</i>, not a week from when the claim was first added.
