<dd>I like this version, which IMHO presents the pertinent facts and conveys a neutral point of view. Plagiarism is an important subject among authors, and when an important author is accused of it, it is worthy of prominent mention. When the important author is controversial, and when many people have the point of view that she should be discredited wherever possible, responsible encyclopedia editors need to try very hard to avoid edits that might disrupt the article's neutral point of view. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It’s been five days since the New York Post reported at least three instances of “textbook plagiarism” in Ann Coulter’s latest book and found “similar patterns of cribbing” in the last 12 months of her columns. Yesterday, Coulter’s syndicator, Universal Press Syndicate, announced it was going to probe the allegations, itself. And she remains under investigation for voter fraud in Florida, a third degree felony. (with links to all of the allegations) <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2006/07/07/real_journalism_fox_news_hannity_colmes_silent_about_ann_coulters_plagiarism_and_voter_fraud_allegations.php#more" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newshounds.us/2006/07/07/real_journalism_fox_news_hannity_colmes_silent_about_ann_coulters_plagiarism_and_voter_fraud_allegations.php#more" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>

<dd>What? Churchill is a professor being fired from his position because of plagarism, one of the most serious offense a scholar can commit. Why does that merit adding "dirt" to this particular article? If there are legitimate accusations against Coulter then by all means add verfiable, noteable references to those accusations. But to try to add material to one article because "another article has something similar" is poor logic and has no merit in Wikipedia policies or practice. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 02:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coulter's critics have glommed on to non-academic writing that contains hundreds of footnotes but left out attribution of a few short factual sentences that her publisher considers trivial. Thats it: a few instances of what her liberal cirtics consider to be plagiarism. Whereas with Churchill, a university committee agreed unanimously that as a professor he had engaged in "serious research misconduct," including four counts of falsifying information, two counts of fabricating information, two counts of plagiarizing the works of others, improperly reporting the results of studies, and failing to “comply with established standards regarding author names on publications.” In addition, the committee found him "disrespectful of Indian oral traditions." And by the way, the CHurchill article does not even use the word plagiarism in any subheading despite his being fire for it. Whereas COulter is merely accused of it by leftwing political enemies, and some here treat that information as if it defines her.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.146.217.186 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.146.217.186_1e09.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.146.217.186">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>I pretty much agree with the thrust of the anonymous words immediately above, but not necessarily their strong expression. IMHO the article should definitely mention the allegations of plagiarism and describe what is alleged. (Plus, of course, anything notable that contradicts the allegations or responds to them.) Also IMHO, we should avoid quoting from a jillion references that report the allegations, report new items that have been found that seem to have been plagiarized, throw in their opinion that Coulter is a serial plagiarist, etc. Put the references in, if you want, but try hard to avoid looking like Wikipedia has a point of view on this matter. Just because you can reference it doesn't mean that it belongs in the article. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>It wouldn't hurt to quote <b>one</b> example of a "factual sentence or list ... copied from another source without attribution".</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is a dispute between Coulter opponents and Coulter supporters about how serious the "plagiarism" charges are, why not describe the dispute? Is anybody (outside of Wiki contributors) saying that Coulter should:</p>
<dl>
<dd>have her book(s) withdrawn from publication?</dd>
<dd>be considered a sloppy, deranged, unreliable kook?</dd>
</dl>
<p>If so, these opponent POVs could be added to the article, along with any balancing POV from defenders, couldn't they? --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWing_Nut_3e6c.html" title="User:Wing Nut">Wing Nut</a> 13:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that it's reasonable to include some of the stuff that Wing Nut suggests, particularly as long as the plagiarism flap is a current event. Both sides should be presented though, and we should guard against this section becoming a long anti-Coulter rant, complete with highly documented references. (The plagiarism stuff shouldn't be longer than its importance within the article merits, and it <i>definitely</i> shouldn't be an anti-Coulter rant.

<p>I disagree with the suggested re-write. The tone is dismissive about the plagiarism, which makes it inherently POV. It also doesn't correctly use the &lt;ref&gt; tag. Previous versions provide more detail and give examples.

<dd>It is ok for the tone to be dismissive about the plagiarism, if the plagiarism is not real. Does anyone know either way? Probably not. So, just report the facts. The facts are: 1.

<dd>I haven't followed this section closely, but my impression is that previous versions have glorified in mentioning every allegation of plagiarism, putting in references to each, and in general magnifying the "allegation" side of things. I appreciate that someone might think that it's some sort of "inherent POV" not to cover every little detail, but I have to say that those people are wrong in their thinking. To "pile on" is to express a point of view. So is to defend "piling on." To me, it's proper to say that allegations have been made, while providing some detail to put the allegations in context, and posting a roughly equivalent amount of material about defense against the allegations, opinions that they are groundless or nitpicking, etc. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:09, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's sort of like the "Coulter is an habitual offender of Islam" section further down in the article. Aren't people ashamed to <i>post</i> this stuff?

<dd>That's fine, it should be shortened, but the re-write is dismissive. To say that critics (what critics? this is a weasel term) have pointed out five instances without referencing a single instance and then giving quotations to both her column publisher and book publisher denying the charges is dismissive and POV.

Why are there no exaples of the plagarism and/or factual errors cited? That would clear up a lot in my view. 66.57.225.195 22:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Coulter's "plagarism" is just as easily considered "paraphrase" in my mind. She summed up 2 passages using her own words to make the point made in another work. Coulter is a political humorist who only needs footnotes and endnotes in the first place because she is vilified. Case in point, by the way, of what she says about the liberal media. Do you think Al Franken could ever get his column dropped from a newspaper? I find the gentleman and his anti-plagarism computer program to be far too debatable to be included as fact here. ---rippa76</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed rewrite</span></h2>
<p>This paragraph focuses on a minor event and gives toomuch detail for an article that is actually about Coulter, not some newspaper that dropped her column. The precise date it happened is a minor piece of info, as is the nameof the small-time edior and the small-time paper. The comments of several readers is also not something of value for an encyclopedic article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current version: <i>On August 28, 2005 {<b>why is the precise date given?</b>}, Coulter's syndicated column was dropped by the Tucson newspaper Arizona Daily Star {<b>how is the name of a small state paper important in an encyclopedia article about Coulter?</b>}. David Stoeffler,{<b>how is this guys name - a nobody who is not even at the paper anymore - important?</b>} the editor and publisher said, "We've decided that syndicated columnist Ann Coulter has worn out her welcome. Many readers find her shrill, bombastic and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives." {<b>is the important fact that the column was dropped, or what the editor claimed as the reason? - agan this is supposed to be an encyclopedia</b>}[15] Despite this sentiment, Editor &amp; Publisher magazine {<b>this information belongs in the footnote, not the article</b>} wrote that she "hasn't lost any of her 100-plus newspaper clients, or the support of her syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate," despite the swirl of negative press that has accompanied the release of her latest and most controversial book, Godless. [23]</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proposed version: <i>In 2005, one newspaper dropped Coulter's syndicated column citing reader complaints. [15] But none of the more than 100 newspapers that carry the column have dropped it due to the controversy surrounding the 2006 release of</i> Godless<i>. [23]</i></li>

<dd>I agree with your rewrite, whoever you are. Somebody fixed it in a similar way a week or so ago, but somebody else reverted it. All your points are valid. The way the article stands right now, with some minor guy's strong anti-Coulter words about a non-notable event, makes it hard to believe that this section is written with a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 21:29, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, he said them, but to put them into an encyclopedia is hardly an act of neutrality.) The guy who said them, by the way, resigned a few weeks later under mysterious circumstances.

I was probably too quick in saying "straw man," but I think a more specific response would have been in order. ("Straw man" is putting an argument in somebody's mouth, then legitimately destroying that argument. This wasn't <i>quite</i> that. Sorry.) BTW, I wondered what "[ec]" meant.

<dd>I agree that we need to shorten the section but I'm not sure I follow either the original section or the rewrite. The first "half" is about a newspaper dropping the column because of reader complaints. The second "half" is about many newspapers retaining the column. The entire "controversy surrounding the 2006 release of 'Godless'" seems to come out of nowhere and I don't see the connection between the first and second halves of this section. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 21:33, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ElKevbo: IMHO the important fact is that in spite of all the talk against Coulter, her column keeps chugging along, and people aren't dropping it. To mention, yet alone quote some guy's rant about, the occasional add and drop is just a waste of bandwidth. And quoting the rant smacks of a biased point of view. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 00:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the lengthy quote from the Arizona newspaper editor needs to go - it's giving undue weight to that particular issue.

The sections just don't really follow one another logically. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 02:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that is a likely explanation. I appreciate the attempt at balance but it just doesn't work in this case. It would work much better if the mention of "Godless" were removed as it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the issue at hand: the non-decreasing numbers of newspapers publishing her column. The point is that the Arizona paper cancelling their publication is an isolated incident.

<dd>Yes - its an isolated incident that does not even belong in the article.

Specifically, I'd say the quote on premarital sex is rather muddled and doesn't seem to fit well, while the mention of the quote from scripture in Godless (the "they exchanged the truth of God for a lie" bit) speaks to her assertion that Christianity fuels her writings, so I'd say that bit's notable. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 02:26, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Lou Sander</b> says: I'm thinking that the section could be trimmed quite a bit. Suggestions:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Coulter openly professes her Christian religious beliefs. At one public lecture she proclaimed her faith in Jesus Christ, saying: "I don't care about anything else: Christ died for my sins and nothing else matters."[25] Time magazine's John Cloud also reported that he attended a service at Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City with Coulter, where she worships and often brings guests.[2]</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><s>When asked during an interview about the morality of non-marital sex, she replied: "Christians are the most tolerant people in the world—because we know there's original sin. We know people do bad things. But it seems to me it's a much worse thing to go around saying that it isn't a sin to commit a sin. I mean—at least feel guilty about it."[1]</s></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><s>She has stated that her Christian faith, "fuels everything," she writes, and that it particularly fuels her book Godless.[26] In that book, Coulter says in a footnote, "Throughout this book, I often refer to Christians and Christianity because I am a Christian and I have a fairly good idea of what they believe, but the term is intended to include anyone who subscribes to the Bible of the God of Abraham, including Jews and others."</s> Coulter has stated: "<s>Although my Christianity is somewhat more explicit in this book (Godless),</s> Christianity fuels everything I write. Being a Christian means that I am called upon to do battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisy—you know, all the virtues in the church of liberalism."[26]</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In a commentary on Mel Gibson's film "The Passion of the Christ" she wrote: "Being nice to people is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity. <s>(as opposed to other religions whose tenets are more along the lines of 'kill everyone who doesn't smell bad and doesn't answer to the name Mohammed')."</s>[27]</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Coulter also quotes Christian scripture in her work. Godless begins with: "They exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the creator.... Therefore, God gave them up to passions of dishonor, for their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature. — Romans 1:25-26"</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the transitions could be better, but I didn't want to cloud things up with them right now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the deleted stuff: 1) Sex: not notable in the context of a biographical encyclopedia article. 2) "fuels everything": some is repeated later; the rest is from a footnote, and is therefore probably not worthy of mention. 3) "As opposed to...": Inflammatory stuff that detracts from the point being made, plus we already have a boatload of anti-muslim stuff (see below about losinthe point).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd maybe get rid of the whole Mel Gibson paragraph, except that she definitely isn't nice to people, and some think that's grossly incompatible with Christianity. This corrects that misperception. The "smell bad" stuff isn't central to the point. In the paragraph before that one, the "do battle" stuff, similarly, makes explicit the connection between her religion and what she does in her work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As changed, we'd have a section that: 1) Editorially states that she's a Christian. 2) Quotes her basic profession of faith. 3) Discusses her church attendance (not a huge deal, but readers might be curious). 4) ID's her religion as her fuel, and quotes her on what it fuels her to do. 5) Explains that niceness isn't central to her religion. And finally, 6) gives an explicit example of Christianity in her work. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I would say either keep the entire Gibson quote, or delete the whole thing; keeping the part where Coulter outlines a positive guideline, but deleting the part where she immediately fails to follow that guideline herself, risks losing out on one of Coulter's many "jokes". &#160;;) The only other quibble I have is that I think we should keep the sentence on her claim that Christianity "fuels" her work, and the source for that claim - I think that sentence should go first in the section, because it's the real reason we even <i>have</i> a section on her religious views, ie., it's why the section is notable. All the rest of the material you struck, I would support removing. Cheers, <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Just some initial thoughts, I think we should eliminate the whole Gibson quote, as removing the second part alters the entire context of the joke. This is not really descriptive of <i>her</i> belief in Christianity, so I'd sooner see it go than stay, as long as it was under the part about her views on people from the Middle East. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 01:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is an obvious issue that Coulter repeatedly and publically refers to herself as a Christian when her behavior contradicts what so many Christians accept as Christ's teachings. I added the inescapable conflict between Christian precepts and Coulter's frequent statements that religion is her motivation for her book Godless There is a strong reaction to this among CHristians and secular commentators too, but even without that it is necessary to address it due to its inherent relevance to her continued public statements.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not arguing the point...I'm just saying that pointing it out is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original Research</a>. If you can find a reputable Christian group that objects, you can quote them and cite it with a reliable source, but we just can't come out and call her a hypocrite...we can only report if others accuse her of hypocrisy (with appropriate, reliable sources, of course).--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 03:41, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term "open about her Christian belief " is both POV and assumes there is some reason not to be "open" about that. Christianity is the overwhelmingly dominant religion in her gestalt - what is there to be "open" about?? Her obvious ideology is not in conflict. The terminology used is gratiutous and not enlightening -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Getterstraight (<a href="../../../g/e/t/User_talk%7EGetterstraight_3a50.html" title="User talk:Getterstraight">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Getterstraight_f7ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/Getterstraight">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>As a fan of both Coulter and Christianity I disagree with your interpretation that to say she is "open about her Christian belief" is POV and assumes there is some reason not to "open". If by gestalt you meant <a href="../../../w/e/l/Weltanschauung.html" title="Weltanschauung">weltanschauung</a>, I agree but I don't see its relevance. To be "not open" would be to simply not (be willing to) discuss the subject. Many people (me, for example) are simply private (not open) about their religious beliefs and do not discuss them in public. Coulter discusses her religious beliefs publicly both in interviews and in her books and is therefore, "open" about the subject. I actually changed it to "open" from "profess" because profess has a secondary meaning, "to pretend", and I didn't think the word choice was a good one. As for it being gratuitous, the entire sentence is; but it flows well. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 17:35, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You justify substituting wording whose primary purpose is to put unremarkable behavior in a positive light (i.e. POV) by replacing a word whose <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary.html" title="Secondary">secondary</a></i> meaning <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">may</a> be viewed as negative. The fact you are a fan of Coulter's speaks to your neutrality in seeing this point. Since encyclopedic style calls for use of words to concisely deliver information, then it would be worth stating she was "closed" about her faith, or that she was open about not going to church, or did not consider herself a Christian, as <a href="../../../t/h/o/Those.html" title="Those">those</a> would be noteworthy. Certainly it is not surprising that someone who makes a living and regular headlines speaking negatively about people she does not believe are Christians should be expected to not be "closed" about being Christian. "<i>Profess</i>" is the perfect word for your own definition of her behavior, "to affirm openly, declare, claim". But if you prefer "proclaim" that is also more appropriate, and although I beleive i tcarries a connotation stronger than profess ( aterm used frequently in the behavioal sciences) i tdoes not have a dictionary negative secondary meaning. Since she activley proclaims her opinion of her religious self on a routine basis, is that not more descriptive than merely being open about it? Remember, counselor, your fan status is prima facie evidence you seek to paint the subject in a positive light over the delivery of relevant information. GetterstraightGetterStraightGetterstraight
<dl>
<dd>I was not so much in favor of saying she was "open" as much as I was <b>not</b> in favor of saying she "professes" for the reason we both mention, namely, that secondary definition; "proclaim" is fine by me. The rest of what you say kinda lost me. I can't tell if you are saying that based on Coulter's criticisms of non-Christians that it should be obvious to anyone that she she must be a Christian, open about her beliefs. If so, I disagree. While it may not be <i>surprising</i> to find out someone who says the things Coulter does is a Christian, I think "encylopedic style" calls for it <b>not</b> to be left up to the reader to make that tacit assumption. Appropriately, this section of the article makes both her religious beliefs and the fact that she's open about them pretty clear. Therefore, with regards to "concisely delivering information", you have to admit the entire sentence we're discussing is gratuitous/redundant; but as I said, I think it flows well. If you disagree, please feel free to remove it entirely. I'm unclear on what your point is regarding my being a fan of Coulter, but it must be important because you mentioned it twice. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 16:19, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, a few minor things in the "Jersey Girls" section caught my eye. Namely, the line "The partisan activities of the, 'Jersey Girls' have also been documented by other observers." seems kinda irrelevant; the only reason I can think of for it's inclusion would be to make a point about the Jersey Girls. I think that an article about Ann Coulter should only contain material relevant to Ann Coulter. The Jersey Girls' activities can go somewhere else. Also, the line "makes no apologies" kinda sticks out to me as something she herself would say, and should probably be omitted or replaced with something like 'defends her stance'. But anyways, that's just me... <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutronium_a0f7.html" title="User:Neutronium">Neutronium</a> 01:31, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not really an NPOV issue, it's a notability issue. The reason for the inclusion of the section on the Jersey Girls is due to a recent controversy over Coulter's comments on the Jersey Girls, which went so far as to earn her not one but two scalding remarks on the floor of Congress itself. Now that's what I call controversy. I would say that if we're interested in reporting on controversies involving Coulter, this article would definitely be the place for it. Unless there were an "Ann Coulter Controversies" article. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 03:30, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Kasreyn. The Jersey Girls stuff definitely belongs in the Coulter article: it's current, it's a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a>, it's the kind of thing Coulter often gets involved with. I think that the stuff about other people ID'ing the girls as partisan is important in putting this controversy into context.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on Women</span></h2>
<p>Can anyone explain why this entire section was removed? It has been in the article for a long, long time. There have been disputed over what should be <i>in</i> it, but I don't recall anyone arguing the entire section should just be deleted. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 20:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't remove it, but I've long wondered why it was there. Maybe somebody thought it wasn't very important. I suppose that Coulter definitely said all those things, but who cares? Is she noted for her comments about women? (IMHO, no.) Do encyclopedias usually regurgiate a bunch of a subject's words on a topic, without discussing why that topic is important in the subject's work? (IMHO, no.) Could readers infer that showing a bunch of well-sourced quotes "against" women means that Coulter is an anti-woman sexist? (IMHO, yep.) Should we make a special effort NOT to include things that might erroneously be interpreted as trying to paint someone in a negative light? (IMHO, yep.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 03:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I care. And as far as I'm aware, her comments sparked a good deal of outrage. Is it survey figures you want from me or something? As far as I can tell, "notability" is wrangled out between editors based on common sense and their gut feelings. I've never seen any really objective standards proposed for determining it. And I feel Coulter's comments about women are notable. I can't speak for anyone else.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You ask, what use are a "bunch of a subject's words". Here's a use: Ann Coulter is a polemecist, self-described. She makes her living off of saying outrageous things. Whether you see her as a vindictive hate merchant or a brilliantly witty satirist, <i>either way you slice it</i>, she makes her living off of saying outrageous things. Throughout the article, we cite sources who say essentially that - "Coulter says outrageous things to make a living." So I ask, why do you think the article would be complete without examples of what we are discussing? In the article on Degas, some photos of paintings would be in order. In the article on Lance Armstrong, a discussion of his favorite custom bikes might be handy. In the article on Ann Coulter, some examples of the more widely remarked-upon of her stock-in-trade: polemics, and the reactions thereto.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You say that you feel it is incumbent upon us to make a "special effort" to avoid anything that might be "interpreted" as trying to paint Coulter in a negative light. But consider for a moment: what if Coulter really were, as some people believe, a truly bad and awful person? (Hypothetical, mind you.) Would we then also be required to avoid anything that could be interpreted as trying to paint her in a negative light? The NPOV policy mainly refers to the verbiage used, but there is a section on "Undue weight". It essentially says that if <i>in the real world</i>, one viewpoint on a subject is more widespread than another, we should give proportionate amounts of our time and space for those viewpoints. (This is my interpretation of the Undue weight section. If I'm mistaken, the following reasoning of course, would be voided.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So the question is, what is the balance of opinion on Coulter out there, in "real world" land? What proportionate balance should we be emulating? Note that I've raised this issue here before, if I'm not mistaken, and don't recall engendering any real debate. No one was interested. I doubt I can judge this sort of thing based merely on personal experience. An overwhelming majority of people I have spoken to offline have expressed to me negative opinions of Ann Coulter, ranging from the garden variety "she's right about some things but she's way over the top" to "she's an evil fascist b****", etc., etc. But perhaps I move in rarefied circles. Perhaps I have asked all the wrong people by sheer chance. Perhaps I have an unconscious talent for only asking people who dislike Ann Coulter. I'm willing to acknowledge all these possibilities. But the problem remains: how do we at this article figure out what the balance of opinion on Coulter is, and represent it proportionately? Aaagh!!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I can't keep up. This article has gone through roughly 50 edits a day for <b>weeks</b> now. It's too much to cope with. I previously had my hands full just reverting the jagoffs who thought it would be cute to insert "Ann Coulter is a C***". Then there are the editors who obstinately refuse to engage in any dialogue or collaboration unless you kick and scream and hold your breath (and revert). Then, you get a grudging and terse reply, and whee, they're back to the 30 edits in a row with practically no edit summaries! In particular, 136./84./whoever the hell he is today appears to have very little interest in debate or obtaining any consensus. No offense, Lou, because I think you're one of the saner and nicer people at this talk page, but you and him put together do not equal consensus.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm at my wit's end. There is a poisonous atmosphere at this article. There is not enough communication between editors, not enough collaboration, and <i>certainly not</i> very much in the way of consensus for many of the recent changes. And this isn't necessarily because all those changes are "bad"; hell, most of them would probably have consensus <i>if there was time to ask people what they thought</i>, or if anyone bothered to. I'm sure I would have agreed to quite a few of them if anyone had tried to persuade me. Most editors here, myself included, are reasonable and can be debated with and convinced of points. That sort of discussion is how we forge a consensus article out of our varying knowledge, experiences, and viewpoints. That's what Wikipedia is supposed to be about. But no, apparently no one can stand to wait around and TALK when there's reverting and blanking to be done. By definition you can't <i>know</i> whether an edit has consensus if you never bother to stop and ask anyone.</dd>

<dd><b>How I deal with it.</b> The biggest way I deal with it is to avoid making substantive edits myself. I just put out what I think are sound facts and well-grounded opinions, and hope that people agree. It's pretty hard to get agreement on the talk page, even to very uncontroversial proposals, but sometimes somebody will make a substantive and unreverted edit that seems to have considered my (hopefully) sound facts and well-grounded opinions.</dd>

<dd><b>Stupidity (IMHO).</b> My favorite stupid part of the article is the business about kente cloth (now titled Confederate flag, and not as stupid as it once was, but still reasonably stupid). When I first saw it, it presented a quote about "kinte cloth" in such a light to show Coulter as saying nasty things about Negroes (that racist b****!!!). One of my very first edits was to fix the red link by making it <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kente_cloth.html" title="Kente cloth">kente cloth</a> (Hey, not every encyclopeddia editer knows how to spel, expecially when dealing evenhandedly with a racist idiot like Ann Coulter!!!)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Later on, I looked at the reference, and found that it was a column about the Confederate flag. It argues (as I recall it) that the flag stands for a great many good and wonderful things, that its "racist" aspect is minor and pretty much made up, and that those who promote condemning it as a racist symbol are loony liberals full of hot air. The mention of kente cloth is just a small part of the column, used to illustrate liberal one-sidedness: <i>"if C.F. is demeaned by liberal loons because of its minor connection to slavery, why are they not also demeaning K.C., which has a similar connection to slavery? And even more, why are the same liberal loons promoting K.C. as a glorious symbol of historical pride?"</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, the kente example is trivial and not worth mentioning, unless of course, somebody wants to make Coulter into a racist by quoting her words out of context. (That context being a long column showing that liberals demean the Confederate flag on loony grounds that are full of hot air.)</dd>

<dd><b>Coulter on women.</b> On the women quotes, I acknowledge that you and your many acquaintances find them them outrageous and notable, and that you do so on grounds that are very important to each of you and all of you, and that you care very deeply about the subject at hand. But until I see a bunch of stuff showing that Congressmen denounced a group of Coulter anti-woman quotes, or that CNN did a show on Coulter's anti-woman side, or that credible people did some articles on it, or something similar, I'm not going to agree that they're notable enough to put in an encyclopedia article about her.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>She says a <i>lot</i> of outrageous stuff, and she's an equal opportunity offender, but IMHO, she mostly attacks/makes arguments against liberals and Democrats and their (according to her powerful, well-reasoned arguments) loony ideas and behavior. I keep wondering when <i>that</i> stuff, (the meat of her work), instead of her outrageous <i><a href="../../../o/b/i/Obiter_dicta.html" title="Obiter dicta">obiter dicta</a></i> will work its way into our encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also observe that the article is not in any way lacking examples of Coulter's polemical style. And I think that picking out 27 anti-ostrich quotes and putting them in a section on "Coulter on ostriches" would be something more than an effort to demonstrate her polemical style.</dd>

<p>This article is still riddled with POV potshots at Coulter. Editors who hate her feel the need to fill the article with comments or quotes they think make her look bad. But that is not what this article is for. It is to provide objecitve factual information in a neutral way. The article could be filled with comments in praise of Coulter just as easily as it could be filled with critiques. Sadly, those who hate her are way too excited about including the latter. As usual, despite her obvious popularity, some editors feel that the mainstream view is that she is a hated bitch and want the article to read that way. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.221.66.16.html" title="User:136.221.66.16">136.221.66.16</a></p>

<dd>Please don't try to paint yourself as guardian of neutrality. It's not convincing. A choice gem from today: <i>"a liberal fat comedian slings mud at her, so what? why should a bio include such trash?"</i> I dunno, maybe because Al Franken's criticism, in his book "Lies and the..." etc., has been widely published and read and is therefore <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notable</a></i>? You say our job is to provide objective factual information. That is what you have been <i>removing</i>, such as Franken's criticism (reported in as NPOV a manner as I've ever seen), the kente cloth furor that Lou went to the trouble to fix (and which IMO is one of the only reasonable things Coulter has ever said), and on and on.</dd>

<p>I don't really want to touch all this debate with a 20 foot pole, but I just thought that I'd point out that I removed the 'Coulter on Women' section recently, because it was only a collection of quotes, most of which were already on her <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter" rel="nofollow">Wikiquote article</a>. So I moved the one quote that wasn't to wikiquote and deleted the section. If you think you have something more to write on that topic, please do so, but also please do more than just citing a bunch of quotes that are better put elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 17:06, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The various topics covered in the next section (I called it "Other criticisms," but maybe there's something better) either do not represent <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversies</a>, or are maybe not highly notable, or both.</p>

I definitely do not EVER want to see the REAL Rush Limbaugh in a mini skirt (the goggles really will do nothing there)!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The lead paragraph</span></h2>
<p>I don't really love "controversial" in this paragraph. Although it DOES describe her, IMHO lead paragraphs in encyclopedias don't include adjectives like that. She's an "author," and that belongs in there. She's a "bestselling author," and that probably belongs in there, just because it focuses a little better on what kind of author she is. (Not "struggling," or "science fiction," or "academic," for example.) "Controversial," etc. comes out throughout the article, but maybe it could be explicitly covered in a mild, factual sentence or two immediately following the "Media career" heading.</p>
<p>I'd be VERY much in favor of removing "former litigator with the Center For Individual Rights" from this paragraph, too. Reasons: 1) Yes, I know it's an accurate statement, and it isn't unimportant, but it's not what she's noted for rignt now; it's a fairly minor chapter in her past. 2) It IS mentioned later on, in the "Education and early career" section of her Biography. It belongs there, and it's not notable enough also to be mentioned in the lead paragraph. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 20:50, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reading the lead paragraph again, I'm thinking that the rest of the paragraph adequately conveys the idea of "controversial" -- the stuff about polemecist, Moore, and Limbaugh do it pretty well, IMHO.

<dd>I agree with your second point but not your first. I think it's been adequately demonstrated that controversy has been foundational to her success and noteability. Maybe she is intelligent, persuasive, and original enough to have succeeded without courting controversy.

<dd>ElKev and LV -- I'm not saying it isn't warranted or isn't important -- it just seems that it's a bit unsuitable in the first sentence of an encyclopedia article. Most such sentences are dry and factual, no matter how heroic, evil, or controversial the subject. They just say "AAA is a B, C, and D." <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s first sentence doesn't mention home runs, for example. Also look at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>, and even <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a>. The first sentence is short and limited to basic facts. Then the other stuff is brought in.

<dd>Your proposal would seem to turn any article dealing with accusations into a repository for links, which is not what Wikipedia is about. Neutrality can still be achieved without whitewashing details, as long as due weight is considered. The answer is not to "NOT report the details of things like that" but to make sure each side is given a chance. Of course, we want to be smart about it and not write an article where 80% of Ann Coulter's life are these charges of plagiarism, especially when her publisher defended her. But 84's proposal and your approval of such is not the way to go. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 02:55, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Kizzle:</b> Thank you for the links. The controversies in Franken and Air America are kind of like those in the Coulter article's "Major controversies" section -- more or less thorough discussions of big deals, including both sides, written after the dust had settled.

<dd>You gave me what I asked for, but what I'm <i>really</i> looking for elsewhere is the focus on minor utterances or events, current and past, presented in a way that is negative to the subject of the article, and easily seen as being in the article <i>because</i> of their negativity. By "contemporary," I was trying to exclude scandals of the past like Watergate, ABSCAM, Lewinsky, Teapot Dome, etc. I refer you <b><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Duke_University_lacrosse_team_scandal_df81.html" title="2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal">here</a></b> for a notable contemporary scandal that is covered as it should be, IMHO: in a separate article, with lots of discussion, etc. Also see <b><a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html#Prescription_drug_addiction" title="Rush Limbaugh">here</a></b>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>Taking a look at the 'external links' section, we could probably trim these down a bit. I don't have a problem with the three links at the beginning, and the 'column archives' seems to be appropriate as well. But there seems to be a lot of stuff we possibly could trim up under the 'book reviews' and 'interviews' sections. Some of these could have something written up in the article and moved over to the 'references' section; like <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607070010" class="external text" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607070010" rel="nofollow">Flatulent Raccoon Theory</a> or <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" rel="nofollow">the fifth estate</a>. Others come from somewhat questionable sources (spinsanity.org, talkreason.org, countercurrents.org, crooksandliars.com). Not so sure that these follow <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 21:25, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you on the three links at the beginning and on the column archives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't find anything of merit in "Book reviews and criticism." If they're book reviews, they belong in the articles on her books. If the links say stuff like "screed" and "new low," readers might infer that this article fails to present a neutral point of view. All else I looked at was inappropriate to be referenced from an encyclopedia. (I didn't look at everything, though.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I only glanced at the "Interviews." Some of them might be useful for understanding Ann Coulter, but they don't seem to be of encyclopedia quality. Do other biographical articles include interviews?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also the section above "External links," called "Further reading," has nothing at all of merit. It deserves to die. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Liberal&#160;!= unreliable. Crooksandliars.com is mostly a repository for video links from news sources, so I'm not sure how that violates WP:RS. An attempt should be made to view the article and make sure it's not someone going "Ann Coulter sucks because she's a bitch", but rather "Ann Coulter's source on page 136 removes the context, here's her source with the context put in"... as long as the claims meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> I think the links should stay in. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No they should not, look @ Stephen King's page and other "notable" authors. They stick to official links. If you're going to have reviews and interviews, have 2 of each... from professional respected reviewers that give a "good review" and a "bad review" same with the interviews: from <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> - "For albums, movies, books: one or two links to professional reviews which express some sort of general sentiment." --<a href="../../../e/m/m/User%7EEmmSeeMusic_92a8.html" title="User:EmmSeeMusic">EmmSeeMusic</a> 00:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You do realize the policy refers to articles on <i>"albums, movies, books"</i> which is substantially different from articles on <i>authors</i> of these works. In addition, Stephen King is not as controversial as Coulter, nor are his works a) non-fiction or b) contain highly disputed assertions. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:12, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>More reason they shouldn't be there if they're just reviewing her as an author and not a specific work.

<dl>
<dd>Huh? I was responding to your assertion that "all the book reviews shouldn't be there." The policy you cited states no such thing, as it wouldn't make sense to limit one book review on an author's page who has multiple books. Secondly, the interviews do add something to the article that mere prose cannot, and is once again not prohibited by the policy you refer to. What links specifically are you talking about that link to "sub-par" websites? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would help <i>me,</i> and I'm sure it would help others, if editors would be more specific about what parts of Wikipedia policies they are talking about. Sometimes I can't follow what they are saying.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with those who don't want this article to include links to book reviews. Each of Ann Coulter's books has its own article, and the book review links should appear there, not in the article about the author. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> says, under OCCASIONALLY ACCEPTABLE LINKS, <i>For albums, movies, books: one or two links to professional reviews which express some sort of general sentiment.</i> This article isn't about a book. Neither are the links typically to "professional reviews" -- for the most part, they are links to opinion columns with strong anti-Coulter points of view, dedicated not to reviewing Coulter's books, but to bashing them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Under WHAT SHOULD BE LINKED TO, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> says <i>On articles with multiple points of view, a link to prominent sites dedicated to each, with a detailed explanation of each link. The number of links dedicated to one point of view should not overwhelm the number dedicated to any other.</i> The number of links dedictated to anti-Coulter points of view is six. The number dedicated to pro-Coulter points of view is two (maybe). Only one link has a detailed explanation, and that is to an anti-Coulter site. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For me, the bottom line of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> is that if there are external links, they should be small in number, directly applicable to the article, explained in detail, and balanced as to point of view. The links in this article do not comply with that. The effect, for me, is that in its choice of External Links, Wikipedia is presenting an anti-Coulter point of view. I say: <b>Be bold, Dr. Cash!</b> <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I agree, no book reviews. Pro or Con, they should all be on the actual books sites. It clutters the article and makes it look unprofessional when there's links to non-professional or sites. --<a href="../../../e/m/m/User%7EEmmSeeMusic_92a8.html" title="User:EmmSeeMusic">EmmSeeMusic</a> 16:24, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm fine with offshooting the links regarding specific books to their respective articles. However, it is incontravertible that Coulter's books have sections with citations that many view are taken out of context. Articles from sites like Spinsanity or CrooksaAndLiars.com, <b>as long as they meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></b>, should be in here somewhere, whether it is on the individual book pages or not. I'm not trying to deface Ann here for some personal satisfaction, as you can see I just wrote my proposal above giving credence to the publisher's defense of plagiarism charges. If the info in these articles do not belong in the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> (of which I still haven't seen a specific passage that applies, the first mention was about articles on books, the second mention simply <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begged the question</a> by stating "Those websites clearly do not meet the standards that the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> sets forth" without actually citing such policy) then they at least belong somewhere in the book articles, maybe a disputed section that talks about such allegations. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 17:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you think they have a place in Ann Coulter's Wiki page... OK, but I'm glad to see I am not the only one that would like all the reviews taken down. Maybe we can put it up for a vote? It shouldn't require a vote since I would think just by looking at the EL section people would realize that it's filled with useless links that have no place clutting this Wiki article. --<a href="../../../e/m/m/User%7EEmmSeeMusic_92a8.html" title="User:EmmSeeMusic">EmmSeeMusic</a> 18:08, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looks like somebody beat me to it to add something here. Anyway, I just removed the book reviews and interview sections, having moved several notable book review links to the book articles individual, and removing several others. As for the interview links, I removed all the interview links which were hosted on sites that did not belong to the interviewing organization itself, since this would be third-party information. For example, the link to the today show interview hosted on the drudgereport.com site, though drudge report is verifiable and reliable, the link itself said that the transcript was "rushed" and not complete. That left two links: The link to cbc.ca was just a video, and I couldn't see the value in it in relation to the article, and the link to the booknotes.org I moved to a reference.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Quotations section</span></h2>
<p>Someone removed the quotations section citing a discussion that took please in the archive. I have taken a look at that discussion and despite what this person may believe there was anything but consensus reached. As such I am renewing the discussion in the hope of achieving this goal. Quite simply these quotations, or soundbites are Coulter's trademark. Almost every media appearance involving her leads in with one of her intentionally massively over the top and completely outlandish statements. Whether it be about the 9/11 wives (or Jersey girls) <i>enjoying their husbands' deaths</i> or <i>bombing the NY Post building</i> or <i>Liberals being Goddless</i> and <i>worse than terroists</i>; she uses these statements for their shock value to gain more media attention. They are an integral part of Coulter's MO and I think that this article leaves a gapping whole in describing Coulter if left out. - <a href="../../../g/i/e/User%7EGIen_ba45.html" title="User:GIen">Gl<font color="green"><b>e</b></font>n</a> 15:41, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your input. I'm not sure how we'd work statements about Bill Clinton's mastabatory habits, or anorexics having/not having boyfriends into the article's content - yet its these exact kind of statements that get her into cable news shows or onto the front page of the political papers... she is so incredibly blatant in her use of such statements for publicity that they cannot <i>not</i> form part of her bio. I am curious, what harm do you think such a section causes? - <a href="../../../g/i/e/User%7EGIen_ba45.html" title="User:GIen">Gl<font color="green"><b>e</b></font>n</a> 15:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If these kinds of statements are indeed why she is famous then *that* fact needs to be cited. In the course of citing that it may be helpful or appropriate to also include some examples as those would surely also be in the cited source or directly referred to by the cited source. To otherwise state that "she's famous because of ___" is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> regardless of how obvious such a statement may seem to some people.</dd>
<dd>An entire section of quotations presented without context or explanation is a magnet for POV and OR since there must be justification (i.e. noteability) for their inclusion beyond the opinion of a Wikipedia editor. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 17:10, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It did take place (almost once a month for a year+ now), and almost every time most people have said that an indiscriminate list of quotations shouldn't be there. For awhile it was just trying to par the list down to a workable number (6 was the common suggestion), then we moved away from this unencyclopedic version, and started working the quotations into the body of the article. This helped with flow and style. It also helps prevent things from being taken out-of-context. See <a href="../../../q/u/o/Wikipedia%7EQuotations_1e4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Quotations">Wikipedia:Quotations</a> for a proposed guideline on this subject, and more discussion on why WP is NOT a random list of quotations (i.e. Wikiquote).

Again, I fail to see how we'd work subjects such as <i>Bill Clinton's mastabatory habits</i>, or <i>anorexics having/not having boyfriends</i> or her opinion that God gave us the earth for us <i>"to rape" into the article - yet, again, these are the EXACT types of sound bytes that get her into the news on a daily basis. She uses these outlandish little blurbs so blatantly that they are most definitely notable.

<dd>Her quotations are definitely one of Coulter's trademarks, so there's more than the usual justification for keeping some of them. But IMHO they need to be in the context of the discussion that prompted them. Usually, the quotations are just the exclamation point at the end of a discussion of something notable. I'm in favor of having just a few of them, carefully explained, and each instance presented from a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 16:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting. What is your response to my above point, that a discussion of the content of Coulter's polemics is noteworthy due to the fact that <i>she</i> is noteworthy due to her polemics?

<dd>She is primarily notable for her activities as an author and columnist. In that work, she uses her intellect and argumentative skills primarily to demonstrate the foibles (as she sees them) of liberals and Democrats. (There isn't much on that in the article, by the way.) Another aspect of her notability is her polemical nature, but as "flashy" as that is, it's not her main claim to fame (it's primarily a matter of style, not substance). She's something like <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Rodman_c3a9.html" title="Dennis Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrell_Owens_c693.html" title="Terrell Owens">Terrell Owens</a> in that respect -- many know them for their antics, but their real importance is as outstanding basketball players. IMHO, her WP article focuses mainly on her antics, and does so mainly by quoting harsh words from her critics. Some of this is fine, but there's too much negative stuff from her critics, and far too little about her substantive work. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I couldn't disagree with you stronger. She is known for her polemics, not her argumentative skills or intellect. People tune in to hear what she's going to say next, just like Howard Stern. She's a shock-jockette. She's right on par with Sean Hannity and Michael Moore, all notable for their extremism.

<dd>Lou, with all due respect, how do <i>you</i> know she <i>is</i> known for her arguments or intellect? Of course Wikipedia isn't the final source, but you're throwing that out there as if it were common fact. It could be the case (which I highly doubt), but you're using this unsupported justification as consideration for the article's organization. As for your playboy example, editorial quality is fine and dandy but if it didn't feature naked women, we would have no idea who Hugh Hefner is today, and the magazine would probably have gone out of business a while ago. Ann Coulter is known for her polemics, plain and simple. She's famous by her intellect the same way Howard Stern is famous for ground-breaking journalism. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It kind of IS a common fact. She writes bestselling books and a column that is featured in serious newspapers. Her writings make strong, reasoned arguments against liberals, Democrats, etc., and they hate it. It's what she does. She does it in an over-the-top manner, and that attracts a lot of attention. Just like the siren on that big red truck. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 02:04, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because Ann Coulter "writes bestselling books" and has "a column that is featured in serious newspapers" does not imply that she "makes strong, reasoned arguments against liberals, Democrats, etc., and they hate it." I hate Coulter not because she makes strong arguments against liberals, but because she's almost as sloppy as Michael Moore when it comes to fact-checking and using sources. Have you even read any of the citation-by-citation analysis done by several different groups, or is the content of their arguments automatically disqualified because they happen to be of the opposite political persuasion? Regardless, Dennis Rodman and Terrell Owens became famous because of their athletic ability, whereas the infamy came later. Coulter is famous <i>precisely</i> because of this infamy, and that is the reason she sells books just like Howard Stern, with his similar antics, causes hundreds of thousands of people to join Sirius Radio to hear what he'll say next (and not his journalistic integrity in doing the news). If you can't understand that sensationalism and extreme behavior sells, and that's the reason why both Howard Stern and Ann Coulter are famous, then I'm afraid we're at a fundamental disagremeent. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be especially happy to see the "Coulter on Arabs and Muslims" section go over to Wikiquote. These are some valuable and well-referenced quotations, but Arabs and Muslims are <b>not</b> a main theme of hers. Why would anyone collect them here? Bottom line: 1) Lists of quotations belong in Wikiquote, not Wikipedia. And 2) The Arab and Muslim quotes, individually and collectively, are not notable in the context of Coulter's biographical article. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Lists</i> of quotations belong in Wikiquote. Paragraphs that incorporate quotes into prose analyzing her viewpoints are salient to this article. This is the conclusion from a neverending debate that has been occuring for around 2 years now. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:38, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see your point. But Are you saying that by putting some paragraphs around the quotes in a list of anti-Arab, anti-Muslim quotes makes them suitable content for an article about Ann Coulter? That seems to be what has happened here, at least to a few of the quotes. I say again, Arabs and Muslims are NOT a major topic for Ann Coulter. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:49, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Two things to consider. First, given the body of work Coulter has written dealing with the Muslim population, I truly don't believe that these admittedly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim quotes are not representative of her general view or are taken out of context. If you can find some quotes akin to "Muslims people are great!" then by all means PLEASE add them in. Considerations for representativeness (is that word?) should trump a simple positive/negative weighing. The first post I ever made to Wikipedia almost 2 years ago was comparing Ann Coulter to Jack the Ripper by saying that an article on Jack the Ripper shouldn't omit some of its victims because it makes him look bad. While this analogy was rightly blasted as extreme to say the least, the point remains: call a spade a spade. Rather than asking yourself, "Does this make Ann Coulter look bad (or good)?", ask "Is this an accurate representation of what Coulter has said on the matter". While you have no reason to believe me, I'm really not trying to make her look bad (hell I hate the woman and I'll still defend her against what I think are trumped up plagiarism charges), I just think as a columnist and author, her views on subjects are noteworthy to potential readers, and that removing info not based upon accuracy but upon its positive or negative implications seems wrong. Second, the section on Arabs and Muslims as it stands is little more than words surrounding outright quotes. However, we have the option of either removing the section altogether because of this, or to strive towards better accompanying prose. For the reader's sake, I emplore we strive for the latter. As for your claim that "Arabs and Muslims are NOT a major topic for Ann Coulter", I must disagree, as in the world we live in post 9/11 (as a conservative, isn't that your line?&#160;;) ), the relationship between western and islamic cultures is tremendously significant, and Coulter hasn't exactly kept quiet on the matter. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gimme a break! ANN COULTER IS NOT ANY SORT OF NOTABLE VOICE ABOUT ARABS AND MUSLIMS. Her notable work is about LIBERALS and DEMOCRATS. (But you might not know it if you only read this article.) Yes, she has probably said maybe five or ten pages about Arabs and Muslims. Yes, its nature is to be negative and outspoken (as is much else that she says). Yes, one can quote it, reference it, and write some generalities to put it in some sort of context. One can even collect it all in one place to allow it to be carefully scrutinized. But none of it is notable in the context of her body of work, her mainstream activities, or anything else; it's just crap she said along the way. For example, her current book about liberals runs to 300+ pages, and it's about their "religion." If Islam is mentioned even once, it would be a surprise. (I read the book, and I don't remember seeing any mention of Arabs or Muslims, but of course I could have missed it.)</dd>

<dd>One effect of devoting huge amounts of an article to her outspoken negative <i><a href="../../../o/b/i/Obiter_dicta.html" title="Obiter dicta">obiter dicta</a></i> on Arabs and Muslims is to <b>unintentionally give the appearance</b> that the encyclopedia has a certain point of view about Ann Coulter. Specifically, readers could easily infer that the encyclopedia is trying to persuade them that Coulter is a racist and a bigot -- that anti-Arab, anti-Muslim sentiments are some sort of driving force in her work. "Well there are her words," says the encyclopedia from its possibly not-so-neutral point of view, "and look how very many of them there are!" (It's left for the reader to draw the inference of racism and bigotry, of course.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 05:35, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This conversation has gotten completely off topic. The question is: Should there be a quotations section in an encyclopedia article? Let's consider how many encyclopedias (real ones, not wiki) have quotation sections for people.....................................................................................<b>cricket chirp</b> ...........................................</p>
<p>And it's also not about whether what Ann Coulter says gives her fame or her intellect. There either should NOT be allowed quotation sections in articles or there SHOULD be allowed. Ann Coulter is an author. How many authors on wiki have their own quote sections?

<li>Coulter meant Canada <b>as a nation or people</b>, as in "10,000 Canadians volunteered"</li>
<li>Her critic interpreted her remark more narrowly, in the sense of <b>the national government</b></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on Arabs and Muslims</span></h2>
<p>There is a section on this in the Ann Coulter article. It is about as long as the combined sections on her Books and Columns(!). It consists of six quotations collected from various places, complete with eleven references and some attempts to put some of the quotes into the immediate context of the times and places they were made. I'm sure nobody did it on purpose, but this section <i>appears</i> to have been put into the article with the specific intent of defaming the author by painting her as a "racist" and a "bigot." There is no other reason for it to exist, or for it to be so huge. If it is a "perfect example" of anything, IMHO, it is a perfect example of how an encyclopedia can advance a non-neutral point of view while appearing to "follow the rules." Unintentionally, of course. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there anything in that section that is untrue? No, there is not (which means, by definition, it is not defamation). Then why does it make Ann Coulter look like a racist? Because she has said plenty of racist, bigotted things. So if that section of the article doesn't portray her in a good light, then she has no one to blame for htis but herself. By your own logic, it's defamation to collect all her anti-islam quotes in a single place. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 20:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Center for Individual Rights (CIR)</span></h2>
<p>About 50 words in her "Education and early legal career" are devoted to describing this organization:</p>

<p>This just popped up 5 minutes ago on AOL (undated, but this is the first I've seen it). Some sort of AOL book person did a three-page interview with Ann Coulter. It also has an unflattering picture.

<p>This article, and the discussion is a long, long way from being neutral. It's almost impossible to see an unbiased and objective profile of Ann Coulter in these pages.

<p>IMHO this is an improvement because it's shorter and more direct, especially in the first sentence. The words <i>syndicated, attorney, colleges,</i> and <i>national</i> are no longer in the lead, but they are well-covered later in the article. The Moore and Limbaugh stuff isn't highly encyclopedic, but it sums her up very nicely, IMHO. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 15:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I agree with an earlier editor who stated that "Rush," "Limbaugh," and "miniskirt" should never be in the same sentence, I think your rewrite is fine. The only slight hesitation I have is in the removal of "lawyer." If she doesn't define herself with that label, isn't viewed that way by others, and is not active in the profession then I see no problem with removing it for the sake of brevity. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 19:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Biography," etc.</span></h2>
<p>The heading "Biography" is misnamed, because it really only covers her life before her media career. The subheading "Education and early legal career" is descriptive, but it's kind of out of place under the not-so-descriptive "Biography" heading.</p>
<p>In looking around for a better way to head this material, I looked at several articles, including the one on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>. His life before he became famous is covered under the heading "Early life," and it weaves very well into the article. I think it would also do so here.</p>
<p>In the Ann Coulter article, I propose to rename the "Biography" heading as "Early life," and to delete the subheading "Education and early career." I believe that doing so will improve the flow of the article, especially its headings. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 15:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this bit on the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting_e994.html" title="Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting">FAIR</a> website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kurtz's account of a 1997 debate on MSNBC's NewsChat show (10/11/97), when Coulter was a paid MSNBC contributor. According to Kurtz (Washington Post, 10/16/98), "Coulter was debating a disabled Vietnam vet when she snapped: 'People like you caused us to lose that war.' (She says she didn't know the guest, appearing by satellite, was disabled.) That ended her MSNBC career." <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1124" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1124" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's notable because I always assumed she was deliberately dissing a disabled vet. As if to say she blamed <b>disabled Vietnam veterans</b> for losing the war - as opposed to blaming "people who express opinions like that" (whatever <i>that</i> was would be interesting to know, too).</p>
<p>A Wikipedia article about a controversial person is always better when the views of supporters (or fans) are balanced with the views of critics. Readers want to know WHY supporters endorse a public figure or their ideas - as well as why critics condemn them or their ideas. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 16:30, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some specific things here that IMHO cause people to see problems with the Coulter article are the use of the unencyclopedic word "fired," the invocation of a disabled veteran to inspire pity (a technique analyzed by Coulter in her recent book, and therefore probably familiar to many readers), and the inclusion of negative non-events like an editor "considering dropping Ann Coulter."</p>
<p>Please note the absence of similar things in the other articles cited, and, IMHO, in <i>most</i> other articles. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:48, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Note that I don't go claiming you have a crush on Coulter (even though you admitted it) or that she's the only (slightly) attractive conservative out there, or that you just like Coulter because conservatism today is falling apart due to it being hi-jacked by extremists and she makes you proud to be a conservative, or any other attempts to attack your motivations rather than your arguments when you insert such obvious peacock terms as "insightful and hard-hitting commentary".

<dd><b>kizzle: 1)</b> I try very hard to assume good faith, and I don't think that anything I've posted shows that I don't. Example: In "Coulter on Arabs &amp; Muslims" (above), I said <i>"appears"</i> and <i>"unintentionally"</i> to emphasize that I'm not throwing stones. Maybe I should have left them out. <b>2)</b> somebody else said the <i>"atheistic,"</i> stuff, not me. <b>3)</b> thanks for your opinions on conservatism, etc. <b>4)</b> I don't edit much for substance. But somebody had put "sarcastic" and "abrasive" in the lead (which IMHO is a bad place for colored words like that), and I felt the need to add some balance. I think the whole sentence is gone now, which is a big improvement. <b>5)</b> I call "editorial glee" as I see it. It seems as though there's delight on this page when another not-highly-notable Coulter quote, firing, etc. gets into the article. <b>6)</b> IMHO, there is quite a bit of unsuitable material in this article. When I carefully specify what it is and why I think it doesn't belong, not many respond to my reasons. Those who do say stuff like "she said it, didn't she?," and defend its truth. The truth is not an issue.

<dd>1) Assuming that your co-editors take "editorial glee" in quoting Coulter is lacking <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. 2) True, this message wasn't directed solely towards you. 3) Those <i>aren't</i> my opinions on conservatism, I was trying to come up with some juicy ad hominems to demonstrate my point. 4) Agreed. 5) It's both wrong and lacking <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to assume that because someone wants to add a Coulter quote, that they take pleasure in doing so in order to make Coulter look as bad as possible. This is the crux of the argument of my previous post. 6) Debates over encyclopedic appropriateness and selection of suitable material are commonplace, but accusing people of personal motivations to "get" Coulter because they disagree with you is wrong. I couldn't have said it better myself, Whether this stuff belongs in an encyclopedia, presented as it is, <i>is</i> the issue, <i>and not the suspected motivations ("editorial glee") of your co-editors.</i> Once again, I'm not out to get Coulter, I'm not jealous of Coulter, I don't have a secret crush on Coulter, I'm not intimidated by Coulter's arguments and thus want to make her look bad, I just think that this article would be better served by the inclusion of quotations worked into the prose of the article to demonstrate both her views and act as samples of her writing style. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 18:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>kizzle:</b> 1) I'm not assuming. I remember one editor saying "if it walks like a duck..." in some sort of gleeful context, and others that I can't cite right now. I will watch carefully for glee or its lack in the future. If I don't see any, I won't mention any. 2) OK. 3) On re-reading, I see it. 4) GMTA. 5) OK, but when I make specific arguments for removing some of this stuff, they are often answered with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw men</a> or other non-sequiturs. Maybe I'm not being clear enough. 6) While I believe I see a certain non-neutrality in this article, and while I think that for some reason many are blind to it, I try hard to avoid accusing anybody of anything, and I believe I succeed.

<dd>Lou, perhaps people are reading too much into it... the anon did not say whether these supposed "digs" were occurring on the article page or the talk page, so I assumed the anon meant actual instances of failure to maintain NPOV in the main article itself, which I don't see. It goes without mention that this talk page includes a lot of POV material from both sides (why, I seem to recall Lawyer2b mentioning here his desire to marry her&#160;;). As long as such material remains 1.) on the talk page and 2.) under control so it doesn't disrupt constructive discussion, I don't see how it's a problem. The anon still hasn't replied as to what these "digs" are in the main article, and I'm beginning to think that's because they're unable to actually prove it.

What I have heard people say is that reporting on such firings is not notable, or that NPOV Undue Weight is violated thereby. To my mind, this does not equate to a "dig". <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 04:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps the fact that <i>Godless</i> is #4 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/bestseller/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/bestseller/index.html" rel="nofollow">New York Times bestseller list</a> is a factor. Coulter has taken a potshot (no, it's more focused than that) against American Liberalism, and she got "the largest advance ever given to a conservative nonfiction author". So maybe Liberals are jealous? I daresay they bristle at having their atheistic outlook (and the ideas and policies which derive from this materialsm) held up for display and ridicule. "G</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on "Plagiarism and factual inaccuracy"</span></h2>
<p>A couple of anons have removed the following paragraph from the referenced section, citing "POV," but not explaining themselves. IMHO, it does not express any editorial point of view. It is a fair, properly sourced summary of some of the author's prior writings about factual inaccuracy, and it provides context and balance to the other material on the subject. It includes links to Wikipedia articles about the specific assertions she makes (except for the one on anorexia), so readers can draw their own conclusions about them (and about their citation here).</p>
<p>Most or all of the <i>other</i> Coulter quotes in the article are notable in great part because of their shocking nature (<i>e.g.,</i> the Philander Smith rat poison joke). This one is a serious comment about a serious matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Coulter’s book <i><a href="../../../l/i/b/Slander%7E_Liberal_Lies_About_the_American_Right_b25c.html" title="Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right">Slander</a>,</i> she wrote that "Books that become publishing scandals by virtue of phony research, invented facts, or apocryphal stories invariably grind political axes for the left. There may be publishing frauds that are apolitical, but it’s hard to think of a single hoax book written by a conservative." She goes on to discuss discredited books by highly praised liberal authors <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigoberta_Menchu_b7b8.html" title="Rigoberta Menchu">Rigoberta Menchu</a>, whose award-winning autobiography was to a great extent <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigoberta_Menchu_b7b8.html#Controversies_about_her_autobiography" title="Rigoberta Menchu">an invention</a>; <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_A._Bellesiles_7705.html" title="Michael A.

<p>I propose to put it back in, prefaced by the words "In 2002, Coulter herself wrote on the topic of factual inaccuracy," and less the part about Naomi Wolf and anorexia. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Polemical Style</span></h2>
<p>Coulter's ideas and arguments are often overshadowed by her over-the-top style, which is definitely one of her trademarks. To those who don't read her work, or who read it and react emotionally to it, her style is her <i>only</i> trademark. (It is as though <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> had the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coprolalia.html" title="Coprolalia">coprolalia</a> variety of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette%27s_Syndrome_bcac.html" title="Tourette's Syndrome">Tourette's Syndrome</a> -- it might be hard not to focus on his swearing.)</p>
<p>I'm thinking that we need a specific section on "Polemical style," where it can be discussed, where outside writings about it can be cited, etc. Right now, the discussion of her style is scattered throughout the article and, IMHO, often overshadows the substantive content of one section or another. The proposed section would allow a lot of this to be concentrated in one place.</p>
<p>I think the section should be either before or after "Religious views." <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:37, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can one simply think that Coulter's trademark is not presenting meaningful arguments or does that belief necessarily imply an emotional reaction or lack of reading if we disagree? Lou, if you do not think that Al Franken has a trademark of worthwhile ideas and arguments, does that necessarily mean that you haven't read it or that you just reacted emotionally to it rather than simply disagreeing with it?

<p>I have twice removed the following from the intro:</p>

<dd>"...and perhaps most famously as an "inconvenient <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitch.html" title="Bitch">bitch</a>" by chat show host <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Letterman_d46f.html" title="David Letterman">David Letterman</a>. <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/the-blog/2006/06/08/video-letterman-calls-coulter-a-bitch-who-should-be-fixed-up-with-oj/" class="external autonumber" title="http://hotair.com/archives/the-blog/2006/06/08/video-letterman-calls-coulter-a-bitch-who-should-be-fixed-up-with-oj/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, there is nothing supporting the phrase "most famously" in the cited source. Second, it's clear from the video that Letterman used the phrase "Inconvenient Bitch" not so much as a direct reference to Coulter (as in "She is an inconvenient bitch") but as a play on the title of Gore's movie "An Inconvenient Truth." To characterize it otherwise is misleading and dishonest. Finally, I don't think it really adds anything to the intro except length, something of which the intro certainly doesn't need more. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 02:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Certainly he was referring to Coulter. But it's also clear that the phrase was selected as a play on the Gore movie and not necessarily because Letterman truly feels that Coulter is, indeed, and inconvenient bitch. He's a comedian paid to make jokes and, I would argue, not particularly well known for the depth of his political or historical knowledge other than that necessary for his comedy. That someone would argue that a joke made in Letterman's Late Show monologue belongs in the introduction of an encyclopedic biography beggars belief. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 03:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>kizzle: Inserting the Letterman quote is done with what I would call "editorial glee."

<dd>You could be right, but I try to not guess my fellow co-editors motivations on the matter and simply discuss or revert if I disagree. For instance, I have advocated including information that puts Coulter in a negative light, I have been quite persistent about it, and while I think it might be notable, you do not. Does that make my actions fueled by "editorial glee"? My point was not that you were wrong, but to indulge ourselves in guessing motivations on the part of co-editors rather than the merits of their arguments (of which there exists absolutely none in the people who are trying to insert the Letterman quote in the beginning) leads us down a dark road. Is it fair for me to assume everytime we disagree that it's because you have a crush on Coulter?

<dd>My $0.02: I was never satisfied with the removal of the simple, one-word description "controversial" which used to be in the intro. It was simpler and far more NPOV than some of the stuff we have now, and if I remember correctly had pretty firm consensus. Even Coulter's supporters are willing to admit that she is indeed controversial, and sources describing her as such are dime a dozen. I say, kill off the Letterman quote, kill off the hyperbolic "Rush in a miniskirt", and go with a more NPOV "Coulter, a self-described polemecist (source) has been described as controversial (source)" etc. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 03:40, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I very strongly believe that encyclopedias do not use words like "controversial" in the lead paragraphs of articles about living human beings. I also believe that such words are infrequently, and very judiciously, used lower down in the body. If others believe differently, it would be very helpful to have some references to other articles. IMHO, the article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> has a suitable introductory section. So do <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maureen_Dowd_4b31.html" title="Maureen Dowd">Maureen Dowd</a>.

<dd>My 2 cents: I'd much rather have "controversial" applied to both Michael Moore and Ann Coulter than to neither. Why, Lou, do you believe "controversial" does not belong in the lead paras of an encyclopedia entry? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is more than a belief. It is, in my experience, a fact. The examples of controversial people other than Ann Coulter are typical examples of how controversial people are handled. If I am mistaken, I will be happy to be shown some examples. I can't find any, but some might possibly exist. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 05:59, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So it is a "fact" that "controversial" does not belong in the lead paras of an encyclopedia entry? That seems to me to fall under the classification of a belief or judgment rather than a statement of fact. I agree you've found a discrepancy between Ann Coulter being described as "controversial" while Moore is not. What you haven't refuted is why they shouldn't <i>both</i> be addressed as "controversial". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 06:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The point <b>is not</b> what we individually would <i>like,</i> though we are all free to <i>post</i> whatever we want to. The point <b>is</b> that this article seems to be different from others, in that editors infuse the notion of "controversial" all through it. They also like to include inflammatory quotations from the subject of the article.</p>
<p>These things just aren't done in encyclopedias. They aren't even done in <i>this</i> one, at least that I can see. (See all the many articles referenced above. Also see <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Springer_2f00.html" title="Jerry Springer">Jerry Springer</a>.) Some people <i>like</i> to put vandal-like words into articles, or to spray paint naughty words in schoolyards, or to shout insults at people in special education classes.

<dd>So according to your logic, saying Coulter is "controversial" is tantamount to "vandal-like words into articles, or to spray paint naughty words in schoolyards, or to shout insults at people in special education classes"? I think not. I must ask again for you to provide a justification beyond that of "It just isn't done", as it is almost <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begging the question</a> at this point. I'm all for describing Michael Moore, Al Franken, Malcolm X (as long as it was "controversial at the time", cause I don't think he's creates too much controversy these days) among others as controversial... while I didn't like Farenheit 9/11, I like Michael Moore as a person and I'll still describe him as controversial. Contrary to your assertion, it <i>is</i>, as editors of this article, what we would <i>like</i> to place in this article. Due to the way Wikipedia works, each page is written by a different group of editors, and thus uniformity is not its strong suit. It could be that there was never a discussion on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> about the word "controversial" in the lead, or that we think that their discussion's conclusion was wrong. Even still, a concensus on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> does not equate a concensus on <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>, which is why WikiProjects exist. Maybe you would like to start a WikiProject about the word "controversial" and whether it should be outlawed from any article's introductory paragraphs in order to establish such a precedent of uniformity that you may rely upon, but until then, citing other pages runs into the problem of what I just proposed: given the disparity, why can't we make both <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> <i>and</i> <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> say "controversial" in the lead? I'm sorry I must ask this again, but so far besides an incorrect use of precedent, you haven't stated why <i>on this page</i> (as well as possibly on the other pages you cited) it shouldn't be used in the lead paragraphs. As LV said, It's "simple, accurate, and verifiable." --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 18:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lou, I can't agree with this. You are equating good-faith POV disputes to bad-faith vandalism. Additionally, the article on Jerry Springer does not appear to be the bastion of clinicality you seem to think it is; it describes his show as a "tabloid talk show" in the very intro, a description that (while I feel is accurate) is certainly no less subjective than "controversial". <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 21:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This page is 240 KB long. The guideline recommends keeping them to under 32 KB, so people with certain browsers can edit them. I'm reluctant to make substantive edits, as they keep being reverted with unclear (to me) reasons. (For example that Coulter's remarks on domestic separatists belong with those on bombing the NYT because they are "coupled.") <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 08:31, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would recommend archiving sections 1-32 (so that the section on Religious Views would be first); sections 1-32 seem to have very little recent discussion, while Religious Views has a comment from a few days ago. I seriously doubt anyone would object to your archiving them. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 09:39, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the 32 KB limit is really for encyclopedia articles themselves, and doesn't really apply (or is not enforced quite as strictly) for talk pages. Anyway, we might still want to archive some of the sections of this talk page that aren't quite as controversial anymore and people aren't actively discussing. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 18:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Domestic separatists</span></h2>
<p>I removed the following section previously from 'other controversies', and nuking that section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Coulter has criticized the government's handling of radical <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separatism.html" title="Separatism">separatists</a>. She has described members of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidians_ac61.html" title="Branch Davidians">Branch Davidians</a> as, "harmless American citizens" despite their use of violence and <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup> after the bulk of the group was immolated in an <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> raid.

I don't think the 'other controversies' section would be good to bring back, though I also don't think that this particular incident is notable enough for 'notable controversies' either. It's just an example of one of the things she's made comments on in the past, and really isn't a major theme of hers, so I don't think it really belongs in the article.

<dd>The "Notable controversies" section came about to separate things that were truly notable and truly <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversial</a> from other things, like statements she made that some editor(s) didn't like. Every time she says something, or gets called a name, somebody wants to put it in the article. Some even want to put it in the lead (<i>e.g.,</i> Letterman/"bitch").

<dd>Yes, she herself said that that quote (Kill them, convert them, blah, blah, blah...) is a notable quote. I believe she compared it to Ozzy Osbourne and his bats.

<dd>Yes, I added that one. Don't know why it was removed, no one has replied to the several times I asked.

<p>I was the one that actually reverted the removal of it, though in reading a recent entry on our request for peer review, I'm thinking that the part about, "kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity," did cause a significant controversy, and is somewhat notable. However, the section as it currently stands is poorly written and really just a collection of quotes, so I am modifying my stance on this to that of a, "major rewrite," instead of deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 18:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

There, I made the point that the Arabs and Muslims section is longer than the entire sections on her books and columns. The responses were to the effect that "the material that is there is true," and "it doesn't matter that it's longer." 1) Yes, it's true. Nobody disputes that, and I didn't say it wasn't. But its size, emphasis and level of detail are out of proportion to its importance. 2) Yes, it DOES matter that the Arabs &amp; Muslims section is longer than the sections on her books and columns, but not to anyone who doesn't feel it does.</dd>

<dd>As far as the 'coulter on liberals and democrats' section, this section only contained one or two minor sentences on her thoughts related to liberals sexual freedoms and citing the 'anal fisting' thing. I didn't think this was notable enough for its own section, so I moved this up in the article ('media &amp; career: columns' section), to another article where it's talking about her being critical of liberals and democrats. Seems to me like her being critical of liberals is a major theme of hers in most topics, so a specific section on this is probably unnecessary. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 16:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've rewritten the 'coulter on arabs and muslims' section, focusing predominantly on her comments directly related to the aftermath of 9/11 and removing some quotes that did not seem to fit that topic, like the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Thomas_18d6.html" title="Helen Thomas">Helen Thomas</a> quote. I also removed the part about the Muhammed cartoon controversy (see below), which was really just a long quote by coulter that really wasn't directly related to 9/11.

<dd>I don't hate it being in there, but IMHO it's not important enough to waste the bandwidth on. I also don't like all the accusatory emphasis on "felonies." I'd cut this section off after the second paragraph. This is an encyclopedia, not a gossip column or an Ann Coulter blog.

<p>Okay, so I've been gone for a little while doing my own thing, and today is the first day I've had a chance to look at this article in a long time.

<dd>GMTA. I've been thinking about the first one or two paragraphs, and I didn't like the two "polemicals" or the Rush Limbaugh stuff. (The paragraph isn't bad, but it can be better.) I'm going to try something along the lines of "Ann Coulter is an American.... She's known for her opposition to .... Her sytle is...." I think all that can be done in two or three sentences, to have it end up like the first paragraph of Michael Moore.

<dd>I agree. The president of her syndicator had a very astute point when he said something to the effect that there are only a certain amount of ways to rewrite a short sentence.

<dd>Coulter's comments regarding publishing scandals being a left-of-center phenomenon are indeed irrelevant to the question as to whether she did plagiarize.

<p>The reason they should not be included is that there are already 50% more words in the 3 preceding paragraph defending Coulter, stating her own position and refuting her critics than words on the charges. The section is too long.

<dd>I think Coulter's opinion on factual inaccuracies in published books is notable, especially in a section regarding her books' supposed factual inaccuracies. I also disagree that the section is too long. That there are 50% more words defending Coulter alludes more to the lack of detail the article provides to the charges against her. As a huge Coulter fan, I personally think the substance of the plagiarism charges should be expanded in the article. Why don't you add some specific examples? &#160;:-) <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 16:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's not that "blabs" are unwelcome in an encyclopedia, it's that they generally are not notable, but there are some exceptions, of which the appropriateness of these exceptions in an encyclopedia is directly correlated to the amount of news cycles and popular references they receive beyond the original mention.

<dd>Wasn't that particular "blab" uttered during his deposition and while under oath? Or am I misremembering it...?

<dd>So, we're talking about the Bill Clinton section of the "Notable Controversies" section, right? That I can understand removing. <i>But it would help if there was clarification at the top of this Talk section.</i> The whole time reading I was thinking about the Paula Jones controversy (which absolutely deserves to stay in). Her talk against Clinton is definitely frequent and substantial (it's what helped to launch her career), but couldn't there just be a mention of her disgust of him somewhere else in the article?

<dd><i>Following on the heels of daily papers in Augusta, Ga., and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a weekly in Greensboro, N.C., has decided to drop Ann Coulter's regular column, distributed by Universal. "Yes! Weekly", which has carried the conservative firebrand since last August, announced the move after polling its readers, among other considerations. She will be replaced by another conservative, William F. Buckley. This follows the pattern at the other papers that had dropped Coulter, where she was replaced by conservatives Michelle Malkin in one case, David Limbaugh in the other.</i> - <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002912730" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002912730" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>

<dd>Augusta's explanation - <i>"In the end, we've reluctantly decided Ms. Coulter's incisive writing, laser-like perceptiveness, quick wit and devastating logic have been overshadowed, and that she has lost her effectiveness as a conservative standard-bearer. "As of today, we're opting to go with Michelle Malkin, one of the most articulate and exciting young conservative voices out there today. "Ann Coulter has long been known for her acid tongue. But much of the hand-wringing by her critics has been, and still is, the result of the fact that she is ruthless in pointing out their hypocrisy and flawed thinking. "But biting commentary is one thing. A personal attack is another -- such as when she slammed several 9-11 widows for backing Democrats and allegedly milking the tragedy for political purposes. That charge alone isn't necessarily unfair, but to suggest they were 'enjoying' their husbands' deaths and calling them 'witches' -- well, that's where stridency crosses a line. "Moreover, in the weeks since, Coulter herself had become the issue, rather than the topics she was writing about, which is an unhealthy circumstance for a journalist, even a columnist. "This editorial page stands for many things, and we make no bones about it. But one of the things we stand for is civility. Pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around. But you've got to stand by your principles, even -- especially -- when it's painful."</i> - <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002912730" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002912730" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></dd>

But there are, of course, other ground to oppose adding or retaining material in an article.</dd>
<dd>And you're right - it's a duplication of an earlier section anyway.

<dd>Well call me a stickler for the rules, but if the rule states that "Unsourced or poorly sourced negative material" should be immediately removed, and a quality source is found for the disputed passage, it would seem that the passage could be reinserted as the rule no longer covers it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problem with "Losing Syndication" examples</span></h2>
<p>I've got a problem with 2 of the 3 examples listed in Coulter's "Losing Syndication" section. The first one, regarding her assignment at USA Today to cover the 2004 Democratic Convention, I removed because it contained no mention of her syndicated column being dropped; just her assignment. The second one I believe is not appropriate for the section, and perhaps the article. To me, a section entitled "Losing Syndication" implies either <b>a)</b> there was a time period (perhaps even presently ongoing) during which she lost syndication at a higher rate than during other time periods or <b>b)</b> that Coulter has been "losing syndication" as a general pattern over a long period of time. The incident where her column was dropped by National Review is listed as an isolated incident occurring in 2001. The next examples of her "losing syndication" are in 2005 -- four years later. The section pretty much needs (and it makes sense to include ) those 2005 examples, especially since they were described by a source as a "pattern". I feel the National Review example should be removed, because it doesn't fit in with describing situation <b>a)</b> or <b>b)</b>. This section's purpose should not be to "list every instance Coulter's article was dropped"; unless we want to change its title. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 04:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do <b>not</b> remove any of those examples, as they are all 100% accurate, 100% well documented, 100% noteworty, and 100% relevant to the article as it was part of her profession, not part of her personal life. As the Wikipedian who organized the section "loosing syndication", I hereby invite you to propose a different name if you do not like the name I gave the section. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 04:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your discussing the matter. <b>1)</b> In your edit summary, you argue that since that Coulter was not employed by USA Today at the time her assignment was cancelled, she was doing "syndication work". I'm not a reporter, but I would be shocked to hear that a <b>single</b> assignment to cover a week-long event for a <b>single</b> newspaper is considered "syndication". Syndication in journalism, as I have always seen the term used, is licensing articles for use in multiple publications and is normally a long-term on-going relationship. Opinions? <b>2)</b> I am not disputing the examples' accuracies, I'm just not seeing the greater context in which you want to include them because its apparently not about noting her losing syndication. It seems like you want a section that simply lists all the times she lost work (single assignments and newspapers carrying her column) because she pissed people off. Is this correct? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 05:26, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From <a href="http://www.dictionary.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dictionary.com" rel="nofollow">dictionary.com</a>, Syndication means <i>To sell (a comic strip or column, for example) through a syndicate for simultaneous publication in newspapers or periodicals.</i> The definition does not indicate the quantity of newspapers or periodicals. Hence, one newspaper is also syndication (even if it is an <i>exclusive</i> syndication agreement). So long as she was not an employee, it was a syndication job. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 05:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know. Where I come from newspaper<b><u>s</u></b> and periodical<b><u>s</u></b> mean more than one. To interpret the way you want we should expect the definition to say "a syndicate for simultaneous publication in <b><u>a</u></b> newspaper or <b><u>a</u></b> periodical". Might I also bring your attention to dictionary.com's definition of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syndicate" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syndicate" rel="nofollow">syndicate</a>? <i>A company consisting of a number of separate newspapers; a newspaper chain.</i> You don't want to debate definitions with someone who's going to be a lawyer, now, do you?&#160;;-) <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 05:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess I am somewhat surprised that you are unable to answer your question, as the answer appears to me to be self evident. And the answer is ..... Basically all those examples show that Coulter is so far off the mainstream, and is so controversial, that newspapers and periodicals have been rejecting her columns. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 06:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now we're getting somewhere. <b>1)</b> I agree that Coulter is not mainstream and is <b>exceedingly</b> controversial, however, the reason I was unable to determine what your argument was is that, in my opinion (as stated above), it was mislabeled and you are diluting your evidence. (Boy, I'm sounding like a lawyer already, huh?) Your evidence seems to be the recent "pattern" of various newspapers of dropping her syndicated column. To mention, "oh yeah, and 4 years before this she got fired for not being professional", in my opinion, weakens it because someone who is "having their columns rejected" is not going to go for one year (let alone four) without rejection. You may be right, and she may be so far-out that she is being rejected for it, but I don't think a case can be made for that happening until recently. <b>2)</b> All this is moot, though, because isn't your conclusion (that all these examples point to a pattern of rejection) without a source <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">original research</a>? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 06:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>There is no <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">original research</a> in the article. Everything cited is well referenced and well documented.</li>
<li>I fail to see how does the fact that the pattern of being dropped has been going on for 5 years weakens anything. So what if there was one incident 5 years ago, another two years ago, and five more incidents this year? What exactly is the significance of the gaps?</li>

<dd>I understand why you might think #1, but you need to read the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:No_original_research#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:No_original_research#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" rel="nofollow">"synthesis of published material"</a> section of the "no original research policy". It specifically states, <i>Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C.</i> That is what it appears to me you are doing. A = Coulter was fired from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Review_fed9.html" title="The National Review">The National Review</a> in 2001. B = Coulter was dropped from a <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> assignment in 2004. Conclusion C = These two are part of a pattern of losing syndication mentioned in 2006. To make that argument (by including A + B in that section) I think you need a source linking A and B to your pattern. Also, I strongly think the entire section ought to lead with "<i>In July, 2006, Editor and Publisher described a "pattern" of newspapers replacing her column with that of other conservative columnists.</i>" Because it will make it more clear what the section is about. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 07:07, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lou, I can make a case that for a writer like Ann, all three incidents are notable; so what do you think about eliminating the separate "Losing Syndication" sub-section that implies they're all part of some larger "pattern" and simply incorporating the incidents in the section on her columns? Those examples could be introduced by something like, "<i>While no doubt a successful syndicated columnist, not all of Coulter's employers have been pleased with her performance.</i>" <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 16:08, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I hate "Me too" posts, it's rather difficult to measure consensus and opinion without them. So, in that spirit: I agree with Lawyer2b's point of view and almost all of his points. I do think that to isolate these particular incidents and present them out of context as evidence of widespread, falling readership or success is both POV and original research. These isolated incidents either need to be linked together with published, noteable sources that link them together as a trend or indication of a trend or presented in their proper context. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 19:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Earlier, someone proposed this material be moved out of this specific section and incorporated throughout the article in the appropriate sections. I can't seem to find the specific proposal right now, though (this is a busy Talk page!) but I suspect it was put forth by either Lou or Lawyer2b. I would also be amenable to adding more balanced material as proposed below by Ptkfgs. My objection is not that the material is included in the article but rather how it is included. I simply feel that the current method of inclusion attempts to link all of these incidents together to lead readers to a conclusion unsupported by any source. I understand your dislike of Coulter but I just don't think this is appropriate in an NPOV encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 20:08, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. The E&amp;P article does cite a trend of some sorts of 4 specific papers dropping Coulter after her plagiarism charges and Jersey Girl comments, but I feel we're just adding on top of that cited trend any time Coulter has been dropped from another paper. I personally believe that the section should be there, but that it should be limited to the trend E&amp;P identified, along with sticking with the theme of any other papers that dropped her at the same time either because of plagiarism charges or Jersey Girl comments, but to include stuff like the USA Today thing along with the NRO thing is just tacking on any paper removing her. The other alternative is not to phrase the section as if there's a rising tide of a Coulter backlash but rather show that Coulter has been dropped several times for her controversial writing style from various papers by focusing upon the reasons stated why she was dropped, and then make sure to provide balance by including that she still is nationally syndicated in numerous publications, and that the impact of these few papers dropping her is pretty low. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>It seems you object to having a section heading, as opposed to the wordings of the section heading. If you don't like the title wording, I've already said you can propose a different section title. My likeness or dislikeness of Ann Coulter is irrelevant. The only question is whether the article is POV.

<dd>Just to make sure, it sounds as if you think I suggested titling a section in the article "Original Research", which I did not. I’m not necessarily saying the section is POV, I’m actually not sure. What I think ElKevbo is agreeing with me about is that your listing the incidents in a separate sub-section appears to <u>present them as part of a pattern you concluded exists and for which you have no citable sources</u>; and that this is ‘’original research’’. As I mentioned before, I can see an argument that the incidents are notable and should be included in her article somehow but I think putting them in a separate section puts <i>inappropriate</i> emphasis on them as a group, which appears to be your intention to begin with. Would you be willing to compromise and simply integrate the sub-section into the section on her columns? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 20:21, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The discussion here seems to go in circles. I've already stated before that breaking a long section into sub-sections improves readability. It appears that nobody objects to the content, as everything is well referenced. It seems appropriate to lump all the incidents in which her columns have been dropped into one section, rather than scattering it throughout the article. Although other wikipedians have charged that the lumping is POV, none have been able to demonstrate why it is POV. Our job as Wikipedians is to present material in a readable manner. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 20:35, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really want to end this debate by stating that the subsection in question contains 458 words. This is long enough to be broken off into its own subsection. I can certainly understand that Coulter's fans are not happy to see all of Coulter's rejections being listed together, but that is an insufficient reason to not bracket all the information which is all inter-related into its own subsection. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 20:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Debate re-opened. That is entirely inappropriate because, in "lumping all the incidents in which her columns have been dropped into one section," you're implying a pattern where one might not exist. She's a nationally syndicated author with highly controversial views. No doubt there will be occasional newspapers that drop her columns here and there. The E&amp;P article, however, cites a pattern of such following the publication of Godless, which is why we had a sub-section in the first place. I actually don't necessarily care if it's this way or my other proposed alternative, as long as we provide balance by stating something along the lines that "Despite being dropped from these papers, Coulter remains a nationally syndicated author whose words appear in numerous publications" (specifics on her distribution would be even better). It's all about balance people! --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I like Kizzles "crack at it" better, but I still have a few problems with the section. Specifically, the USA Today article should be integrated into a different section as it has nothing to do with "syndication" (look up the word). She was contracted by <i>one paper</i> to write <i>one article</i> about <i>one specific event</i>. This is not syndication. Also the lead sentence is chaulk full of weasel words ("few", "various", etc.).

<p>my edit regarding the impact these incidents have not had on her popularity makes sens While I do not have an opinion on the specific construction of this section or what it should be named, I think there is merit to the inclusion of a description of how widely a syndicated columnist is syndicated.

<dd>First, two of the examples listed are not drops in <i>syndication</i>. The USA Today and National Review gigs were not examples of syndicated work. Second, ignoring that, the Shreveport Times did not drop her -- it only says they were considering it. Thirdly, and perhaps most important is the consideration of time. These six drops happened over a course of 5 years. While four happened since late 2005, as a group (which you really seem to like viewing them as) she's averaged once per year. In my book, that's occasional. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 21:26, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aww come on, people! Firstly, even if this section goes in the article, it doesn't belong in the "Notable Controversies" section. Her "unsubstantiated allegations" don't constitute a notable controversy. HOWEVER, her hatred of Clinton certainly deserves a mention, but not under a controversy section! How many people who say base and lewd things about Bush get a section called "unsubstantiated allegations against Bush" under a "Notable Controversy" section? There's an extensive Bill Clinton/Paula Jones section ALREADY in the article. If we wanna comment about Coulter's hatred of Clinton, do it there. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 17:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This 'unsubstantiated allegations against bill clinton' keeps getting re-added to the page, and I find it totally unacceptable. The section is nothing but a bunch of he said/she said quotes about Clinton and fags. Big f'ing deal! Maybe put a line or two about her hatred of Clinton (which sorta goes with her hatred of liberals, doesn't it?), but it is NOT a 'notable controversy'. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 17:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Plagiarism and Factual Accuracy Section"</span></h2>
<p>Isn't this section about allegations of plagiarism <i>against</i> Coulter? I'm all for balance, but that to me would be Coulter's response and/or her publisher's response to the charges of plagiarism against her rather than her making allegations against <i>other people</i>.

<dd>Encyclopedias do not include sections of material about allegations against the subjects of their articles. To do so promotes a negative point of view about the subject of the article.

Omitting the <i>fact</i> that there are allegations against the subject of an article in order to avoid negativity is <i>highly POV</i>. It is not the place of editors to protect subjects from possible negative reactions by selectively excluding facts. Proper NPOV requires that the fact of an allegation be reported accurately; it would be POV to issue a judgment about the allegation one way or the other. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 02:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I disagree with Lou regarding whether or not the encyclopedia should include allegations against the subjects of their articles, I feel that Coulter's views on "factual inaccuracies in published works" are notable, especially in a section regarding supposed factual innaccuraies of her work.

That being said, this section is for controversies <i>involving</i> Ann Coulter, and more specifically, this sub-section is for allegations of plagiarism and factual inaccuracy <i>against</i> Coulter, not her views on the matter. 3 paragraphs on people accusing her of plagiarism followed by 1 paragraph of her accusing random people of plagiarism (not even in defense of her plagiarism) just don't fit together. Balance is achieved by getting Coulter's side of the story on whether she plagiarized (or possibly her publisher's apt comments), not a nexis search for "plagiarism" within Coulter's works. I think this would benefit Coulter more, as achieving "balance" by adopting a "well they did it too!" defense is one of the most basic logical fallacies you can commit. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 22:39, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doc, can you point out the section in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that says Google searches are not acceptable as a source?

<dd>The immediate preceding post really answered your question. But the other reason that citing links to google searches in articles is that the google searches are too dynamic. For example, your google search for 'Ann Coulter' this week will very likely produce completely different links in the top 20 results than the same search next week, two weeks later, and even a year later. That's why you need to be more specific when you're citing sources. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 21:04, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My good doctor, I now see two questions and neither, IMHO, have been answered. To wit:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1)</b> What part of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states or implies a Google search is not allowed as a citation.</li>
<li><b>2)</b> Is a books.google.com search a valid citation?</li>
</ul>
<p>I disagree that the section even <i>implies</i> you have to read the books you find using a books.google.com search before you cite them. The policy states, "<i>When you use one of these services, be sure to gather all the information you can find by selecting links such as “About the Book.” You should be able to assemble a citation in exactly the same way you do with a print publication.</i> It don't say nuthin' 'bout no readin'. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 21:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would also add, that the "top 20 results" for a google search changing every week is germane only insomuch as the fact being supported requires it to be <i>in the top 20</i>. The results of a google search can change and still be supportive of fact, q.v. Coulter and "queen of mean". <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 21:35, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is not the right policy to cite or use here. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a more useful policy in this circumstance. A Google search is simply not (always) repeatable and thus not verifiable.

First of all, if you're linking to a Today Show interview, linking to a third-party site with a copy of the interview would not be ideal -- it would be better to link to the actual Today Show website with a copy of the interview.

Anyway if anyone wants any practice at wikiediting, here's something to challenge your skills! 216.165.199.50 02:48, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One resolution to this problem would be to not mention the petition against Coulter from Media Matters. Until it actually is shown to be effective, it is sort of irrelevant. For example, there is no mention of Bill O'Reilly's boycott of France on Wiki's France page, because it has had no effect and is irrelevant to the topic. That sentence seems like a POV pumping up of Media Matters. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 22:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mention of the petition simply does not belong in an encyclopedia, so I reverted again. The reverter did not establish consensus on this talk page. As far as the media matters reference, it simply doesn't add anything to the section, nothing new at least. The topic is covered quite well enough, and media matters is just, IMHO, beating a dead horse on this.

<dd>The MM link has NOTHING to do with their petition. It has documented each and every Coulter appearance, along with video clips, and transcripts citing factual errors and flat out lies spewed by Coulter. Al Fanken has the same thing. Just because you put, "linkspam" doesn't mean that only neutral Coulter sites can be posted. Coulter makes a lot of ridiculous and malicious claims. MM is the most comprehensive and thorough web site out there. Coulter is in the same category as Jerry Falwell. Stewiegfan 15:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's be honest here, MMFA doesn't like Ann Coulter and will not give her the benefit of the doubt, whether she deserves it or not. This is a biographical article of Ann Coulter, so a site dedicated to exposing her as a liar, probably shouldn't be linked here. MMFA will not contain biographical information on her, and her factual errors and lies are already listed and cited elsewhere in the article. The external links should be to other cites that bio Coulter, MMFA doesn't fit the bill. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 20:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice try, but no. Jerry Falwell is the same. You will find all other entries for many others also contain links to sites that document people, even the ones they don't like. MM contains not only transcripts, but video. It doesn't matter if a site "likes" Coulter or not. She has made a ton of outrageous claims. MMFA has the most comprehensive, up-to-date entries on Coulter. The link will be staying.</dd>

<p>I don't (necessarily) object to the merge but I do object to the manner in which it was done. Isn't there supposed to be some discussion first?

<dd>I've seen discussion going the other way: if there's a lot of critical material about the subject of the article, it's best to put it in a separate article. I don't recall where I saw this right now, but it has something to do with biographies of living persons. I am NOT in favor of importing this critical material about Ann Coulter into her article. It has the effect of presenting the entire subject from a non-neutral point of view. This is amplified if it's done without significant discussion and consensus. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 20:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think I can address that concern. As I read Criticisms of Ann Coulter, everything is either something that is/was in the article (specifically, it looks like it was copied on Apr 1 2006) or is polemic (like calling her "<i>blatantly</i> racist", when it's a perfectly valid opinion that she's not racist at all, but rather just likes to annoy people by sounding racist). Therefore, there's very little that would survive the merge that wasn't on this page anyway. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">ē</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 20:39, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I support the <b>merge</b> proposition on its merits. It will take a good bit of work to merge the two articles and I suspect there will be quite a bit of work after the merge between authors who disagree but it's still a good idea.

<p>I agree that it should be <b>merged</b> (and <b>redirected</b>), but the manner in which it was done was poor. I also don't think we necessarily need a 'criticisms' section; much of the content can be merged into the 'notable controversies' section, and much more can probably just be removed as non-notable cruft,... <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 23:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think someone may have misread my quote, and did the merge too quickly. I was attempting to open discussion, if it had not previously taken place. There should have been a consensus reached first. However, it does appear that most of the stuff in the criticism article was here in some form already, so I think the merge could take place rather quickly. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 23:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ehh... I'm kinda with Lou on this one. Dumping that into here is going to tip the scales very much towards the anti-Coulter end. If we're going to keep the info, the existence of the article should be viewed as a daughter article and possibly combined with other info here rather than merged, as there is <i>definetely</i> enough controversies on here to warrant its own daughter article. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:19, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't support a dumping of the entire 'criticisms' article in here either for the reasons you stated. But I do think a good portion of the subject matter covered over there is already covered here, and with that being the case, there is no point to have that site stand on its own. Might as well just add it to the controversies section in brief.

<dd>I looked at the "criticisms article" again, and there's a lot of stuff there that is in the Coulter article or the articles on her books, or has been there and has been removed after discussion. A lot of it is poorly-written cruft, too. It's very hard to see the current Coulter article as written from a neutral point of view, and putting this stuff there would only make it harder. To see what I mean about point of view, go through the Coulter article and take note of the amount of material about her work (which, even though you may disagree with it, is serious, reasoned criticism of liberals, the NYT, etc.). Then take note about the amount of material about criticisms of her offhanded inflammatory comments. Then consider if you are reading something encyclopedic that is a balanced biography of a living person. (And please don't just conclude that if something can be sourced, it belongs in the article. Try to think beyond that. Take a look at the articles about other controversial people, and see if they are different in tone and content than this one. Look at <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Byrd_2e6a.html#Views_on_race_and_race_relations" title="Robert Byrd">Robert Byrd</a> for something with, IMHO, a balanced discussion of a potentially inflammatory subject.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I totally understand the POV/undue weight concern of the editors here. But I think it's generally agreed that a controversies section belongs in this biographical article. The repetitive stuff from the "criticisms" article, should be briefly and POV'ly (I made up a word) added here, if possible. The stuff that's poorly written can and will be fixed. The criticism of Treason and Slander should not go here, but into the articles of those books. ... I just thought of this... why don't we simply have a controversial quotes section and list her quotes without commentary. Although I agree that the BYrd page does an excellent job discussing the topic, the difference between Byrd and Coulter, is that Byrd's views on race where excellently tied into his role as a US Senator and his opposition to the appointment of Clarence Thomas which is closely related. Coulter is simply an author with a following. Technically, the article could do without a controversies section, but then it would be accused of being POV the other way. So in order to reach a consensus, why don't we simply make the controversies section, a quote repository with no comment. Let the reader's decide if the quotes are controversial or not. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 00:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Criticism is just that, criticism. Why wouldn't it be "critical" of Coutler? It sounds as if you only want a pro-Coulter page and that is not going to happen. The story about Coulter publishing the author's home phone number and e-mail address, to which resulted in the author being harrassed, needs to be published on here, but where? In the Criticism page. If you would like to clean up the Criticism section beforehand, I see no problem with that. But a criticism section IS going to be added. There is simply too much that doesn't fit into the other sections, and Coulter has made numerous statements that are flat out wrong. Coulter goes into the Jerry Falwell category of people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.32.20.145 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.32.20.145_ac03.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.32.20.145">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>IMHO, the Wikidifference between Byrd and Coulter is that this encyclopedia, through its editors, expresses the point of view that Coulter is a person whose legitimate views are not to be fairly presented, and who is to be, as much as possible, portrayed as an offensive person. When you look at articles on other controversial people, they are handled very differently from those on Ann Coulter and her books. Check out <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farrakhan_10e0.html" title="Louis Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>, for example. (The examples are given, not to invite comparisons of their subjects' roles in life and that of Ann Coulter, but to invite comparisons of Wikipedia's handling of Ann Coulter and other controversial people, in hope that editors might begin to handle Coulter as they routinely handle the others.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 00:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For some reason, the concensus of editors here feel there needs to be a criticism section (I don't necessarily agree but I don't want to rehash old fights) and if there is one here, then the other article should be merged into it, somehow. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 00:57, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I propose having the Ann Coulter article be about Ann Coulter, not about the well-sourced opinions of her targets, her critics, and those who would suppress her views. That requires a certain evenhandedness and a separation of the criticism from the material about Coulter. Many, but not all, editors are able to do that.</dd>

<dd>If there is a criticism section, shouldn't all the criticisms be moved there? In many articles, the pattern is A, criticism of A. Then B, criticism of B. Then C, criticism of C, etc., with care taken that the criticisms don't grossly outweigh the A, B, and C. (Alternatively, A, B, and C, then criticisms of A, B, and C, with similar care about weight.) If the criticisms become so heavy that they create a non-neutral point of view in the article, they can go into an article of their own.</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I think it's smarter to just create a criticism page and link to it. Coulter has stuck her nose and her mouth in many public figures and debates. When a person starts committing felonies, doesn't fact check, and makes outrageous statements, there deserves to be a criticism page to say exactly what the criticism is, and let people decide for themself. Controversies and criticisms are a bit different, in that, not all criticism has led to a paticular controversy per se. I believe that the current Controversy section is good on the main page since a lot of it is ongoing, and it talks about her books etc., and it seems pretty concise.

<dd>IMHO the notion that Coulter "doesn't fact check" is a result of the undue weight that Wikipedia gives to the viewpoints of her critics. People read those viewpoints and draw erroneous conclusions about the subject of the article. Coulter's book <i>Treason</i> contains 48 pages of endnotes, put there by an honors graduate of Michigan Law School. Generally speaking, they are rock solid backups for what is said in the book. Are there occasional errors? Of course. Are they quickly corrected? Yes. Do critics gleefully focus on minor errors in an effort to discredit her very solid work? IMHO they do, but you can judge for yourself. (And wouldn't it be nice if you could use Wikipedia to actually read about her work?) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 12:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seriously don't think that we want a 'criticism' section added to this article. The material from the criticisms article is really best merged with the 'notable controversies' section, which already covers many of her criticisms. Please remember, wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> anyone's personal soapbox, so if anyone is trying to make a point by adding info to wikipedia, please stop. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 03:37, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you read the Criticisms page, I'm here to tell you, it's not a soapbox. It's really too much to add to the controversy section as a whole, but the information is still valid. A link to the page, I still think, is in fact, valid. The section on the main page is "Notable" Controversies, which would be the "big ones", if we were to add all, we would have a 20 page document on here, which makes the Criticism page valid to have. Coulter's outrageousness sparks every other week. Stewiegfan 03:52, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, we should keep the criticisms page, clean it up, move all the criticisms and controversies there, then link to it from the main article. The main article should state that there are criticisms and controversies, should outline their general nature, then refer readers to the criticisms page to see the details. People could load up the criticisms article with whatever well-sourced material they want to. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 12:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've changed my original opinion based on the fact there does not seem to be a way to merge the articles without giving undue weight to one POV. As a compromise solution, I think Lou Sander's idea may be the way to go.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Religious Views</span></h2>
<p>Some anon keeps posting material about Coulter's criticism of evolution under this section. This stuff definitely doesn't belong in a section on Coulter's Religious views.

<dd>Now some non-anon has put it back in, marking it as a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Help%7EMinor_edit_e212.html" title="Help:Minor edit">minor edit</a>(!). Here is the questionable paragraph: <i>"In her book,</i> Godless<i>, Coulter claims that "there’s no physical evidence for <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>", and goes on to state there's "no proof in the scientist’s laboratory or the fossil record." Coulter's arguments against evolution do not appear to have any scientific basis <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter1.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter1.cfm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter2.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter2.cfm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The section in which it appears is about Coulter's Christian religious beliefs, which she openly states. The questionable material has nothing to do with her stated religious beliefs. It has to do with a claim made in a book (which has its own article, and seems to be a good place to discuss the claims made in it). The book is about the "religion" of liberals, which is a different thing than Coulter's religion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is very hard to see how a statement about weaknesses in scientific claims is part of the author's personal religious views, particularly when the book says little or nothing about her personal religious views.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Or maybe it isn't so hard. This paragraph also appears in the book: <i>"The single greatest victory of the Darwiniacs is in the realm of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a>, not science. They have persuaded the slumbering masses that anyone who questions the theory of evolution must do so out of religious fervor."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<p>Here's a draft: On August 25, on the Fox News Channel political commentary show Hannity &amp; Colmes, Ann Coulter contraversially asserted residents of New York City "would immediately surrender" if terrorists invaded their city. She had also written the comments in a collum: "As Republicans were saying repeatedly -- captured on Lexis-Nexis for a year before it showed up in a [Republican pollster] Frank Luntz talking-points memo in 2004 -- the savages have declared war, and it's far preferable to fight them in the streets of Baghdad than in the streets of New York (where the residents would immediately surrender)."(1)</p>

<dd>Is there any particular reason that this comment is notable? She says many things, and we can't really put all of them into her biographical article. It isn't suitable to do that, either. After all, this is an encyclopedia, not a gossip column or a historical record of everything a person says. If we put this comment in, we should provide the full context of the statement, plus several paragraphs to put it into the larger context of her life and work, as is done when the critical comments of others are posted.

<p>It's notable because of the notability of the preson who stated it and it's defamitory against a whole city's population in regards to what Establishment politicans talk about a great deal in the US: terrorism by Islamic fundementalists.

<dd>First, things are not notable just because a notable person says them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Buying her book</span></h2>
<p>This might be OT, but I went to the most Liberal part of New York City to buy her <i><a href="../../../g/o/d/Godless_%28Coulter%29_1930.html" title="Godless (Coulter)">Godless</a></i> book. It was at a sidewalk book-stand in the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_West_Side_4981.html" title="Upper West Side">Upper West Side</a>, where a man and woman were selling half-price hardcover political books. Of course, less than a handful of the titles on sale there were liberal - <i>Godless</i> was only there because it's a best-seller.</p>
<p>When I handed him my $15, he refused to meet my gaze and even seemed to step back a bit. He was literally in the gutter, and I had to lean over the table to get him to take my money.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that I've bought her book I intend to expand the <i>Godless</i> article and correct some of its errors.
