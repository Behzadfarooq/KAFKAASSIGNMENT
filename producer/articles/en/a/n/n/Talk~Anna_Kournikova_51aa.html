<p>"she is perhaps more famous for her beauty than for her tennis skills"</p>

 isn't this against NPOV or is it just a fact? Lenore 03:03, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't say it's either - it's actually quite a nonsensical statement when you think about it. <i>Within a tennis conext</i>, she's more famous than other female players of equal ability because she's more attractive than they are, but it's her tennis talent that first brought her into the public eye and gave her a platform to be noticed for her looks. For the above statement to make any sense, you'd have to prove that other women of equal attractiveness but with less tennis talent are equally famous, which is of course not true. Think about it this way - following the logic of the above statement, you could say "Michael Jackson is more famous for sleeping with little boys than for being a singer", based on the fact that his activities with young boys accounts for most of his current media coverage. But of course, his liking for young boys would not be talked about if he wasn't a famous singer. I've removed the above sentence. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalefire_eaed.html" title="User:Palefire">Palefire</a> 19:59, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sorry, Palefire, but that's sophistry. Of course it is a fact that Kournikova is far more famous for her appearance than her tennis accomplishments; how many female athletes who have never achieved a significant championship or milestone at the professional level have had a tenth of her publicity? Kournikova was a premier star at the junior level, but that has had no more import to her professional career than Ryan Leaf being a college star has had to his. It sounds more like you're trying to come up with reasons to discredit the obvious facts than to look at the facts and draw the obvious conclusions. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 12:42, Jul 29, 2005</p>

<dd>She's hot, so I will vote for the latter. She is certainly a beautiful girl, if I shall say so myself. :). It's not NPOV, because it is a fact. For Lord's sakes, she was mentioned in a commercial showcasing her beauty when a bunch of men, when hearing "Is that Anna Kournikova", they ran and trampled over each other to get to her; so it is very obvious her beauty had a lot to do with her success and her progressing in the industry. And to tell the truth, I don't give a hoot about tennis, I navigated to this page so I could get a picture, shows you how much people know about her beautiful appearance, doesn't it? I agree with RGTraylor. Oh yea, did I mention she is HOT!? She's certainly in my top 50 if not #1. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinneyboy90_f313.html" title="User:Kinneyboy90"><font color="blue">Эйрон</font> <font color="red">Кинни</font></a> 04:01, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Palefire about the statement "Gaining reknown more for her beauty than for her tennis skills." You can't disentangle the two factors and weigh them against each other; she is as famous as she is because of a synergetic interaction between her skills and her beauty. That's a philosophical point, though. More relevant in terms of wikipedia policy is that Palefire and I challenge the factual accuracy of the statement, therefore, by both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, it needs to be attributed to a reliable source, as in, "According to so-and-so, Kournikova is known more for..."

<p>This article contradicts itself in two spots. In "Tennis Career" it states that she has won "two Grand Slam doubles titles" but in "Trivia" it says she has "won 16 doubles WTA titles, including <b>3 Grand Slams</b>"</p>
<p>Also in "Tennis Career" it says "she only reached the finals four times in 130 singles tournaments" yet in "Finals" it says "Kournikova participated in three finals matches".</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Trivia and Finals sections are wrong; I'll go and make the edits. The WTA site has detailed information on Kournikova's senior career, down to every match she ever played, where, when, what ranking the tournaments had, and all the scores to boot. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:15, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't believe she played 130 professional single tournaments in her career, not with the amount of injuries she had. And why cancel the fact the she was injured?</p>
<dl>
<dd>What you believe is irrelevant, I'm afraid; the 130 singles tournament total comes from the WTA's own website, which as cited above has a comprehensive and searchable database listing results from every match and tournament every one of its players has ever played, and which is linked on the Wiki entry if you care to look it over. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 12:54, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the WTA website it is also stated that Kournikova spent three years in a row in the top-15 of the WTA tour ranking, which is quite a accomplishment, or that she won the Orange Bowl in 1995, THE world championships tournament for juniors. Yet you (RGTraynor) delete every post made on this. It's a fact on her career so post it. I don't know why you like to stress all the 'negative' parts of her career. Most of which are subjective views.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not a single one of which are subjective views. If you wanted my actual view (which is subjective) it is that Kournikova was an average singles' player who neither you nor anyone else would care about if she wasn't model-pretty; there are many other tennis players whose accomplishments dwarf hers with articles a fraction of the size of this one. (For instance, I rather doubt, without looking it up, that you have any notion who won said Orange Bowl -- which is <b>not</b>, in fact, "the" world champion tournament for juniors, but one of nine principal junior tournaments -- in 1994 or 1996, and I note that Kournikova's page is the only female tennis player's article to which you've contributed.) It is far from insignificant that the pictures of her that hit this article are invariably bikini shots as opposed to action pictures of her in matches. Are you this invested in Amelie Mauresmo's article? Jelena Dokic's? Martina Hingis'? All three are former junior world champions who have gone on to successful singles careers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the "Top Fifteen" deal you keep posting, that fails under Wikipedia's rules concerning neologisms. No one ever cites "top fifteens" - "top ten" lists are the standard in the sports world, but of course Kournikova only cracked the Top Ten once in her career, so in effect you've created an artificial threshold under which she qualifies and declared that a significant fact. There are few athletes who cannot be tricked out to be significant by means of similar and hitherto unrecognized constructions. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 23:10, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For your information: I know the champions of the Orange Bowl of 1994 and 1996, and the other years as well, doesn't matter however. Nowadays the Orange Bowl is one of nine GA tournaments. However, in the nineties the Orange Bowl was considered the world championship tournament. I never posted pictures here, by the way. I am not going by Anna's looks as you like to state. I'm a female (hetero) tennisfan and I just loved the way she played. You can read I assume: the WTA site posts top-15, it's a common tennis term, but apparently you don't know that either. I don't feel the need to contribute to any pages on Amelie, Jelena or Martina. The first two are boring players IMO and Martina's piece is actually quite ok. It just disturbes me that you consider Anna as an average player. It shows the lack of tennis knowledge you have. Not everyone knows the game, you certainly don't, but that doesn't mean you can write your subjective views on here. The frequent use of the word model and bikini in all your writings show your limited view.</p>

<dd>(shrugs) You're entitled to your (equally subjective) opinion, but in the sports world, how prettily you play matters a great deal less than whether you produce on the playing field. Kournikova never won a senior singles tournament and made the finals of only four. By contrast, "boring" Mauresmo has won nineteen singles titles -- and is the reigning WTA champion -- been a finalist in seventeen others, has over 400 career wins, and is ranked #3 in the world. That's in the Top Ten, by the bye; the <a href="http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com" class="external text" title="http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com" rel="nofollow">WTA site</a>) doesn't list fifteen singles players in the Top Ten ranking featured prominently on their front page. Mauresmo is, unfortunately, unlikely to win any modelling contracts in the foreseeable future. That being said, I'm sure there are many discussion forums and bulletin boards upon which you can debate Kournikova's merits as a singles' player, but their advocacy isn't pertinent here. In any event, a genuinely knowledgeable tennis fan familiar with the WTA site wouldn't have questioned whether Kournikova had played in 130 senior singles tournaments. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 21:41, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kournikova won 16 doubles tournaments and not 13. I don't know how to change it, can someone please do that ?

<p>"In a feature for Elle magazine's July 2005 issue, Kournikova stated that if she were 100% fit, she would like to come back and compete again."</p>
<p>She looks pretty fit to me!! <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamiancorrigan_d621.html" title="User:Damiancorrigan">Damiancorrigan</a> 14:18, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone think that the article should mention the Anna Kournikova computer virus, which spread around the globe through e-mail and would infect user's computers if they clicked on a link promising pictures of her? Obviously the virus maker had to choose someone with worldwide popularity, and their choice of Anna I think is significant.</p>

<p>Would the number of Google hits prove that she is/was the best-known woman tennis player in the world? Let's face it, anytime we say that something is the "best-known" in the world, we're at least verging on POV. (Is Christianity the world's best-known religion? Was John F. Kennedy the best-known U.S. President? Is Coca-Cola the world's best-known product? These are certainly the conventional wisdom, but all unprovable IMO, and probably Western-biased, as would the number of Google hits be.) This is not like we're talking about something <i>objective</i>, like whether Mt. Everest is the highest mountain on earth, or Russia the world's largest country in area. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 21:00, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
