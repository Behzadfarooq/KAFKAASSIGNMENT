This new <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">country</a> was to be a loose <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederation.html" title="Confederation">confederation</a> of two <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_%28non-sovereign%29.html" title="State (non-sovereign)">component states</a> – the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriot_State_cbe5.html" title="Greek Cypriot State">Greek Cypriot State</a> and the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish Cypriot State</a> – joined together by a minimal federal government apparatus.</p>
<p>This federal level, loosely based on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Switzerland_43aa.html" title="Politics of Switzerland">Swiss confederal model</a>, would have incorporated the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collective Presidential Council, made up of six voting members, allocated according to population (per present levels, four <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> and two <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriots_738d.html" title="Turkish Cypriots">Turkish Cypriots</a>), and selected and voted in by parliament. An additional three non-voting members would be assigned 2:1.</li>
<li>A President and Vice President, chosen by the Presidential Council from among its members, one from each community, to alternate in their functions every 20 months during the council's five-year term of office.</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> legislature:
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate.html" title="Senate">Senate</a> (upper house), with 48 members, divided 24:24 between the two communities.</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_of_Deputies_9cbe.html" title="Chamber of Deputies">Chamber of Deputies</a> (lower house), with 48 members, divided in proportion to the two communities' populations (with no fewer than 12 for the smaller community).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Supreme Court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot judges, plus three foreign judges; to be appointed by the Presidential Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan included a <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federal</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitution</a>, constitutions for each constituent state, a string of constitutional and federal laws, and a proposal for a United Cyprus Republic flag and a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a>. It also provided for a Reconciliation Commission to bring the two communities closer together and resolve outstanding disputes from the past.</p>
<p>It would also have established a limited <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_return.html" title="Right to return">right to return</a> between the territories of the two communities, and it would have allowed both <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> to maintain a permanent military presence on the island, albeit with large, phased reductions in troop numbers.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2002.html" title="January 2002">January 2002</a>, direct talks under the auspices of Kofi Annan began between the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidents_of_Cyprus_e5c3.html" title="Presidents of Cyprus">Republic of Cyprus President</a> <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glafcos_Clerides_2976.html" title="Glafcos Clerides">Glafcos Clerides</a> and Turkish Cypriot Leader <a href="../../../r/a/u/Rauf_Denkta%C5%9F_ef4c.html" title="Rauf Denktaş">Rauf Denktaş</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2002.html" title="November 2002">November 2002</a>, Kofi Annan released a comprehensive plan for the resolution of the Cyprus issue. It was revised in early December. In the lead up to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU)'s <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2002.html" title="December 2002">December 2002</a> Copenhagen Summit, intensive efforts were made to gain both sides' signatures to the document prior to a decision on the island's EU membership. Neither side agreed to sign. The EU invited the Republic of Cyprus to join on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">16 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>.</p>
<p>Following the Copenhagen Summit, the UN continued dialogue with the two sides with the goal of reaching a settlement prior to Cyprus's signature of the EU accession treaty on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">16 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. A third version of the Annan plan was put to the parties in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2003.html" title="February 2003">February 2003</a>. That same month the Annan again visited the island and asked that both leaders agree to put the plan to referendum in their respective communities. Also in February 2003, <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tassos_Papadopoulos_c1bc.html" title="Tassos Papadopoulos">Tassos Papadopoulos</a> was <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections_in_Cyprus_bc51.html" title="Elections in Cyprus">elected</a> as the fifth president of the Republic of Cyprus. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">10 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, this most recent phase of talks collapsed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hague_6158.html" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, when Denktaş told the Secretary-General he would not put the Annan Plan to <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2004.html" title="February 2004">February 2004</a>, Papadopoulos and Denktaş accepted Kofi Annan's invitation to resume negotiations on a settlement on the basis of the Annan plan. After meeting with Annan in New York, talks began on-island on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">19 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. The two community leaders, Rauf Denktaş and Tassos Papadopoulos, met nearly every day for negotiations facilitated by <a href="../../../%C3%A1/l/v/%C3%81lvaro_de_Soto_7f7f.html" title="Álvaro de Soto">Álvaro de Soto</a>, Secretary General's Special Adviser for Cyprus. In addition, numerous technical committees and subcommittees met in parallel in an effort to resolve outstanding issues. When this stage of the talks failed to reach an agreed settlement Rauf Denktaş refused to attend the next stage of meetings which were scheduled to take place in Bόrgenstock on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and sent the then prime minister <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmet_Ali_Talat_f1be.html" title="Mehmet Ali Talat">Mehmet Ali Talat</a> (who later became Denktaş' successor as President) and his son <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serdar_Denkta%C5%9F_09e1.html" title="Serdar Denktaş">Serdar Denktaş</a> (who later served as deputy prime minister). The talks collapsed and no negotiated agreement was reached by the two communities. Annan then stepped in as arbitrator and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">31 March</a> presented to the two sides a proposed final settlement. Rauf Denktaş rejected Annan's proposal immediately and Tassos Papadopoulos rejected the plan a week later while Mehmet Ali Talat supported it.</p>

<li>Reunification was desired for economic reasons.</li>
<li>Many Turkish Cypriots no longer perceived the Greek Cypriots as a threat, especially in the light of the strictly bi-zonal proposition of the Annan plan.</li>
<li>Turkish Cypriots would receive considerable constitutional power in the United Cyprus Republic that the Annan plan proposed, over-proportional to their percentage of the population.</li>
<li>The Turkish Cypriot component state would still, even after territorial cessation of some areas to the Greek Cypriot component state, make up 28.5 percent of the total area of Cyprus, including large economically important areas that were inhabitated exclusively by Greek Cypriots prior to the division of Cyprus in 1975.</li>
<li>The right of return of Greek Cypriots to their homes in the areas coming under the control of the Turkish Cypriot component state would be strictly limited if not, in some cases, forbidden, thus the possibility of Turkish Cypriots becoming a minority in their respective component state would not exist.</li>
<li>The guarantor powers to the constitution of Cyprus would retain their powers as such, thus Turkey would still have the arguable right to intervene in Cypriot affairs, most definitely on behalf of the Turkish Cypriots and vice versa.</li>

<li>The <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a> in Cyprus are Greek 77%, Turkish 18%, other 5% of the population. (2001) The Annan plan equates the representation of the two major ethnic groups in the proposed <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate.html" title="Senate">Senate</a> and in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> giving 50-50 representation to the two communities. The majority becomes a minority in important decision centres.</li>
<li>The plan created a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederation.html" title="Confederation">confederation</a> even though it utilized the term "<a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federation</a>" because there was no hierarchy of laws, while central authority emanated from the so-called component states. Note that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> abandoned its original <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederal.html" title="Confederal">confederal</a> structure because it was unworkable. In 1789, a <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_republic.html" title="Federal republic">federal</a> constitution was established containing a clear federal supremacy clause. The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot (77% of population) and Turkish Cypriot judges(18% of population), plus three <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_%28law%29.html" title="Alien (law)">foreign</a> judges; thus foreign actors would cast deciding votes.</li>
<li>The Plan did not include a settlement regarding the repatriation of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> settlers living on Greek Cypriot owned land in the '<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Cyprus_4e5f.html" title="Northern Cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a>', while after 19 years, the possibility of abolishing the derogation of 5% of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> and Turkish citizens who could settle in Cyprus, is obvious, and the danger of a permanent mass settling of Cyprus by Turkey is visible.</li>
<li>Nearly all the Turkish <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settler_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Settler (disambiguation)">settlers</a> would be granted <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship.html" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> or residence rights leading to citizenship. The central government would have limited control towards future Turkish <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_policy.html" title="Immigration policy">Immigration</a>. Those <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settler_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Settler (disambiguation)">settlers</a> opting to return to Turkey would be compensated by <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a>. Even though <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> systematically brought in the <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settler_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Settler (disambiguation)">settlers</a> to alter the demography of the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">island</a>, it had no responsibility for their <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repatriation.html" title="Repatriation">Repatriation</a>.</li>
<li>The Plan simply disregarded the plain language and clear meaning of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_def6.html" title="Geneva Convention">Geneva Convention</a> of 1949, section III, article 49, which prohibits <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonization.html" title="Colonization">colonization</a> by an <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_territories.html" title="Occupied territories">occupying power</a>. Article 49 states in its last paragraph: "The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies."</li>
<li>The Plan did not deal in full with the issue of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demilitarized_zone.html" title="Demilitarized zone">demilitarisationof</a> the illegal 'TRNC', and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> felt they had no reason to believe Turkish promises concerning the withdrawal of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops.html" title="Troops">troops</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> would be excluded from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy_e22d.html" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">European Common Defense and Foreign Policy</a>, while <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Armed_Forces_c1da.html" title="Turkish Armed Forces">Turkish troops</a> would remain in <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> even after the accession of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> to the <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a> with intervention rights, (a military <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion.html" title="Invasion">invasion</a> - occasionally used <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemistically</a>), in the future Greek Cypriot component state.</li>
<li>Many <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> interpreted the Right of Return policy as to be seriously flawed, meaning only 20% of Greek Cypriot refugees would be able to return over a time frame of 25 years, whereas <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriots_738d.html" title="Turkish Cypriots">Turkish Cypriots</a> would have had full right of return. The plan denied to all Cypriots rights enjoyed by all other <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union_6f1e.html" title="Citizenship of the European Union">EU citizens</a> (right of free movement and residence, the right to apply to work in any position (including national <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_service.html" title="Civil service">civil services</a>, the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_vote.html" title="Right to vote">right to vote</a>).</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriots_738d.html" title="Turkish Cypriots">Turkish Cypriots</a> would have gained all the basic demands it made, from the first day of the implementation of the solution. To be exact, 24 hours after the holding of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a>. In contrast, everything that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> were aspiring to achieve, would have postponed without guarantees and depend upon the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodwill.html" title="Goodwill">good will</a> of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> to fulfil the obligations it undertakes. They are also subject to the precondition that all would have gone well.</li>
<li>The return of the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_Territories_8ba2.html" title="Occupied Territories">Turkish occupied land</a> will take place in the period between three and a half months and three and a half years from the moment the solution is signed with no guarantees whatsoever that this shall be implemented.

<li>The Plan did not address the issue of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereign_Base_Area_0128.html" title="Sovereign Base Area">Sovereign Base Areas</a> (SBAs) on the island, although parts of the SBAs would be transferred to the governments of the two constituent states.</li>

<li>The plan absolved <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> of all responsibility for its <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus_7511.html" title="Turkish invasion of Cyprus">invasion of Cyprus</a> and its <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murders.html" title="Murders">murders</a> <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapes.html" title="Rapes">rapes</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mischief.html" title="Mischief">destruction of property</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churches.html" title="Churches">churches</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/o/Looting.html" title="Looting">looting</a> and forcing approximately 200,000 <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> from their homes and property. The <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Cyprus_fc28.html" title="Politics of Cyprus">Cyprus government</a> filed applications to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Commission_5611.html" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_bd4a.html" title="Human Rights">Human Rights</a> on September 17, 1974 and on March 21, 1975. The Commission issued its report on the charges made in the two applications on July 10, 1976. In it the Commission found <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> guilty of violating the following articles of the European Convention on Human Rights:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

</dl>

<dd>3.. Article 3 - by inhuman treatment of prisoners and persons detained;</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5.. Article 8 - by displacement of persons creating more than 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, and be refusing to allow the refugees to return to their homes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The plan failed to provide payment by Turkey:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1.. for the lives of innocent civilians killed by the Turkish army;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>2.. for the victims of rape by the Turkish army;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>3.. for the vast destruction of property and churches by the Turkish army; and</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4.. for the substantial looting by the Turkish army.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Plan subverted the property rights of the Greek Cypriots and other legal owners of property in the occupied area:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•by prohibiting recourse to European courts on property issues;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•by withdrawing all pending cases at the European Court of Human Rights and transferring them to local courts;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•by allowing Turkish Cypriots and illegal mainland <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turk</a> settlers/colonists to keep <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriot_0d12.html" title="Greek Cypriot">Greek Cypriot</a> homes and property they were illegally given following Turkey's invasion of Cyprus and not having to <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reimburse.html" title="Reimburse">reimburse</a> the rightful owners of the property for 30 years of illegal <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trespass.html" title="Trespass">use</a>;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•by a highly complicated, <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambiguous.html" title="Ambiguous">ambiguous</a> and uncertain regime for resolving property issues and which is based on the principle that real property owners can ultimately be forced to give up their property rights which would violate the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights_4a1c.html" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a>. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriot_0d12.html" title="Greek Cypriot">Greek Cypriot</a> property owners would have to be reimbursed by the to be federal treasury which would be <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funded.html" title="Funded">funded</a> overwhelmingly by the Greek Cypriots, meaning that Greek Cypriots would be reimbursing themselves.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Plan would have the effect of protecting those <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="British nationality law">British citizens</a> who illegally bought <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriot_0d12.html" title="Greek Cypriot">Greek Cypriot</a> property from <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settler_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Settler (disambiguation)">settlers</a> or persons who are not owners; in the occupied north of <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. They would, in effect, not be held responsible for their illegal action.</li>
<li>The cost of economic reunification would be borne by the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a>. The reunification cost has been estimated close to $20b</li>
<li>Following Annan 5 plan the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> would not have been allowed to make up more than 6% of the population in any single village in the Turkish controlled areas in the north thus they would have been prevented from setting up their own schools for their children and would not have even been able to give birth once this <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quota.html" title="Quota">quota</a> was reached.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to UN 260 resolution <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">Genocide</a> is: (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</p>
<ul>
<li>The agreement places time restrictions in the right of free, permanent installation of Greek Cypriots back to their homes and properties in the to be Turkish Cypriot state, which constitutes a deviation from the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union_6f1e.html" title="Citizenship of the European Union">European Union practices</a>. Those <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypriot_refugees.html" title="Cypriot refugees">Greek Cypriot refugees</a> that would return to their homes in regions under Turkish Cypriot administration would have no local <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, because the political representatives of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriot_d49d.html" title="Turkish Cypriot">Turkish Cypriot</a> state would be elected only from <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriots_738d.html" title="Turkish Cypriots">Turkish Cypriots</a>.</li>
<li>The functional weaknesses of the Plan endanger, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter_alia.html" title="Inter alia">inter alia</a>, the smooth activity and participation of <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, with one voice, in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>. While the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> have with many sacrifices achieved <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Accession_2003_e69e.html" title="Treaty of Accession 2003">Cyprus accession</a> to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriots_932a.html" title="Greek Cypriots">Greek Cypriots</a> could very easily be led to the <i>neutralization</i> of the accession until the adoption of all necessary <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal.html" title="Federal">federal</a> and regional legal measures or the loss of the benefits of the accession or the facing of obstacles in <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> participation in the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_9757.html" title="Economic and Monetary Union">Economic and Monetary Union</a> and other European institutions.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Cyprus_edb2.html" title="Economy of Cyprus">Economy of Cyprus</a> would have been separate with the plan. There will be no common <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary.html" title="Monetary">Monetary policy</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fiscal_policy.html" title="Fiscal policy">fiscal policy</a> and no investments by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Cypriot_0d12.html" title="Greek Cypriot">Greek Cypriot</a> businesses shall be allowed in the Turkish Cypriot constituent state.</li>

<p>Loukis Loukaides the Cypriot judge on the European Court of Human Rights, has since called on the Greek Cypriot political leaders to stop backing the Annan Plan as a basis for negotiations, because its basic philosophy violates fundamental human rights and the EU acquis. (Cyprus Weekly 15 April 2005)</p>
<p>He recommends the following action be taken:</p>
<p>1 - The drafting of an official information bulletin on the violation of the EU acquis by the Annan Plan.</p>
<p>2 - To declare clearly that the Plan is incompatible with the European Human Rights Charter and other International Human Rights Treaties, which are already binding on us and also as a result of our EU accession.</p>
<p>3 - To cease at last to refer to the Annan Plan as a basis for a settlement, or negotiations. So long as this continues, foreign officials and organisations that could assist us achieve a good settlement, will not do so.</p>
