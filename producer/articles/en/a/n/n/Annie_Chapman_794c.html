<p>As with other Ripper victims, there is some confusion about her personal details. "Dark Annie", as she was known, was 47 years old, in poor health and destitute at the time of her death. Her height was estimated at five <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_%28unit_of_length%29.html" title="Foot (unit of length)">feet</a> (1.52 <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">metres</a>).

<p>Chapman was born Eliza Ann Smith in September 1841. She was the daughter of George Smith of the 2nd Regiment <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Guards_ca91.html" title="Life Guards">Life Guards</a> and Ruth Chapman. Her parents did not marry until nearly six months after her birth, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_22.html" title="February 22">February 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>, in <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddington.html" title="Paddington">Paddington</a>, London. Smith was a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier.html" title="Soldier">soldier</a> at the time of his marriage, later becoming a <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_worker.html" title="Domestic worker">domestic servant</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a> Annie married her maternal relative John Chapman, a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coachman.html" title="Coachman">coachman</a>. For some years the couple lived at addresses in West London, and they had three children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emily Ruth Chapman, born in 1870.</li>
<li>Annie Georgina Chapman, born in 1873.</li>
<li>John Chapman, born in 1880.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1881 they moved to rural <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clewer.html" title="Clewer">Clewer</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, where John Chapman took a job as <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coachman.html" title="Coachman">coachman</a> to a farm <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailiff.html" title="Bailiff">bailiff</a>. But young John had been born disabled, while their firstborn, Emily Ruth, died of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Meningitis.html" title="Meningitis">meningitis</a> shortly after at the age of twelve. Due probably to stress caused by their children's misfortunes, both Annie and her husband took to heavy drinking and separated in either 1884 or 1885.</p>
<p>By the time of her death young John was said to be in the care of a charitable school and the surviving daughter Annie Georgina, then an <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent.html" title="Adolescent">adolescent</a>, traveling with a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circus.html" title="Circus">circus</a> in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Third_Republic_a254.html" title="French Third Republic">French Third Republic</a>.</p>

<p>Annie Chapman eventually moved to Whitechapel, where in 1886 she was living with a man who made wire <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sieve.html" title="Sieve">sieves</a>; she was often known as Annie "Sievey" or "Siffey". For three or four years she had been receiving an allowance of ten shillings a week from her husband, but at the end of 1886 payments stopped abruptly. On inquiring, she found her husband had died of alcohol-related causes. The sieve-maker left her soon after, possibly due to the cessation of her income. One of her friends later testified that Chapman became very depressed after this and went downhill.</p>
<p>By 1888 Chapman was living in common lodging houses in Whitechapel, occasionally in the company of Edward Stanley , a bricklayer's labourer, and earning some income from <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crochet.html" title="Crochet">crochet</a> work, making <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antimacassar.html" title="Antimacassar">antimacassars</a> and selling flowers, supplemented by casual prostitution. Acquaintances described her as a more accomplished woman than some in the area, and inoffensive, though she drank regularly and her health was failing.</p>
<p>A week or more before her death she was feeling ill after being bruised in a fight with Eliza Cooper, which was uncharacteristic for her. The two were reportedly rivals for the affections of Edward Stanley.</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight on the morning of her death, she, like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Ann_Nichols_6328.html" title="Mary Ann Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, found herself without money for her lodging and went out to earn some on the street. She was probably last seen alive by a woman who believed she saw Chapman in front of 29 Hanbury Street close to 5:30am, talking to a man who may well have been her killer.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Chapman_794c.html" title="Edit section: Discovery of her body">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Discovery of her body</span></h2>
<p>Chapman's body was discovered about 6:00 on the morning of Saturday, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">September 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, lying on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanbury_Street_6261.html" title="Hanbury Street">Hanbury Street</a>, Spitalfields. Her killing was very typical of Ripper murders and most similar to that of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_Eddowes_ca91.html" title="Catherine Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a> three weeks later.</p>
<p>The body was conveyed later that day to Whitechapel mortuary in the police ambulance by Sergeant <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Badham_5cb9.html" title="Edward Badham">Edward Badham</a>. Badham was the first to testify at the subsequent inquest on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">13 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. George Bagster Phillips describes the body of Annie Chapman as he saw it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street. This is inquest testimony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The left arm was placed across the left breast. The legs were drawn up, the feet resting on the ground, and the knees turned outwards. The face was swollen and turned on the right side. The tongue protruded between the front teeth, but not beyond the lips. The tongue was evidently much swollen. The front teeth were perfect as far as the first molar, top and bottom and very fine teeth they were. The body was terribly mutilated...the stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but was evidently commencing. He noticed that the throat was dissevered deeply; that the incision through the skin were jagged and reached right round the neck...On the wooden paling between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.</p>
<p>He should say that the instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge...he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence...of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive...</p>
<p>A handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning. He should say it was not tied on after the throat was cut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence indicated Chapman was killed around 5:30am, in daylight, in the enclosed back yard of a house occupied by seventeen people, some of whom were already up and about, with windows overlooking the yard, the only convenient escape route being the narrow passage through the building by which the workman discovering her body had entered the yard. Residents however had seen and heard nothing at the time of the murder.</p>
<p>Dr. George Bagster Phillips who examined the body concluded that her recent ill health was due to <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. Later researchers suggested that some of her health problems were the result of <a href="../../../s/y/p/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a>. Phillips concluded that the victim was sober at the time of death and had not consumed <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a> for at least some hours before it.</p>

<p>There are two front doors, one leading into a shop and the other, on the left, into a passageway which goes through the building and opens into the back yard. The door to the back yard swings to the outside from right to left and, when open, covers a small recess of the yard. It is a self closing door. Baxter refers to it as a swinging door. The back yard is separated from the adjoining yards by a five foot high wooden fence. There are three stone steps leading down to yard level. Looking from the top of the steps there is a small wood shed to the left, Annie's feet pointed directly at it. To the right is the Privy. The yard itself is a patch work of stone, grass and dirt.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Chapman_794c.html" title="Edit section: Funeral">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Funeral</span></h2>
<p>Annie Chapman was buried on Friday, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>.</p>
<p>At 7:00am, a hearse, supplied by a Hanbury Street undertaker, H. Smith, went to the Whitechapel Mortuary. Annie's body was placed in a black-draped elm coffin and was then driven to Harry Hawes, a Spitalfields undertaker who arranged the funeral, at 19 Hunt Street.</p>
<p>At 9:00am, the hearse (without mourning coaches) took Annie's body to City of London Cemetery (Little Ilford) at Manor Park Cemetery, Sebert Road, Forest Gate, London, E12, where she was buried at (public) grave 78, square 148.</p>
<p>Annie's relatives, who paid for the funeral, met the hearse at the cemetery, and, by request, kept the funeral a secret and were the only ones to attend.</p>
<p>The funeral of Annie Chapman took place early the morning before [14 September], the utmost secrecy having been observed, and none but the undertaker, police, and relatives of the deceased knew anything about the arrangements. Shortly after seven o'clock a hearse drew up outside the mortuary in Montague-street, and the body was quickly removed. At nine o'clock a start was made for Manor Park Cemetery. No coaches followed, as it was desired that public attention should not be attracted. Mr. Smith and other relatives met the body at the cemetery. The black-covered elm coffin bore the words "Annie Chapman, died Sept. 8, 1888, aged 48 years." (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Telegraph_eab7.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, page 3)</p>
<p>Chapman's grave no longer exists; it has since been buried over.</p>
