<p>Per the previous editor's request for a reason why the adjective was deleted: Conservative blogger? Moderate blogger? Liberal blogger? Legal blogger? Politics blogger? It seems to me that to call Althouse a conservative, still less a conservative blogger, is stretching the definition of the term unreasonably. If anything, the apt term would be a moderate blogger, which is a singularly ungainly term. Moreover, her blog is not even primarily focused on politics, which means that describing it with an explicitly political adjective would be missing the point <i>even if that adjective were applicable!</i> Ergo, it seems far more sensible to simply omit the adjective entirely, instead of getting into a protracted argument about what Althouse's politics are and what kind of blog it is. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 19:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is the wikipedia now to include any article about Tina the Goth Girl Live Journal and what she did today, what got pierced and who she fought with?</p>
<p>How is Ann Althouse different from Tina the Goth Girl who blogs at LiveJournal/MySpace/....?</p>
<p>I agree. UW-Law School has far more notable professors--Stewert Macaulay, Carin Clauss, Walter Dickey, Charles Irish, Frank Remington--that don't have entries. Professor Althouse doesn't have a wikipedia article based on her scholarship, she has one because she takes pictures of bratwurst and gave her car a name for some reason.

<p>It belongs ... and the "tiny piece" you left doesn't justify the hed. Althouse was attacked by LGF; she then inadvertently started another controversy with an offhand remark where she, not the left-wing bloggers, chose to pick the fight.</p>
<p>I'll admit it might have been too quotey but you need something to explain this section. How about one general "Controversy" section subdivided for LGF and Feminism?</p>
<p>And, since your user page indicates you are a law student at UWM, you should state for the record whether you are now or have been a student of Professor Althouse. NPOVing can come not just from what you put in but from what you leave out.

<li>Explain to me why a blogging fight of no particular consequence belongs in someone's bio? Especially one that I cannot imagine is of much general interst or one of questionable significance. Even if it did, surely it does not deserve 50% of the article.
<ul>
<li>I tend to agree with mmmbeer. I actually came here by accident and was surprised to find this information, so I thought I'd check the talk page. I'm surprised this isn't flagged as NPOV. It actually seems just plain useless. Sounds more like Daniel Case has an agenda than anything actually significant to contribute to this bio. 144.92.104.49 16:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think the whole issue goes to Althouse's credibility (i.e., whether, as it seems she did, she invented an issue to get upset about as a way to regain her conservative credibility. She would hardly be the only commentator of any ideological stripe to have done this). I am happy with what has been left here, but if, say, you check out the equivalent discussion of, say, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a>'s <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barebacking.html" title="Barebacking">barebacking</a> escapades, its relevance to his credibility is fairly assessed.</p>
<p>If you're going to complain that this doesn't belong in someone's bio, then expand the entry so that the bio is more complete and this can be placed in proper context. When you leave a page basically a stub for months at a time, you pretty much tell anyone here that anything else you add is relevant.</p>
<p>No, I didn't have any agenda. I began writing about this over at the <a href="../../../p/a/j/Pajamas_Media_76d9.html" title="Pajamas Media">Pajamas Media</a> entry and then realized it was more relevant over here. I now think it deserves a separate article, though why controversies about particular bloggers can't be accomodated within the articles about the bloggers themselves (consider that <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html#Dean_campaign_consultancy" title="Daily Kos">the dustup over Markos Koulitsa's work for the Dean campaign</a> is entirely contained within the article about his blog, and if that doesn't merit a separate article I certainly don't think this does).</p>
<p>However, I fully expect that if I take it separate, an AfD campaign will be started against it. Oh well. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 00:09, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alright, I give up. I just find it very funny that this evening, a user whose IP came back to Madison, WI, and has apparently never edited any articles here previously comes on, and after a bunch of edits to the section deletes it entirely. Coincidentally Althouse herself <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/11/whos-real-whore-here.html#comments" class="external text" title="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/11/whos-real-whore-here.html#comments" rel="nofollow">posted</a> about the Pajamas Media article today (it has actually been around for some time, as she might have discovered by checking its history page).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd take the complaints above more seriously if the revisions to the article since then had not been so uniformly favorable to Althouse. If I didn't have an agenda before, I have one now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Intellectual honesty is a law professor's stock in trade. I believe it's relevant to an encyclopedia article on one to note episodes where he or she seemed not to take that too seriously.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, it looks like either she or her fan base is going to keep her Wikipedia article short and innocuous. Therefore, I have reposted my near-final edit from last night as the <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Ann_Althouse" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Ann_Althouse" rel="nofollow">Ann Althouse article</a> at <a href="../../../d/k/o/DKosopedia_2838.html" title="DKosopedia">dKosopedia</a>, where I suppose most people here would say it belongs, and where I have taken some advantage of the less restrictive NPOV climate. Since so far Wikipedia articles do not generally link to other wikis' articles on the same subject, I have decided not to put it in external links. For now I am just satisified with the link here on this page.</dd>

<p>Hello wikiworld. I've just made some substantial edits to this page, and it's my first attempt on this scale, but I opted for boldness. FYI I have absolutely no dog in this fight, only yesterday having become aware of either the controversy or the various players. I've tried to stay faithful to NPOV, but welcome constructive oversight and suggestions. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickersnee_4420.html" title="User:Snickersnee">Snickersnee</a> 20:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

You edited my contribution. I thought you were almost painfully even-handed, while mine was not. I would have left the part about inviting readers to comment on the other blogger's body, because this and her loathing of Clinton and continued support of W do address the issue of her credibility as a moderate. But I think you really improved that entry so I won't tweak it further. Thanks for the improvement. ljean 22:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for saying that, I really appreciate your kindness. I realize I left out far more than I included, but it's a summary, and I thought it better to stick to the core issue of what caused the kerfuffle. I have my own ideas about what constitutes a "moderate", but I bet everyone else does too, and would rather avoid a wiki-war over a subsidiary issue which would drag on indefinitely. Also, Ann (sometimes) claims not to loathe Clinton, so then we'd have to go back and forth on that. I did leave in the focus on poor Ms. Valenti's tangibles, but only because it's directly on topic, and can't really be disputed. Even given my limited focus, I expect it to be challenged, and would rather keep it short and defensible, rather than extensive and rejected.<a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickersnee_4420.html" title="User:Snickersnee">Snickersnee</a> 00:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suppose it's become unavoidable that this issue will have to be included, at least for a while, but we might at least make some pretense about being balanced about the characterization of what happened. The previous version certainly was not that; with that said, since I find the reaction of the left to this entire "controversy" disingenuous, meretricious and louche, clearly I can't do that alone. I don't represent the present edit as being "complete," but rather as one suggestion of a possible compromise, and I'll leave it to other users to make further changes. What I would suggest, however, is that we try to work together (even if in a synthesis-antithesis process) to find a text that fairly and accurately represents what went on. I don't want this article to be a puff piece, but OTOH, what I'm <i>not</i> willing to accept is a plainly POV article which becomes yet another part of the leftosphere's smear attack against Althouse. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 01:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Simon replaced your article with one that was ever-sos-lightly hysterical, including things like "Several left wing bloggers attacked Althouse in increasingly bitter and hostile terms." I think that Simon needs to be blocked from editing this. Is there a mechanisms on wikipedia to request this? Because he removes anthing that is not completely unbiases. I admit my own entry was initially biased. Another person cleaned it up nicely. Then it became a 3x longer entry about "Ann as matry". Please, she is a senior tenured law professor who taunted a young blogger.</li>

<p>I added the POV tag to this entry. The "chief editor" of this page is "Simon Dodd". If you visit the Althouse blog comments, it can be seen that Simon shows up in almost every thread there, almost always to defend Althouse. At other blogs, people have wondered if Simon is an Althouse sock puppet. I don't believe so, but we do have a history of strange edits to this page from folks associated with Althouse. I believe that reviewing Simon's comments at althouse demonstrate that Simon should not be editing this page. Just reading the comments on this talk page, we can see Simon use phrases like "the left" in a POV manner. Simon self describes himself as a conservative, Simon comments at the Althouse page as a conservative and in frequent "battle" with leftists, Simon Dodd should not be editing this page. 130.76.64.14 02:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Welcome aboard, Quxxo. See my previous comment above, which <i>explicitly</i> invites Althouse's critics to edit this version and <i>acknowledges</i> that I can't create a balanced entry without their help, with the qualifier I don't expect this entry to take Ann's side, but I'm not willing to let this entry become part of the leftosphere's lynch mob against her. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 03:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Snickersee asked me, as a former editor of this page, to take a look at this controversy. I admit to probably being one of Anne's critics, but I learned a valuable lesson from the first edit war: Even if a blogger is notable, even if a controversy about a blogger's blog is notable, describe it in the most general terms. You don't need to include this level of blow-by-blow. All I think need to be mentioned is that Franke-Ruta confronted her on TV about the feministing controversy and then she walked out, with maybe any explanation she chose to offer. It would be better to go into such detail as the article currently does on a wiki devoted to blogs and bloggers. Not here.</p>
<p>The accusations against Simon Dodd are out of line. His user page doesn't seem to be that of a sockpuppet and he makes his potential biases pretty clear. Comments about him by others off-wiki are irrelevant to his behavior here, especially by unidentified people who seem not to understand how Wikipedia works.</p>

<dd>Daniel, I appreciate your comments, and naturally I agree - I don't know how I can make the point any clearer than I did upthread that I'm perfectly willing to work with critics to get a balanced and reasonable article. I don't want this page to be a puff piece for Althouse, but on the other hand, I'm not willing to let it be part of the smear attack on her. I think this article can be fair and neutral, and users will notice that I've not just reverted any and all attempts to insert material about the Valenti / Franke-Ruta spat. But what I do and will demand is that if the Valenti business has to be mentioned at all, it has to be dealt with in a contextualized and evenhanded manner. It isn't really enough to just link to the video, because POV can seep in through omission just as easily as it can through addition.</dd>
<dd>And y'know, if Althouse's critics want to have an entry that is mindlessly critical of her, they have an alternative venue: they're welcome to head over to Dkosopedia or wherever and write whatever poisonous decontextualized crap they want.</dd>
<dd>In any event, since most of the more egregious nonsense appears to be from purpose-created user accounts and anonymous users, I've filed for this page to be semi-protected, restricting edits to registered users with accounts older than five days, which I think will take a great deal of heat and vandalism out of this article. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 15:20, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As usual, Wikipedians are to be congratulated for giving a reasonably clear summary of a confusing series of events. I say that sincerely. But having now read the entry, I must now say...fer chrissake. This "controversy" is hugely overblown by those who care about it. It is a dustup involving obscure figures - I am a daily reader of several news sources, and I never heard of any of these people. I vote for sharply abbreviating this entry. Mrwriter 21:48, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, several people have now expressed that sentiment, and I also share it. I would appreciate very much if one of the several editors since my revision (perhaps Simon?) could point out what about my version was so painfully NPOV that it couldn't be salvaged without rendering the article overly-detailed and gossipy? At least mine was brief. I'd be sincerely indebted for the chance to improve the quality of my contributions. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickersnee_4420.html" title="User:Snickersnee">Snickersnee</a> 01:56, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really didn't have so much of an issue with your edit as surrounding edits, actually - yours fixed a couple of defects and didn't introduce anything massively troubling. I tend to agree with Mrwriter that this controversy is really fairly minor; my thinking, however, is that the less context one is aware of, the less this video is going to make sense. POV creeps in along several angles of attack, and omission is one of them. My own view is that a neutral recounting of the facts -- including all relevant context -- is sympathetic towards Althouse, but I know several others believe that a neutral recounting of the facts -- including all relevant context -- shows her to be, you know, whatever it is all these left wing bloggers want to say about her. But what we <i>all</i> ought to be able to agree on is that more facts and more context can't be a bad thing, as long as it's concisely written. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 04:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you claiming that Franke-Ruta was engaged in some sort of conspiracy with Valenti AND with Bob Wright to somehow bait Ann? And that this conspiracy required knowing that Ann would go ballistic over the use of the word "breast"? If that's your claim, where is your evidence. Wiki policy is no original research. This book stuff this baiting stuff is pure POV and not surprisingly, it was advanced by Simon at Althouse's blog today, and entered by Simon into the wiki entry today.</p>

<dd>If I really must respond to this bilge... As to your appeal to Wikipedia policy, that fails to survive scrutiny. "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true." See <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. Personally, I think that policy is spinach, but nevertheless, it has been accepted as "an official policy on the English Wikipedia." Ibid. The information added earlier is not only attributable, but attributed. Your claim that it isn't relevant might be reasonable if the entry for <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_2_2e7c.html" title="World War 2">World War 2</a> began "World War 2 began when the Allies declared war on Germany" - that would be false by omission of relevant context, such as Germany's actions before the allies' declaration of war (Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Rhineland, WW1, etc.). That is no less true here.</dd>
<dd>I can certainly see why you're anxious tokeep context out of this article's discussion of the diavlog, because the less context readers are aware of, the less they are likely to understand what actually happened. Nevertheless, POV can enter an article as effectively through ommision as it can through inclusion.</dd>
<dd>I don't know what they're putting in the water out there in Arizona, but you seem to be under the mistaken impression that this article either reflects your opinion, or it's POV. By contrast, I've repeatedly noted (and demonstrated in fact) that I'm happy to have this article include information I don't think should be in here, and even present alternative views, but what I won't accept is if it's an unvarnished smear piece. Go away and stay away. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 02:01, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is the relevance of that book to the bloggingheads issue? Are you saying that book was somehow important to the issue? If so, be specific, what are you saying is the relevance of the book to the issue? Referring to the book is your attempt at deflecting the responsibility of the blow up from Althouse to some unknown cabal trying to increase sales of the book. Cite that, or remove it. What is your claim with regards to the book. Isn't it the case that you and one or two other people in Althouse's forum are the only people making such a claim? How is the claim then, not original research, how is it documented, and how is it not your POV? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.39.78.68_3728.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.39.78.68">71.39.78.68</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.39.78.68.html" title="User talk:71.39.78.68">talk</a>) 17:11, 8 April 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Because there isn't an issue to address. See generally FRCP 12(b)(6). Your position is absurd, and doesn't even rise to meriting inclusion on the talk page, let alone a substantive response.
