<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie.html" title="Edit section: Act One">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act One</span></h3>
<p>Annie is an 11-year old (The part has been played by actresses with ages ranging from 8 to 20) orphan girl living in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Depression era</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. The play begins late one April night, when an <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphan.html" title="Orphan">orphan</a> girl named Molly is jolted awake by dreams of her parents. Annie shows the girl a note her parents left her in one half of a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a>-shaped <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locket.html" title="Locket">locket</a>, which promises that they will one day come get her <i>(Maybe)</i>.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Annie realizes that her "folks are never coming for [her]" and that she has to go find them. She decides to escape, but is quickly thwarted by Miss Hannigan, the cruel woman who owns the orphanage. The children are forced to clean the orphanage at this early hour <i>(It's the Hard Knock Life)</i>, though when Bundles McCloskey, the laundryman, comes to pick up the orphan's sheets, Annie escapes in a laundry basket, and the orphans celebrate her escape <i>(It's the Hard Knock Life - Reprise)</i>.</p>
<p>During her escape, Annie finds herself in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Mark%27s_Place_76ad.html" title="St. Mark's Place">St. Mark's Place</a> as city dogcatchers pursue stray dogs. Annie finds a sad-faced mutt who has been wandering alone. "They're after me, too," she tells the dog, and then assures him that "Everything's gonna be fine." <i>(Tomorrow)</i> Officer Ward of the NYPD suspects that Annie's dog is a stray, but she tells him that the dog is hers: "I call him Sandy because of his nice sandy color." Sandy responds to his new name when he is called by Annie, and Officer Ward is reluctantly persuaded that the dog indeed belongs to Annie.</p>
<p>Underneath the <a href="../../../5/9/t/59th_Street_Bridge_9db4.html" title="59th Street Bridge">59th Street Bridge</a>, Annie and Sandy meet a group of people living in a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooverville.html" title="Hooverville">Hooverville</a> <i>(We'd Like To Thank You Herbert Hoover)</i>. During a raid on the Hooverville, however, Annie loses track of Sandy, and is found by the police and is taken back to the orphanage where she is reprimanded by Miss Hannigan <i>(Little Girls)</i>. Mere minutes after Annie is returned to Hannigan, Grace Farrell, secretary to billionaire <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver__Daddy__Warbucks_e53f.html" title="Oliver &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks">Oliver Warbucks</a>, arrives at the orphanage. Warbucks wishes to have an orphan stay at his home for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> (reasons for the adoption vary from version to version, from the need for an <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir.html" title="Heir">heir</a> to a <a href="../../../p/r/_/PR_0fe7.html" title="PR">PR</a> stunt), so Annie is taken by Grace.</p>
<p>Though the servants at Starbucks' <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mansion.html" title="Mansion">mansion</a> welcome Annie warmly <i>(I Think I'm Gonna Like it Here)</i>, Warbucks is more hesitant to accept Annie. The two strengthen their bond during a trip to the <a href="../../../r/o/x/Roxy_Theater_15bf.html" title="Roxy Theater">Roxy</a> <i>(N.Y.C.)</i>, as well as other briefly mentioned trips. Warbucks quickly decides that he wishes to adopt Annie. Hannigan is clearly angered over this news, and with the help of her <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conman.html" title="Conman">conman</a> brother Rooster and his girlfriend Lily St. Regis, the three develop a plan to get rich off of Annie <i>(Easy Street)</i>.</p>
<p>To break the ice for a request for adoption, Warbucks buys Annie a new heart locket. <i>(Why Should I Change A Thing?)</i> When the girl approaches hysteria as he attempts to take the old locket off, Warbucks realizes that Annie still wishes to find her parents. He swears to Annie that he will find her mother and father <i>(You Won't Be An Orphan For Long)</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Act_Two" id="Act_Two"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie.html" title="Edit section: Act Two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act Two</span></h3>
<p>The pair go on a <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> show, and initiate a public plea for Annie's parents. Warbucks offers $50,000 to anyone who can prove that they are Annie's parents - or, whoever has the second half of the locket <i>(You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile)</i>. The radio broadcast is heard by the orphans <i>(You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile (Reprise)</i>, as well as Miss Hannigan. Rooster and Lily plan to pose as Annie's parents, and with Hannigan's knowledge of the second half of the locket, take the reward money and leave town <i>(Easy Street - Reprise)</i>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during a visit to the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>, Warbucks and Annie inspire <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> and his <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a> to introduce the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> platform <i>(Tomorrow - Cabinet Reprise)</i>. After a paper from the <a href="../../../f/2E/b/F.B.I._d754.html" title="F.B.I.">F.B.I.</a> shows that it will be impossible to trace Annie's parents through the locket - over 90,000 were made - and the 1,246 people claiming to be Annie's parents turn out to be liars, Warbucks decides to adopt Annie <i>(Something was Missing, I Don't Need Anything But You</i>).</p>
<p>During an improvised party celebrating the eve of Annie's adoption, Lily and Rooster enter disguised as "Ralph Mudge" and "Shirley Mudge", and claim to be Annie's parents. As the couple has a false <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_certificate.html" title="Birth certificate">birth certificate</a> and the other locket half, Warbucks begrudgingly accepts the two as Annie's parents. Warbucks invites the pair to come pick her up the next day, on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> morning.</p>
<p>Warbucks, and surprisingly Annie, are saddened over this turn of events <i>(Maybe - Reprise)</i>. New news from the F.B.I. is quickly received - Annie's real parents, David and Margaret Bennett, have died. Lily, Rooster, and their accomplice <b>Hannigan</b> are all arrested. The play ends with a full cast song <i>(New Deal for Christmas)</i>, the adoption of Annie by Warbucks, and the re-uniting of Sandy and Annie.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie.html" title="Edit section: National Touring Companies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">National Touring Companies</span></h3>
<p>During the Broadway run of "Annie," there were four touring companies that were launched from the original production to bring the to show to major U.S. cities.:</p>
<p>The 1st National Touring Company of <i>Annie</i> opened in Toronto in March of 1978 with Kathy-Jo Kelly in the title role. After playing a few more cities, it landed in Chicago where it played for 32 weeks before continuing on the road in April of 1979 with Mary K. Lombardi as Annie. In the fall of 1980, Theda Stemler took over the part and was replaced in Boston when she grew too old. On May 15, 1981, Louanne Sirota, who had played Annie in the long-running Los Angeles production (see below), took over the role for four months. In August of 1981, Becky Snyder became the company's last Annie, closing the tour on September 6, 1981.</p>
<p>The 2nd National Touring Company (sometimes referred to as the West Coast or Los Angeles Production) opened in San Francisco on June 22, 1978 with Patricia Ann Patts starring as Annie and the then-unknown <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molly_Ringwald_494c.html" title="Molly Ringwald">Molly Ringwald</a> playing one of the orphans. The show landed in Los Angeles on October 15, 1978 for an open-ended run at the Shubert Theatre. On June 12, 1979, Louanne took over the role from Patts and played out the rest of the year in L.A. before the show left to tour other cities. Marisa Morell took over the part in January of 1980 on the road and continued with the show for most of 1980. During this period <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyssa_Milano_53f3.html" title="Alyssa Milano">Alyssa Milano</a> joined the cast as one of the orphans. In December of 1980, Kristi Coombs replaced Morell and played Annie until this touring company closed in Philadelphia on January 23, 1982.</p>
<p>The 3rd National Touring Company of "Annie" was launched in Dallas on October 3, 1979 with Roseanne Sorrentino in the title role. This company toured to 23 cities playing mostly shorter runs of a month or less. On March 27, 1981, Bridget Walsh took over for Sorrentino. Becky Snyder (who had closed the 1st National Tour) joined this company in the summer of 1982 and stayed with it until it closed in September of that year.</p>
<p>The 4th National Touring Company of "Annie" opened on September 11, 1981 with Mollie Hall playing Annie. This production was a "bus and truck" tour, with a slightly reduced cast, that traveled the country often playing in two cities a week. This company was still touring when the original Broadway production closed in January 1983, making Kathleen Sisk the final performer to play Annie from the original production team. This final production closed in September of 1983.</p>

The original girl cast in the role, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Pacitti_b5df.html" title="Joanna Pacitti">Joanna Pacitti</a>, was fired and replaced by her understudy, Brittny Kissinger<a href="http://www.brittnykissinger.com/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brittnykissinger.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (who usually played July) while battling bronchitis in her hotel room, just two cities away from their Broadway debut.

This very public incident, coupled with the rather mixed reviews the new staging garnered, doomed it to a short run. After the short Broadway run, however, a moderately successful national tour was staged. The orphans on tour and during the Broadway run were played by Christiana Anbri, age 6, who played "Molly," Katherine Young, age six, who played "Kate," Lindsey Watkins, age 9, who played "Tessie," Mackenzie Rosen-Stone, age 9, who played "Duffy," Casey Tuma, age ten, replaced Kissinger as "July," and Cassidy Ladden, age eleven, who played "Pepper." Kissinger, then 8, became the youngest actress to ever play Annie on Broadway.</p>

<p>The film version, made in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> by <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, starred <a href="../../../a/i/l/Aileen_Quinn_9777.html" title="Aileen Quinn">Aileen Quinn</a> as Annie, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Finney_84fb.html" title="Albert Finney">Albert Finney</a> as Daddy Warbucks, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Burnett_bffe.html" title="Carol Burnett">Carol Burnett</a> as Miss Hannigan, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernadette_Peters_b813.html" title="Bernadette Peters">Bernadette Peters</a> as Lily, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Reinking_ea11.html" title="Ann Reinking">Ann Reinking</a> as Grace, and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Curry_ff85.html" title="Tim Curry">Tim Curry</a> as Rooster. The film also restored the characters of Warbucks' servants/bodyguards from the comic strip, Punjab and The Asp, Played by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Holder_e5ab.html" title="Geoffrey Holder">Geoffrey Holder</a> and Roger Minami respectively. It was directed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Huston_1c74.html" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>, his first and only film musical. The film's reviews ranged from positive to extremely hostile, and in spite of a $57 million US box office take (making it 10th highest grossing film of the year), the film still did not turn a profit on its theatrical release. An actress who played one of the orphan girls in the movie, Marta Marrero, later became a successful pop/dance singer as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martika.html" title="Martika">Martika</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the changes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The film featured four new songs, "Dumb Dog", "Let's Go to the Movies", "Sign" and "We Got Annie", and cut "We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover", "N.Y.C", "You Won't be an Orphan for long", "Something was Missing", "Annie" and "New Deal for Christmas". In addition, The song "Maybe" has 2 reprises while "Little Girls" and "Easy Street" do not.</li>
<li>In the stage play, Hannigan, Rooster and Lily are caught at the Warbucks estate, thus not kidnapping Annie. In this movie, she is kidnapped, leading to Warbucks organizing a city wide search. Eventually, Punjab and the Asp rescue Annie and return her safely at the end. Miss Hannigan also attempts to rescue Annie from being killed by Rooster, and is shown joining in the celebration at the end of the movie.</li>
<li>The scene used for the "Maybe" song was actually the last scene taped for the film, the reason being that the original opening was too long. Although the "Maybe" song was still used, Annie and Molly are sitting at the window; However, this scene was still inserted into the film, only the last part with the rest of the orphans singing, after the "Little Girls" scene, during Annie's first night at the Warbucks estate.</li>
<li>Punjab and The Asp are bought back for this film, although the characters are supporting roles.</li>
