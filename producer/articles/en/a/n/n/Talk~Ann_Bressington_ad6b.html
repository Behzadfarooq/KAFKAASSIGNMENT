<p>In an email from the SEO, I've been told "<span style="color:#666;">Ind Nick Xenophon No Pokies group polled 167 594 above the line ticket votes and 8 below the line = 167 602. Nick Z received 23 263 below the line first preferences , Bressington received 32 and Darley 61. Total first preferences = 190 958</span>". So I must correct where I wrote "barely over 200" to 32&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 07:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've heard that lots of candidates for upper houses don't get many "below the line" votes, including people from major political parties.

<dd>It's probably relevant insofar as that she was running as an independent (and thus making clear that she was elected on Xenophon's preferences instead of on her own back), but it's not a particularly big deal. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 05:06, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the point here is that people were intending to re-elect Nick Xenophon as an independent, and due to many preferencing against him, thought he risked being kicked out, but instead not just returning himself, but inadvertantly electing a conservative woman with some silly policies. I wonder how many people who voted for Xenophon agree with legislation she proposes... one of the downfalls of democracy. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 05:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While this is true, I don't think you can attribute those motives on the part of the voter. It suffices, IMO, to make clear that she was elected on the back of Xenophon's preferences, and had little primary vote in her own right, both of which are quite verifiable based on the figures. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 05:35, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"one of the downfalls of democracy"</i>... no, one of the downfalls of above-the-line voting. 20% of people trusted Xenophon enough to let him allocate their preferences (i.e. they voted for Xenophon above the line). If they weren't happy for Xenophon to do that, they should have voted below the line. My ranting aside, I agree with Rebecca's comment on what should be in the article. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 05:40, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not quite. I said that people inadvertantly elected Bressington. This is true. People were voting for Xenophon. I did express opinion (on talk page, not article) that I believe her policies are silly. I then went on to say that I wonder how many people who voted for Xenophon would agree with her policies - a question. I then said that it is one of the downfalls of democracy (in hindsight I should have been more specific and said preferential above the line voting) that a person who wasn't intended to be elected (in voters minds anyway) was elected - regardless of belief of her policies. It is a hard choice to say whether or not she should have been elected. People tend to vote for parties in which case candidates are candidates to just about everyone, and as long as they follow the party lines they voted for they don't care. Independents typically run on their own, but if they happen to have running mates like Xenophon did, there's always the chance they can get in without voters intending them to. Regardless of my own beliefs, and regardless of her policies, I happen to think it was wrong that the candidate in question was elected, as people were voting for Xenophon. Ask yourself this question - how many people who voted above the line for Xenophon do you believe knew the first thing about Bressington, let alone her policies? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 11:52, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, in regards to "I've heard that lots of candidates for upper houses don't get many "below the line" votes, including people from major political parties. Unless it's been remarked on in a major newspaper or the like, I think it should be removed." - can you name one candidate who was successfully elected to the LC in SA's modern political history in the way that Bressington was? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 11:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bottom line is that for the first time in modern SA political history, someone unknown was elected to the LC unintentionally, the voters didn't know who she was and whom had no idea what her political leaning or policies were. I'm not fighting for revert or modification of the article, just pointing out what are facts, whether you choose to believe they are facts or not. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 12:15, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO, voters are constantly electing people who they have no idea about, other than that the Liberal or Labor party machine likes them. This time, voters elected someone they knew nothing about, except that Nick Xenophon thought she'd be a good member. Granted it's not quite the same thing, because there is Labor/Liberal policy, but even that changes after the election. And then there are members who are elected as a Liberal/Labor and then quit the party and become independents. How many Liberal voters in 1997 knew they would sell ETSA? How many Peter Lewis voters knew they were in effect supporting Mike Rann? How many Queensland Labor voters knew they would elect Mal Colston who would go on and support Howard policies? etc. etc. etc. I guess what I'm saying is, even though her situation is unique in one way, in another way it's not really very different to what happens all the time. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 03:43, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>p.s. The above is a roundabout way of saying that I agree with Andjam.

<dd>But an MLC changing their stance/party/leaning after election is a reflection on them and will be judged appropriately after the time comes for their attempt at re-election. Labor/Liberals quitting and becoming inds reflect on them are are judged accordingly when their time comes for re-election. People voted for Peter Lewis, not someone else. People voted for Xenophon, not someone else (technically not correct, but you know what I mean). What i'm saying is, all members elected have stated their stances and what they believe in, and whether or not they stuck to them or changed their minds etc etc, they are judged at their next re-election. Nobody knew what Bressington supported - people weren't voting for her! Each MLC elected has had a clear position going in to their respective election, regardless of if they changed it during their tenure. Defection is not a valid comparison here. (again, i'm not arguing for any changes to the article one way or another, just debating the merits) <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 05:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we're drifting away from the purpose of this talk page (probably my fault). According to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines</a>, "<i>Keep discussions on the topic of how to improve the associated article</i>". So while I think this is an interesting (and civil) discussion, I don't think it belongs here.

<p><i>"she has stated that her policies are anti-abortion, anti-euthanasia and against the legalisation of prostitution."</i> Can anyone provide a cite for that? (I've already dropped a note on the Talk page of the original contributor). The anonymous editor deleted it a couple of times. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 23:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know that she's stated it in those terms, but she has made it fairly clear that she's against all three. Perhaps a rewording more along the lines of "she has these views on these issues" than "these are her <i>policies</i>" (which kind of implies that she's single-issue) would be appropriate. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
