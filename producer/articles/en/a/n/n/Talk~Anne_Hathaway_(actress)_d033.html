<p>To 66.185.84.80 who keeps deleting the image from the article. Thank you for explaining <i>why</i> you keep deleting it: you say you need an image with just Hathaway in it. Your intentions are laudable, however since we don't <i>have</i> an image with just Hathaway, we'll just have to make do with what we have. Once we have an image with just Hathaway, you can replace the cover image of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Princess_Diaries_%28film%29_24a4.html" title="The Princess Diaries (film)">The Princess Diaries</a></i> DVD. Until then, please stop reverting the article--wait until you have a new image to link to.</p>
<p>Also, please get an account. Communicating with an IP address is so impersonal.&#160;:-) An account gives you <i>more</i> privacy, not less. Also please follow the guidelines for submitting images (i.e. don't upload copyrighted images lifted from the Internet). Since getting a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> or <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> licensed image of Hathaway will be tricky, I again assert we should leave the current image until a suitable replacement can be located &amp; uploaded. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 21:30, Aug 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In addition to the "Jewish, American, and English" mentioned in the article, Miss Hathaway has Irish ancestry, with (according to an interview she gave while promoting <i>Ella Enchanted</i>) roots in Donegal and Cork. Furthermore, the "American" designation is of limited informational value -- for example, the skater Kristi Yamaguchi and the filmmaker Woody Allen are both "American," despite having widely different ethnic backgrounds. El Draque 03:40, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "American" description only serves the purpose of identifying her as a citizen of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Taken in this sense, the use for Yamaguchi and Allen are identical. It doesn't attempt to explain her ancestry or heritage. If you want to add the information about her Irish heritage, go ahead.

<dd>Sorry, I see how I was unclear in my phrasing. I wasn't complaining about the sentence that refers to her as an American actress. My objection was to the listing of her heritage as "Jewish, American, and English," because "American" could cover a whole range of ethnicities besides Jewish or English. Why name two specifically and then include a non-ethnicity, especially when she was already identified as a citizen of the United States? Anyway, I'll make what I hope is a non-obtrusive edit.</dd>

<p>Does anyone have a good link for her being of "Irish, English and Jewish" ancestry? I'm usually on top of these things and I just have not been able to find a single source to confirm that. I see there's an interview where she mentions some of her Irish roots, but does anyone know about Englisn and Jewish?</p>
<p>Here is the Irish reference, btw: "Hathaway's heritage actually goes back Ireland, and in particular, Cork and Donegal.</p>
<p>"On my father's side, we have relatives all over Cork and Donegal. Ireland is such an amazing country, and I have this little dream in the back of my head that someday I'll end up living there. When I've established myself in America, and I don't need to live near the action, so to speak. If you're good, the work will come to you. I feel very Irish; maybe that's why I've been so lucky with my career."

<p>Is a discussion of the actress's topless roles really relevant? It comprises roughly a third of her career section. Why are her topless roles so meritous of mention, compared to most other actresses? --Dbarefoot 04:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because her rise to stardom was based on her sweet, wholesome image. The roles with nudity she's recently been enthusiastically pursuing fly in the face of what brought her fame in the first place. — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 14:32, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which roles has she been 'enthusiastically' pursuing? That is, what evidence is there of her film selection process? I think 'Havoc' has a lot of nudity in it, but as I recall, she had one brief scene in 'Brokeback Mountain'. I can't speak to her two new films coming out this season. Regardless, I think the nudity is overemphasized in the context of the Career section, and unnecessarily crass. I'd propose something along the lines of: "Hathaway soon moved away from family films. Following Princess Diaries 2, she had supporting roles in R-rated films Havoc and Brokeback Mountain. Her desire to break out of her Princess Diaries image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals." --Dbarefoot 17:42, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>She stated she is enthusiasically persuing these types of films. I can't find the quote right now, but she said she wants to take the roles of hookers and other low-lifes so she won't be type-cast as a sugar-sweet actress. She played a low-life in <i>Havoc</i> and is persuing other such roles. I haven't seen either <i>Havoc</i> or <i>BM</i> (and don't plan to), but she persued the first <i>because</i> of its racy content and liked the latter because it had nudity. She wants to nudity by her own admission. I think that adding the quote would help the article. — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 20:08, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that the nudity is relevant, but after just skimming the article I've seen it mentioned at least twice; it is relevant on the section that examines her changing career but it certainly isn't needed in the introductory paragraph, it just looks out of place. Will be removing the first mention later when I log in 86.134.120.185 12:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The lead section could indicate that her career changed to darker roles, but noting that she had a nude scene in more than two sections (unless sometime in the future she is cast in another film with nudity) is flowery-like and excessive. <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENever_Mystic_107c.html" title="User:Never Mystic">Never Mystic</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/v/User_talk%7ENever_Mystic_a467.html" title="User talk:Never Mystic">t</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Never_Mystic_885e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Never Mystic">c</a>) 13:19, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Explaining the changes I'm making:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think the word "gay" is appropriate to use. It's basically a slang term, while "homosexual" is the more formal word, and thus probably more suitable to an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>"said in an interview" to "citing that" - "said in an interview" is kind of redundant, since she's obviously said every quote mentioned in the article somewhere. No point in mentioning where every time, as long as the source for the quote is cited with the number digit</li>
<li>"she now calls herself a non-denominational Christian" to "she is now a non-denominational Christian" - why say "she now calls herself"? Is there any reason to believe that she isn't actually a non-denominational Christian?</li>
<li>External links / sources - easier to have it all under one big section called "References", since in a sense interviews and web sites are also references for other parts of the article</li>
</ul>

<dd>Are you the person who keeps reverting "gay"? "Gay" has not been a slang term for 30 years. Gay people prefer it to 'homosexual,' which has clinical associations. What's more, its being encyclopedic is supported by the fact that it *has a wikipedia entry* (<a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>). I'm going to revert your anti-"gay" changes, since others have also reverted them, and you're the only one who has a problem with it. Unless this discussion supports your position, consensus is against you at the moment (judging by the fact that others have also tried to revert your changes), so it is not Wikipedia-appropriate for you to keep reverting. I can't possibly be bothered getting into a reversion war with you, but your conscience should tell you that according to Wikipedia's rules of consensus, you are outvoted and should not revert. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EAroundthewayboy_d3d0.html" title="User:Aroundthewayboy">Aroundthewayboy</a> 05:46, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This Never Mystic person persists in reverting everyone else who changes "homosexual" to "gay," without justifying himself in this discussion page. As far as I can tell, he is in a minority of one and should cease and desist, or else we should get an admin here to stop his edit war vandalism. He is violating Wikipedia's rules of consensus.</p>
<p>I have interviewed Anne for a major magazine, and she is not only charmingly, avowedly pro-gay, she makes a point of using the word gay over and over. NeverMystic, get over your personal issues. <a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EAroundthewayboy_d3d0.html" title="User:Aroundthewayboy">Aroundthewayboy</a> 08:43, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly, I don't believe you've interviewed Anne Hathaway before, but that's besides the point here. Could you explain what "edit war" I'm persisting in? As far as I can tell, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Hathaway_%28actress%29&amp;diff=74815453&amp;oldid=74639412" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Hathaway_%28actress%29&amp;diff=74815453&amp;oldid=74639412" rel="nofollow">reverted your edits</a> because you claimed that an automated bot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Hathaway_%28actress%29&amp;diff=74639412&amp;oldid=74638955" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Hathaway_%28actress%29&amp;diff=74639412&amp;oldid=74638955" rel="nofollow">introduced an error</a> into the article's content, which was not the case. This is not an edit warring; you shouldn't revert an automated bot based on what words you like and don't like. Wikipedia doesn't work this way.

It seems that <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Jack O'Lantern</a> found "homosexual" to be more formal and you disagreed.

<dd>Hi, I was the one who referenced up/tweaked/added to this article in June, and then kind of left it hanging, so thanks for picking up the pieces. I tweaked "Hathaway is Irish" to "Hathaway has Irish ancestry on her father's side", because of course she is not Irish but American, and I'm not sure of her mother's ancestry (all we have is that quote cited above in this discussion page).

<p>I am currently reviewing this article for GA status and would like one of the editors look at this line in the section <b>Career transitions</b><br />
<i>"and believes that her nude scene in Brokeback Mountain was the definitive moment in which her career changed paces to darker roles."</i><br />
The reference tag (currently #21) directs to a blog (not the best from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> point of view) that doesn't seem to say that she considered her brokeback role "darker". I'm going to put an on-hold tag and write up a more fuller reviewer for you. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 05:37, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After my initial readings, I thought there was only a few "quick fix" issues that could be done to get the article to GA status. However, with a more thorough follow up, I think there is more then what is normally appropriate for an "on-hold". But since I already tagged, I will give the article's editors the normally 7 day period to address the concerns listed below before I fully submit the GA review. Here is how the article currently stack up to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good Article Criteria</a><br />
<br />
<b>1. It is well written.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a need for some copy edit attention with minor spelling errors here and there. I will point out a couple below in relation to other items.</li>
<li>There are some awkwardly constructed sentences like this one in the Lead <i>To distance herself from her family-oriented image, Hathaway began starring in more serious films, including Havoc and Brokeback Mountain, and the latter received many Academy Award nominations.</i></li>
<li>The comments regarding Hathaway's decision to not become a nun because of her brother should probably be attached to the <b>Early life</b> section where it first talks about her wanting to be a nun.</li>
<li>I would also correct the wiki-link for the TV series Get Real in this section.</li>
<li>This is a minor point but this line in <b>Career transitions</b> struck me as odd <i>Since The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, Hathaway started appearing in less family-oriented films.</i> While Havoc and Brokeback Mountain are certainly not family oriented films, I don't know if it is needed to characterize them as that to make a point about Hathaway's career. Both films were not comedies like her previous films and you could says the line that she started appearing in less "comedic oriented films". From the references listed in the article, it seemed like she was drawn the Havoc and Brokeback films more for their <i>dramatic</i> content rather then to do "less family-oriented films".</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. It is factually accurate and verifiable.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the comment above, there are some other items that could use a reliable source reference like the first line in the <b>Early work</b> that says <i>While Get Real was successful, it was cancelled after one season.</i> Who noted that the series was successful? (also the sentence needs copy edit)</li>
<li>Also in that section in reference to the film Nicholas Nickleby there is the line <i>"Because the film was released to one hundred theaters across the world,[14] it failed at the box office success (totalling less than US$4 million),[14]"</i> with reference 14 going to a page that just gives the statistics of the film. There is not really a statement of whether or not the film was considered a box office success-which takes into consideration many factors other then just US intake. More over the direction connection being implied (Because of point A, it is considered point B) which is borderline OR synthesis. I would look into rewording or finding a more direct reference that the film was not a box office success. (another sentence for copy edit)</li>
<li>Is there a cite for declining the The Phantom of the Opera role?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. It is broad in its coverage.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Early life</b> section it is mentioned that <i>Her maternal grandfather was a Philadelphia radio pioneer.</i> but neither name of what exactly made him a "radio pioneer"</li>
<li>Has there been any critical evaluation of Hathaway's overall career and her career choices. I often hear her compared to a young Julia Roberts. Why?</li>
<li>I also think that the section on <b>Personal life</b> is a little thin. I actually thought she got married (she hasn't) and in doing a google search, I saw that she is quite active with her boyfriend in doing a lot of charity work. That maybe an area to look at.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. It follows the neutral point of view policy</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The family oriented vs dark roles dynamic seems a little odd but nothing that I would say violate NPOV.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>5. It is stable</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The article has progressed gracefully since its creation and is sufficiently stable for GA consideration</li>
</ul>
<p><b>6. It contains images, where possible, to illustrate the topic.</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The article has several images of Hathaway from different aspects of her career to help illustrate its topic.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I will check back on this article and give it a week's time to see if the above concerns have been addressed. If you have any questions, reply on this talk page and I will respond. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:37, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "career transition" section is definitely not as good as it could be, which leads me to believe that I nominated Anne Hathaway somewhat early for GA status.

I have asked <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> if he can assist in expanding "personal life" (since I'm not educated on this).

<dd>wow, there has been a bit of improvement here. I like the improved lead section with the Sunday Times reference to her acting style. The rewording around Nicholas Nickleby is better. Looks like most of the citation concerns have been addressed. The <b>Career Transition</b> section still needs some tidying. (like my concern about how ref #22-The Starpulse blog is being used and the phrase "darker roles" which is not in that source). I also still think there should be more about her Charity work to help flesh out the <b>Personal life</b> section. But all in all, it is an improvement.
