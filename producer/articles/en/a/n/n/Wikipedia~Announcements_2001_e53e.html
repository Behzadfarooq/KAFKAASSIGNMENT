<p>Wikipedia has a new logo, inspired by the old one, but with the text "Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia", and a nifty new epigraph for Wikipedia:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but by this singular passion from other animals, which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continued and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure.</dd>

<p>In other words, Wikipedia is better than sex (and other carnal pleasures).

Although we have grown faster in the weeks following September 11, press coverage and Slashdotting, we now--without help from significant press coverage--seem to be growing at a steady rate of somewhat better than 2,000 articles per month. At this rate, we will have 25,000 articles by next April and 40,000 articles by next November.

<p>Announcement from <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">User:Larry Sanger</a>:</p>
<p>I think we've discussed subpages quite a bit--certainly enough to air the issues and give people a chance to state their views and change their minds--and in view of this, I've decided to get rid of them.</p>
<p>Let me explain this decision--I'm done arguing for it, but of course you are owed an explanation, since the issue has been very controversial.</p>
<p>Examining the various pages on which people have discussed them, it seems there is at least a majority of people in favor of getting rid of them or who are amenable to the idea of getting rid of them. I think it's pretty important, although perhaps not absolutely essential in every case, that we at least not contradict majority opinion, when a consensus cannot be arrived at. The majority includes many old hands who have had more experience with the problems associated with subpages than some of their newer advocates, which I also think is important. Finally, and probably as importantly as anything else, my well considered opinion is that the arguments in favor of getting rid of them are much, much stronger than the arguments in favor of keeping them. I predict yer gonna thank me in a year. (Maybe not <i>all</i> of you.&#160;:-) ) --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">User:Larry Sanger</a></p>

<p>Wikipedia statistics: Jimbo's been looking at various Wikipedia statistics, and one interesting statistic has surfaced: the number of people (unique IPs) that have edited Wikipedia on any given day of October ranged from 96 to 236, with the vast majority of days between 130 and 180. After the recently increased traffic from Google, it seems we can expect an average number of daily editors of about 170. We can expect this number to continue to climb, however, as the virtuous cycle of content-traffic-contributors-more content continues into the indefinite future.</p>
<p>The number of unique visitors (editors or not) ranged from 3,112 to 7,983 in October, with a pre-October 28 average of about 5,000; the post-October 28 average is shaping up to be something like 8,000. The latter is not expected to decline, because it is not due to press coverage, but instead to (we expect) stable and growing factors related to the amount of traffic Google sends us.</p>
<p>While we're at it, pageviews ranged from 21,491 (on a very slow weekend day) to 48,321. They are now very much on the high end of this range.</p>
<p>All of these statistics are, by the way, enormous increases over just, say, three months ago.</p>

<p>A lot of news!</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_traffic.html" title="Wikipedia traffic">Wikipedia traffic</a>: Yesterday, Wikipedia began receiving a substantially increased amount of traffic from <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google.com</a>, which will probably result in a permanent traffic increase of over 20% compared with the few weeks leading up to yesterday. We're not sure yet why this is happening. Google already was far and away the most important source of traffic for Wikipedia. If the increase is permanent, then in terms of new personnel and increased article production and editing, we can expect that this will have a long-term effect similar to that of a major news article or of a Slashdotting.</p>
<p>Nupedia is about to announce the results of a vote on the details of its new editorial system.

<p>Nupedia will probably be set up as, in part, an approval mechanism for Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>On October 10, Larry Sanger made a proposal to <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a>'s advisory board (the Advisory-L mailing list) that would greatly simplify the Nupedia editorial process. In the last few days, over a half-dozen editors and reviewers have written in to express their support for the plan, with dissent only on relatively minor details. So it is certain that Nupedia will be adopting a new simpler system.</p>
<p>In brief, under Sanger's proposal, Nupedia would adopt a traditional review process and do away with nearly all of the bottlenecks--and the public review along with it--of the present system. Articles, once approved by an editor, a referee, and perhaps a copyeditor, would be posted on the Nupedia website and be available for public comment.</p>
<p>Part of this proposal is important to the future of Wikipedia, and reads as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's important that we supplement the above proposal by creating a link on Wikipedia article pages labelled: "Submit this article to Nupedia." This would link to a page that would solicit further information from the submitter and then place the Wikipedia article in the Nupedia queue for approval or rejection. Submission information would be reported on the Wikipedia Recent Changes page, as would final approvals and rejections of articles in the Nupedia system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, perhaps we'd be flooded with articles that the editor would simply reject with the press of a button and thereby do a bit toward teaching Wikipedians about the standards Nupedia upholds. Having to do this might be very annoying to editors, however; we might, in that case, want to limit who can nominate Wikipedia articles to some select group of Wikipedians. Moreover, we might make only Wikipedia-approved articles...nominatable for Nupedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, in the past week or so, traffic levels have levelled off and stabilized at levels over twice what they were before September 11.</p>
<p>A Wikipedia article (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a>) is actually <i>required reading</i> for a college course (a Pakistani university, it seems, but it's hard to tell). See <a href="http://cs.lums.edu.pk/~cs101/assignments/reading4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cs.lums.edu.pk/~cs101/assignments/reading4.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Other articles have been used as reference information in other courses (see <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Friends_of_Wikipedia/College_course_pages" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Friends_of_Wikipedia/College_course_pages" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), and in one case previously, an article was part of the "course materials" (see <a href="http://www.secs.oakland.edu/~srodawa/courseware/cse449/fa01/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.secs.oakland.edu/~srodawa/courseware/cse449/fa01/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). But the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a> article seems to be the first Wikipedia article that is specifically labelled as part of a reading <i>assignment.</i></p>

<p>The current levels of traffic are overloading Wikipedia's software, causing intermittent problems with viewing and editing pages, but improvements are made to the server to reduce the problems. One thing Wikipedians can do to help is change, on their Preferences page, their Recent Changes "Default days to display" to 1 or 2, instead of the current default of 7.</p>
<p>Among the problems the traffic levels are causing is that Wikipedia does not display links to newly-created pages as working links--for example, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaspora.html" title="Diaspora">diaspora</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundationalism.html" title="Foundationalism">foundationalism</a>. There are also still intermittent delays and failures in editing pages. To be safe, if you're making extensive edits to a page, consider saving drafts of your work to a file on your computer. (Once your final draft is saved to Wikipedia, regardless of how links are displayed, the information <i>will</i> be saved.)</p>

<p>Beginning next Tuesday (when Jason Richey returns from a weekend vacation), we are going to be taking the non-English Wikipedias more seriously:</p>
<ol>
<li>We'll be setting up non-English Wikipedias for all the other major languages (including many we've omitted).</li>
<li>We'll be <i>actively</i> seeking out translations of the main text (e.g., the GNU license notice), and uploading the translations. I.e., we will going to Wikipedia-L, to the individual non-English Wikipedias, and perhaps also to specific individuals, requesting the text and promising to upload it immediately upon receipt.</li>
<li>We will soon (probably today) set up an International Wikipedia standards mailing list, which would explain set basic standards that we would like all Wikipedias to follow (think of it as the UN).</li>

<p>Wikipedia exceeds 12,000 articles. Since we passed the 11,000 mark on September 19, we have been adding an average of 125 articles per day, for a total of 1,000 articles in eight days. Of course, we can't realistically expect to maintain this rate beyond the next few days (since the effects of press coverage are generally short-lived), but if we did, we would have over 50,000 articles by next October.</p>

<p>A quite positive <i>New York Times</i> article on Wikipedia has appeared today (page D2, "Circuits" section).

It is possible (how likely, we still don't know) that we will be completely inundated with traffic, as a result. This has made it extremely important that we upgrade, as soon as possible, to WikiWiki software that can handle a lot of new traffic. Among the features we need most is database-driven software. Magnus has spent some of his copious summer free time creating some new code. The plan now is to make it as easy as possible for Wikipedian programmers to be able to work on this new code, so that we ourselves can create the new features that we want!</p>

<p>In other news, recent discussions on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia-L_12a7.html" title="Wikipedia-L">Wikipedia-L</a> as well as on Larry Sanger/An impending scalability problem have raised some interesting questions about the future of Wikipedia. It seems that many are now desiring some way to sort through the RecentChanges page more easily, because (not that we're complaining or anything) there are so many of us at work now that there are hundreds of edits per day--making it difficult to identify edits in which we're interested and distinguish them from other edits. Various solutions are being considered.</p>

<p>Wikipedia passes <b>7,000</b> pages. It would have done so within the next day or so, but yesterday's slashdotting advanced the schedule... A check five minutes ago showed 7808 pages with enough content to contain a comma (ie excluding redirects, one-liners and lists); of these, approximately 106 are wikipedians pages, 56 are about wikipedia, and 403 are /talk subpages: with all these excluded, that makes 7243 pages. Yesterday's total, pre-slashdot, was 6947. Nice work!</p>
<p>Welcome to all the new people! Isn't Wikipedia great? The fact that much of the work done is of OK quality, and some of it is pretty good, bespeaks the robustness of the Wikipedia concept. Just don't forget to be bold in updating pages!</p>

<p>Wikipedia is now useful! In this exciting new development, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a> noticed that he could look stuff up in Wikipedia that he didn't know, and answer a few questions he had, just as one does with a real encyclopedia. He couldn't do that a few months ago, and now he can. This might be a reflection of the fact that, in less than six months, Wikipedians have created 9,595 pages, and 6,716 of these are "comma pages." Wikipedia is great!</p>

<p>Wikipedia continues to move full steam ahead. Today is the five month anniversary of Wikipedia's founding (an early version appeared as part of nupedia.com on January 10, 2001). So, how many articles do we have? We have 5,964 pages on the website, total; 4,264 articles of 150 characters or more (two or three sentences); 3,969 "comma" articles; and 1,002 articles of 2,000 characters or more (about three ordinary-sized paragraphs. At this rate, in a year, we can expect to see 10,000 "comma" articles.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is moving! We are going to move wikipedia to a newer server on May 3. You can expect wikipedia to be unavailable for a period of about a half an hour, sometime between 11:00am and 2:00pm PST. During this period, I will be copying the current data to the new server.

<p><a href="http://www.google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a> has been crawling through Wikipedia and including pages in their database rather slowly.

Despite the delay, we have a slowly-growing source of traffic--and therefore more contributors, and therefore (very possibly, anyway) an increasing rate of article-writing--from Google and Google-using search engines like Yahoo! and Netscape. The news then, though it's surely not great news to many, is that on Wikipedia "the rich (will) get richer"; or "if we build it, they will come" and in greater and greater numbers.</p>

<p>We have broken 3,000 pages! As impressive as this sounds, it's misleading, because very many of the pages are redirection pages and "one-liners." A slightly more accurate count can be achieved by using the search function (at the bottom of every page) to search for "," (comma). This excludes redirection pages and many one-liners. At present, the count of "comma" articles is at 1,910--we can expect to break the 2,000 level of "comma" articles within the next few days.</p>
<p>P.S. As of 11:20pm EST there were 2056 pages with at least 150 characters. Of those pages, 796 had at least 1,000 characters and 159 pages had 5,000 or more characters. (To search by minimum length, search for <code>(.| ){150}</code> and replace 150 with the desired number of characters.) There were also 634 redirection pages (search for <code>^#REDIRECTs</code> for a list).</p>

<p>In related events, recently a discussion was started on Advisory-L and Nupedia-L, two Nupedia mailing lists, pointing to the fact that Wikipedia had made fantastic progress while Nupedia seemed relatively inefficient.

<p>If you've got a minute, think about publicizing Wikipedia. Think about leveraging effort--in the time it takes you to write two decent articles, you might be able to get ten people on board who can write ten decent articles apiece.</p>

<p>The Slashdot interview just now appeared on Slashdot.org, but the link to this site is buried fairly deeply. So we may not have the massive influx that I had hoped and feared.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> is being interviewed by Slashdot, and the interview may appear tomorrow (Thursday) morning. He mentioned Wikipedia in the interview, and we may experience a substantial surge in traffic. Based on what has happened to other wikis mentioned on slashdot, we might expect to see some vandalism. If all the active participants could log in a bit more often tomorrow to keep an eye on things, that would be great.</p>
<p>Notice, we've added a little something to the top of the page: "Get involved! Wikipedia is a free community project!" And also another "Edit text of this page" link, now at the top of the page. We're hoping to make it clear to visitors unfamiliar with the wiki concept (which is most of them) that this is a community-edited project.</p>

<p>I think we are over 1000 pages now. If we create 1000 pages a month, we will be able to hit 100,000 pages in only 8 years. However, I think that as we grow, we will attract more people to work on the pages, and we'll end up growing faster and faster.</p>
