<p>We have lots of announcements of the form "xx language wikipedia reached yy,000 articles?" This page is supposedly for en announcements. Should we change the remit of this page to include the good tidings from our other-tongued cousins? (It could duplicate the equivalent meta page), or should we boldly remove them, with a swift "moved to meta" summary comment? <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 11:15, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These 'X Wikipedia X milestone' posts results in new announcements every other day. Each day at least one new announcement is listed the Announcements link on RC should be bolded. Since most of the announcements are just noise that does not pertain to the English Wikipedia, I imagine that many people ignore the bolded announcement link on RC. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_News" class="extiw" title="meta:Wikimedia_News">meta:Wikimedia News</a> is the place for that type of stuff. Right now Wikimedia News is more or less a copy of the English Wikipedia's announcement page and that may result in many people ignoring that page as well. --mav</dd>

<dd>They have nothing to do with en, and end up sounding like a desperate competition. It also furthers the idea that here (En WP) is the mother/main WP, where anything other WPs do must be report to the superior. Wikimedia is where we all belong under. It is a false idea these other WP # reporters are having. Why exactly aren't these #s reported in the German or Malay WP, for example? --<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenchi_e72d.html" title="User:Menchi">Menchi</a> 17:19, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I updated the boilerplate at the top of the page to try to reflect opinion offered here. It seems to me that this discussion is a microcosm of the wider use of meta: vs Wikipedia: namespaces. Meta would, in an ideal world, be used more and Wikipedia: less . But its not an ideal world because we don't have things like integrated (or side-by-side) recent changes, integrated watchlists and single sign-on. They would be brilliant features in my opinion. Until they come online I don't think it is reasonable to really make a "push for meta", and so the current status quo is going to be maintained. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 09:22, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am happy with your slightly bolder update.

<dd>My own view is a little different. I am of the opinion that what is happening to other versions <i>is</i> of major interest to the English Wikipedia. In a real sense, EN is the "parent" Wikipedia, and is by far the largest. In a number of places, Wikipedia calls for people to help with translation from EN to other languages. Thus as English speakers were have a vital interest in what's going on in the wider Wikiworld. And as someone else has pointed out, keeping track of other languages is not confined to EN. The German version does; so does the Afrikaans version - where their MAIN PAGE compares the progress of their version to that of the English and Dutch ones. And yes, I agree with Pete - we MUST get some new software features, to allow for <i><b>seamless</b></i> navigation between the different languages of Wikipedia, as well as the different Wikimedia organs (Wiktionary, Wikisource, etc).<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">Davidcannon</a> 10:02, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Dear Kelly,
</pre>
<pre>
Happy April Fool's Day, and thank you for your lightning-fast response
last week!  I wrote the ODP the same day, and have yet to hear from them.
I notice that the Reference list has been updated, but that Wikipedia is
not on it.  Perhaps the latest ODP update overwrote the category change
made to your backend?  (Wikipedia *is* categorized by the ODP, but only
under "Open Source".)
</pre>
<pre>
Our Alexa reach hit 1.7% today!  Your metrics may not be "representative
of the global Internet population", but they are certainly fun.  :-)
</pre>

<dd>I might add that many of those were minor milestones indeed. I understand fully that reaching 1000 articles is a large feat for a language that recently kicked off. But reporting the next 1000 and so on is overdoing it. The news value of this page is devalued by all these minor announcements. I think only round numbers should be reported, e.g. only 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000, 75000 etc.</dd>

<dd>Speaking for myself, I rather like the reporting of milestones on this page. I think its good for us (Britons, Americans, and other English speakers) to keep an eye on what is happening with the other language wikis. I can see your point, though. As a compromise, how about putting the milestones under a separate heading, at the bottom of the page? That way, those coming to the page would first see matters relevant to the English wikipedia, but would be able to scroll down the page (or follow the link in the TOC) to the MILESTONES section. I'll set it up that way in the next day or two. You can tell me how you like it (I think you will, but if you don't, you can revert it - no offence taken). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">Davidcannon</a> 10:48, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that the Meta is far less known, and has much less traffic, than the English Wikipedia. I am of the opinion that Britons and Americans tend to be a bit too insular with respect to other languages; compare that with the attitude of speakers of other languages such as German (whose Wikipedia keeps track of what's happening with other languages) and Afrikaans, whose MAIN page gives comparative statistics for English and Dutch, as well as Afrikaans. That's their MAIN page! Not one of us has suggested doing anything like that with our own main page, and I would not support such a move, but what's the harm in having it on our announcements page?</dd>

<p>Having said all that, I believe in majority rule, and will gladly comply with it. To determine what the majority verdict is, I'm starting a POLL at the bottom of this page. As I said, I will abide by the result. But having said that, I believe it is in everybody's best interests if we (AND every other language in which Wikipedia is published) has information about what is going on in the wider community.</p>

<dd>I've never seen it as ingraining the stereotype of the superiority of the English Wikipedia.

<dd>I'm not saying that such information shouldn't be on the Meta. It should be. But should it be <i>only</i> there? I don't think so. I might change my mind if a few structural changes were made (such as seamless integration of the Meta with all language Wikis, etc, which wouldn't require separate watchlists and separate logins for the users of multiple WPs, or for users of a Wikipedia and the Meta) I'll be far more willing to remove information of this type to the Meta if and when such upgrades are forthcoming.

<dd>I have been of the same mind. However such structural changes are a long way off. I think we should push meta regardless - if you have long-lasting log in cookies you barely notice the difference anyway. As for data being only there... the only two logical choices are to have the data just on meta, or all data on all wikis ... having the data on meta and en gives undue prominence to en. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 16:41, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see the point that people are making - that too many minor events are being classified as "milestones" and are cluttering the page. I agree that we (including I) should avoid posting such trivia in future. Depending on which way the vote goes, I will continue to post milestones - but only really significant ones (e.g. the Romanian Wikipedia reaching 5000 but NOT the Spanish Wikipedia reaching 21,000). As for moving the milestones to the Multilingual Statistics page, as Eric Zachte suggested: thanks for that idea, Eric. I didn't think of that. It seems a good idea to me. As for moving them entirely to the Meta, please stay tuned for an article I'll be posting on the Meta in the next day or two about the need for an upgrade to allow seamless navigation between the Meta and Wikipedia (and also among the different language Wikipedias, and the sister projects as well). IMO, that's the only think that's going to make the Meta a success any time soon. Anyway, now that I've read what everybody has had to say, I can agree that some significant adjustments in the publication of milestones are needed. Where I continue to differ somewhat with some members is <i>how</i> these adjustments are to be carried out. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">Davidcannon</a> 11:29, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Milestones Table Edit</span></h3>
<p>I have removed several milestones from the table. Yes, I pushed for milestones to be retained, but the "consensus decision" was that only <b><i>major</i></b> milestones should be included, and I think it is important to hold ourselves to that decision. Accordingly, I have removed a number of milestones that are not round numbers. Please don't take offence, <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfio_ae11.html" title="User:Alfio">User:Alfio</a> - given the recent dramatic growth of the <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://it.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Italian Wikipedia</a>, you'll get your turn in just a few days, so don't run away just yet :-) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">Davidcannon</a> 13:55, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I heartily approve of presenting the milestones in a table-like fashion. It is much more helpful to the reader... in this form I am more relaxed about the data being on en... I would prefer meta, but am happy if it is on both. As for the layout of the table... do we intend to only have one entry for each language or, as further milestones are reached, would a language have more than one row (e.g. when en reaches 250,000 do we drop 240,000 or keep it?). I would prefer keeping it, as otherwise we lose historical data, and miss out on the rate of progress. On the flip side, this means the table will eventually become quite substantial in size. Might it be more appropiate to have the table on another page, clearly linked from this one and others? I recommend upgrading <a href="../../../m/i/l/Wikipedia%7EMilestones_6b97.html" title="Wikipedia:Milestones">Wikipedia:Milestones</a> for this purpose, which isn't widely used right now.

<p>I can see the merit of your suggestion, Pete, but speaking for myself, I'd prefer each language to have only one entry - its latest milestone. Taking up your suggestion of upgrading the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Wikipedia%7EMilestones_6b97.html" title="Wikipedia:Milestones">Wikipedia:Milestones</a> page, however, we could have more detailed tables on that page that would keep track of the rate of progress.

Don't get me wrong, Tuf-Kat. I myself am very much in favour of keeping milestones on the Announcements page, and I pushed for their continued inclusion. But let's get one thing straight: Only a VERY narrow majority voted for their retention - and only for MAJOR milestones; only two voted for the indiscriminate inclusion of whatever one fancies to be a milestone. Almost half voted for their complete removal - and that included a number of "names" that have been around Wikipedia much longer than I. While not in sympathy with their views, I think we've got to factor them into the equation. In a nutshell, 89 percent voted either for no milestones or very significant ones only; of these, 50 percent favoured keeping significant milestones, and 39 percent favoured dumpingthem. 61 percent voted for milestones altogether, but only 22 percent for indiscriminate ones.</p>
<p>My interpretation of these figures is that while a majority exists for milestones to be kept, it is a tenuous one, and those of us who favour them can't just throw our weight around and include everything that we fancy to be a milestone. When the number 1000 was proposed as the smallest milestone (by you and I think one or two other persons), nobody suggested a smaller figure. And no, I wouldn't say that 100 articles "means that the Wikipedia has become seriously active," as you put it. The <a href="http://oc.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://oc.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Occitan Wikipedia</a> has almost five times that number - and it's been stuck at 487-493 for months and months now. Is it "seriously active?" Not by my standard of reckoning! If 493 articles is insufficient to render a Wikipedia seriously active, I hardly think 100 is. 1000 is a much more realistic figure. What do the rest of you think? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 10:27, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand, but respectfully continue to disagree. I originally voted for formation as the first milestone, but on further thought that made little sense, since Wikipedias are created (i.e. a Main Page exists at xx.wikipedia.org) before there are any contributors (sometimes somebody does push for the creation of a particular language wiki, but not usually), so the Wikipedia is often "formed" before there are any Wikipedians. I think 100 articles establishes that there are (or were) at least one Wikipedians. Certainly, 100 articles is not a guarantee of continued growth, but pedias like Occitan are the exception, I think (Basque and Afrikaans also had some major activity but have since dropped off, IIRC). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:18, Apr 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that the milestones have been reordered by size, rather than alphabetically, as previously. I don't mind, but it will make a lot more work for those uploading them, as their relative sizes will inevitably change.

<dd>I believe several factors may have caused the change in ranking, but I believe a significant cause was due to Nick Berg. For a couple of weeks Wikipedia was the top search result for 'Nick Berg' and similar searches on both Google and Yahoo. 100,000s of people were searching for the video and ending up visting Wikipedia trying to find it. In May the Nick Berg article got almost half a million hits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/stats/usage_200405.html#TOPURLS" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/stats/usage_200405.html#TOPURLS" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>], even those stats probably understate the true number. I believe this greatly increased Wikipedia's ranking in late May 2004. However Wikipedia's Nick Berg article dropped from the top spot on Google and the number of searches dropped off dramatically going into June, causing a decrease in the Alexa rank. Or it could be something else. -- <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopsracer_cec6.html" title="User:Popsracer">Popsracer</a> 11:12, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion the falloff of traffic is noteworthy. Wikipedia has seen fairly steady growth in traffic, apart from times of server overload. The traffic has definitely fallen off in the last three weeks, so much so that the weekly averages are below the 3-month average. I, for one, am very curious why. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 05:28, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My pet theory is that the drop-off corresponds with the rise of the "second generation" of Wikipedia mirrors that now how to work the Google algorithm. For example thefreedictionary.com <i>always</i> hammers WP in the rankings, which has dropped off dramatically for many searches. The timing matches. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 08:55, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a very plausible theory. I just did a Google search on Zsuzsa Polgar, and the Wikipedia article was not in the top 140. That rankles because six of the cloned articles are in the top 100, with two of them in the top 10! Perhaps Google, which once drove Wikipedia growth doesn't do so as much. But what I don't understand is this: if all of the clones are compliant and link back to the original Wikipedia article, won't that push the Wikipedia rank higher than that of any single clone?

<dd>Lots of factors. First some clones are in very poor compliance. Others link only to the main page not the original article. Not surprisingly we are #1 hit for "Wikipedia". Others hide deliberately awkardify the links so when the click a link they don't go directly to our site.. it runs a tiny script on the mirror site which redirects them to WP for the ordinary user, but stays at the mirror if you are the Googlebot, thus stopping us from getting pagerank from them - not surprising since we are their competitor! <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 08:49, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, because the list is not very well thought out. Do we really expect to have no announcements between 350k and half a million articles?

I wish people would stick to the schedule for non-English Wikipedias, though. True, it doesn't clutter things up because the table stays the same size.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fastest growth</span></h2>
<p>This is moved from the main page.</p>
<ul>
<li>July saw the fastest rate of monthly growth in Wikipedia's history. The total Wikipedia project (in 100 languages) posted a net gain of 81,859 new articles, shattering the previous record of 75,223 new articles in March. The English Wikipedia gained 21,507 articles - breaking the March record of 21,037; other languages to make record gains included Italian (8659 new articles - the previous record was 1668, in May), Portuguese (4127 - the previous record was 1855, in May), Swedish (3095 - the previous record was 2874, in March), and Norwegian (1475; the May and June figures of 1001 and 1004 new articles had themselves been records). On current trends, Wikipedia will number one million articles by mid-September.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know where this claim is grounded. I mean what kind of growth? I added monthly but numbers suggest definitely not montly growth.

<dd>Hi Erik. There is a prelimary discussion of which stats are wrong at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_4be3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">Wikipedia talk:List of Wikipedians by number of edits</a>. Certainly the CSV file that outputs the number of edits isn't screwy somehow. People are reporting that their total number of edits has gone down! Also it says there were 7k new articles on EN in July (from 283-290K). However the count on the main page went from 283K to 315K. The number of new editors (again on en - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm</a>) is listed as 168 - the lowest since April 2003. However the webalizer stats say that July was by far the busiest month on record. The growth in database size (in MB) is consistent with webalizer - not the stats related to number of articles/number of wikipedians. I am pretty certain there is a problem somewhere - I for one would be extremely grateful if you could track it down. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 22:38, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"However the webalizer stats say that July was by far the busiest month on record." This is the number of page requests. The number of visitors was high but equal to 5 months ago. Page requests is a shady figure. It includes all robots. With official partnership to Yahoo and 10ths of mirrors (many of whom make money over the back of Wikipeda but that is another story) that get their act together and keep their sites up to date, instead of relying on a half year old dump this is bound to rise more rapidly than number of contributions to database. This does not mean all is well. I will have to look into it. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Zachte_33ed.html" title="User:Erik Zachte">Erik Zachte</a> 00:39, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found the culprit. Now if someone would have alerted me to this problem earlier :( It was relatively easy to spot once I stripped the original script to bare bones for specific tests. The script thinks it is ready reading the cur database when on 75% it encounters the SQL statement that signals end of data, but here as part of an article text. It was bound to happen sometime. Thus new articles which are all in the back of cur database are only counted after two edits (when they appear in old database). I'll send an update soon. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Zachte_33ed.html" title="User:Erik Zachte">Erik Zachte</a> 01:33, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Davidcannon! I would vote for muting the colors somewhat, but the new format is much preferable to the old one. My only question is mathmematical. If the progression of milestones is 1, 2, 5, 10, etc., shouldn't the latest milestone for the English Wikipedia be 200,000 rather than 100,000? --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 07:08, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I agree. I suppose I didn't go for that option this time, because it would create three rows with only one entry - but then, there's really nothing wrong with that. I admit that my spacing of the milestones was pretty arbitrary - it would probably make more sense mathematically to follow Fuzzheado's suggestion (every thousand up to 10,000, every 10,000 up to 100,000, and every 50,000 thereafter). When we have literally hundreds of languages on Wikipedia, we'll probably do something like that. At the moment, I think it would create an unnecessarily large table with lots of empty space, which I'm trying to avoid. When several wikipedias reach 100,000 (Japanese almost certainly will before the end of the year; French is about to hit 50,000 and, with a bit of luck, might double before the year's out), we'll create a new level (200,000) for English. And oh yes, if others express the same sentiments as you, I'll certainly tone the colours down a bit when I get around to it over the next few days. I'm quite happy about that.</dd>

<dd>I've been keeping an eye on quite a number of wikipedias over the past few days. Am I the only one who has noticed that most of our projects are growing faster than usual, and that this month is going to be an all-time record for quite a number of languages? Portuguese has exploded - 4500 new articles since the beginning of the month - more than 2500 of them in the last two days. Serbian has exploded too. Even Luxembourgish has come from nothing to be grazing a thousand articles. I realize that bots may have been employed - but am I alone in thinking that they were deliberately unleashed at this time, as each language's wiki strives to play its part to make the million article milestone happen? It's exciting; I only hope they keep it up <i>after</i> the milestone is announced.</dd>

<p>I reverted the premature anouncement of Alexis 349 position.

I think the 409 was from 20 september.Sometimes the graph is updated before the traffic rank. The graph shows the stats for from yesterday (the 21 september) as daily but tomorrow the 21 september will be drawn as a 3 day average. so it will be changed bye a small decrease.

<p>From the site :</p>
<p>How Are Traffic Trend Graphs Calculated? '<i>The Trend graph <b>shows you a</b> three-day moving average <b>of the site's</b> daily traffic</i> rank, charted over time. The <b>daily traffic rank</b> reflects the traffic to the site based on data for a <b>single day</b>. In contrast, the main traffic rank shown in the Alexa Toolbar and elsewhere in the service is calculated from three months of aggregate traffic data.</p>
<p>Daily traffic rankings will sometimes benefit sites with sporadically high traffic, while the three-month traffic ranking benefits sites with consistent traffic over time. Since we feel that consistent traffic is a better indication of a site's value, we've chosen to use the three-month traffic rank to represent the site's overall popularity. We use the daily traffic rank in the Trend graphs because it allows you to see short-term fluctuations in traffic much more clearly.</p>
<p>It is possible for a site's three-month traffic rank to be higher than any single daily rank shown in the Trend graph. On any given day there may be many sites that temporarily shoot up in the rankings. But if a site has consistent traffic performance, it may end up with the best ranking when the traffic data are aggregated into the three-month average. A good analogy is a four-day golf tournament: if a different player comes in first at each match, but you come in second at all four matches, you can end up winning the tournament</p>

<dd>Good point. Are articles like Wikipedia:September 20 appropriate? The way announcements are now aren't that timeless. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a></dd>

<p>I agree with Anthony about the big picture. The appropriate place to put this is generally on Meta (remember, this milestone is all Wikipedias, not just the English one). Pages there include <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_timeline" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipedia_timeline">Wikipedia timeline</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Milestones" class="extiw" title="m:Milestones">Milestones</a>. I find that better than Wikipedia:September 20. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:33, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Anthony also, though I will note that some events make it onto dates without meeting quite so strict a criterion. And I want to note also for anyone's benefit that a fairly decent list of important Wikipedia dates is at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Wikipedia_74f2.html" title="History of Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a> -- since the days are wikified, a what links here from a given day (say, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>) will note it's linked to from History of Wikipedia. I don't know how useful that is, given the number of articles linking to days. But I thought it worth mentioning. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 21:50, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WikiProject announcements</span></h2>
<p>I added an announcement that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_World_music_6440.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject World music">Wikipedia:WikiProject World music</a> has completed an article on the music of every independent country in the world. I think it would be a good idea to have more WikiProject announcements for events of this sort. Any other opinions? I seem to recall there being an announcement once for the completion of an article on every German province or something, or I may be imagining that... WikiProject announcements seem more interesting and relevant, I think, than more Alexis stuff or obscure languages reaching 100 articles. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 22:13, Oct 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Seems to me that when mentioning the server names, their names should be linked to the people they were named after. Hope it's OK that I am making that change, albeit belatedly, to the entry about the new web servers.</p>
