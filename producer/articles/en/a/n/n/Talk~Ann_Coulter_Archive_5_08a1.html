<p>One doesn't need to be a genius to know about her racist views. She repeatedly supports racial profiling, which only affect Muslims, hispanics, and blacks. Calling her "politically incorrect" is a nice way of saying that she is a racist.</p>
<p>What about Asians? It's tiring how many Asian-Americans are just passed off as the passive, "controllable" (ie. "harmless" and "nerdy", and keep to themselves) minority.

If there is any question of the bias of this article, read the wikipedia article on Al Franken. There is no section in it discrediting him or dedicated to his critics. Al Franken and Ann Coulter are essentcially the same just in different political parties</p>

<dd>Um, no - Al Franken is a partisan, Ann Counter is a nutcase. <i>Slight</i> difference. Every second word out of his mouth <i>isn't</i> a lie. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 7 July 2005 14:43 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. Big difference. Al Franken uses self-effacing humor and facts to persuade. Coulter uses harsh invective, lies, and distortions. Coulter's mendacity has been thoroughly documented, and only the relentlessly lazy or ill-informed could be unaware of that fact. People of both sides of the political spectrum have complained about her shrillness, even Bill O'Reilly! There ARE left-wing counterparts to Coulter, but Franken is not one of them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">status of quotations</span></h2>
<p>There are two different ways to interpret the above poll results (currently 11/10 in favor of keeping the quotations):</p>
<ul>
<li>One can see no concensus and from this justify removing the information since it didn't reach concensus.</li>
<li>The other interpretation is that one can see no concensus to change what currently exists, and thus justify keeping the information in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that we must adopt the latter interpretation, because if we apply the former rule in a utilitarianist sense, we will face several unwanted consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>any passage in any article at any time could be questioned and removed given that it does not meet a significant concensus.</li>
<li>endless challenges, as what is to prevent us from simply re-polling to bring back the information in. Given the exact same results in a hypothetical subsequent vote on including the quotes on this page, we would be justified in including the information, as one could interpret that there isn't concensus to keep the info out, of which this process could be repeated <i>ad inifinitum.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Given a tie, the direction of a poll should favor keeping information previously existing for some time the same rather than removing/changing information</i>. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:22, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have reached my 3 revert limit today, thus I plead with others to follow the above guideline. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:24, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

There is only one way to interpret an 11/10 vote on Wikipedia: there is no consensus. This isn't a democracy, we don't use votes to make decisions. The close tie tells us that we don't agree. The content of the page does not command consensus. We must therefore edit the page until we have consensus. I still don't understand why we have to have that bald list-of-quotes in the first place. Coulter is famous for her bizarre neanderthal conservatism, let's write about that and use the quotes to illustrate it. Just plating a braindump into an article doesn't cut it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:34, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly my point. I can equally say that there is no concensus to remove the information. In other words, while "the content of the page does not command concensus", neither does its removal. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:40, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are a nice reverter, but I think people may be at this awhile. <b>If something is on Wiki and it is entirely POV as it is, then it either get removed or editors change it to be NPOV. I think the burden is on those who want the quotations to write an appropriate paragraph and stick it in there.</b> In that way, the context can be added that make it NPOV. I don't think that is too much to ask. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 03:37, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>--&gt;That is not the default. <b>NPOV is the default</b>. <b>Removing the quotes is inherently NPOV.

<dd>Umm, once again, how is quoting coulter POV?

<dd>for the love of god, <b>what</b> exactly is POV about <i>quoting</i> the woman? if coulter were here, she would no doubt want <i>more</i> quotes like these. i can see tony's argument that quotes aren't encyclopedic, though i disagree for the case of a polemicist. but POV entirely escapes me. what POV do you think is being expressed here? these are <i>illustrations</i> of her style &amp; that's exactly why she's well known -- it's certainly not for her intellect. she's proud of these; conservatives are amused by them; i'm horrified by them -- but including the quotes furthers no point of view that i can see. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 06:29, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The quote section has been there quite a while, and has been debated at length before -- see archive 1. Full disclosure: I went under the name Wolfman in that debate. Given the previous participation of many editors &amp; long-standing debate, it doesn't seem to me that the default should be to remove the section given an essentially tied poll now. If you feel strongly about removing the quotes (and apparently you do), perhaps the best way forward would be to post an RFC.

<dd>It doesn't quite work that way. There is no "default". Either a page is stable or it is not. When there is consensus and someone calls a vote, for instance, you tend to see most people stacking up on one side and one or two opposing it. This hasn't happened here (although I opposed calling the vote for the very reason that I perceive no consensus). In the absence of consensus there is no "default". We'll go on arguing about it until someone rewrites it to the satisfaction of all. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:28, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Whether or not you recognize it, there is a "default." In a hung poll, a decision must still be reached whether to include the information or not. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:56, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's never going to be to the satisfaction of all. But, I do recall that I brokered a compromise back around September. This had two parts. First, a 'disclaimer' which appears to be intact. Second, I reduced the number of quotes by selecting those most illustrative of her style. I think that got it down to 8 or so quotes. That compromise was pretty stable for quite a while. Apparently, there has been quite a 'quote creep' in the meantime. The best way forward might be a discussion of <i>which</i> quotes contribute most rather than whether there should be <i>any</i> quotes.

<dd>Along with that, the discussion suggests that the article might be enhanced by a paragraph or two describing different aspects of her style, and incorporating quotations within the text to illustrate the points made. I think the list of quotations is better than nothing, because it provides some information, but it would be more useful to the reader to have that kind of summary, and it would satisfy the editors who don't want a long collection of simple quotations. Of course, it would also be more work, and, no, I'm not volunteering to do it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 04:07, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Now you don't like them, so you threaten deletion if those who want the quotes don't modify them into paragraph form, without even a concensus to remove this previously existing info? <b>If you don't like how the quotes are, why don't you modify it yourself instead of holding it hostage via threats of deletion?</b>--<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 17:15, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with kizzle. The paragraph form would be more helpful to the reader than the simple collection of quotations, but, until someone writes the paragraph, having a selection of quotations in the article is better than forcing the reader to switch over to Wikiquote. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 17:38, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>what sort of content do you think would be appropriate for paragraph form? to me, the current lead-in paragraph to the quotes section sort of says it all. i worry that providing 'context' will really turn into an opportunity (and battleground) to provide a point of view. i do think that the list of quotes ought to be pruned quite a bit, because it goes way beyond what is necessary to give a flavor of her style &amp; her issues. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 18:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, I believe that you are missing the point. Coulter is a polemicist. <i>That</i> is why she is known. I imagine that Clinton finds these embarassing. Coulter does not. They are her <i>craft</i>. They are the very essence of her notability. Clinton is notable because he was the most powerful man on the planet for 8 years. Coulter is notable because she is rhetorically flamboyant (at least that's why she is successful as a pundit). You act as if she ought to be embarassed by these quotes, well I do agree with that. But, she &amp; most of her supporters revel in them. I ask again: <b>What</b> POV is supposedly being pushed here?

<p>Okay, it seems pretty clear that there is no real consensus on whether to keep or to remove the quote section. That just means we need to buckle down and find a compromise that everyone is relatively happy with.</p>
<p>There are some underlying issues that I think need to be addressed first: <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 05:15, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Is this an NPOV issue?</span></h3>
<p>Some people are throwing around the notion that the quote section is inherently POV. It seems to me (assuming that the quotes aren't selected in order to support one POV or the other), that a quote section is absolutely NPOV. I think we might be seeing an example of the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hostile_media_effect.html" title="Hostile media effect">hostile media effect</a> here. To see, let's have a strawpoll on this issue, and, in the spirit of scientific inquiry, let's also state our individual POVs on the subject of Ann Coulter. For the record, let me point out that "NPOV" doesn't stand for <i>no</i> point of view. NPOV is achieved through fairly and accurately representing <i>all</i> POVs. If you think Mrs. Coulter is Evil Incarnate, say (anti-). If you think she's the greatest thing since sliced bread, say (pro-). If you truly think you're neutral, or you don't wish to show your hand at this time, say (undisclosed). I'll start off.</p>
<p>Also, in case I haven't made it clear, let's consider this question independently of whether or not to keep the quote section. For example, I don't think this is an NPOV issue, but I do think the quote section should be removed, or at least severly prunned, for aesthetic reasons. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 05:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A while back, Tony proposed that we make an extra effort to use Coulter's quotes in the main text of the article, in order to provide evidence for or against the POVs under question.

He suggested it as an alternative to the quote section, but let's consider this proposal independent of whether or not we keep a seperate quote section for now. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 05:32, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

That way, we could use the quotes to demonstrate her views. This might also be a good opportunity for some NPOV discussion about whether or not her views are being misrepresented or something. Use quotes for that as well. Then we could open up the Criticism section with something along the lines of "In addition to her often controversial views, many people criticise Ann Coulter because... yada yada yada". <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 06:39, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My thoughts on quotes</span></h2>
<p>Sorry to jump in so late, but I thought i'd add another voice to this.</p>
<p>I believe the quotes should stay. Quotes are as NPOV as you can ever get provided they are accurate and in context. If they are not accurate then they should be corrected, if they lack context then context should be added. There's no need to delete them.</p>
<p>Yes, a point could be reached where an article has too many quotes, and this article does have a lot of them, but I do not find them excessive because each them contributes to understanding what Coulter is all about and it does so in her own words.</p>
<p>As for the quotes being very negative, that's simply a result of Coulter saying a lot of negative things. She makes her living criticing Democrats and the media and others whom she disagrees with and there's nothing wrong with that. It is simply here style and the quote section is naturally going to reflect that. Still if people feel that the quote section should include more positive or uplifting sentiments from Coulter then the solution seems to me to to add some "positive" quotes, not to remove the ones that are there now.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 22:26, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OTOH I notice that the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Franken_2e2d.html" title="Al Franken">Al Franken</a> quote section has been moved to Wikiquote and the most potentially offensive one has been deleted so I guess if liberal editors have to sanatize the controversial comments of of liberal commentators then it's only fair that conservative commentators do the same. <i>sigh</i> Wikipedia is doomed.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 22:34, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>How many encyclopedias offer a "quotation" section in an article as large as this one? A few quotes works, an entire section dedicated to the quotes doesn't give it the feel of an encyclopedia. There's already a large criticism section. Put some "shocking" quotes in there. There's already a large non-criticism section. Put some "not shocking" quotes in there. But the section is pointless and NOT encyclopedic and is only put in there "to demonstrate" how she writes.

<dd>Kizzle, no offense, but what's your point? Clearly I can't edit anything, since the page is protected. And I wouldn't want to just change anything without discussing it on the talk page first, so that there's a consensus. And if you read my paragraph, I never said let's <b>expand</b> the quotes <b>into</b> paragraphs. I said remove a lot of them, and work a few others into other paragraphs in the article. What other article on wiki has such an extensive quote section? Does it apply to authors? If quite a few authors have an extensive quote section in their articles, by all means have a quote section in Ann's. She IS an author. But as far as I know, quote sections are dedicated wikiquote, which most authors have links to in their articles. Coulter's quote section is uncalled for, because it's not that hard to point a little mouse to the wikiquote link and click on it to get a picture of how Ann Coulter writes.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 16:26, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No one offered an objection to my entry, and because of length and lack of defense, I removed a vast amount of the quote section, and directed the article to Coulter's wikiquote. Six quotes is still a large amount, but I hope I picked out enough from her own writings and enough to demonstrate her way of writing so that everyone will get over the tragic loss. I dare say it might be difficult to do...you know...dragging that little mouse over to the wikiquote link...<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 16:05, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, for reasons of length and consistency, I tried to shorten the article. I removed a lot, and tried to copyedit as much as I could (there were a whole lot of "which"s in the article). I especially removed large amounts from the Al Franken section, because if people want an extensive explanation of his commentary on Coulter, they can check out the article for his book. This article is on Ann Coulter, not on her critics. I also removed some paragraphs that I felt didn't need to be in there, because it was basically reiterating statements that could be made in about two sentences. I was aiming for concise, removal of bias, and still NPOV. If someone has a question about the removals, I'm more than willing to discuss.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 13:09, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's the deal with this Canada/Vietnam War section? At the very least, the way it's written is certainly not "criticism" of Coulter. It's more like "controversy". And from my point of view, it doesn't seem to prove any point of serve much of a purpose, nor do I really think it had any lasting impact on Coulter. What does it prove? That she's been wrong before? Well, I think we can all agree she's been wrong <i>at least</i> once before. So my question to everyone is, can I remove it, or at the very least, move it out of the "Criticism" section and into a different one, like the Paula Jones 'controversy'?

<dd>Well, originally the statement about her being accused by critics of being just plain wrong about an easily verifiable fact was supported with a few examples; for instance that the new york times didn't print anything about dale earnhardt's death until a week later. But they all got chipped away as being too trivial too mention. For whatever reason, rather than chip away at her "blame Canada" statement, somebody decided to argue the case. Now it has a life of its own, without any connection to the rest of the article. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:16, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I took out the bit about blowing up the New York Times because it appears at least two other times in the article, including later in the same paragraph. I removed '(supposed)' because there is no supposition involved. The sentence says that Coulter has stated this. She has. I removed '(jokingly)' because it is a POV opinion and the passage already specifically says that some claim Coulter is only joking with these comments... that BELIEF is included and should not then be re-inserted as 'fact' in the conflicting opinion. Finally, I removed 'their leaders' because while Coulter DID only advocate killing Muslim leaders she suggested converting ALL of them to Christianity. As written the sentence indicates she wanted to kill some muslims and convert others... true. As revised it had indicated that she wanted to kill some muslim leaders and convert others... false - she said to kill them all. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 10:36:44, 2005-08-17 (UTC)</p>

I don't think that anyone would consider Coulter "conservative" in the literal meaning of the word (radical would be more apt).

<p>Responding to <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> (Cathyleftwing obviously needs to read up on NPOV, or at least attempt to understand it), the label is a conclusion that is entirely POV. The issue is entirely relative to where you start from, issue based. You are correct that "conservative" generally fits into the same POV category, but in this case dealing with one person, I think it reasonable to label her that. As for "right wing", it has perjorative connotations (that is why the attempt is being made by left wing POVers). Why not "right of center"?

My rationale is always consistent, and "left wing" is just as POV. Even if I wrote article about Cathyleftwing, I would not state it as so in the article.

<dd>I don't hold anything against Cathy except for reactionary reverts. I guess this is the problem when any old editors (obviously more than Cathy) can edit Wiki and they can't comprehend encyclopedic writing or what NPOV means (except when it does not correspond to their POV). Even worse when editors do not read prior posts or take time to think about them. I respect Cathy's right to think what she thinks or to think that Anne Coulter is evil or to think she is the greatest thing. And it is fine to say so on this talk page. But it has no relevance to what should be on the article. The fact that she thinks or anyone thinks that Coulter is right or left wing is irrelevant. Let me go back to what I said several times, putting a label on anyone requires a POV, so by definition it violates the standard. And I am not making an argument for the label "conservative" as <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> keeps wanting me to do. It is also problematic, and, yes, perjorative in some limited cases, but far less so than "right wing." And genius <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> has his own labels for everyone. Perhaps we should get rid of the NPOV policy and make it an GPOV policy (Guettarda POV). He can separate out everyone. How? Because he knows. Ok, I admit, this is getting rediculous, but so is not understanding NPOV. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 04:28, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still haven't heard any concrete reason for the demand that Coulter be described as "conservative" rather than "right-wing". If "right-wing" is more accurate, then it doesn't matter if the term is perjorative. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:24, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The wikipedia article on right-wing to which the coulter reference is linked is not particularly pejorative, and seems to me more accurate. Joe Lieberman is conservative; Ann Coulter is rightwing. Her rightwingitude is not what people mainly take her to task about; it's her style. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:26, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> I'm thankful to you for forgiving my honest mistake in posting on your User Page. But yes it is true, I am "new" around here but I am not new to life, or to the politics of our great nation, the fact of the matter is I am a "compassionate" Republican who has voted in every election since 1976 and am one who feels strongly in revealing "the truth"....wherever that may lead or be...good or bad. Saying that Ann Coulter is <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-Wing_da8f.html" title="Right-Wing">Right-Wing</a> is no great insult to her, it is merely revealing a rather "ho-hum" fact, given her outlandishly ignorant comments she has made in her writings and television appearences over the years, her "over the top", reactionary comments have done more harm than good to those truly conservative Republicans and a large number of sensible Democratic's across the aisle, such as Joe Lieberman for one, for anyone to call me "reactionary" to my measuredly calm and thoughfully placed edit(s) on Ann Coulter, does an injustice to my intelligence, in the years since I graduatuated <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale</a> I have had a wonderful exsperience as a teacher at a small college in New England. I do not need to be coddled or lead about by the nose on a ring...in having a open roundtable discussion here on these important edits I always try to maintain a NPOV (and I do understand what that means here on Wikipedia all too well , now) and never resort to name calling, for what good does that ever do?, and that brings me back to the point of this paragragh, from a NPOV Ann Coulter is not a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">Conservative</a>, she is a <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-Wing_da8f.html" title="Right-Wing">Right-Wing</a> reactionary commentator, and shes proud of it!, well good for her I say, but it doesnt mean that I think ..."shes evil"... just a little far our there from the rest of us in GOP or sensible Democrats, and yes from all of the majority of moderate Americans citizens who truly care about our country and who have the eyes and brains to see the exstremists for who and what they are on both sides of the aisle. <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalom.html" title="Shalom">Shalom</a>!

<p>"Conservative" is the most commonly used term for Coulter, and the most NPOV. "Right-wing" is often used frivolously and pejoratively, and hence is less encyclopedic.69.217.124.190 23:37, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please read this section, we've addressed each of those issues. Namely, "conservative" is pejorative, and "right wing" is apparently more accurate. Further, on what basis do you say that "conservative" is the most commonly used term for Coulter? Is being common the same as being correct? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 00:04, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the section first. "Right wing" is inherently POV-pushing and a less encyclopedic term.69.209.232.89 03:54, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What POV does the use of "right wing" push? Is "conservative" a POV-free term? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 04:34, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have addressed these issues and they were entirely misstated by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a>. They both require a judgment based on an editor's POV -- and we see what POV Willmcw has. "<b>Right wing" is worse because it is intentionally POV</b>. "Conservative" is not usually intended to be POV, but the only way to label someone with a one word label, is to make it also POV. And to answer the POV definition question, <b>the term "right wing" is always used to denote an extremist</b>, the reason the POV pushers are intending to label this subject. <b>Note their objection to the term "right of center" above</b> -- it does not allow them to insert their POV --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 04:58, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe you should change the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">Right-wing politics</a> article if you believe that you have an accurate understanding of things. Left-wing and right-wing convey far more information than "conservative"...from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservativism.html" title="Conservativism">Conservativism</a> "<i>In western democracies, 'conservative' and 'right-wing' are often used interchangeably, as near-synonyms. That is not always accurate, but it has more than incidental validity. Certainly the enemy is in both cases the same: the political left. (Although left-wing groups and individuals may have conservative social and cultural attitudes, they are not generally accepted, by self-identified conservatives, as part of the same movement). On economic policy and the economic system, conservatives and the right generally support the free market, although less so in Europe than in other places. Attitudes on some ethical and bio-ethical issues - such as opposition to abortion - are accurately described as either 'right-wing' or 'conservative'.</i>" But a term which can lump Coutler with environmentalists and Russians longing for the days of Lenin...is a term that may be overly broad, and in the interest of clear communication should probably not be used. So yes, I have a POV - my POV is that <i>clear accurate communication</i> should be paramount in an encyclopaedia. If this is something that you are opposed to, maybe you are in the wrong place. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:47, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My thoughts, Coulter probably does not mind being called "right-wing". I don't think it is such a POV term. Why does it matter if she is called "conservative" or "right-wing"? Both are accurate, and both are going to be seen as POV by someone (see: "Liberal" v. "Progressive", etc.) --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 16:19, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
