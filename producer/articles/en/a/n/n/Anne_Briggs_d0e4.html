<p><b>Anne Patricia Briggs</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>), known as <b>Anne Briggs</b>, is an <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk singer</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Briggs_d0e4.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Anne Patricia Briggs was born in <a href="../../../t/o/t/Toton.html" title="Toton">Toton</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottinghamshire.html" title="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. Both her parents died while she was still young and she was raised by an elderly aunt in Nottinghamshire.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> she cycled with a friend to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. They stayed overnight with <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Fisher_13c9.html" title="Archie Fisher">Archie Fisher</a>, who was at that time prominent in the revival of folk music in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and, through him, she met <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Jansch_ba27.html" title="Bert Jansch">Bert Jansch</a>, who had just begun to compose his own songs. Jansch and Briggs had an instant rapport and were to remain influential on one another for several years.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trades_Union_Congress_d168.html" title="Trades Union Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> passed "Resolution 42", a resolution to devolve cultural activities outside of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. To implement this resolution, playwright <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Wesker_b9e8.html" title="Arnold Wesker">Arnold Wesker</a> was appointed as the leader, with <a href="../../../e/w/a/Ewan_MacColl_a3c0.html" title="Ewan MacColl">Ewan MacColl</a> and <a href="../../../a/2E/l/A.L._Lloyd_7415.html" title="A.L. Lloyd">A.L. "Bert" Lloyd</a> heavily involved. Calling themselves "Centre 42", they organised a tour around <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, hoping to involve local talent at each stop. At <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham.html" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> MacColl heard Anne Briggs singing "Let No Man Steal Your Thyme" and "She Moves Through The Fair", and promptly invited her to perform on stage that night. She became a full member of the tour and recorded the same two songs on an album recorded live in Edinburgh later that year.</p>
<p>By this stage, Briggs had become somewhat remote from her aunt, and decided to leave home, just four weeks short of her eighteenth birthday. Centre 42 gave her an administrative job in their offices, liaising with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatres</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery.html" title="Art gallery">galleries</a>. She soon acquired the contacts she needed to pursue her own musical career.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Briggs_d0e4.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings of folk music career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings of folk music career</span></h2>
<p>Anne Briggs visited the main British <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_club.html" title="Folk club">folk clubs</a> which were then becoming well-known: The Troubador, The Scots Hoose and various Irish music venues. At his time, the emphasis at such venues was on instrumental folk music, and singing was regarded as merely a pause between tunes. A young <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christy_Moore_cb07.html" title="Christy Moore">Christy Moore</a> heard her and was inspired to give more emphasis, in his own music, to singing rather than playing jigs.</p>
<p>She became loosely associated with the Scottish folk musicians who were sometimes regarded as part of the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippy.html" title="Hippy">hippy</a> culture: Bert Jansch, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incredible_String_Band_891f.html" title="The Incredible String Band">The Incredible String Band</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Palmer_ff5e.html" title="Clive Palmer">Clive Palmer</a>, for example. Briggs and Jansch lived together in a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squat</a> in <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl%27s_Court_150c.html" title="Earl's Court">Earl's Court</a> before moving together to a house in Somali Road, London, where <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Renbourn_2ecc.html" title="John Renbourn">John Renbourn</a> lived, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Young_Tradition_efb1.html" title="The Young Tradition">The Young Tradition</a> also lived for a time. Jansch and Briggs had some resemblance to each and were so naturally close that they were often mistaken for brother and sister. It was Briggs who taught Jansch the traditional song "Blackwaterside" which he recorded on his "<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Orion_2bed.html" title="Jack Orion">Jack Orion</a>" album in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>.</p>

<p>Anne Briggs began her recording career by contributing two songs to a thematic album, "The Iron Muse", released by <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topic_Records_3cde.html" title="Topic Records">Topic Records</a> in 1963. Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd sang on the tracks, and Ray Fisher made a brief appearance singing along with Briggs. An <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extended_play.html" title="Extended play">EP</a> "The Hazards of Love" was recorded in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. It was an early inspiration for both <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_Tabor_27c0.html" title="June Tabor">June Tabor</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Maddy_Prior_4723.html" title="Maddy Prior">Maddy Prior</a>.</p>
<p>At about this time, Anne Briggs entered a relationship with a Scotsman who proved to be violent towards her. She was rescued from this relationship by <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamish_Henderson_5205.html" title="Hamish Henderson">Hamish Henderson</a> who accidentally bumped into her and invited her to join Louis Killen, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Swarbrick_8f1d.html" title="Dave Swarbrick">Dave Swarbrick</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Armstrong_d3b3.html" title="Frankie Armstrong">Frankie Armstrong</a> for a recording project. This resulted in the album called "The Bird in The Bush" which is still regarded as one of the best collections of traditional erotic folksongs recorded in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Briggs_d0e4.html" title="Edit section: Johnny Moynihan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Johnny Moynihan</span></h2>
<p>While touring England, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dubliners_d3c2.html" title="The Dubliners">The Dubliners</a> met Anne Briggs and decided that she would be the perfect musical partner for a folk singer they knew in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, called <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Moynihan_8c29.html" title="Johnny Moynihan">Johnny Moynihan</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> they accompanied her to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and for the next four years she spent her summers there, travelling by horse-drawn cart and singing in pub sessions. During the winter months she earned money by touring English folk clubs. Her time in Ireland introduced her to the solo "<a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_nos.html" title="Sean nos">sean nos</a>" singing style heard in the songs of Irish folk artists, and this was an influence on her later singing style, when blended with the elements of traditional English music which she had already taken up.</p>
<p>She was notoriously wild at this time and there are many stories, from this period, about her antics, such as pushing Johnny Moynihan and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Irvine_b522.html" title="Andy Irvine">Andy Irvine</a> out of a hay loft and, on another occasion, jumping into the sea at Malin Head, Donegal, to chase seals. In an episode of Folk Britannia (a documentary history of UK folk music) aired in 2006 <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Thompson_148e.html" title="Richard Thompson">Richard Thompson</a> recalled that he only ever encountered Anne Briggs twice; and on both occasions she was drunk and unconscious.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> Johnny Moynihan and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Irvine_b522.html" title="Andy Irvine">Andy Irvine</a> formed <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweeney%27s_Men_f637.html" title="Sweeney's Men">Sweeney's Men</a>. Anne Briggs joined them on tours and learned to play the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bouzouki.html" title="Bouzouki">bouzouki</a>, at that time a rare instrument in the British Isles. She wrote "Living by the Water", which was to appear on her 1971 album, accompanying herself on the instrument.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Briggs_d0e4.html" title="Edit section: Reluctant star">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reluctant star</span></h2>
<p>The folk-rock impresario <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Lustig_4fa9.html" title="Jo Lustig">Jo Lustig</a> signed up Pentangle in 1968 and a couple of years later took on Anne Briggs. Through his influence Anne performed along with the folk-rock group <a href="../../../c/o/b/COB_b368.html" title="COB">COB</a> at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Festival_Hall_614a.html" title="Royal Festival Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>.</p>
<p>In the same year, she recorded an album, "Anne Briggs", which was released by Topic. It consisted mostly of Briggs singing traditional unaccompanied songs, but Moynihan plays bouzouki on one track. Later that same year, a second album, "The Time Has Come", was released on CBS which finds Briggs moving away from the mainly acapella style of her previous recordings, instead opting to flesh out the songs (mostly written by Briggs) with acoustic guitar. The <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> had broadcast a film of the Watersons in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> "Travelling for a Living" and Anne had made a brief appearance in the film. <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lal_Waterson_2e57.html" title="Lal Waterson">Lal Waterson</a> joined Briggs as a vocalist on the album. Sales of "The Time has Come" were, however, dismal, and it was dropped from CBS's catalogue, finally being re-issued in 1996.</p>
<p>Early in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> she recorded a third solo album "Sing a Song For You" with instrumental support from "<a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragged_Robin_e3f4.html" title="Ragged Robin">Ragged Robin</a>", who were a folk-rock band assembled around Steve Ashley. The album includes Moynihan's song, "Standing on the Shore", previously recorded by Sweeney's Men. She was pregnant at the time with her second child. Her confidence was at its lowest ebb and it was to be her final studio recording. By the time it was issued, Briggs was living in the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrides.html" title="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>. The album sank without trace until <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fledgling_Records_1186.html" title="Fledgling Records">Fledgling Records</a> re-issued it in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, when it was acclaimed by folk music aficionados as a lost gem.</p>
<p>She became a market gardener and avoided all contact with the music scene. When Bert Lloyd died in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> she was persuaded to sing in a memorial concert. Despite coaxing from some of the brightest names in British folk music, she refuses to return to the studio.</p>
<p>There are several anecdotes and photographs of Anne Briggs in the book "Dazzling Stranger" by Colin Harper (2001).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Briggs_d0e4.html" title="Edit section: Influence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence</span></h2>
<p>Anne Briggs' musical legacy is her significant influence on the work of other musicians, rather than recognition by the general public. Her earlier partner, Bert Jansch, who described her as "one of the most underrated singers", recorded Briggs' songs (including "Go your way, my love" and "Wishing well") on four of his albums. She was also his source for several of the traditional songs which he recorded, including "Blackwaterside". Jansch's instrumental accompaniment to this song was later copied, virtually note-for-note by <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a> and recorded as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mountain_Side_f38f.html" title="Black Mountain Side">Black Mountain Side</a>.</p>
<p>Briggs' compositions were played and recorded by Pentangle: for example, "The time has come" appears on their "Sweet Child" album. One of Briggs' songs, "Mosaic Patterns" (which she herself has never recorded) was recorded by blues singer, Dorris Henderson. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Denny_5a13.html" title="Sandy Denny">Sandy Denny</a> wrote a song in tribute to Briggs, called "The Pond and the Stream" on "Fotheringay" (1970).</p>
<p>Her name continues to be praised by younger singers — <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza_Carthy_945d.html" title="Eliza Carthy">Eliza Carthy</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Rusby_9ff7.html" title="Kate Rusby">Kate Rusby</a> and lead singer of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altan.html" title="Altan">Altan</a>, Maired Ni Mhaonaigh, for example. More recently <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Greig_f67a.html" title="Charlotte Greig">Charlotte Greig</a> and the Scottish band <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Yorkston_and_the_Athletes_7a8a.html" title="James Yorkston and the Athletes">James Yorkston and the Athletes</a> have cited Anne Briggs as an influence on them. David Tibet of Current 93 also recently mentioned her in an interview.</p>
<p>A song on <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Orton_92af.html" title="Beth Orton">Beth Orton</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comfort_of_Strangers_462a.html" title="Comfort of Strangers">Comfort of Strangers</a>, 'Shadow of a Doubt' is cited as an ode to the song 'You go your way', the chorus being somewhat directly lifted.</i></p>
<p>In 2001, PG Six (founding member of New York's enigmatic musical collective Tower Recordings) released a version of 'Go Your Way' on the 'Parlor Tricks and Porch Favorites' album (See AMI014 on <a href="http://www.amishrecords.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.amishrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amishrecords.com/</a>)</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the Richard Thompson song "Beeswing" was written with Briggs in mind.</p>
