<p>Let's try this again. How much mention should this article give to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a>? Personally I think it's adequate right now. This article should briefly alude to CE, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> should host the entire discussion (referring back here for any other details). In particular, this article should not be making any claims that are not already in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a>. squell 18:48, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Common Era should not be mentioned in this article any more than it is already, or even less for all I care. Since this 'Common Era' business is simply a <b><a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a></b> for the original <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">Anno Domini</a> terminology, it deserves no more than a small mention on this page. Over on the Common Era page, however, the <i>Anno Domini</i> must be overtly referenced due to the fact that it is the original terminology, that in which <i>common era</i> stemmed off. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickA_389d.html" title="User:PatrickA">PatrickA</a> 00:13, 24 December 2005 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since nobody seems to have an interest in this issue without the instant reward of seeing the article change, I have <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html#Anno_Domini_.28talk_.C2.B7_history_.C2.B7_watch.29" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">requested unprotection</a>. squell 16:10, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That was not an invitation to start another round. During the last week nobody stepped up and complained about the protected version or proposed alternatives, so it appeared to have the closest thing to a consensus here. squell 03:46, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it just me, or does anyone else think that BC and AD should be replaced with BCE and CE? I was kind of surprised that, this being an encyclopedia, everything is marked otherwise. Sorry if this has been mentioned before. SprSynJn 23:46, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The easiest answer is: <i>Yes, it is just you.</i> The more accurate answer is tedious and not very satisfying, but can be found in triplicate <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECommon_Era_f491.html" title="Talk:Common Era">here</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EEras_bee2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Eras">here</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_BCE-CE_Debate_bb4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/BCE-CE Debate">here</a>, and probably other places, too. squell 15:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see, thank you. Although my original question was rhetorical, as it is obvious that I am not the only person in this world who believes so, your answer seems to actually imply that you are sure it is just me. Funny. SprSynJn 17:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm more implying that the subject isn't really worth bothering about, looking at the volumes of fruitless debate it has already generated. squell 21:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I took the liberty of adding that After Death was an incorrect translation of the abbreviation. Being constantly flammed on forums when ever I bring up it's true meaning is getting rather old. Look fine? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shiadon (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shiadon_f32e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shiadon">contribs</a>) 14:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>The point about AD not meaning After Death is already mentioned in the "Popularization" section, so I have removed it from the introductory paragraph. This should be discussed in the "Address After Death" section of the talk page. It would be great if someone could find a reliable source that says that "After Death" is a widespread error. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 16:11, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the reference to Cunningham and Starr (1998), forgive my ignorance but who are they? A google search turns up nothing. So why are these unknown people quoted here, and in any case, who cares what they think? The comment and reference is entirely out of place in this article, and so, for that matter are most of the references and external links, which aren't about AD, but are about the controversy of AD vs CE. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 22:51, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks at first for several copyedits you made after me. You can be sure that I attempt to write without faults. But it's true, if I know, that's an article <i>of Joe Kress</i>, I'm reassured. I know, he'll reread and correct obvious defects. Thanks again.</p>
<p>With your version I'm consenting except two points:<br />
<i>You deleted:</i> "...and – not at least – to the fact that until now, the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_calendar.html" title="Solar calendar">solar</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> has always been considered to be astronomically the most correct one <sup>1</sup> <i>(see article: <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_year.html" title="Tropical year">Tropical year</a>)</i>." Imagine the hypothetical case, Christianity would not have "inherited" Caesar's calendar, but a lunar calendar like the ancient Roman or the better Greek Metonian lunar calendar: I'm sure at least after the Renaissance, men of the Early Modern Time would not any longer have accepted a such one lunar calendar for civil use.</p>
<p><i>You see:</i> The Gregorian calendar fetches his force not only in "the (<a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a>) <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tradition.html" title="Tradition">tradition</a>", but also <i>clearly by the fact</i>, that's a <i>solar</i> calendar. Because it is a solar calendar, it's <i><b>definition</b></i> must be close to the tropical year or as the case may be the vernal equinox year.</p>
<p>That's the second point where I not agree: <b>definition</b> vs. <i>approximation</i>. Like the julian year is clearly <i>defined</i> 365.25 days, the gregorian year is also defined 365.2425 days. That this definition should be the close to the tropical/vernal equinox year to be widely accepted is obvious. Also, since we know that neither the vernal equinox year nor the tropical year is stable over times, such <i>calendar year definitions</i> are always <i>approximations</i> respectively to the astronomical realities. However it is doubtless the matter of <i>definitions</i>.</p>
<p><i>A minor point:</i> concerning the Persian calendar you added "which is very close to the vernal equinox year". We should at least add "present" because in Khayyám's lifetime, the vernal equinox year was sth. like 365.2423&#160;days.</p>
<p><i>Outside:</i> I didn't verified who added the "Cunningham and Starr" reference. Like <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> above, I don't know who they are? A lexicon which I ignore, or who else? Do you know more, Joe?</p>

<p>P.S. <i>Out of topo:</i> One day when we both will have time and notion, I would appreciate to discuss with you the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_coordinate_system.html" title="Celestial coordinate system">celestial coordinate systems</a>, because the current <i>vernal equinox reference</i> in these coordinate systems, seems me to be antiquated, perhaps worse. It seems me, nowadays as unacceptable, like it is – in modern scientific consideration – e.g. a New Year's Day trying to be fixed at the real phenomena of solstice or equinox. These celestial coordinate systems dates of a time, when science thought both that the equinoctial and the tropical years are identical and that this length is invariable over times.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For the "Cunningham and Starr" reference:</i><br />
There's a (too) lengthy talk section about it above; they have (apparently) written a book about 'interfaith dialogue'. The addition at that time helped to stem POV pushing (from either side) in this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the other respects:</i><br />
I was tempted last night to remove even more than Joe Kress did (but decided to wait); for the simple reason that the era isn't directly related to the Gregorian calendar, but the other way around. AD was also used with the Julian calendar, and wouldn't the supposed Revised Julian calender also use it? Conversely, no AD vs. CE debate is about astronomical accuracy, obviously.&#160;;) The statement about the 'Revised Julian calendar' seems a bit too brief anyway, as its accuracy is actually worse. squell 14:28, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hallo Squell. We dialogue for the first time, but sometimes I saw your contributions. Thanks for your reply.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <i>the content</i> of the "Cunningham and Starr" statement, I'm not against to let it in the article. Effectively, this should be the sense of the "C.E. mode": signalling that the enunciator not necessarily has "faith in Christ". <i>(Me, personally, I don't like suchlike "cosmetics". Because, however named this Dionysian Era, it is and will be the Christian era, the Anno Domini era. The rest is an attempt of prescribing terminology in a <a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a>. Seldom justified and mostly ignored.)</i> Only I demand me whether it is reasonable to explicitly referring to these two widely unknown authors, or if it would be better to freely formulate the current content.<br />
On the other hand, the modern Common Era is now, I.M.H.O. the years since the 365 first days of 1792, the appropriate, common <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_zero.html" title="Year zero">year zero</a> of the Modern Time, the adequate modern era for all citizens, all around the world, whatsoever their religious convictions. <i>(Like already you read it perhaps, on my user page.)</i> But because this "crosscut saw definition" of my friend Michael Florencetime is – at the present time – victim of the perhaps most scandalous and iniquitous censorship of modern times – <i>the last and ultimate defence for the appearance of an unchanged <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a></i> – we can't instantaneous insert this nor in the corresponding Wikipedia articles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You are right, A.D. is not a Gregorian invention, since the Gregorian calendar is the reformed Christian, julian calendar. <i>You wrote:</i> "the 'Revised Julian calendar' [offers an] accuracy [...] actually worse". Depending which accuracy you mean. For Christian Easter date calculations your statement is just. But for a good civil calendar, there is no objective reason to privilege the <i>vernal equinox</i> – since the civil society is not subordinated to the terms of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicaea_a44c.html" title="First Council of Nicaea">Nicaea Council</a> regulating Easter dates – quite the contrary: any modern civil calendar must be orientated to the <i>real tropical year</i>. What uses it to try maintain the vernal equinox at its date <i>(thereto see also Peter's table at <a href="../../../y/e/a/Talk%7EYear_zero_e4c6.html#Nobody_uses_Gregorian_calendar_before_AD_1582.2C_October_15th" title="Talk:Year zero">Talk:Year zero</a>)</i> if all your other beginnings of seasons and the whole year hilariously diverge, by applying a exceptional common year rule out-dated since five or six millennia?</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you think you can rewrite the section on the common era, using neutral language and avoiding weasel words, <i>I</i> won't demand that the references be kept. However, this does mean that whatever you 'freely' formulate might again become subject to disagreement between others.</li>
<li>Easter cares about the vernal equinox, so you have to judge a christian calendar by that. The distinction between VE and mean tropical year is totally irrelevant for any civil calendar, because no single civilization will last long enough to see the seasons diverge. Regardless, an article which discusses an era is simply not the best place to put this information. squell 18:59, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
For the <i>section on the common era,</i> I don't have intention to rewrite it now. We'll see together how to formulate it later without "again become subject to disagreement between others".</p>
<p>You are right, and I don't have any reproach, neither to the Anno Domini era, nor to the Gregorian exceptional common year rule. Except the fact, that currently <i>more than two third</i> of our contemporaries, in reality, never lived a second in the Anno Domini era, despite of the "vintage" printed on our tax computation. That's a fact. If it's an old lie: <i>All living in the 21th century.</i> However it's a lie! What in <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bede.html" title="Bede">Bede</a>'s time in Europe, perhaps wasn't false, nowadays in our global civilisation is false.</p>
<p><i>You wrote:</i> "The distinction between VE and mean tropical year is totally irrelevant for any civil calendar, because no single civilization will last long enough to see the seasons diverge." I demand me, what notion you have about science. In science, everywhere else, the most accurate value is the best one and this value have to be applied. Relativisms like: <i>"But see, it's only the question of just 27 seconds a year. And with a supplementary exceptional leap year in about 1200 years, we can correct all this."</i> are neither convincing nor justified. In our now modern times, everywhere else, we calculate rather in picoseconds than in nanoseconds. <i>Nor it's true:</i> I ignore what age you have, but probably you have good chances to see all the "seasons diverge" in the Gregorian calendar after A.D. MM.XLVIII–II–XXVIII. <i>Neither that's for the first time in our history.</i> Beyond, "an article which discusses an [solar] era" has also to discuss (briefly) its astronomical base, implied by its present rules, which try to synchronise the calendar year and the astronomical realities.</p>
<p><i>The truth is:</i> The Dionysian Era <i>is not</i> a chronology, but a <i>chronicle</i>, in which perhaps you and me live, but surely not all human beings all around the world;<br />
<i>and moreover:</i> The only chronology existing before, the astronomical, so-called Cassini chronology, is <i>not continuous</i> and ironically <i>astronomically shifted</i>.</p>

<dd>I thought that my extensive edit would trigger a reaction. I agree with Squell that I didn't delete enough. Discussion of any calendar's accuracy has no business being in an article about an era. It belongs in the calendar's article, not here. Thus even the footnote should not be here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not accept your argument that the Gregorian calendar's accuracy contributes to its acceptance. I would go even further than Squell in saying that as long as the astronomical cues of a particular calendar do not appreciably change during the average person's lifetime (usually shorter than a civilization's lifetime) then its accuracy is acceptable. Note that the Julian calendar was not changed for over 1500 years because its drift relative to the seasons was not noticeable during any person's lifetime. Furthermore, as far as the average person is concerned, a calendar's sole purpose is to label a day, to give it a name, to distinguish it from other days. The average person does not care whether it is 'accurate' or not. The astronomical cues are those inherent in the calendar, thus even though the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_calendar.html" title="Islamic calendar">Islamic calendar</a> has a substantial drift relative to the seasons in only one decade, there is no reason to reform it because its accuracy relative to the seasons is not its purpose. That drift was obviously no hindrance to agricultural activity because Muslims not only did not starve during the Middle Ages, but prospered, becoming one of the greatest civilizations on Earth during that period, while Europe with its solar calendar languished in its own "Dark Ages". Similarly, the Chinese Empire, which used a mathematical lunisolar calendar, prospered, also becoming a great civilization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I completely disagree that people of the Renaissance would have changed an inherited lunisolar calendar into a solar calendar. They might have improved it in light of their greater knowledge of astronomical parameters, but they would <i>not</i> have changed it. A solar calendar is not inherently superior to a lunisolar calendar. Indeed, it is decidedly inferior because something as obvious as the Moon's phases is ignored. You underestimate the power of tradition (or religion). It was European tradition, or economic and military power during and after the Renaissance, which caused the Gregorian calendar to be adopted worldwide. Its 'accuracy' or lack thereof was no consideration whatsoever. Either the Julian calendar or an inherited lunisolar calendar would have been accepted worldwide if Europe was still using either today. The modern version of the Chinese lunisolar calendar is exquisitely tuned to modern astronomy, whereas most other calendars make do with cyclic approximations. Of course, this makes it quite complicated to calculate vis-a-vis cyclic calendars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Definition vs approximation depends on the calendar. The numbers you cite are inherent to a particular calendar, but the only calendars I know of which <i>define</i> astronomical parameters via numbers were the traditional Chinese calendar and the several Hindu calendars, where everything was numerical because these calendars included mathematical astronomy within themselves. Basically, an entire book was needed to describe each calendar. Their numbers were not approximations, they were definitions. Other calendars don't include mathematical astronomy, certainly not the Gregorian or Revised Julian calendars. Your numbers are the result of applying mathematics to the rules of the calendars, the rules themselves do not even mention those numbers. The papal bull <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter_gravissimas.html" title="Inter gravissimas">Inter gravissimas</a> is the source of the Gregorian rules, without any mention of 365.2425 days. Because these two calendars do not include mathematical astronomy, their numbers are necessarily approximations of the astronomical parameters which the calendar supposedly follows. The Persian calendar is slightly different. It could be based on a cycle or an astronomical parameter. The Omar Khayyam rule which you mentioned was a cycle, hence the number was an approximation. But the present Iranian calendar requires that the true vernal equinox occur within 12 hours of the midnight beginning of Norouz (New Year's Day), hence it cannot be an approximation—it is a definition, though not a number per se because the calendar does not include mathematical astronomy within itself. The French Republican calendar has a similar situation—either its New Year's Day was determined by some cycle or it was the day of the autumnal equinox. Some of these matters have been discussed on the <a href="http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calndr-l.html" class="external text" title="http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calndr-l.html" rel="nofollow">CALNDR-L</a> e-mail list, which you should join if you have not done so. All the world's calendars are discussed. Unfortunately, that includes endless discussions of proposed reform calendars, which, for the most part, are advocated solely by their authors.</dd>

<p>I agree, that calendar's accuracy should be discussed <i>extensively in calendar's article</i>, whereas in the <i>era article</i> a <i>short mention or footnote</i> is sufficient, however also inevitable to round out the era article.

<p>First, one trivial preliminary remark, only for avoiding all misunderstandings: Certainly none calendar system never defines the <i>tropical year</i> nor it can try it. This is an obvious banality.<br />
However each calendar system, ipso facto, inherently, always <i>defines</i> a length of time interval, the respective <b>calendar year</b>. Whether this number of days is explicitly mentioned (in the case of the Gregorian calendar) in "Inter gravissimas" or not is <i>completely irrelevant</i>, since every twelve years old schoolboy, mastering elementary basic arithmetic, can accomplish the calculation of the inherent, underlying <i>definition of this calendar year</i>.</p>
<p>Now, the comparison with the tropical year or the VE year is quite more difficult for the reasons we all know. Especially it supposes to dispose of a <i>good value</i> of this one. The Gregorian calendar is obviously based on the so-called "Alfonsinischen Tafeln" dating from 1252, giving 365d 5h 49min. 16s for the VE year. But <i>before</i> the "Rudolphinischen Tafeln" of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Kepler_c2ce.html" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> in 1627, the knowledge of the length of the V.E.Y. – regarded till our contemporary time as identical to the TY – stayed in <i>various not all-too accurate</i> approximations. 1627, i.e. 45 years after the Gregorian reform of 1582.</p>
<p><i>In summary:</i> I can confirm you, that calendar systems are <i>also</i> "approximations of the astronomical parameters". But <i>at first</i> they <b>define the calendar year</b>. This always and absolutely independent of any astronomical accuracy, independent of their respective ability to synchronise the calendar year and the astronomical realities <i>the closest one possible</i>.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don't know, as well as you, the "traditional Chinese calendar and the several Hindu calendars". Perhaps you can give me some good, study worth Internet sources?<br />
Thanks for the CALNDR-L link, which I ignored. But certainly I will not sign on there, exactly one for the reasons you indicated.</p>
<p>At last to: "The Omar Khayyam rule which you mentioned was a cycle, hence the number was an approximation." et sqq.<br />
No, it's not a clear definition, but an <i>empirical</i> proceeding, which needs "high-priests" – here in the form of astronomers – to predict when the next solstice/equinox will occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can pose even <i>serious problems</i>, if this one occurs accidentally <i>very close</i> to midnight.</li>
<li>On the other hand <i>for the past</i>, historians always have to consult listings.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the reason why neither the Persian Norouz nor the old French Republican calendars for example can <b>not</b> be considered to be <i>modern, scientific calendar systems</i>.</p>

<p>For this topo, let's share our discussion into "solar vs. lunisolar" and more "accurate vs. less accurate".</p>
<p><a name="solar_vs._lunisolar" id="solar_vs._lunisolar"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnno_Domini_7159.html" title="Edit section: solar vs. lunisolar">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>solar vs. lunisolar</i></span></h4>
<p>We have to remind that – <i>I'll say this less for you than for third readers. I know very well that you, Joe Kress, are a great specialist in (not only) calendar systems</i> – the about twelve <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_moon.html" title="New moon">new moon</a> per year are entirely a coincidence, without any cause and effect wrt. the "year of seasons", i.e. the tropical year. For this reason, the proceeding of the old Egyptians: to liberate the <i>calendar year</i> from the old, auxiliary new moon counting and to orient towards a trivial day counting was progressive, "modern" and scientific.</p>
<p>Even a Metonic lunisolar calendar with a better synchronisation with regard to the year of seasons, however maintains a false semblance. <i>(Also this better synchronisation can only be accomplished <b>after</b> the cognition of the TY.)</i> Therefore, it has well been the old Egyptians who via their calendar definition found the very first <i>scientific</i> approximation of the tropical year: <i>365 days exactly one</i>. Later on, because they maintained their <i>calendar year definition</i> unchanged during millennia. So, once more, the old Egyptians found, could calculate, the second <i>scientific</i> approximation of the tropical year in human kind's history: 365.25 days. This value was the recognised calendar-year-value till 1582, October 4.</p>
<p>Quite an other question is the emotional or, as the case may be, religious relatedness to the lunar calendar system. Self-evident I have – I suppose, I hope just like you – no any sympathy for astrology. Also wrt. the moon – which has of course real gravitational influences to earth – I behold all lunar horticultural rules e.g. for unproved superstitions.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, just like you, I suppose, I like the moon. Highty-tighty! Today it's the waning gibbous moon.<br />
The Gregorian calendar has the advantage, that it connects both, the solar and the lunar calendar. <i>(I studied years ago the conventional Gregorian new moon's dates – listed in not very well-known tables – and compared with the astronomical dates, and I found that even more than 400 years after, these dates are quite good, rather close.)</i></p>
<p>However, any modern, scientific, civil calendar must be solar.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnno_Domini_7159.html" title="Edit section: accurate vs. less accurate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>accurate vs. less accurate</i></span></h4>
<p>The study of calendar systems and their respective astronomical accuracy is a section in the science of chronology.<br />
Chronology is <i>well</i> a science. Presently it is universally considered as an auxiliary science of history and astronomy.</p>
<p><i>If I resume your second and third paragraphs, as well as what Squell said before, you assert in substance:</i><br />
<b>Science can be false, as long as none remark it!</b></p>
<p>Aye, perhaps you both are right! Till none remark it, often hidden errors stayed in many sciences during very long times. Till someone perceived it.</p>
<p>This someone was my friend Michael Florencetime, who clearly recognised in 1989, that a correct scientific chronology must first define a <i>common</i> year zero. Quite not for instance a <i>leap</i> year zero. This is a fact. Like Michael is also a <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poet</a>, etymological: "s.o. who <i>acts"</i>, he decided to define this civil, historical and astronomical year zero, 1½ year later <i>with a saw!</i></p>
<p>This definition, because it is the correct one – the only way to have, at last, an accurate, continuous chronology – will stay in history of humankind.<br />
This, completely independent of the <b>length of interval</b>, the ponderous world will take to recognise it and to understand that <i><b>the Cassini chronology now is scientifically refuted</b></i>.<br />
<i>(A religious chronicle can't neither be refuted nor scientifically confirmed. Each one who would enterprise to proof this or that, ipso facto, would disqualify himself as scientist.)</i></p>
<p>Let's go back to the my "argument that the Gregorian calendar's accuracy contributes to its [present worldwide] acceptance":<br />
<i>You wrote:</i> "That drift was obviously no hindrance to agricultural activity because Muslims not only did not starve during the Middle Ages, but prospered..."<br />
<i>and:</i> "Similarly, the Chinese Empire, which used a mathematical lunisolar calendar, prospered, also becoming a great civilization."</p>
<p>I never would contest that. Indeed the Islamic civilisation "becoming one of the greatest civilizations on Earth" during the European Middle-Ages. Also Arabic astronomers, at these times, were among the most preeminent of their time. Nevertheless, it was completely prohibited for these astronomers to propose any new calendar system since it was the Prophet himself who once explicitly stated in the Coran, that the twelve-moon rule has to be applied without exception. As you know, the Islamic tradition not distinguishes between religion and civil society. So any reform in calendar was excluded, albeit science prospered. Also the Chinese Empire prospered, notwithstanding they used the older lunar calendar system.</p>
<p>After Middle-Ages, during the Renaissance and the Early Modern Time European men turned towards sciences. <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> is one of the most famous results of this paradigm shift. It seems me completely excluded that any hypothetical inherited lunisolar calendar would have survived these times up to nowadays to be still recognised internationally!</p>
<p><i>You wrote:</i> "A solar calendar is not inherently superior to a lunisolar calendar." I don't agree. <b>Scientifically it is!</b> Because the aim of a modern calendar system is last but not least to count the "year of seasons". Scientifically, <b>the moon has no part in the recurrent year of seasons</b>. Absolutely no part! Therefore, if we want to count the "recurrent years of seasons" – in our scientific present – we have to exclude categorically any reference to the moon phases in the length of the year. <i>(Months and weeks as approximated references to the older lunar system are acceptable, since they are less important sub-units.)</i></p>
<p>But we can speculate and argue as long as we want, one fact remains: <b>The present internationally recognised calendar system <i>is a solar</i> system.</b><br />
This should be not a coincidence, but a result of common acceptation, because everyone knows that the tropical year and the solar calendar are related.<br />
Lunar calendars, with sometimes thirteen lunar-months years, are auxiliary means to simulate the accuracy with regard to the <i>consistent solar calendar</i>.</p>
<p>All this supports: apparently the fact that <i>the solar Gregorian calendar has been considered to be astronomically correct</i> contributed to its acceptance.</p>

I haven't responded to this until now because I don't think this amount of discussion is a good way to debate a relatively minor point. About the only thing at stake here is the Wikipedia policy of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>.</p>
<p>Your argument, I <i>think</i>, boils down to that, if the muslim world had assumed the dominant position during the industrial age, their calendar would not have been as succesful as a world calendar because it is purely lunar; agreed, but the logical result would have been the usage of a solar calendar coupled with a Anno Hijri count, as in Iran. We would have soon be celebrating the start of the year 1385.</p>
<p>In any case, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> requires us to not just construct a plausible argument, but to make verifiable statements. We do have real life evidence (the Persian calendar) of an epoch being used with different calendrical systems, as well as calendrical systems ignored even though they are more astronomically correct, which suggests that the link you claim isn't there.</p>
<p>Of course the dominance of the christian epoch has everything to do with the christian calendar being the de facto standard; this deserves mention, but it is a stretch to suggest that this is due to any reason other than that the culture which promulgated it is the most dominant one in other areas as well. squell 01:06, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thanks Squell for your arguing reply,</p>
<p><i>Indeed, that's my argument:</i><br />
Sciences, while in ancient times prospered, during the Middle-Ages, for different reasons, lied idle in Europe.<br />
Since <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> times the thinkers in Europe fortunately reappropriated sciences.</p>
<p>[The fact that afterwards and surely up to nowadays, the results of these cognitions alltoo often are used to<br />
make "quick money" without any other considerations is another problem what we can't discuss right here.]</p>
<p>This rediscovery of sciences in Europe during the AD 15th century is a well-known and accepted fact and <b>not a hypothesis of an "original research"</b>.<br />
Lastly even the Gregorian calendar reform is a result therefrom. Rome knew, people won't eternally accept a calendar giving false results. After the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> and in the historical context of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Reformation_17e4.html" title="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> – yet armed with new, better cognitions in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> – the Roman Catholic Church behold auspicious the end of the 16th c. to reinforce its intellectual and spiritual hegemony. Rome placed the "bet". Rome won the bet. Even if some protestant and anglican states in Europe made 170 years and more for this understanding.</p>
<p><i>In other words:</i><br />
Not only any lunar civil calendar would <i>not</i> have survived up to nowadays – I'm glad that on this point we are in agreement – but also any preserved Julian calendar. What happened if Rome would not have become acting in 1582? I can't answer you on this historic fiction. But impossible that the Julian calendar would have survived up to our present scientific times! Everywhere in sciences, the mankind aspires incessantly toward higher precisions in all standards. <b>Also that <i>is not</i> a hypothesis of new original researches</b>, but this is prouvable.</p>
<p>An error in calendar of nowadays almost 11 minutes and 15 seconds yearly, would never, never be accepted by any <i>modern, reasonable</i> citizen.<br />
If the Christian Era would have remained in <a href="../../../s/o/s/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria_c847.html" title="Sosigenes of Alexandria">Sosigenes</a> calendar rule, then the internationally recognised era would not be the AD era anymore and this since long times. That's sure.</p>
<p><b>The actual de facto standard of the Christian Era is due to <i>both</i> the world-wide dominance of Europe (traditionally counting in Anni Domini) since the end of Middle Ages <i>and</i> to the fact that the Gregorian calendar rules makes that the Christian solar year is in error of "only" 27s/year.</b> Because everyone knows that the <i>Christian calendar</i> can't be modified successfully without Rome, the world hitherto consoled itself: This error is "only" <i>almost 27 milliard nanoseconds</i> per year.</p>

<p>PS.&#160; However, I'm astonished that you qualifie accuracy in calendar as a "relatively minor point".<br />
Does this mean that you juge it acceptable to live in contradiction to the astronomical realities, respectively in ignorancy?</p>

<p>My comment after reading the discussions, then the article are as follows. Seems like some of the article is off topic or beyond scope. One reason there is so much debate is, I think people are loosing context. There are facts on both sides of almost all the issues, in many cases both side’s facts are correct, that is because the context is the issue, until that is resolved we will not achieve a satisfactory resolution to the discussion or the article. I am not as educated or knowledgeable as most people who have contributed so I will go with a few simple observations.</p>
<p>Is this an article about Anno Domini? Or is it an article about the western history of calendars? If it is about the former and not the latter then the depth could be reduced some. Possibly a separate article on the histories of calendars. Western and Eastern and why not while we’re at it even French. In history “to the victor go the spoils” so with the Roman dominance at a critical time in history, and the rise of the Catholic church in power and as the keepers of knowledge and history in the West it is no surprise that their thumbprint is on many things. I am not meaning to make a judgment on right or wrong, just acknowledging it is how it is.</p>
<p>When someone goes to the Catholic/Christian article, that is not the place to discuss Buddhism or Hinduism and their relative merits. I want to say with much less ferocity than the previous sentence that the synonym part of the article does not seem to belong. Especially the C.E. it is an accepted alternative but this is the Anno Domini article. Mentioning C.E. with a hyperlink seems adequate. That’s my input please think about scope and remember it is about Anno Domini not a debate about the merits of A.D. vs. C.E. Baddog 06:13 02/11/06 CST</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're confusing calendars with dating styles. This article doesn't discuss a calendar, but a year numbering system. In that context it is relevant to discuss its history and the schemes it replaced. What else is there to discuss? Second, replacing the terse summary of CE with a simple "See also", as you seem to be suggesting, would probably not do justice to the gravity of that subject and its relation to AD. squell 15:06, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK I tried, I appreciate your input, I acknowledge my shortcomings, and I guess I was wrong! In an article dealing with Anno Domini I assumed it might be about AD but I guess I’m wrong. With all do respect to you I now say, “This article doesn't discuss a calendar, but a year numbering system” In my nieborhood that is a calandor! If it is different in yours fine. Come on! Still this article is Anno Domini, I bet that burns you.You are either an aithiest or born again. I have no more coments! simply you do not get it!!! BADDOG 02/11/10:10 CST&#160;!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, hard to argue with that. But it's a pity you don't take the oppertunity to enlighten the <i>others</i> reading this what exactly AD means, since clearly, they too are missing something. squell 20:56, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On 03:04, 14 February 2006 Tothebarricades.tk put a NPOV tag in the article with the summery comment:<br />
<b>BC/AD is an outmoded dating system increasingly fading from scholarship - and yet this article acts as if BCE/CE is an anemic PC "synonym".</b></p>
<p><i>The concerned paragraph currently states:</i></p>
<p><big><b>Synonyms</b></big><br />
<b>Common Era</b><br />
Anno Domini is sometimes referred to as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> (<i>CE</i>) instead. This term is often preferred by those who want to avoid the association with the Christian era. For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. ... do not presuppose faith in Christ and hence are more appropriate for interfaith dialog than the conventional B.C./A.D." When the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> abolished the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> era in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, it adopted Western years, calling that era <i>gōngyuán</i>, 公元, which literally means Common Era.</p>
<p><br />
Hi User Tothebarricades.tk,</p>
<p>Primarily I didn't contribute on this paragraph. Recently user Squell made some changes, but the content is older.<br />
By naming the PR of China, Squell hushed up all the former East European states from <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Germany_0033.html" title="East Germany">GDR</a> to <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> which habitually used CE instead of AD, "to avoid the [explicit] association with the Christian era". You can call this era – counting from AD I – however you want. Nevertheless, this era <i>is and will be forevermore</i> the Christian era.</p>
<p>The article speaks about "interfaith dialog" etc. But in my eyes this (ex-)CE is indeed – like you say it – "an anemic political correctness synonym", an inconsistent "euphemism".<br />
In your summery you quoted the word synonym. What does this mean? That AD and CE (in this sense) are synonym, can't be seriously contested.</p>
<p>You wrote "outmoded" and "increasingly": Do you have therefore statistical or other proofs or is it a very personal impression, opinion?</p>
<p>Your NPOV tag seems me not justified.<br />
Quite another question is, whether our new C.E. is not really "AD minus 1792"!&#160; <i>(cf. my user page)</i><br />
In this sense, user Tothebarricades.tk, a good continuation of our current year CE 214 also for you.</p>

<dd>Should this article really contain an inclusive list of all countries that use CE? No, that would be <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a>. The PR of China seems the prime example of non-Jewish usage of CE, however. (Although it would be pretty hilarious if someone started advocating in favour of CE by using the claim that 'That's how the GDR did it!';)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have simply removed the NPOV tag. <i>This article is not about the common era</i>. Note that my edits to the Common Era section were an expansion of how you (Paul Martin) refactored the older content, so please don't hint that I am the one responsible for it — I am getting <i>sick and tired</i> of these continuing rounds of war edits by people who feel they need to prove a point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I'd like to ask Paul Martin why he has insisted on the latest edits he made to this article. Both Joe Kress and I have voiced discontent over them previously, and you have pretty much re-instated them. And at that, most of those edits were to parts which were not really in need of any repair. Since they've been already discussed and do not appear to reflect consensus, I hope you have a convincing argument. squell 12:22, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For the first point, you misunderstood. The mention of the former practices in some other states was an argument against the pretended terms of "outmoded" and "increasingly".<br />
<i>In no case</i> this was a disguised criticism vs. you. No, this article should <i>not</i> "really contain an inclusive list of all countries that use CE". That's neither necessary nor required.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you was right by removing simply the tag. Me, generally, I try to have at least an exchange with the user placing it, except in cases of obvious ill will or vandalism.<br />
With my edit on 21:56, 20 January 2006 I simply shifted the Common Era mention under the new title Synonyms along with the old content of the former article Anno Salutis redirected by me up to here. Never, never I "refactored" anything in this part, not an iota!&#160; Effectively <i>this point</i> is provable. I won't see you "sick and tired", but the contrary.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have become rather pro-active on this article with respect to NPOV. In the past, I also have quickly reverted edits that <i>only</i> moved the Common Era section out of the introduction — or, inversely, tried to make it more prominent — because I deem such edits to be only motivated by a desire to promote a certain point of view. On the other hand, your edit (which also moved that section), while I object to some of it, was clearly a substantial effort to improve the article.</dd>

<dd>By the same reasoning, I think it is improper to slap a POV notice on an article, without evidently reading the talk page (<i>Mention of CE</i>, is at the top) or leaving an explanation there. And by his edit summary, I judged it being motivated by a desire to push a point of view. If anyone disagrees with that, they can always re-add the tag — hopefully accompanying it with an explanation <i>what</i> exactly is being POV.

<dd>For the point: "accuracy contributes to its acceptance". Joe Kress let me (here above) a long reply on 07:45, 25 January. I prepared my own reply in the evening of Jan. 27th, which was ready at 98%. Too tired to finish it, I decided to go to bed. In the morning of Jan 28th, I was very disappointed to see that Joe already "removed footnote per talk" without waiting – not even 72 hours – for my reply.

<dd>Common era is hypocritical and that's not my "POV". It is simply a cover of the AD system without acknowledgment of such, to offer non-Christians some false sense that the World Calendar is not based in Christianity. If you argue that it's used only to remove connotations with "in the year of Our Lord", that could be accomplished with "Christian Era" rather than "Common era"...calling it "common" is hypocritical in the sense of using the Christian calendar without acknowledgement. "Christian calendar" wouldn't be hypocritical. Not to mention, if non-Christians don't want to be saying "our Lord", either deal with it or make your own calendar and see how far that gets in the public sphere.

<p>Who is <i>offering</i> this to other cultures? Most are adopting the number for the year on their own. I really do not care if you think <a href="../../../c/e/_/CE_7a86.html" title="CE">CE</a> means <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Era_73ed.html" title="Christian Era">Christian Era</a>, or Christina Era - either way, usually only the abbreviation gets used &amp; it is less offensive than AD. There are lots of non-Xn calendars, but there is one calendar very much in <i>common</i> usage around the world. It would be very disruptive (&amp; meet even more resistance) to try to get the whole world to adopt some newly "invented" calendar. No matter what calendar is used, there has to be a pivotal year &amp; any year chosen would be seen as showing preference to some culture, so <a href="../../../c/e/_/CE_7a86.html" title="CE">CE</a> is the best alternative we have. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 06:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why is everything about "less offensive" with you cultural sensitivists? Don't you realize that if we brand everything to be "less offensive" that there would be no uniqueness left in anything at all? The <b>reason</b> that this is <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> is because Jesus was (traditionally believed to have been) born 2,006 years ago, why deny this for the mere purpose of "cultural sensitivity" or "political correctness"? As that you don't care if I call <a href="../../../c/e/_/CE_7a86.html" title="CE">CE</a> "Christian era", nor do I care if you use the Christian calendar or how you refer to it, but this does not mean you, or others with your views can superimpose your silly euphemism over the AD system. Can you <i>please</i> tell me how using AD and BC is more offensive and wrong than having <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Day_0d60.html" title="Christmas Day">Christmas Day</a>, the celebration of the <i>nativity of Jesus Christ</i> a <i><b>federal holiday</b></i> in the United States? No, you can't, because that is just as POV. The reason they do it is because it is tradition and accepted among the public.

<p>I recommend converting all dates in the wikki to BC/AD notation. I believe it to be both more accurate and easier to read than the recent politically correct terms BCE and CE. I do not like the re-writing of many text books to include the CE BCE garbage as it is just a recent 'invention' meant to make some people feel better.

<p>I'M CONFUSED!!! just curious when the politically correct version of BC... hold on... sorry...BCE and CE (for AD, RIGHT?) started...??? when on earth did all this change take place? so i was watching TV the other night, and saw some reference to some historical event that happened in "such-n-such" year BCE. i immediately called my husband from the other room &amp; asked what the E was for. he had no idea. i was really confused (and still am)... that was a few weeks ago, but i was just on my temple's website looking at the calendar of upcoming meditations &amp; saw a history given of one of the meditations &amp; BCE or CE came up as part of the date, and i said to myself "THERE IT IS AGAIN! WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?" so i came on here, wikipedia, for an answer... though really didn't get one. why is it that things you grow up with in everyday life suddenly CHANGE into unknown terms? i mean, i still call things: toilet paper (rather than "bathroom tissue")..., chairman/chairmen, actors, black people, white people, BC/AD (even though i'm not a christian &amp; never have been), DIED (instead of "passed away" or "expired") i mean, for most of these things, it's just goofy to change them into something less human. i don't really see the BC/AD thing as really changing on basis of "political correctness" as most of the changes based on "political correctness" are hysterical &amp; merit much laughter in their new terms. but BC/AD? i never saw it coming. sure, i gave it much thought, but that was just always what it was called. i have never been a christian, but i still didn't care one way or the other. i think all these nutty changes are crazy. i don't really mind BC/AD being changed to BCE/CE (right?) but i'll still call them BC &amp; AD. that's what i've learnt over the past 40 years. it's like changing the word "BREAD" to the word "HYRMROK". i'll still call it BREAD. just like all the other word/term changes. how come noone ever consults the public before they change a word or term? how annoying &amp; selfish of the word-changin elite! anyway... no, really, when did this change come about? eta: i don't necessarily find the actual representation of time to be entirely accurate in terms of BC/AD. but neither would be BCE/CE. so my slothlike objection or ridicule of the BCE/CE isn't based on accuracy. hell, i don't care what's actually accurate. history happened in the PAST. and we'll all DIE here soon enough, so what does it matter when? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.73.54.254 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.73.54.254_55c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.73.54.254">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>You have hit the nail on the head. CE started out as a tiny movement. The problem is, nowadays, as soon as any small movement reaches 5%, they suddenly think they are the majority, and the other 95% are the minority.

<dl>
<dd>Whether or not conception and birth occur in the same year depend not only on how long gestation is, but the dates of conception, birth, and beginning of the year. It is widely understood that the Annunciation and Nativity are celebration dates, rather than historical dates. A person researching these issues might use the ceremonial dates, or might attempt to estimate the actual dates. Also, there were many dates in use for the beginning of the year. The Alexandrian computists of Easter table used the Diocletian era, which they treated as begining on August 29. So for example, if the conception was celebrated March 25, a new year began on August 29, and the Nativity was celebrated December 25, conception and birth would occur in different years. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 01:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dionysius does not mention the date of the Incarnation, not the month, not the day, not the AD year, and not the Diocletian year. The only ways to relate his years to other systems is (1) to note that the first year of his table, AD 532, follows the last year of the table he based his work on, Diocletian 247, and (2) to note that his cover letter is dated both AD 525 and as the consulate of Probus Junior.</dd>

On P. 778 they write "if Dionysius, whose calendrical rules or <i>argumenta</i> make September, not January, the beginning of the year, treated incarnation as synonymous with birth (as his early followers, including Bede do) rather than conception...", indicating it is an open question whether Dionysius considered the conception or the birth to be the Incarnation. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 00:20, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Incarnation era:</b> an era reckoned from the supposed date of Christ's Incarnation; usually that of the year AD, otherwise called the Nativity, Christian, or Common era, but in an Alexandrian, Coptic, or Ethiopic context an era reckonned from 29 August AD 8. (The distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late ninth century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e. the Annunciation on 25 March; see 'Annunciation style'.) --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 00:36, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An online Latin text and translation of Dionysius' Easter table and arguments <a href="http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> quotes the beginning of his first argument as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

or<br />
If you want to find out which year it is since the <b>incarnation</b> of our Lord Jesus Christ... (emphasis added)</p>

<p>So it would seem an editor who wanted to use only the word <i>birth</i> would either have to challenge this web editon of Dionysius, or prove that <i>birth</i> and <i>incarnation</i> were synonyms during Dionysius' time. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 01:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>and one who wanted to use conception would have to show that incarnation meant conception - and there is the further problem that wikipeida cannot say Jesus was incarnated - just that he was believed to be incarnated.</li>

<dd>I agree that an editor who wanted to use <b>only</b> birth or <b>only</b> conception would have to demonstrate an exclusive meaning, otherwise both possibilities should be presented. I also agree that there is nothing in the translations of Dionysius that indicate what date he considered the year to begin. However, his Easter table and arguments do not mention AUC (years from the founding of Rome) and that is confirmed by Blackburn and Holford-Strevens p. 778 who write:
<dl>
<dd>The existing Alexandrian table being due to expire in 247 Diocletian (AD 530/1, hence current at Easter [5]31), Dionysius began with 532, thus instituting the era that we use today. However, nowhere in his exposition of his tabel does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, Olympiad, year of the world, or regnal year of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date, or even claim it as his own discovery, but treats it as an unproblematic fact, corresponding to current knowledge or belief.</dd>

<dd>The Latin words <i>Anno Domini</i> do not contain any element meaning "our". It means literally, IN (the) year of (the) Lord.

<dd>I understand that the Latin only explicitly includes the words "year" and "Lord". But I've always seen it rendered into English as "In the year of our Lord".

<dd>If you read a bit further on in the 2nd paragraph of our article, there is the longer phrase <i>Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi</i> ("In the Year of Our Lord Jesus Christ"). I actually don't know where this longer formula is used, since I have never seen it elsewhere, but at least the Latin is good: <i>Nostri</i> here is the word translating "Our". It is probably better to stick to the literal translation and not "assume" <i>Nostri</i> when it isn't there. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:39, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>STating that Anno Domini translates literally as "Year of Our Lord" is just plain incorrect and bad Latin. It doesn't matter how many sources you can come up with that propagate this ignorance. We should do better and use a literal translation. Including a citation for the ignorant mistranslation is not going to help; as we have seen the correct translation can also be cited just as easily. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens translation because <i>anno Domini</i> derives from the words in Dionysius Exiguus' tables "ANNI DOMINI NOSTRI JESU CHRISTI" through changing to singular form and shortening. When re-expanding the short form, it is reasonable to go back to the expression from which it comes. I wonder if Codex Sinaiticus would translate <i>ANNI DOMINI NOSTRI JESU CHRISTI</i> as <i>years of <b>the</b> Lord Jesus Christ</i>? Not that it matters, a person writing in a medium such as Wikipedia, where a person's expertise cannot be verified, cannot expect his or her characterization of an Oxford University Press publication as an "ignorant mistranslation" to be taken seriously. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:53, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(unindent) I admit I have not found a source that gives a step-by-step descripton of if, or how, <i>ANNI DOMINI NOSTRI JESU CHRISTI</i> was shortened to <i>anno Domini</i> and then to <i>AD</i>. However, I think we can agree that <i>anno Domini</i> is one of the latin names for the era we are talking about, and it should be translated as the correct "long form" English name for the same era. I don't know if we could find legislation adopting the AD era for official use in one or more English speaking countries back when the Julian calendar was in use, but we can find legislation for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in England: the British Calendar Act of 1751<a href="http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-British.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-British.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<p>Bear in mind that "(in the) year of Our Lord" appears many times in English - including the US Constitution. Must googlecount that vs "year of the Lord" sometime. Also remember that Latin does not use articles like English does, so we could never determine if "the" was a "correct" translation. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 21:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Either translation is acceptable. Latin doesn't have definite or indefinite articles (so you could translate <i>anno domini</i> as "in the year of the lord" or "in a year of a lord" or the other two permutations thereof), and Latin often didn't include possessive pronouns like "ours" or "mine". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.70.237.210 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.70.237.210.html" title="User talk:71.70.237.210">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.70.237.210_90ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.70.237.210">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Now, since the article does not claim Christian era is the only phrase for which AD is an abbreviation, and since one dictionary says AD is an abbreviation for Christian era, we would have to find a source better than Oxford University Press to justify JimWae's reversion. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>JimWae was right. "AD" is not an abbreviation of "Christian Era"—not in the true sense of the word "abbreviation". The particular dictionary you cited is careless in characterizing it as so. Oxford University Press publishes more dictionaries than I can count, some better than others. For resolving questions in which technical accuracy is at issue, a pocket dictionary is not a good choice. (For example, does your dictionary distinguish among abbreviations, contractions, initialisms, and acronyms in its word labeling?) --71.175.22.69 17:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To answer the question from IP address 71.175.22.69, no the dictionary does not distinguish among abbreviations, initialisms, and acronyms; it does label contractions (like <i>can't</i>) as such. Also, you have not posted a reliable source that describes the <i>Oxford Pocket Dictionary and Thesaurus</i> as careless, so I'll pass over the issue. So what kind of shortened form is <i>AD</i> when it stands for <i>Christian era</i>. Surely not a contraction or initialism. To try to see how the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> (3rd ed.) deals with English words with a short form based on Latin, I looked up <i>lb.</i> and found that is labeled as an abbreviation.</dd>

<dd>If you disagree either that <i>AD</i> is an abbreviation, or that <i>AD</i> is the short form for <i>Christian Era</i>, please find a source; I'd be happy to see it. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:29, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"AD" is not an abbreviation of "Christian Era" because it is not formed by shortening the latter. This follows directly from the definition of abbreviation. (The Encarta dictionary entry on abbreviation provides a clear explanation of what an abbreviation is. See <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/abbreviation.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/abbreviation.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.) "AD" is an abbreviation of "anno domini", and functions as an adverb. "Christian Era" is a noun phrase (and functions as a noun). "CE" is an abbreviation of "Common Era" (or "Christian Era" if you prefer) and functions as a noun phrase when used purely as a shorthand for its expansion. When used after a year number, "CE" really means "<i>in the</i> Common Era" (or "<i>in the</i> Christian Era"). --71.175.22.69 03:48, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that Encarta dictionary entry says an abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase, but it does not specify the process of shortening. Apparently, Encarta does not object to translating into Latin before shortening, because an entry for <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861625337/lb.html" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861625337/lb.html" rel="nofollow">lb.</a> says this is an abbreviation for pound.</dd>
<dd>I also note that Encarta says AD or A.D. is an adverb, so apparently they consider it a word in its own right. If we want to find a way to express this that covers all the dictionaries, this could get messy. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 04:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BC obviously stands for Before Christ and AD, Anno Domini but why is the former in English and the latter in Latin? If someone knows, could they add to the article please? <a href="../../../t/u/c/User%7ETuck99_4821.html" title="User:Tuck99">Tuck99</a> 07:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know why that is. You probably noticed that Anno Domini was invented in 525, while the concept of numbering years before Christ was invented by Bede several hundred years later. The fact that the two concepts were invented at different times may play into the difference in the abbreviations. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 17:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A google for "annis Domini" reveals a low number of uses in English. The search, of course, revealed only the uses in the full (rather than abbreviated) form. In full form, it appears to be used with multiple years ("annis domini 1993, 1996, 2004"), rather than with periods longer than a year. For cases I saw, it appeared BEFORE the years rather than after. While "7th Century in the yearS of our lord" improves the reading where AD comes AFTER the year, there are still syntactic difficulties with "in the years of our lord, 7th Century". The "info" was addded by an IP with no other edits, and subsequently used to justify removal of a paragraph from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> article. Still, some discussion of use of "annis Domini" would be appropriate for this article. Anno Domini existed first, then was abbreviated as AD. Some citation <i>might</i> be found for the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backronym.html" title="Backronym">backronymic</a> claim. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 06:14, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
