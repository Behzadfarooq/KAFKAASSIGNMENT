<p>RW - you should know better (being a member of the BAR and all) - you shouldn't go online posting information about people that you have current complaints against. You also shouldn't be posting links to "white supremacist" websites.</p>
<p>The most pathetic thing about A.L.'s and now also your campaign to spread misinformation on Wikipedia about ultra-nationalists is that these individuals like the spotlight and were never hiding in the first place. You are only stroking their egos.</p>

<p>As per Wikipedia's rules, I am notifying you that the image Northern Alliance &amp; Friends 6 has been tagged as badfairuse. Dogmatic 19:09, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Talk page for the photo in question contains my reason for tagging it as badfairuse. This would also apply to any other image from the Northern Alliance website. Dogmatic 20:59, 2006</p>
<p>I've just commented on the matter at the image talk page. Can you confirm that you uploaded the image from the NA site? If so, I fear it may have to be deleted. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 01:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll delete the first image momentarily. To the second: I'm not an expert on copyright either, but I imagine the most appropriate course of action would be to ask the LFP for permission. I believe there's a generic form available at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright</a>. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 01:31, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dunno, people on Stormfront seem to think it's him but - then again - you'd think the London Free Press would have covered it. Perhaps someone should call Randy Richmond at the LFP and ask if it's the same guy. BTW, we can include those photos as fair use, we just have to assert under the notice *why* they are fair use (ie non-commercial, needed to illustrate story etc). Homey 00:02, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello from Australia. Our article on <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">White supremacy</a> currently lists as contemporary white supremacists 5 Canadians about whom we do not have articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyler Chilcott</li>
<li>Craig Harrison</li>
<li>Peter Kouba</li>
<li>David Ruud</li>
<li>Tomas Szymanski</li>
</ul>
<p>(We do have an article about a quite different <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Harrison_94fd.html" title="Craig Harrison">Craig Harrison</a>.) I seem to recall that you added these names; if not, I hope that you know something about them. Are any of these people <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a> enough that we should have articles about them?</p>
<p>I ask this because I'm not sure Wikipedia should list names in such a context without providing (1) specifying precisely who we are describing as White Supremacists and (2) giving some evidence for that description. (Hmm. Another option is to add a link or two after each name to <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_Sources_f4fe.html" title="WP:Reliable Sources">WP:Reliable Sources</a> calling them White Supremacists, but that's a bad precedent for future vandalism.) Or perhaps we should remove those names (and restore them if we get articles about them).</p>

<p>AnnieHall, is there any reason you never do articles about the Terrorist Org. ARA,OCAP? You seem to be hellbent on doing articles on only Canada's Far Right and yet you seem to largely leave their opposition alone. Is this deliberate?</p>

<p>Hello Annie,</p>
<p>My name is Bill Noble. I'm messaging you to ask what your purpose here on Wikipedia is. At this point I'm afraid that I'm strongly under the impression that you are deliberately attempting to cast pro-White activism and activists in a negative light.</p>
<p>I signed up not too long ago in an attempt to make Wikipedia entries on related topics a bit more fair and objective. I've noticed most of my contributions in this vein seem to be evaporating. As I learn how to better use the features of this site, I backtracked the changes in the Glenn Bahr entry and found that you seemed to be claiming responsibilty for the removal of the term 'pro-White' from that entry.</p>
<p>Those who hate Whites and supporters of pro-White activism constantly try to infer that pro-White initiatives are hate-based. This is a false and hurtful accusation against the pro-White movement.</p>
<p>If you have any humanity or compassion in your heart, I hope that you will in future take care not to alter content in such a manner. In the long run, such proliferation of anti-White bias can cause a lot of real pain and even cost lives, in a world increasingly unfriendly towards White people.</p>
<p>Hoping you will try to be a little more considerate in future, Bill Noble</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I responded to your statement on your talk page, though I would add that it seems to me the pro-White activists you're defending may have cast themselves in a negative light since I'm simply writing about what they've done or said. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 01:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well Annie, I certainly won't deny that hate exists, or that it occurs in the rank and file of WNs. However, the occurence of hate in the pages of Stormfront hardly justify labelling Stormfront a 'hate site'.</p>
<p>Consider that White Nationalism is a cause which only needed to come into existence because the welfare and existence of the White race was in peril. The source of the peril lies in various non-White and/or anti-White groups, in a confluence of various contributing factors which can involve non-Whites who are not necessarily anti-White, and anti-Whites who are not necessarily non-White, as well as numerous non-White anti-Whites.</p>
<p>The definition of an anti-White is anyone who deliberately takes a course of action which is calculated to hurt the White race or any effort to preserve the White race.</p>
<p>Hatred, when it occurs, occurs for a reason. Many of those who hate Blacks do so because they have had negative experiences with Blacks. I myself might have reasonable grounds to hate Native Americans, as I've been assaulted by them often enough, most recently a couple of weeks ago. However, I make the intellectual choice not to hate them, because I see their behavior as being part of their nature, and thus, something they cannot help; they are violent and aggressive, and hate White people. There are exceptions, certainly; yet, there is also the rule to which those exceptions occur.</p>
<p>What hate you observe in sites like Stormfront is simply a natural response to the pressures of opposition, aggravation, and various other negative affronts non-Whites and/or anti-Whites commit against my people. Some WNs live near ghettos and have experienced violence at the hands of ghetto Blacks. an you blame them for developing negative opinions of Blacks as a result? And perhaps some fear, some resentment, some derision or contempt?</p>
<p>Other WN live near Native reserves, as I did, and have had unpleasant experiences there. Still others have been subject to violence by Asian gangs or various other ethnic delinquents.</p>
<p>None of this implies that all people of every non-White race is necessarily a bad apple. However, the fact that racial tension is naturally inherent in human beings means that forced integration or a 'program of multiculturalism' is going to expose people of one race to the dark side of other races.</p>
<p>If all races were separate, had their own sovereign territory and self-rule, and each took care of their own criminal element, then the word 'racism' would come to bear connotations of 'respect' instead of the connotations of 'hatred' that become apparent in the word's ciurrent everyday usage.</p>
<p>So long as White people are subject to having multiculturalism imposed upon them, without their consent, they are guaranteed to react to this cultural rape with strongly negative feelings and expressions.</p>
<p>If you want to end hate,</p>
<p>You must first end the rape of the White race.</p>
<p>It's either that or hurry up and slaughter us so that we are no longer present in this world to hate those who wilfully rape and slaughter our race.</p>
<p>- Bill Noble</p>
<p>P.S. If you should happen to peruse the Stormfront thread on Glenn Bahr's Wikipedia entry, you'll find some harsh comments I've made regarding you. These comments are based upon your apparent motives as viewed from my perspective. I see I was inaccurate in my guess that you'd avoid open discussion with the likes of myself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Yes Mr. Noble, I have been reading your post on the Glenn Bahr Wikipedia article with a great deal of amusement. You might wish to let “Teardown” (who I believe edits on Wikipedia as 8318) that there’s nothing that I’ve written about on Wikipedia that he himself can’t find online. There’s no inside information that I have access to (I wish I had access to such a source) and that the articles I write and edit are based on some very simple Google searches. They give me far too much credit."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>'... with a great deal of amusement'. This indication of condescension suggests that I may not have been far off with my comment that you wished to avoid speaking directly to us 'because that would give them credibility' and that you plan to abruptly cut off this discussion in the not-too-distant future. Perhaps your entire response was delivered for the express purpose of proving me wrong in suggesting that you'd avoid open discussion altogether?</p>
<p>I do agree that most of what you post does appear to be derived from the public domain, however.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"It seems to me that you want to have it both ways Mr. Noble. On the one hand you say that <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> is not a hate site, but on the other hand you say that if some White Nationalists do express hatred on Stormfront then they have a reason, and a good one at that, which you then proceed to vaguely justify."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps I didn't express my point clearly enough: the expression of hatred on a site does not define what that site is. Pro-White sites exist to help pro-White activists network with one another. The adversity we are beset with will inevitably lead to expressions of hatred. We are after all only human, and it is human to experience emotional reactions to things which confront us in life.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"You know that I can easily provide thousands of links to posts made by Stormfront members who use vile language to describe non-Whites and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a>. Yes, I know that there is a policy that such language is not permitted on Stormfront, but that policy is administered sporadically at best. At the same time anything critical of White Nationalists whom <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_cc55.html" title="Don Black">Don Black</a> favour is often immediately removed from the forum by Stormfront moderators. To me this implies tacit approval of such language and the attitudes that accompany the language since it is not often expunged immediately, if at all. If Stormfront is the respectable face of White Nationalism, then the VNN forum and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_and_Honour_0854.html" title="Blood and Honour">Blood and Honour</a> forum don’t even make an attempt. If you don’t consider Stormfront to be a hate site, then how about these other two <a href="../../../w/e/b/Websites.html" title="Websites">websites</a>?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>VNN - which I personally have posted on, indeed using blunt jargon - seemed originally to place stress upon freedom of speech over outward appearance. As much as I appreciate the freedom and the honesty inherent in such a prioritization, I can see all to well that it does result in a crude outward appearance. Though my chief reason for abandoning that site is their endorsement of the traitor Glenn Miller.</p>
<p>Blood and Honour revolves around the British Skinhead sphere, where the talk tends to be tougher than on this side of the Atlantic. Largely because their situation is tough enough to warrant such talk.</p>
<p>Stormfront may have ended up being something of a censored environment, but if the end result is something civilized and productive, I see no reason to complain.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"You said that White Nationalists who hate have reasons for feeling the way they do. I agree that they have reasons, but the question then is whether their reasons are justifiable. I’ve never been victimized by an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic.html" title="Ethnic">ethnic</a> minority in my life that I can remember. I have been physically assaulted by three white men though. I realize that this sounds like a contrived example, but it is true. Would I be justified in hating all whites? According to your logic, such hatred would be understandable. To me it would be ridiculous to condemn an entire group based on the actions of a small sample. So, I don’t hate whites because I was attacked by three white men, though I will say I’m not at all fond of those particular three white men."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Intra-racial violence would best be dealt with by tribal law, i.e. in a White society, White assailants would be executed or otherwise punished for their crimes. Chances are, with the current regime's approach, the White men who assaulted you got minimal sentences (if any) and are now free as a reward for their assault upon, and resultant partial alienation of, a White woman. Had you been non-White, likely they would have been worse off. You would be fully justifiable in feeling resentment towwrds those who assaulted you, but were they merely White? Or were they White drug addicts? Or White drug dealers? Or White whiggers? Chances are, these lot had something other than race alone to define them. Most well-balanced White men don't go around assaulting the women of our race. Depending upon your clarity of mind, you could end up hating degenerate White males, or you could end up hating men in general, to the point of becoming a lesbian. The clearer your intellect, the better focused your dislikes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Incidentally I do find it interesting that you claim that hatred by White Nationalist can be justified based on their negative experiences with minorities, and then say that Native Americans hate white people but provide no explanation. Since you seem to be saying that hatred occurs for a reason, I wonder if you’d explain the reason why Native Americans hate white people as you claim they do? If white hatred of Native Americans is justified, then is Native American hatred of whites justified? You said that you were recently attacked by some Native Americans? This would imply some animosity. Was their animosity justified?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Native Americans hate White people because we occupy the same space as they do. Hence the slogan: END THE HATE... SEPARATE! It isn't necessarily because we invaded and conquered their land; it's mostly because they live in such close quarters with us. Different races need separation from each other if they are to be peaceable with one another, as delineated in the Twenty-Sixth Precept: <i>Nature has put a certain antipathy between races and species to preserve the individuality and existence of each. Violation of the territorial imperative necessary to preserve that antipathy leads to either conflict or mongrelization.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I have to say I’m worried about your definition of what an anti-White is. Using the Blood and Honour forum again as an example, there is a Canadian moderator who I won’t name who routinely calls for killing minorities and Jews if it means the advancement of the Aryan Master Race. Should he carry though with his boasts, and if you knew that he committed such a terrible crime, would you report his crime to the police? If you would turn him in then aren’t you, in a way, engaging in an anti-White act according to how you define it?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure if you grasp all the fine points of survival in the face of natural law, but the bottom line is: the end justifies ANY means. If anyone finds themselves feeling threatened by pro-White activists, they need to look at what they're doing to become the focus of our anger. I'm sure that in the current social environment, there are multitudes of individuals totally oblivious to the harmful consequences of what they percieve as normal and acceptable everyday behavioural patterns. But what if they paused to consider the eventual consequences of their actions? What if they realized that their actions negatively impacted the survival and/or freedom of another people? Might they not feel remorse at the reckless endangerment they were participating in, and seek to change their ways?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I find your comments about multiculturalism to be interesting but I have to question them. <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> is a very multicultural city and I know the posters on Stormfront rail about that fact and the murder rate in the city. But the murder rate in Toronto is a little over 2 per 100,000 people. In London the murder rate is around 2.4 per 100,000 and it’s at least as multicultural as <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> if not more so. However <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, which is far more monocultural, has a murder rate of 22 per 100,000 people (at least according to 2002 numbers). Perhaps other factors are at play than multiculturalism? Levels of poverty and inequality? Maybe race has far less to do with crime than economic factors?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>No single factor can be pinpointed as the cause of any complex phenomenon. Multiculturalism is a <i>significant</i> factor, and the source of many negative eventualities, without any sufficient beneficial side effects to justify its being imposed upon a nation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I often think that those White Nationalists who express hatred towards non-Whites, and you yourself admit some could be described as hating non-Whites, feel the way they do because it’s easier to blame others for their own inadequacies. It’s easier to make an excuse for one’s failures than it is to think introspectively and come to the conclusion that, “Perhaps it is me after all.” Be honest Mr. Noble. When you read some posts on Stormfront by people complaining about how society is so unfair to whites, don’t you sometimes think, based upon how the poster presents himself, that perhaps the reason why that person is a failure is because that person IS a failure? You might not think this for all, or even most, but I think you’re intelligent enough to realize that you can’t blame multiculturalism for every sob story on Stormfront."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of those sob stories don't have anything to do with the poster being a 'failure'. It's probably debatable what a failure is. My own definition of the term might be someone who dies without reproducing, or someone who fails to avoid addiction to a non-beneficial, harmful substance. Many of the people on Stormfront have personally been victimized in one way or another by non-Whites or by the process of multiculturalization. Many of us are currently in situations where our liberty is at stake for no other reason than expressing our views, opinions and beliefs - I myself am looking at two years in prison, after a court date in late March 2007. That, and a lot of the other unreasonable persecution we have to put up with from the governments, media, manipulated public, and various other collossi that tower over us, certainly justifies resistance and protest from us.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: We seek SURVIVAL and LIBERTY. We resist our EXTINCTION and our OPPRESSION. And frankly, if somebody gets offended because we used a derogatory term to describe them, or because we express concern at their crowding us out of our communities, or they don't like the colors and symbols of the flags we fly, their taking offense doesn't give them a moral high ground over us. We are human beings, and that means we will be rude, we will be angy, we will be resentful, we will be desperate, we will sometimes lose control and lash out... we will not be shining angels smiling away blissfully accepting the tramp of the tyrant's boots crushing us into oblivion.</p>
<p>We are human beings being subject to a deficit of freedom and the means to self-preservation, and we will do whatever we have to do to srvive. We will also often do stupid and detrimental things, because to do such is one of humanity's inevitable shortcomings.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think I started to ramble at the end. I’ll post it anyways. I’m interested in your reply to what is likely the garbled ramblings of a sleep-deprived mommy. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 09:55, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not too much rambling, but the comment about reading my post 'with a great deal of amusement' was perhaps ill-advised. It comes across as an attempt to assert intellectual and/or moral superiority over the person being spoken to, and is not a productive approach to open discussion.</p>

<p>I have to say I'm absolutely blown away by this decision to sub an entire article. The only thing I agree with is the removal of information where <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> is a source. Since it only deals with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Lemire_d8bb.html" title="Marc Lemire">Marc Lemire</a>'s birthday it's can't be too difficult to find a better source. However, I fundamentally disagree with you statement that sources found on the Nizkor Project website is not acceptable. Most of the information from the Nizkor Project clearly show the provenance; government documents, newspaper articles, magazine articles, and primary sources (email correspondences). Even excluding the Nizkor Project, the majority of sources provided WERE government documents (Canadian Human Rights Tribunal) or from other legitimate sources such as <a href="../../../b/27/n/B%27nai_Brith_a3d6.html" title="B'nai Brith">B'nai Brith</a> and other similar sites. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Kinsella_5d74.html" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a>'s book, <i>Web of Hate</i> is well-known to accademics and law-enforcement agencies documenting the far right in Canada from the early 1980s (actually, before then as well) to the mid 1990s. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 03:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stubbing is a common response, and ought to be a lot more common, to problematic biographies of living persons. The key is that it is not sufficient to simply tag random junk with a fact-tag and hope for the best. In this case, I started out with the intention of just removing the stuff that appeared to be badly sourced, but the article was so badly written, with random sources plugged in here and there, that it was impossible for me to do it in one pass. So, I stubbed it, and now we rebuild it. I will help. But it seems like you know more about it than I do, so hopefully you can do it more quickly than I ever could. I have no objection at the moment to references to Warren Kinsella's book... but do you have a physical copy? Can you confirm the information? Could you perhaps quote from it directly?</p>
<p>I fully support the use of carefully quoted information directly from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, B'nai Brith, etc. For Nizkor, the main things I object to are allegedly archived usenet posts and email correspondences... we have no good way to judge what scholarly standards they used, and anyway those things do not seem to add much. There is plenty in the reliable sources. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 04:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could you please add <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Gostick_0f97.html" title="Ron Gostick">Ron Gostick</a> to your watchlist? One of his associates keeps rewriting the article with nonsense and I'm not always arout to catch it. <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimitroff_df4d.html" title="User:Dimitroff">Dimitroff</a> 15:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I thought I should inform you that both of these pages have been deleted, on the grounds of insufficient information. It may be adviseable to re-write and re-create them in the near future. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 22:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe the problem was that both pages included personal information that (i) couldn't be traced to a reliable source, or (ii) was inappropriate in and of itself. It shouldn't be too difficult to create new pages, if we take steps to ensure this problem doesn't recur in the future.</dd>
