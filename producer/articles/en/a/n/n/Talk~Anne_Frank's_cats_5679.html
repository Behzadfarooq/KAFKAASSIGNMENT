<dd>Personally, I am curious about the value of the article itself. The only thing this article presents is that a person loved her pet. 99% of pet owners fall into the same category.

<p>The absence of attempts at linking <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl_2ad9.html" title="The Diary of a Young Girl">The Diary of a Young Girl</a> to this or its earlier incarnation is telling. It signifies that this article has no relevance to the very subject (Anne Frank) that it inherits its shaky notability from.</p>
<p>Anyway: I propose a second AFD that actually will run its course with the acceptance that merging is a valid option "C". So as I see it the available courses of action are&#160;: KEEP,DELETE, or MERGE with <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl_2ad9.html" title="The Diary of a Young Girl">The Diary of a Young Girl</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_historical_cats.html" title="List of historical cats">List of historical cats</a>.

<dd>There's no need to bog down AFD with this case, if your actual goal is a merge. We just merge the two articles (including the old redirect from <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moortje.html" title="Moortje">Moortje</a>), and if no one reverts it, it's a done deal. There's no need (in my opinion) to over-bureaucratize it with five days of debate at AfD for an article that NOTHING links to. I can perform the move in a day or two once others have had a chance to weigh in. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 13:16, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to see it deleted and not merged, if it was up to me alone. If it's merged, Nae'blis and "no one reverts it" - well this won't happen, because I guarantee that I will revert it. The Anne Frank article goes into some depth in regards to her biography, her writing and her legacy. A mention of her cat is probably fair, but the article does not need a lengthy discourse of her history as a cat owner in general and "Anne Frank's cats" goes into such detail that to merge it into Anne Frank would greatly unbalance it. I would hate to see the cats discussed in more detail than, for example, her mother, or her sister Margot. I've read, apart from the diary, several biographical accounts of Frank's life and I was one of the main contributors to the Anne Frank article in it's current form. After all I have read of her, and it's been a considerable amount, I am left with no particular impression of her cats or her relationship with them other than that of any typical child with any typical pet. I barely remember them being mentioned and they seem to have been as much a part of the background as the furniture. They are mentioned in a very widely read work, and yet are not "famous" by any definition of the word. In writing the Anne Frank article, I attempted to be comprehensive but concise and removed a number of side issues and trivial discussions that personally interested me, but that did not have encyclopedic value. I did not trim these sections to create space for her cats to be discussed. In the overall scope of Anne Frank's life and writings, and the historical importance that we have come to place on this particular life, her cats are very, very minor. I would rather see "Anne Frank's cats" remain as it is, than see it merged inappropriately into the Anne Frank article. Please let us balance the content of the two articles before looking at a merge option as the two articles are not compatible. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 14:37, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this would be a bad faith nomination on your part - but go ahead. I have expanded the article and opened it out. As a teacher I think it is possible that someone might want the information contained in this article and, let's be honest, it would be out of place on the Anne Frank home article. The article is valid - as are the various articles about other very famous cats. This article is valid, the cats are notable (only 24 characters are named in teh Diary (possibly the 2nd most famous book EVER after the Bible.... notability in tonnes!Robertsteadman 17:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, its not bad faith, that why I proposed it, and didn't just nominate it. I think I'm clear on my intentions in my previous comment. If the article stays: others are going to stumble upon it and question its existence. If it survives an AFD it will be tagged as such on this talk page permanently as a seal of approval.</dd>
<dd>On another note: I think the article was better as just Moortje, now you just added it with filler of 2 even less notable entities. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 18:18, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well I diagree - the article works well covering all of the cats mentioned in the diary and with <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moortje.html" title="Moortje">Moortje</a> redirecting to this article. Perhaps you should read her diary and see that these play a significant part in the events detailed. Robertsteadman 18:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, does that mean you'd welcome all the kiddie hockey teams being AfD in the hope they get a thumbs up? Come off it, notable is notable and these are some of the most famous and most read about cats in the world ever! Robertsteadman 18:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Robert, your lack of good faith is disappointing. Please remember that Wikipedia works by consensus in matters not already decided by policy/law, and your constant sniping at the Hockey folks is not helping. Consider that this AFD may be a separate issue worthy of consideration, whatever your personal difficulties with the hockey WikiProject. For right now, I'd prefer everyone step back and let this article sit for a day or three until cooler heads can prevail. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 20:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would assume good faith had I not been trolled by a few of them, been subject of personal attacks and abuse and been put up for an RFI simply for nominating their kiddie team page. Put in context assuming good faith against people who seem to be acting against the best interests of WP and against its principles is pretty hard. Robertsteadman 20:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one ever said assuming good faith was easy. But predicating your "good behavior" upon the good behavior of others is a recipe for <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_assured_destruction.html" title="Mutual assured destruction">escalation</a>. Consider, if you will, that the (temporary?) presence of some verifiable, if minor, hockey teams, does Wikipedia no great harm. Similarly, the article here does Wikipedia no great harm by being here, which is why I haven't leapt up to AFD it on first sight. You getting worked up just alienates others and makes consensus harder to come by in the long run, I think. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 21:27, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only thing I'm slightly worked up about is the poor behaviour of certain posters - perhaps you should be having a word with them about their behaviour? As for a multitude of pointless articles about kidddie sport on WP being no harm - it is just the tip of a very big iceberg - let's keep the non-notable out. Robertsteadman 21:33, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of the tip of a very big iceberg, should we remove anything that is more or less locally specific information? If we eliminate local sports teams, the same argument applies for local political ridings, schools, landmarks, streets/highways, etc. Half of Wikipedia, frankly. Now that would be an impressive iceberg to break down. As far as the cats go, I would disagree that they are some of the most famous cats in the world. In fact, I would bet you would be hard-pressed to find very many people who could name them without having to look it up. The only thing they ever did was be named in a little girl's diary. Hardly notable. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 01:50, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"A little girl's diary" - rather more than that in the long run.... You disagree that they are some of the most famous cats in the world - and yet how many cats are more famous? Very few. And very few books are more famous. And yes, maybe half of WP should go - certainly there should not be a place for youth teams, non-notable schools, etc. Robertsteadman 07:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to ccwaters's comment <i>The absence of attempts at linking <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl_2ad9.html" title="The Diary of a Young Girl">The Diary of a Young Girl</a> to this or its earlier incarnation is telling. It signifies that this article has no relevance to the very subject (Anne Frank) that it inherits its shaky notability from.</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry but both this and the previous incarnation had wikilinks to Anne Frank and The Diary of a Young Girl - so, I'm afraid, you asserion is incorrect. Robertsteadman 17:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That says nothing - I really think this is a nonsense - someone is making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> becaus ethey didn't like their kiddie ice hockey team nominated for AfD, they trolled my contributions and are now trying to get theior own back. Totally pathetic.... but not unexpected. Other members of the <a href="../../../h/o/c/WP%7EHOCKEY_7a0a.html" title="WP:HOCKEY">WP:HOCKEY</a> project have been peraonlly abusive, have trolled, have file RFIs and have generally behaved appallingly in order to protect the multitude of pages they have created about non-notable youth teams. A shame. The phrase "clutching at straws" comes to mind...Robertsteadman 19:49, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It has nothing to do with you or hockey. Its about an article about a CAT. That's all. Yeah, I noticed this article via a previous interaction with you. Its an debate I didn't initiate. I'm not sure what point I'm supposively making other that what specifically concerns this article and its existence. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 20:04, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whatever...Robertsteadman 20:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have nothing to do with Ice Hockey. <b>Your</b>(and that is the problem) article was just one of several pet pages that I have either nominated or intend to nominate. Assuming that someone who disagrees with you is out to get you is a failure to assume good faith, please try harder. This 'pettiness' and failure to let things go has spread across several articles and dozens of user pages. What are you going to add to this article to pad it out:</p>
<p>Although Anne doesn't mention it explicitly, Moortje is assumed to have possessed all 4 legs normally associated with cats.</p>
<p><b>or</b></p>
<p>Moortje is generally assumed to have had 4 eyes, but the diary was quite vague about the whole cat/ eye 'thingy'.</p>
<p>It's just a cat. Not everybody has heard of Anne Frank, of those who have, very few have read the book and even less will have any recollection of her cat.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuropean_8003.html" title="User:Neuropean">Neuropean</a> 19:13, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid there are severasl tyhings I don;t believe you with your above statements- the additonal pet nominations were after the <b>Moortje</b> one and clearly to try to justify your actions. The article is valid, much more than many on WP - I am seekling assistance re: your behaviour on WP - you are a clear SOCK and a VANDAL. Robertsteadman 19:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not the place for personal arguments. If you must accuse people, do it on your or my talkpage. At the moment you are just cluttering up discussions with attacks on half a dozen or so people. It's quite disruptive.

<p>Pleaswe explain why a photograph of Anne Frank on an article about an aspect of her life is not fair use? I didn't upload the image, it is one that exists on WP already. Robertsteadman 09:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC) Don;t bother, I've replaced it with another image. Robertsteadman 09:51, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That image isn't fair use either. If you read the tags on the images...
<ul>
<li>The book cover one says it can only be used in an article discussing the book. This article discusses Anne Frank's cats.</li>
<li>The photo of her would probably be OK to use if you add {{fairusein|Anne Frank's cats}} and a detailed fair use rationale for this article to the image description page, similar to the information that is already there for the image's use in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Hope this explains. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of YOUR OPINIONS</a></sup> 09:54, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And the cats are in the book - it is perfectly fair use. So why didn;t you ask me to provide the rationale rather than just remove it? Hmmm... Robertsteadman 09:56, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly what I just did. But the rationale needs to be added before the image, otherwise it's in violation of copyright law. Once a rationale is added, you are welcome to readd the image. You see, I didn't know the cats were mentioned in the book. If you add that information onto the image description page you'd probably be OK using it in the article. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of YOUR OPINIONS</a></sup> 09:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Have you never read the Diary of Anne Frank? (I trust you don;t think she's just "Semi-famous" as some seem to on the AfD for this article!! Robertsteadman 10:02, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wait, in order to use the image of the book cover, you should mention in the image description page that the cats are mentioned in the book, therefore the image is fair use. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of YOUR OPINIONS</a></sup> 10:01, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added fair use to that - though I think the book cover use really did already cover it. Robertsteadman 10:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Have you any idea how long copyright lasts on a photo? As AF died over 60 yars ago I wonder if the image might be PD now? Robertsteadman 10:59, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The quick answer is cuurrent German and Dutch copyrights last the life plus 70 years of the <b>author</b>. REF: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries%27_copyright_length.html" title="List of countries' copyright length">List of countries' copyright length</a>. I'm not going to pretend to understand the copyright climate back then or if this current law extends back.
