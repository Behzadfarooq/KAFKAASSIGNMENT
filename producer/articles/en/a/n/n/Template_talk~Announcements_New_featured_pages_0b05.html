	    <p>Can we reach some kind of consensus on which way things are listed. Currently articles has the newest FA at thye top, whilst lists has the newest FL at the bottom. Haven't checked Portals or Pictures. Personally I think the newest should be at the top, as that's where people are most likely to click. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 11:31, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with you. Latest pages should be at top. — <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 14:26, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apologies, Mike -- I had no idea this conversation had ever happened. As I explained in my comment on your user talk page, I have no great preference for the order. It's just that the procedure for promoting featured pictures specifies that they should be listed by date as a primary sorter and then in alphabetical order within a given date. So when I close nominations that's how I put them in. I closed 8 nominations last night, including three promotions, and noticed the list was in reverse order. So I reordered the list and added the three new entries at the bottom to comply with the closing procedures.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All that said, I can see the logic in ordering them with the newest at the bottom on this particular page. Since the dates are listed in parentheses following the entry, it's logical to list them in chronological order. Reverse chronological makes more sense to me if the dates aren't listed next to each entry, since additions to the list will be more obvious to casual observation at the top than at the bottom. -- <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoondigger_c9bb.html" title="User:Moondigger">Moondigger</a> 20:57, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry I haven't replied sooner - I'm back at Uni and it's taken a while to set up the net in my house and get round to replying. Anyway, yeah. I see your point, about the listing being in that order when the dates are shown. I have to say, I don't particularly like the dates being there. I know it says to put them there, but I think it's a bit ugly and the date is only really useful to the editors in knowing when to remove the pictures. For the casual reader, it isn't particularly useful. I'd far rather have it as it with articles/lists and simply set a number of articles to be listed and when something's promoted to simply add it and remove the oldest one.</dd>

<dd>So essentially it now lies on whether the dates remain, as I your reasoning makes sense. It does need to be resolved, though, as it's a bit weird with the pictures being different to everything else.

<p>What do people think of the idea of making this display a bit more compact and standardized? I'm thinking of something along the lines of <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox5_e4a1.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox5">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox5</a>.</p>
<p>That shows the ten most recently promoted for each type of featured content (except featured topics, of which there are only five so far) in order with newest at the top. The number to be shown could be increased to fifteen or twenty, but keeping it constant across types allows for a compact layout. The colors used are copied from the palettes on each of the different 'featured &lt;whatever&gt;' pages.</p>
<p>I'd like to switch to something like this to show a more compact list on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_content_24ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured content">Wikipedia:Featured content</a> and then move that up above the 'featured content procedures' section. This template is also transcluded onto <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_featured_content_5ade.html" title="Wikipedia:New featured content">Wikipedia:New featured content</a>, an old draft design for the community portal, and a few pages in user space, but none of those get a large amount of traffic.

<dd>Sounds and looks good to me. Can you squeeze topics in there somehow? (I don't know why Calabrese keeps deleting all reference to it). —<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 19:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I put it in with the topics and portals on a separate (smaller) row since new ones are added less frequently. -<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Really nice work, it looks great. I'd perhaps suggest that the topics and portals row be moved beaneath the articles/lists/pictures row, as they're more frequently updated and perhaps the three "more popular" Featured areas.

<dd>Ditto and ditto. Was bold and did.</dd>
<dd>I think we need a different background for this section in the <a href="../../../f/c/_/WP%7EFC_5645.html" title="WP:FC">WP:FC</a> page, Possibly a new standard "featured" color, instead of the <font title="swatch-inline #FFF7E6" style="background-color:#FFF7E6">#FFF7E6</font> .

<p>Currently the topics and portals show the most recent five promotions and the other types show the most recent ten. I picked those figures because they seemed about what was usually shown. However, there was just an update where 14 articles were promoted all at once... meaning that some weren't listed here at all. Is that common / likely to become more common? I expect we will want to tweak the row sizes over time. Do 10 &amp; 5 make sense for now? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 02:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Generally promotions are less than 10. It depends how frequently Raul gets through them. 10 and 5 seems fine to me. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 03:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
