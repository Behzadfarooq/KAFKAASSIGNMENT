<p>The article states that her father, a Quaker, fought in the War of 1812, but died from the effects of exposure in 1866. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to assume that he served in the American Civil War, which ended in the year before his death?</p>
<p>There is a reference, in the article, to his miltary record. Would somebody who knows more about this than I please make any necessary corrections. This also begs the question of why would a Quaker be fighting in a war anyway, but that is not really germane to Annie Oakley's biography.</p>

<p>I recently changed U.S American to American but it has been changed back. I don't particularly mind being reverted but I have never heard anyone referred to as a "U.S American" before. Is this a real term? --Cjrother 20:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"U.S. American" is an NPOV <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonym.html" title="Demonym">demonym</a> phrase meaning 'United States citizen of the American continents'. Another phrase could be used, but just "American" is POV. • Annie Oakley was a first-female superstar relating to women, sports, entertainment, and guns, and is therefore of widespread cross-cultural interest outside of the United States. Wikipedia articles can get mistranslated — Oakley's unambiguous national citizenship deserves to be formally identified. • English Wikipedia is a global encyclopedia to be written from a neutral point of view (<a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>). The continentally-offending USA colloquial use of <i>American</i> as a demonym for citizens of the <i>United States of America</i>, has long been resented (since at least 1947) by many citizens of the 30-some<a href="http://www.unites.uqam.ca/gric/pays.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unites.uqam.ca/gric/pays.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> other countries on/near the two continents of the Americas.

<dd>The United States government, by treaty omission, does not confirm your stated position. "American" is colloquial English usage as evidenced by its failure to appear as a U.S. demonym in the North American Free Trade Agreement<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_the_word_American" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_the_word_American" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. ≈ Soapbox? <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> always trumps a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_443d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">WP:Soapbox</a> claim; but ok, lets follow policy 1 at <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html#Avoidance" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes - Avoidance</a>. The simple way to avoid this dispute is to use a phrase without "American" in it, the most obvious choices being "United States sharpshooter", or "U.S. sharpshooter". Milo 10:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>That does not resolve the dispute since it obviously implies "American" does not already refer to the US, which is the whole dispute. Fact is it is overwhelmingly used to refer to the United States way on the wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+american" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+american" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, clearly demonstrating the majority view. NPOV is not meant to give equal weight to extreme minority views. Further, whichever version of <i>American</i> you prefer, it still works, since Oakley indeed lived in North America. Anyway I linked it to United States just for you.</dd>
<dd>And it most definately is official. Its official use dates back to the founding fathers, who clearly appropriated it, but it caught on. And the world is how it is, not how we want it to be. South Americans who learn english are going to have to figure out what "American" means in english, whether or not it gets hidden from them on the Annie Oakley wikipedia page. 69.227.95.111 21:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To my request for <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html#Avoidance" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">WP:Avoidance</a>, I took your answer (or OT lack thereof) under advisement. My advisor believes that (1) on balance that your answer is nationalistic rather than encyclopedic, (2) your answer seeks to expand gratuitous struggle rather than focusing compromise toward closure, (3) Talk:Annie Oakley is not the place to duplicate the lengthy debate at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Use_of_the_word_American" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Use_of_the_word_American" rel="nofollow">Talk:Use of the word American</a>, and eventually (4) you will become a good NPOV encyclopedist, or you will tire of encyclopedia neutrality and leave, or you will be banned, perhaps for persistent NPOV policy violations.

<p>I'm gearing up to write an article in Ed McGivern, as I just bought a modern reprint of his 1938 "Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting". McGivern was a marksman, exhibition shooter, researcher, and firearms trainer who had quite a significant impact in the early 1900s. One of the steps in preparing the McGivern article was to create an article on exhibition shooting, and in it I mention Annie Oakly. Since she earned her living doing trick shooting, I think "exhibition shooter" is probably a more accurate desciption of her career than "marksman", though she certainly was one, and I've added a link to the introductary paragraph. If anyone wants to dig up a list of some tricks she did and stick it in the exhibition shooting article, I think that would be a valuable addition. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 20:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but I remember seeing a documentary a while back that claimed Annie had used Shotgun style bullets (shot packed into wax in a .22 rifle bullet) to achieve her amazing results with the playing card trick. Is this true and does anyone know more about this? <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasmandude_d726.html" title="User:Basmandude">Basmandude</a> 09:40, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know, but if not yet another legend, it's no problem. It would improve the article if you can find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for that story. Was it in the PBS documentary, Spring 2006?<br /></dd>
<dd>Do you think of <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houdini.html" title="Houdini">Houdini</a> as a cheater because he hid lockpicks on his body before he was lowered into a tank of water, in chains, upside down? <i>Buffalo Bill's Wild West</i> was a show where Annie performed as an <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhibition_shooting.html" title="Exhibition shooting">exhibition shooter</a>, not as a sports competitor. Both examples are showmanship, not cheating. Also, the many more people in Annie's era with a knowlege of guns knew what a .22 caliber hole looked like versus a shotgun pellet hole. It couldn't have been much of a secret if those cards were passed out as souvineers (were they?). A public domain picture of an "Annie Oakley" playing card with ruler marks overlaid on it would make it obvious to Wikipedia readers, too. Milo 09:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Update: No, the shotgun bullets claim wasn't in the PBS American Experience rerun broadcast on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">11-15</a>. That show <i>did</i> mention that Annie was originally considered a shotgun sharpshooter, though later she competed at Wimbledon with a rifle to best her rival — rifle champion Lillian Smith.

<p>War of 1812: 1812. Annie born: 1860.

<dd><i>"marriage wasn't fititng of 'happily'"</i> Pardon, does the "fititng" typo mean "fitting a description"? Can you ask your mom the name of the book or other source that reported that? Keep in mind that Annie was the first U.S. American female superstar, and that tabloid papers routinely print rumors about the private lives of stars that aren't true.</dd>

<dd><i>"1812. Annie born: 1860"</i>The article only says "Her father fought in the War of 1812...". If he was a soldier at roughly age 20, Annie would have been born when he was 68. That does seem quite old when he had two more children yet to father. Another reader has asked previously in § "Annie Oakley's father's military service" why was he fighting in a war if he was a Quaker? Could you ask your mom about that, too?
