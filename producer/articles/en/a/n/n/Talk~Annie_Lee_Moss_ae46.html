	    <p>In the section entitled "Case against Moss," several "sources" are presented as supposed historical support for the claim that Moss was a "communist operative." Two of those supposed sources, "Accuracy in Media" and Ann Coulter, are well known for having political agendas and their neutrality is extremely questionable. Their neutrality is not questioned because the author of this criticism has political opinions that are different from the other forementioned authors. It would not matter whether the sources of the purported historical information were politically "conservative" or "liberal" in regard to their respective opinions; the fact is that they are well known for being politically motivated and therefore are not good sources to support claims of objectivity. Historically, very little evidence was ever discovered that actually impeached Moss, and what was presented was based solely on uncorroborated hearsay (not to mention the fact that she was forced to defend a constitutionally protected activity). The authenticity of the supposed list of Communist Party members was very much in question and could never be verified by the accusers. To cite persons like Ann Coulter, a person well known for her very extreme political opinions, as supposed historical support only casts more doubt on the veracity of the claims. If sources are to be alleged, they should adhere as much to the actual historical record as possible without regard to their own personal opinions. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELottamiata_f55e.html" title="User:Lottamiata">Lottamiata</a> 15:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did you notice you have 4 <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scare_quotes.html" title="Scare quotes">scare quotes</a> in your writing? There is no place in the article that I say she was a "communist operative". I only supply the evidence from the testimony that she was a member of the Communist Party. It was based on her name and address appearing on a list of those attending a meeting where an FBI informant had access to that list. She also received a communist magazine at her house. Its a big leap to go from attending a Communist meeting and reading a communist magazine to being a "communist operative". I saw the movie <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Night_and_Good_Luck_3fff.html" title="Good Night and Good Luck">Good Night and Good Luck</a> and did research on her expecting to find evidence that she wasn't a member. I was suprised by the lack of evidence. If you know of any sourced material write it up and reference it. I even went through the 1930 census and the 1940 telephone directories to see if there were other people named "Annie Moss" in the area. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 18:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading Mr. Norton's comments and I thank him for them, but I am still not convinced of the article's neutrality. I am perplexed as to precisely how one proves that someone is "not" a communist. This is the logical problem of "proving a negative." That is why the accuser should have the burden of proof, not the accused. So, instead of "looking for evidence to prove she was not a communist" (which is logically impossible), one should be looking for evidence to prove that Moss actually was a communist. This is why I am so skeptical of the cited "sources."</p>
<p>The "Subversive Activities Control Board" is a bona fide "source." Even if one disagrees with their methods or opinions, they are a proper historical source because they were first-hand percipient witnesses or participants in the underlying historical event. However, the other two "sources," Accuracy in Media and Ann Coulter discredit the objectivity of the historical recounting because they are highly partisan and were not contemporary to the events.</p>
<p>Whether "liberal" or "conservative," the opinions of political commentators should only be injected into historical research where their comments were contemporary to the events and therefore part of the history of the subject. Otherwise, commentators used to support a particular historical analysis should be limited to historical commentators whose opinions are not particularly activist in nature.</p>
<p>For an example on the left-wing end of the political spectrum, I would not use something that Noam Chomsky wrote as a historical citation for a supportive view of the redistributive economic policies of the New Deal (Great Depression Era United States History), even if Mr. Chomsky approved of that policy (and I am not sure he did, I am merely trying to concoct an example to show that this is not about whether one is on the right end or the left end of the political spectrum but is instead purely about credibility in the writing of history). Chomsky is well-known for his activist opinions on the political left, but he was not a contemporary commentator of the New Deal era and therefore is not a proper historical source. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELottamiata_f55e.html" title="User:Lottamiata">Lottamiata</a> 22:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I want to thank Lottamiata for his insight with regards as to how one 'proves' or disproves that your not a communist. I entirely agree with his comments that it is up to the accuser to give proof in order to acertain the facts in the case and the witness - in this case Ms. Moss , should have had the ability to cross examine any witnesses the senators brought forth. The problem lies not in the theory but in the practice. The 'control board' seems entirely morally equal with his later example of Noam Chomsky in that - at least according to him. Mr. Chomsky is "well known for his activist opinions". Respect where it is due there is a serious factor in the left/question of what happened to Moss, if one is going to use the example or Chomsky for the supposed left, and thereby brining into doubt the position held by what some call the left. Its equally valid to paint with the sme brush the actions of Mcarthy and all of thier hearing and thier veracity because of Mcarty's activism.</p>

<p>"Conservative media watchdog organization, Accuracy in Media, wrote: "[The] Subversive Activities Control Board presented solid evidence that Markward's testimony was true and that the Annie Lee Moss who appeared before the McCarthy committee was in fact a member of the Communist Party." [2]"</p>
<p>Solid evidence? Perhaps a change to simply "evidence" or "purported evidence" would be more objective.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I concur that Lottamiata has a valid point. The material offered by AIM and A. Coulter is opinion, not data. Articles such as this should exclude opinions and focus on the facts. RalphS 20:19, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have removed the AIM paragraph as repetitive and current opinion. Elemming 01:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
