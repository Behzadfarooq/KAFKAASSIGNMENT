<p>Apologies. I was asked to fix this article a few weeks ago and finally got round to it. I basically cleaned up some of the article's more purple/schmultzy paragraphs and the cluttered narrative - there was a lot of repitition, unnecessary trivia or contradictory points. I've also added some more references. Hope people think it's ok. <a href="../../../g/b/o/User%7EGboleyn_eaef.html" title="User:Gboleyn">Gboleyn</a> 18:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone has removed the brief description of Warnicke's 'deformed fetus' theory from the section on Anne's fall. This is not right, no matter what one may think of her findings. <a href="../../../g/b/o/User%7EGboleyn_eaef.html" title="User:Gboleyn">User:Gboleyn</a></p>

<dd>That no doubt accounts for 'four' theories which were only three, suh! When I made my last edit I did selectively go through a page or two of earlier versions to see if there was a fourth theory that had been removed but couldn't spot it. Might have to leave it to you to reinstate. By the way, could you sign your comments with 4 tildes (~) which will embed your name and the date/time of your edits in the Talk page?

<p>What this article needs is an historian to look it over. It is riddled with opinion.</p>
<p>I agree! How do we get Eric Ives or David Starkey?!</p>
<p>I don't think they'd look over an article like this. But I'd be happy to take a look over it. I'm an undergrad at Oxford, in my final year and I've be doing my thesis on historical receptivity and extended essays on Marie-Antoinette, the Virgin Mary and Anne Boleyn. I'm no Starkey, obviously, but if people would like, I'll take a look through this AB article? <a href="../../../g/b/o/User%7EGboleyn_eaef.html" title="User:Gboleyn">User:Gboleyn</a></p>
<p>You get to write an essay on Anne Boleyn? That's amazing. All I get to study is WWII over and over again. Feel free to look over this article. I'm sure you could enlighten us with your degree-level knowledge!</p>
<p>In general, I found this article to be fair and balanced -- "riddled with opinion" only in the sense that it reports what opinion was at the time, which is not only a common practice in discussing history, but a vital one. I studied Tudor history in college quite extensively, and think this article is a good start (though in need of some commas in a few places). Except... the only problem is that a great many citations are missing; events that are, in fact, well-documented have been related here, but not cited. It does need some help in that regard. --<a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHiraeth_8dce.html" title="User:Hiraeth">Hiraeth</a> 00:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd be interested to see the reference and cites for the statements made in the 'Royal Love Affair' section of this page, such as that there is NO truth in the 'rumours' that Mary's children were Henry's bastards...to my knowledge there is still speculation, not without substantial evidence, that the children were parented by Henry VIII and Mary Boleyn.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuceo_c205.html" title="User:Luceo">Luceo</a> 16:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is odd the Mary's husband is referred to as 'a common soldier' and that because of this there was some coldness between Mary and her sister Anne. In fact, as his own entry in Wikipedia states, Sir William Carey was a 'prominent courtier', and it is more than likely that the marriage was arranged to ensure her status and respectability after her affair with the king finished. If there was any coldness between the sisters might it not be because Anne had supplanted Mary in the King's affections, or because Mary ( a compliant mistress) disapproved of Anne's ambitions to persuade the King to marry her? HJD 19 May 2006.</p>
<p>Hmm. Perhaps the 'common soldier' refrence is speaking of Mary's <i>second</i> husband, who was, in fact, a common soldier. Long after Carey's death, Mary married the soldier, which many say caused a rift between the sisters--Anne felt that Mary had demeaned herself (that is, Anne) and the Boleyn name.</p>
<p>Clearly, Mary Boleyn's second husband was a common soldier and the article refers to that as the source of their feud- why would a prominent courtier as a husband cause such a stir?</p>

<p>Was she ever a lady-in-waiting to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marguerite_of_Navarre_e5fc.html" title="Marguerite of Navarre">Marguerite of Navarre</a>? It says so on the latter's page, and mentions Anne recieving an origional manuscript of Marguerite's <i>Miroir de l'âme pécheresse</i>. Miroir was written in 1531, but on Anne's page it says she left to England in 1521. I'm confused... Nowhere on Anne's page does it mention Marguerite of Navarre (unless I missed it). Can someone help me figure this out?--<a href="../../../q/t/o/User%7EQtoktok_bfc2.html" title="User:Qtoktok">Qtoktok</a> 02:49, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've heard that Anne spent some time with Marguerite of Navarre, but I've never seen proof of this. Many books that say Anne was Marguerite's Lady-in-Waiting say that Anne and Marguerite respected one another, a friendship blossomed, and Anne was quite upset when Marguerite refused to meet her when Henry and Anne sailed to France shortly before their marriage.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnne_Boleyn_1153.html" title="Edit section: Marquess or Marchioness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marquess or Marchioness</span></h2>
<p>This refers to Anne being granted the title Marquess of Pembroke; however, Marquess is a male title. Was she really granted the male title, or did she become Marchioness of Pembroke (the female equivalent)? - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">Montrealais</a></p>
<p>Marchioness is more commonly quoted, including in <a href="http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/common/sitepages/roking08.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/common/sitepages/roking08.asp" rel="nofollow">Burkes Peerage</a> and <a href="http://92.1911encyclopedia.org/M/MA/MARQUESS_OR_MARQUIS.htm" class="external text" title="http://92.1911encyclopedia.org/M/MA/MARQUESS_OR_MARQUIS.htm" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> . However the only original text I've found on the Web refers to her as Marquess <a href="http://englishhistory.net/tudor/prianne1.html" class="external text" title="http://englishhistory.net/tudor/prianne1.html" rel="nofollow">in a text by chronicler Edward Hall</a>. Unless destroyed, the original <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letters_patent.html" title="Letters patent">letters patent</a> should be in some archive and would give the definitive answer. However there is no doubt that it was she who was awarded the title (whichever it was), rather than her being a Marchioness due to being married to a Marquess. Since it was the first (and only?) time it happened, there's no precident so hence the importance of original texts. 80.43.217.110 03:57, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm 99% sure it's Marquess, but not sure enough to revert it. I'll check... <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackloon_16d3.html" title="User:Hackloon">Hackloon</a> 02:05, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's "Marchioness". The "Marquess" business is the peerage equivalent of an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a>, probably not helped by the fact that "Marquess" was at one time one possible term for the wife of a "Marquis". (The letters patent, of course, would have used neither form, as they would have been written in Latin.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 17:04, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>IT'S MARQUESS!!! WHERE'D ANYONE HEAR OTHERWISE??? Everywhere I've read, it's Marquess... www.englishhistory.net and Dr. David Starkey say so, and so has every other book I've read. It's Marquess. Wikipedia is the only place that uses marchionessthat I've seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How nice. Unless you can actually quote a Peerage reference work, however, it's all completely irrelevant. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 21:41, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So where'd you see that she was a marchioness? Just wondering, since even the Tudor chronicler Edward Hall uses "marquess" when he wrote an account describing her coronation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Debrett's and the Complete Peerage call her "Marchioness of Pembroke", and the editor of Cracroft's Peerage has specifically stated that she was <i>not</i> "Marquess of Pembroke". <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 22:07, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How on earth would she have been a "Marquess"? Was Margaret Pole the Earl of Salisbury, as well? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 23:40, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not meaning to start a fight, but later on in this article it refers to her being granted the title "Marquess of Pembrooke", so which title is correct? Also, every biography that I have read on Anne, it has mentioned the male version when refering to her peerage title.<a href="../../../p/r/s/User%7EPrsgoddess187_3917.html" title="User:Prsgoddess187">Prsgoddess187</a> 12:59, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I thought she was granted the title "Marquess" as a nod to her being a peer in her own right, as opposed to most women in England's having their right to a title by virtue of marriage to a peer? --SaraFist</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_National_Biography_5c24.html" title="Dictionary of National Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a> she was created Marchioness, not Marquis. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 22:51, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>SaraFist, that is what I have always read, too. Henry made her "Marquess," a peer in her own right, further scandalizing the court. For her trial she faced the peers because she was one herself. --Amy</p>
<p><br />
From David Starkey's Elizabeth:The Struggle for the Throne, page 15:</p>
<p>"In October 1532, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn (newly created Marquess of Pembroke for the occasion) met Francis at Boulogne and were given a lavish reception."</p>
<p>From David Starkey's The Queens of Henry VIII, page 459:</p>
<p>"...before Anne met Francis as Henry's Queen- and Consort to be she should be given appropriate rank by being created a peer in her own right. The title chosen was MArquess of Pembroke, which had strong royal associations, since the earldom of Pembroke had been held by Henry's great-uncle, Jasper Tudor...."</p>
<p>From Carolly Erickson's Mistress Anne, page 177:</p>
<p>"...he(Henry)made her a peer in her own right, granting her the male title marquess of Pembroke...."</p>
<p><br />
Anne held the title marquess of Pembroke. Anne would have been called Marchioness by courtiers out of courtesy.</p>
<p><br />
From Carolly Erickson's Mistress Anne, page 193</p>

<p>Marquess is correct, and the title was given that way purposely- this way, she was a peer, and therefore the most powerful woman in England, giving Henry the license to marry her.

<dd>Thanks for that. The Shakesepeare reference is Henry V act IV scene iv. I've tried a few biogs to confirm this notion, but they're all vague. I came across it in an edition of the periodical <i>Éigse</i>, but have lost the reference. Given the dates, perhaps it's unlikely to be true, but I'd still prefer something concrete. Historical writing on Tudor England is so feeble on the Irish dimension - English historians take one look across the sea and run away in despair at the strangeness and complexity of the task ahead of them (they're not so good at looking across the sea to the continent either).--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 23:22, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to some genealogical research I've done, I am a distant relative of Anne Boleyn and my maternal ancestors are Scots-Irish so she could well have had Irish blood.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 23:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do believe Anne was (just a little?) Irish. One of her relatives had owned some estates in Ireland, I heard, and at the time of Anne's birth, the ownership of these estates couldn't be decided--they either belonged to her father, Thomas Boleyn, or to the Butler family. Thats why many people believe Anne was brought back to England, so she could marry James Butler, and their marriage would settle the dispute. When Anne gained favor with Henry VIII, he finally settled the fight and gave the estates to the Boleyns. But all accounts I've heard of her birth have her being born in England.</p>

<p>"...in the female line she descended from the great Irish noble house of Butler...."</p>

<p>Yes, they said she had a wen on her neck and an extra finger on her left hand, next to her small finger. However, no such disfigurations were noted until after her death, I believe. Therefore, the infamous marks which helped contribute to the idea that she was a "witch" were probably just made up to do just that (that is, make her a witch).</p>
<p>Don't forget, Henry VIII was terrified of disease. If ever there was plague in London, the King was the first to know and the first to run. Ever since his brother had died before coming to the throne (followed closely by his mother) he had understood his own mortality, and had feared it vehemently. This was a king who wanted a perfect male heir, and was willing divorce two wives, kill another two, and allow the other to die just to get one. He was willing to ransack monasteries, and perhaps worst of all; break with the church in Rome and potentially damn his immortal soul. All of this for a male heir.<br />
Considering this, is there really any possibility he would put aside a wife of 16 years to marry a disfigured woman? Would he risk his reputation in this way? Would he risk tainting the perfection of any child he may gain by her? He refused to consummate his marriage with Anne of Cleves because he found her unattractive, so what chance could a disfigured lady-in-waiting stand against such high standards? It is extremely unlikely and probably impossible that Anne was deformed, and if she had been, her family most probably would not have allowed her to court in the first place.<br />
Without doubt, this was a rumour cultivated by those who wished to destroy her. Many people, especially the public, had never liked Anne. When she was accused, it was to their amusement to enhance the myth of witchcraft. Why should Henry care? As long as he was rid of her, the public could say what they wanted.--Anne1536 21:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, that would be inaccurate. They were mistresses, not wives, so they don't belong on a list of Henry's queens. By 16th century standards there was a world of difference between a wife and a mistress and as for Mary Boleyn's importance, it's been massively exaggerated by her modern day romantic admirers, particularly fans of 'The Other Boleyn Girl.' You only have to look at how infrequently she is mentioned in surviving documentary evidence, especially the usually gossipy ambassadors' reports, to see that she was more of a "fling" than a long-term mistress. <a href="../../../g/b/o/User%7EGboleyn_eaef.html" title="User:Gboleyn">User:Gboleyn</a></p>

<p>That comment was self-contradictory. No Duke's daughter is automatically granted any title other than 'Lady'. And Clarence was attainted - all his titles were confiscated. However, after the attaintment of Clarence, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Plantagenet%2C_17th_Earl_of_Warwick_0bb7.html" title="Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick">Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick</a> was granted the titles of his maternal grandfather, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Neville%2C_16th_Earl_of_Warwick_0229.html" title="Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick">Richard Neville</a>, Earl of Warwick and Salisbury (Salisbury having been inherited from his mother, the <i>de jure</i> Countess, and Warwick being held by Neville in <i>jure uxoris</i>, having been inherited by his wife from her brother). The titles were confiscated with Edward's attaintment and execution in 1499 - Margaret was plain Lady Margaret Pole, wife of Sir Richard Pole. Where the matter gets confusing is that, in her article, Henry is described as reversing the attainder on Edward upon his accession i.e. 1509. The same article then says, "and, in 1513, made her Countess of Salisbury in her own right." One would expect that she would have simply inherited the title, and she is listed as 8th Countess (which suggests, though does not specifically confirm, continuity of inheritance rather than reissue). However, the space of time suggests otherwise; the phrasing seems to specifically state that she was Countess by direct creation, rather than by a recognition of rights. The phrase, "Her title was simply changed at a later date to the Countess of Salisbury" is a ridiculous one - defiant of events, law and understanding, it also if anything hacks further at the nonsense that 'Anne was the first ever female Peer, wow!' (her title was 'changed', was it? For that to happen, she'd have needed to be 'created' the Countess. Meaning that she would definitely be a predecessor to Anne). And <i>of course</i> the situation is different to that of Anne - Margaret was a cousin of Elizabeth of York, and Henry considered her his aunt - it would be stupendously repellent if the situations <i>were</i> the same. The point remains, Anne was neither the first ever female peer, nor the first created female peer; she was merely the first female commoner to become a peer (unless Margaret was considered a commoner, and does count as being created. In which case, Anne would be the "first female commoner without close blood-ties to the royal family to be created a Peer." <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 15:26, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who's trying to score points? I'm trying to make sure that the article is accurate - which it wasn't. Now, on this point at least, it seems to be - although someone with better knowledge will probably correct it further later. Who knows?

<p>I'd like to see a separate reference section listing all of the books used in the article and ISBN numbers before I feel comfortable passing this. Otherwise, the article looks very good. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookworm857158367_aed8.html" title="User:Bookworm857158367">Bookworm857158367</a> 15:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. Looking through the history I have NO idea what books those are referencing. I'll <i>try</i> to find what those refs are from.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 19:04, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Passing it for GA. It more than meets all the criteria.

<p>Anne Boleyn was Queen Consort of England and it is childish, irresponsible and historically innaccurate to continually remove this. Don't use arguments about her marriage being declared null and void at her execution blah blah, endless royals have had their status stripped at some point over the centuries such as Edward V, Edward VIII and Katharine of Aragon (indeed several of Henry VIII's wives) yet they are not referred to as the Earl of March, the Prince of Wales or the Princess of Wales. And as a certain Wikipedian is fond of ramming down throats of over users, Wikipedia rules state that the MOST COMMON FORM should be used when it comes to titles. So until someone can prove that Anne Boleyn is more commonly known as the Marchioness of Pembroke, I am reverting her title back to the correct one.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul75_3357.html" title="User:Paul75">Paul75</a> 23:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This issue has already been discussed - I introduced the style 'Queen consort of England' into the bold title, it was removed by <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">User:Berks105</a> - citing the Manual of Style, and - more importantly - the precedent that all other articles refer to deceased consorts by their maiden names/form of name prior to marriage. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelsanders_ec6a.html" title="User talk:Michaelsanders">Sanders</a> 15:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
