<p>Could some liberal brace himself and find even one pro-Ann Coulter external link, just to preserve the neutrality and good name of Wikipedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are "pro-Ann" links in the article: <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.anncoulter.com/" rel="nofollow">anncoulter.com</a>, <a href="http://www.coulterwatch.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.coulterwatch.com/" rel="nofollow">coulterwatch.com</a>, <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com" rel="nofollow">jewishworldreview.com</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h3>
<p>The "External links" section could use improvement, but the NPOV policy doesn't call for the wholesale deletion of links to sites that some editor disagrees with. The guideline found in <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#What should be linked to</a> is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On articles with multiple Points of View, a link to sites dedicated to each, with a detailed explanation of each link. The number of links dedicated to one POV should not overwhelm the number dedicated to any other. One should attempt to add comments to these links informing the reader of what their POV is.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The external links in this article would benefit from better descriptions. Also, the list of links is long, and some pruning might be in order. "Some pruning" does <i>not</i> mean leaving in all the pro-Coulter links and deleting all the others. In addition, one technique that's often used is to have subsections within "External links", such as "Pro-Coulter", "Anti-Coulter", and perhaps "Other" (if any of these links aren't readily characterized as Pro or Anti). Does anyone see a problem with subdividing the links list in that fashion? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 14:03, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further to the above, some of the sorting decisions by Equinox137 seem wrong. I've moved <a href="http://www.stopanncoulter.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.stopanncoulter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stopanncoulter.com/</a> from the "Pro" to the "Anti", and improved one description, but there's still a lot to be done on this section. Right now, though, I have to knock off. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 14:21, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really don't like this idea of sorting links. It passes judgement on links - including news articles - and sorts them into two camps when there really are a multitude of views on an issue, reinforces the absurd 'us vs. them' paradigm, and tells the reader what to think about a link before they even read it. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 16:38, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The MySpace link is still bad. I hate to delete it without talking to somebody, but the last two edits have been pointers to invalid groups. I did a search on MySpace and found the group, but it says it's an invalid group ID when you try to go there. I'm inclined to just delete this until somebody verifies it's resolved. <a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 15:16, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This idea about Coulter's sex has been around a while and popped up here in talk that's now archived. I think it originates from <a href="http://www.straponvets.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.straponvets.com/" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, which "outs" Coulter as a male-to-female transsexual. When it was mentioned here several months ago, no one thought that the site ("Strap-On Veterans for Truth") was serious. No one saw any reason to include anything from this humor site in the article. It's pretty funny, though, to those who'd be amused by a depiction of Coulter as "a former drag queen from Key West named Pudenda Shenanigans". <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:38, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The very suggestion of Ann being a transexual is just preposterous and has nothing to do with her point of view about things or with her stands. Moreover it has the hidden implication that a cute blonde woman can hot have brains. Only a man could have done what he has? Very macho. Is that the point my friends? That says a lot about the way you think.<a href="../../../a/g/c/User%7EAgcala_2407.html" title="User:Agcala">User:Agcala</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's simply untrue. If she is a transexual, a lot of her political views are conflicted- conservatives are often highly critical of alternative sexualities. The implication is not that a woman cannot have brains and be attractive, the implication is that she is absurdly hypocritical, and holds other people to a much higher moral standard than she does herself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"demonstrates" vs "claims"</span></h2>
<p>The use of the word "demonstrates" in reference to Coulter's arguments indicates that she has successfully proven her points. The use of the word "claims" indicates that she has made the arguments, but does not imply that they have been proven (or disproven). Therefore, "demonstrates" is POV, while "claims" is more NPOV.

<p>It appears to be the perspective of the camera that gives the appearance you mention. Not sure where you have seen tentacles that resemble pointy shoes, but I'll leave that to you.

And even so, women lying about their age is considered to be among the whitest of lies. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:35, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ann Coulter a neo-conservative?! No! Absolutely not! Her pal Sean Hannity is a raving liberal compared to Ann. She can make the occasional lucid point, but then make some way "out there" statement that destroys her credibility. The Timothy McVeigh/<i>New York Times</i> comment, for instance. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeC_3d6e.html" title="User:GeorgeC">GeorgeC</a> 06:13, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Insult humor vs. insulting humor</span></h2>
<p>One editor wanted to replace "often including the use of insult humor" with "often including the usage of insulting humor", in the lead sentence. There is a subtle difference, which explains why I think the first is better. "Insult humor" implies a particular and categorizable style of humor. Which is what Coulter uses: it's a highly stylized and deliberately designed humor. "Insulting humor" can refer to humor that insults even though it's not intended to or planned to. It also implies by the non-familiar phraseology there is a lack of style or method involved to the humor, which is not the quality that makes it particularly characteristic of Coulter's.</p>
<p>Another editor wanted to add "vitriolic" to "commentator with a reputation for criticism of liberal politics through provocative polemics". "Vitriolic" is redundant in supplying meaning to the sense of the phrase "provocative polemics". Besides, whenever she applies any "vitriol" broadly, it's done for a cheap laugh. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 21:00, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think she is just a nasty person in the mold of matt drudge, she gives the consertive movement a very bad name, with her nasty self.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Plagiarism Allegations</span></h2>
<p>I would like to discuss the following recent addition:</p>
<p><b>Plagiarism allegations</b></p>
<p>Michael Chapman, a colleague of Coulter’s at Human Events, complained to the magazine's editors in late 1998 that much of her book High Crimes and Misdemeanors had really been written by him and another writer for an abandoned book project, later partially published as an article in the magazine in May 1997, which concluded that Clinton's behavior didn't meet the eponymous standards for impeachment, contrary to what Coulter's book says. He claimed all she did before submitting it to publisher Regnery Gateway was make some cosmetic changes of phrasing.</p>
<p>Chapman sent a letter of complaint to the board of the Phillips Foundation, which publishes HE. The matter was not discussed outside the conservative movement until a 2001 article in The Boston Globe whose publication Coulter had threatened to sue to stop. The paper's media critic, Alex Beam, reviewed both Coulter's book and the unpublished Chapman manuscript and found many similar passages.</p>
<p>Coulter has denied ever knowing Chapman, despite the two having written for the magazine at the same time and frequently attending the same editorial meetings.</p>
<p><br />
(Michael Chapman, a colleague of Coulter’s at Human Events, complained to the magazine's editors in late 1998 that much of her book High Crimes and Misdemeanors had really been written by him and another writer for an abandoned book project,)</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to the source you cite, much amounts to about 7 pages.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(later partially published as an article in the magazine in May 1997, which concluded that Clinton's behavior didn't meet the eponymous standards for impeachment, contrary to what Coulter's book says.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I found two sources: one liberal <a href="http://www.soundbitten.com/archives/week_2002_10_06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soundbitten.com/archives/week_2002_10_06.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, one conservative <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/551968/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/551968/posts" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that said that this magazine article was a group project by members of the <i>Human Events</i> writing staff, including Coulter herself, and that it would be wrong to attribute the article solely to Chapman.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(He claimed all she did before submitting it to publisher Regnery Gateway was make some cosmetic changes of phrasing.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually he said his work was "rewritten" and "paraphrased", and scattered throughout the book, except for a cluster in one chapter. But from the way you phrase it, you'd think that Coulter had been such a crude plagiarizer that the whole book or at least "much" of it consisted of the whole article <i>en bloc</i> submitted to the publisher with a little beautification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And according to the source you cite, it's not even known for certain that Coulter actually reworked the phrases. It may have been written by David Wagner, Coulter's second try at using a ghost-writer. And if she did, she easily could have done it unknowingly by receiving Chapman's material from Wagner and thinking it was Wagner's work, or by receiving it from editor-in-chief Thomas Winter (who was known to have received it from Chapman), thinking it was part of a <i>Human Events</i> group project that Winter had gotten an okay for Coulter to use.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Chapman sent a letter of complaint to the board of the Phillips Foundation, which publishes HE. The matter was not discussed outside the conservative movement until a 2001 article in The Boston Globe whose publication Coulter had threatened to sue to stop. The paper's media critic, Alex Beam, reviewed both Coulter's book and the unpublished Chapman manuscript and found many similar passages.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which has the much more likely non-plagiaristic explanation stated above. Which party in this affair actually accused Coulter of plagiarism? A letter of complaint would not necessarily target Coulter herself. And the only person in the CoulterWatch article cited as accusing Coulter of plagiarism is the author of the article himself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Coulter has denied ever knowing Chapman, despite the two having written for the magazine at the same time and frequently attending the same editorial meetings)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know the names of many people in my department at work, and have never spoken to some, despite the fact that we all attend safety meetings every month. Coulter may simply have been uninterested in the literary efforts of many of her co-workers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This addition seems like it's by someone who wants to paint a false picture of Coulter by linking together a selective (and selectively distorted) series of facts about the circumstances of this affair after intoning that some unknown responsible party has already concluded the worst about them. Thereby giving grounds for its removal. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 21:00, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please fix the material rather than deleting it wholesale. It is undoubtedly true that the accusation has been made and it is apparently true that it has been taken seriously by some parties. There should be an NPOV way of covering this. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:09, May 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A mere accusation against the subject of a Wikipedia article does not rise to the threshhold of notability. This is especially the case when no responsible individual is willing to present evidence of the accusation. I found a reproduction of 80% of the <i>Boston Globe</i> article at this liberal website <a href="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/viewtopic.php?topic=1960&amp;forum=13&amp;start=150" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/viewtopic.php?topic=1960&amp;forum=13&amp;start=150" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Nowhere does it accuse Coulter of plagiarism. And the Coulterwatch article contains the bald accusation of theft, but as I detailed above, its description of events doesn't suggest plagiarism any more than other more innocent explanations, especially if we can trust the report that the editors compiled shared articles by many writers on the staff, including Coulter and Chapman together at one point. <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/551968/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/551968/posts" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>(and it is apparently true that it has been taken seriously by some parties.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh really? I did a Yahoo search for the title of the <i>Boston Globe</i> article, and came up with a commentary on the Democratic Underground containing no carriage returns, The Practical Radical, which literally contains a smeared picture of Coulter, and three reproductions or links to the article, with no commentary, on some blogs. The <i>Globe</i> article itself calls her a "Clinton-basher", "basher" being a word that comes from the phrase "queer basher" indicating the crudeness and irrationality of attack in contradiction to her known skilled analytical abilities, then continues in that vein by sexistly calling her a "poster-girl".</dd>

<dd>(There should be an NPOV way of covering this. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:09, May 15, 2005 [UTC])</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The subject might be deserving of a footnote in a section about her book <i>High Crimes and Misdemeanors</i>. If the addition were to be rewritten to remove bias and added now, it would be a clear case of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiSquatting" class="external text" title="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiSquatting" rel="nofollow">Wikisquatting</a> For those of you unfamiliar with the term, in this case I'd define my usage as writing an article or part of an article about a detail of a subject before that subject itself has been written.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And even if we did have a section about the book, I would recommend against "fixing" the addition. It would set a bad precedent. It would encourage people to simply go to watch sites or fan sites and dump unedited, uncited, unresearched material onto the wiki article, depending on whether they wanted people to like Coulter or dislike her, and know that those who cared more about a NPOV article than they did would be their servants in editing, citing and researching the material so they could spend more of their time on what they wish to do, which is to go around attempting to add bias to other articles, the subjects of which they want people to like or dislike. No, the individual who wrote it should come back and fix it himself or herself. As I said, in this particular case I reproduced the entire section here in the discussion section. 216.119.143.32 06:34, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)</b> is a book by bestselling right-wing author <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of columns written by Ms. Coulter on varied topics, such as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_terror.html" title="War on terror">war on terror</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a>.</p>
<p>In the book Ann Coulter sums up liberals in one sentence:"Want to make liberals angry? Defend the United States. "</p>
<p><br /></p>

<li>collection of columns - significant because it's not the same as a "real book" (like Bishop <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulton_Sheen_55a3.html" title="Fulton Sheen">Fulton Sheen</a>'s "book" which is just edited transcripts of his talks)</li>
<li>the sum-up sentence - who found that? That sure seems to sum up her position! <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 17:19, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Unless she says in the book that this quote, in her opinion, "sums up liberals in one sentence" then it is your opinion. "Sums up liberals" needs to be attributed to her too.
