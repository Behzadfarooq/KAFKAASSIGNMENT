<p><b>Anneke Wills</b> (born <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_20.html" title="October 20">20 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> in <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, <a href="../../../z/u/i/Zuid-Holland_0e23.html" title="Zuid-Holland">Zuid-Holland</a>) is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> actress noted for her role as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companion_%28Doctor_Who%29_2ebf.html" title="Companion (Doctor Who)">companion</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_%28Doctor_Who%29_13ee.html" title="Polly (Doctor Who)">Polly</a> in the long-running <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a> <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of a <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>-born Parisian catwalk model and a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow.html" title="Harrow">Harrow</a> educated artist descended from <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> sea lord <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Richard_Grenville_17f1.html" title="Sir Richard Grenville">Sir Richard Grenville</a>. Her parents Anna and Alaric Willys (she later changed her name to Wills) had planned to buy a house in the South of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> but <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> ended that idea. Alaric was a gambler whose severe debts forced Anna to take on a string of jobs while he became a captain in the British army and an absent figure. Anna worked as a companion to a blind aristocrat, gardener, teacher - moving Anneke and her brother Robin around the country several times. At the end of the war Anna had managed to accrue some savings, which she gave to Alaric who promptly fled to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> with his new lover, leaving a 10 shilling note on Anneke's pillow. Anneke won her first role at the age of 11 while she was living on a houseboat in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bray.html" title="Bray">Bray</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. The film was called <i>Child's Play</i> and she gave the Â£9 fee to her mother. Deciding she wanted to be an actress she then studied drama at the <i>Arts Educational School</i> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and quickly became one of the busiest child actress of her generation, early roles included an appearance as Roberta in the first TV version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Railway_Children_a2b8.html" title="The Railway Children">The Railway Children</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>. At the age of 17 she was thrown out of <a href="../../../r/a/d/RADA_cdc8.html" title="RADA">RADA</a> for 'behaving badly' with Edward Fox, at 18 she was pregnant with Anthony Newley's child and forced to abort it when he left her for <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Collins_5d74.html" title="Joan Collins">Joan Collins</a>.</p>
<p>She appeared in the show from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> alongside <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hartnell_98eb.html" title="William Hartnell">William Hartnell</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Troughton_475e.html" title="Patrick Troughton">Patrick Troughton</a> as <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_%28Doctor_Who%29_bbc7.html" title="Doctor (Doctor Who)">the Doctor</a>. (According to the DVD featurette <i>Doctor Who Origins</i>, she was also one of the actresses considered to play the Doctor's first companion, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Foreman_10d3.html" title="Susan Foreman">Susan Foreman</a>). Wills left after a series for fear of being typecast. Other <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> credits include an appearance in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Avengers_%28TV_series%29_a4f4.html" title="The Avengers (TV series)">The Avengers</a></i> and as Evelyn in <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strange_Report_bbd9.html" title="Strange Report">Strange Report</a></i>. However she left the latter series when it was planned to switch filming to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>Anneke Wills has played various other characters in the <i>Doctor Who</i> audio plays produced by <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Finish_Productions_be77.html" title="Big Finish Productions">Big Finish Productions</a>, most notably <i><a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreus_%28Doctor_Who_audio%29_e995.html" title="Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)">Zagreus</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Next_Life_ff60.html" title="The Next Life">The Next Life</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Lane_%28Doctor_Who_audio%29_b3ca.html" title="Memory Lane (Doctor Who audio)">Memory Lane</a></i> in the role of Lady Louisa Pollard, mother of the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Doctor_8330.html" title="Eighth Doctor">Eighth Doctor</a> companion <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charley_Pollard_7371.html" title="Charley Pollard">Charley Pollard</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anneke_Wills_af41.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Wills has had a turbulent personal life, losing her virginity at 14 to a 'man who grabbed me in the corridor at a party'. One of her early boyfriends was <a href="../../../d/a/p/Daphne_du_Maurier_2ce9.html" title="Daphne du Maurier">Daphne du Maurier</a>'s son, Kits Browning but it was <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Fox_%28actor%29_42b4.html" title="Edward Fox (actor)">Edward Fox</a> who was her first love. She was flying home from <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> after filming for four weeks with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Winner_622d.html" title="Michael Winner">Michael Winner</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> when she picked up the paper and read that Fox had married actress Tracey Reed. There was more heartbreak to follow, after a year and a half long relationship with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Newley_b5b9.html" title="Anthony Newley">Anthony Newley</a> which had started when they met on the tv series The Strange World of Gurney Slade. She fell pregnant only for Newley to meet <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Collins_5d74.html" title="Joan Collins">Joan Collins</a> while filming in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a> and communicate to his manager that she was to be aborted, which she was at four and a half months pregnant. Despite his new relationship with Collins, they continued to see each other and when Wills fell pregnant again she insisted on keeping the baby. By this time she has met <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Gough_3aba.html" title="Michael Gough">Michael Gough</a>, the actor who would later play <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Pennyworth_d0b8.html" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> in four <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> films.</p>
<p>After Gough divorced his second wife they married at <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulham.html" title="Fulham">Fulham</a> register office on <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentine%27s_Day_56e9.html" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. Her daughter Polly had already been born and was later adopted by Gough. At the time of the wedding she was pregnant with their son, Jasper. A year later she was offered her role in <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a> and life seemed perfect for the young actress. However after leaving The Strange Report her professional acting career drew to a close, she moved to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> with Gough and found an <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> farmhouse which they bought and she threw herself into motherhood and gardening. For years they were happy but when Gough started work at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Theatre_edf8.html" title="National Theatre">National Theatre</a> and returned to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> only at weekends, the strain began to tell. He was also womanising and though, as with Newley, Wills initially let this slide, the situation deteriorated and after two years of trying to keep it together they admitted defeat and divorced. She walked away from the marriage without asking for any alimony. Her next move was to take a course in meditation in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> which led to her finding out about the teachings of <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagwan_Shree_Rajneesh_1064.html" title="Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</a>. Leaving Polly who was then 14, boarding at a <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Steiner_8c51.html" title="Rudolf Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a> school in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Sussex_9ac8.html" title="East Sussex">East Sussex</a> she took 12 year old Jasper with her and headed for India, donning the orange robes of Bhagwan's cult followers and joining his ashram where free love was the order of the day. However Wills was more interested in meditation and after initial doubt of her decision she settled down and stayed in the ashram from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, at one stage spending ten days blindfolded on a cushion. She then followed Bhagwan and his disciples to <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> where she subsisted by cleaning houses. It was while she was there that Gough phoned her to inform her of her daughter Polly's death in a car-crash, she and her friend had been driving home when the car hit a patch of ice and skidded into a ditch, they both drowned. At the time Polly had been engaged to be married, she died never knowing that Newley was her father and Newley died in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> having never discussed the fact that Polly was his child.</p>
<p>After Polly's funeral, Wills returned to America where she paid a man $1000 to marry her so she could set up an interior design business. The marriage was in name only and the business didn't work out. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> Wills met a 35 year-old deep-sea diver and after paying for him to go to drama school he left her for a 23-year old fellow student. Wills declared herself finished with love and returned to England in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, first moving to a little cottage in <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purbeck.html" title="Purbeck">Purbeck</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset.html" title="Dorset">Dorset</a> belonging to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Fox_0491.html" title="Edward Fox">Edward Fox</a> (with whom she is still friends), then to <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon.html" title="Devon">Devon</a> four years ago. She lives a hermit-like existence and has declared herself happy doing so.</p>
<p>Her son Jasper now works as a photographer at <a href="../../../s/o/t/Sothebys.html" title="Sothebys">Sothebys</a>.</p>
