<h2><span class="mw-headline">A good summary of Ann Coulter</span></h2>
<p>Anne Coulter is like the crotch itch of american culture. She comes out of nowhere, irritates you slightly, and if you address her bullshit publically, you feel guilty about scratching your crotch in public.</p>
<p>But if you don't, the itch won't go away, will it? There's the rub, the compulsion, you HAVE TO SCRATCH. Even in that damned important meeting where you're on your feet and have that damn powerpoint, YOU HAVE TO SCRATCH IT'S SO IRRITATING. So you have to find a backwards way of doing, turn your back to the audience, away from public sight, JUST LONG ENOUGH TO SCRATCH.</p>
<p>And then you feel guilty. Because anything that combines Ann Coulter and your genitals is wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, shit. She looks like a creature made entirely out of surplus nazi manniquin parts, assembled by Mattel. 70.104.140.28 03:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

These detract from the rest of the section as they'e completely un-noteworthy comments made by obvious supporters of Ann Coulter. Curiously absent is any comment from her detractors. —&#160;<em>NRen2k5</em> 15:31, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely agree Lou. To my knowledge, nobody suggested we make the section one-sided in the opposite direction it is now. Neutralizing is the goal. My main problems with the section in question are these two portions:
<dl>
<dd>1. "many audience members, <i>including the wife of a soldier stationed in Iraq</i>, voiced their support for Coulter" -whether or not someone is a wife of a soldier in Iraq is entirely irrelevant and should be removed.</dd>
<dd>2. "and apologized on behalf of the <i>unruly</i> students" -for obvious reasons the word <i>unruly</i> needs to be removed, as it is entirely too subjective.</dd>

<dd>Those are direct quotations from the sources, and they're not ours to change. We just report what other people say, don't we? Sometimes source material is summarized, but that has to be done in a fair and neutral way. For whatever reason, editors of this article want to, or don't have the skills to, (or whatever else) to fairly and neutrally choose and summarize material about Ann Coulter. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:11, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Direct quotations? Really? Doesn't look like it. They're not quoted properly, it would seem. Notice that in its current state, it isn't the Coulter shills who are calling the protesters unruly, it's Wikipedia itself that's calling them unruly. And it is entirely irrelevant that one of the apologists is “the wife of a soldier in Iraq.” It isn't relevant. I care that she's the wife of an Iraq soldier about as much as I would care if she was a schoolteacher from Abu Dhabi or whatever. It just isn't damned well worth mentioning. But that's just nitpicking, anyway. Including this sort of stupidity in the article, you'd have to be a hypocrite to not allow people to paste criticisms of Coulter in wherever they want. Because that's just what this is - pasting in support for Coulter wherever it fits. Either way it JUST. DOESN'T. BELONG. —&#160;<em>NRen2k5</em> 23:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not one-sided. It's to the point. You don't throw comments in there. If you're going to have comments, there might as well be comments on the comments. And then you don't have an article anymore, you have a talk page. —&#160;<em>NRen2k5</em> 23:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Lou: I think you might not have read the parts I was referring to from this article. As far as I know, the passages I quoted are <i>not</i> directly from the sources. They are <i>subjective</i> interpretations of the events by a wikipedia user, at least in the case of the word <i>unruly</i> being used. The tidbit about the mother of an Iraq soldier, too, is unnecessary and irrelevant. If you can read the specific part of the article I'm referring to, and get back to me/us, I'd greatly appreciate it. Regards. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 03:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ubiq: You're right about that. Sorry. It DOES seem that part of the crowd was "unruly," though. It also seems (to me) that if identifying the mother is unnecessary and irrelevant, so is identifying the organizations, behavior, gestures, etc. of the protestors. IMHO, this incident would be much easier to discuss than the Canadian troops stuff, and some good could be done by discussing it here. What do you think? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's nice that it seems to you to be that way, but that's just what it is: <b>It seems to you</b> to be that way. The fact of the matter is that group <i>x</i> protested a speech by party <i>y</i>. What parties <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> think about the incident is irrelevant. What is important is noting the incident itself, not necessarily the actions of other people surrounding the incident, not their opinions on the incident, and certainly not who these bit players are.<br />
Furthermore, Wikipedia is supposed to be as objective as possible, and outright calling someone “unruly” is <i>subjective</i> at the very best. —&#160;<em>NRen2k5</em> 18:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lou: Like NRe2k5 just pointed out, it doesn't quite matter what it <i>seems</i> like. I don't believe our role as editors is to paint a situation with an adjective that's too subjective to be agreed upon. Furthermore, since none of us (at least the three of us discussing this matter) were actually there to see the behavior of the protestors, it can't quite be ascertained that their behavior was, in fact, unruly. And from the information provided in the article, I can't quite agree with you that "wearing red shirts and giving her the peace sign when she spoke out against attempts by liberals to equate gay rights with the civil rights movement" is unruly. Unruly is defined as: "not submissive or conforming to rule; ungovernable; turbulent; intractable; refractory; lawless: an unruly class; an unruly wilderness." Sorry, I just don't see giving peace signs and staging a walk out as "unruly".</p>
<p>I think you make a decent point about the wife of the Iraq soldiers, except for the fact that the protestors were mostly from gay/lesbian and feminist student groups. This is relevant because it explains why they were protesting, since Ann Coulter is noticably anti-gay. So let us ask what is relevant about a person's opinion who is also the wife of a soldier stationed in Iraq? Does that mean she supports the Iraq war, and is therefore more likely to be a conservative? I believe the fact that a person might be conservative would be relevant but I don't believe we can make such a stretch of a judgment to say that she was. So I think the best option at the moment would be to take that part out (and also take out the part that she apologized). The actual article that is sourced states this: "The wife of an American soldier in Iraq had nothing but praise for Coulter.</p>
<p>'My husband thanks you from Baghdad,' she said"</p>
<p>There isn't an actual apology there. In fact, looking at the article that is sourced <a href="http://media.www.usforacle.com/media/storage/paper880/news/2006/10/20/News/Controversial.Conservative.Pundit.Elicits.Praise.And.Protest.Thursday-2379854.shtml?sourcedomain=www.usforacle.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.www.usforacle.com/media/storage/paper880/news/2006/10/20/News/Controversial.Conservative.Pundit.Elicits.Praise.And.Protest.Thursday-2379854.shtml?sourcedomain=www.usforacle.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, it only cites one person apologizing on the "unruly" students' behalf. Also, I don't think the word "unruly" was used in the article to describe the quiet gay/lesbian protestors, but rather one of the students who was unsatisfied with her answer to his question during the question/answer portion of her speech. Looking at this now, it either seems that there was some serious POV pushing by whoever wrote this part, or that whoever wrote this was not careful in reading the article they were sourcing. Either way this is inexcusable and needs to be fixed. And, yes, I definitely agree that this is an easier topic to discuss than the Canada-Vietnam thing.

<dd>Excuse me, Lou. I carefully pointed out not one, but multiple distortions of the truth in reference to this section of the article and all you have to say is that I'm "not getting the big picture here"? Explain that if you will. Being less vague might help.</dd>

<dd>I'm suspecting that, again, you might not be looking at this carefully enough. Do this: First, read the section of this wikipedia article that describes the incident we're discussing. Second, look at the article that is sourced <a href="http://media.www.usforacle.com/media/storage/paper880/news/2006/10/20/News/Controversial.Conservative.Pundit.Elicits.Praise.And.Protest.Thursday-2379854.shtml?sourcedomain=www.usforacle.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.www.usforacle.com/media/storage/paper880/news/2006/10/20/News/Controversial.Conservative.Pundit.Elicits.Praise.And.Protest.Thursday-2379854.shtml?sourcedomain=www.usforacle.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Finally, compare the two and see how different they are. You haven't contributed anything with your last two or three posts and your opinion has now been rendered all but meaningless here, unless you'd be willing to rebut the claims I'm making, or tell me how I'm "not getting the big picture". Regards.</dd>
<dd>EDIT: Just for reference and to make things easy on Lou, I'm going to list things I believe to be wrong or untrue with this statement in the wiki article (in respect to the article that is sourced as being the account of the event): "After the speech, during a question-and-answer period, many audience members, including the wife of a soldier stationed in Iraq, voiced their support for Coulter and apologized on behalf of the unruly students."
<dl>
<dd>1. That <i>many</i> audience members apologized on behalf of the students. (Just one of them apologized.)</dd>
<dd>2. That the wife of the Iraq soldier <i>apologized</i> on anyone's behalf. (She just complimented her.)</dd>
<dd>3. That the gay/lesbian/feminist students who quietly protested were the ones who were <i>unruly</i>. (They were peaceful and orderly. The guy who--wasn't a part of the LGBT groups--yelled, "Vote no for tyranny," was the one originally referred to as unruly. Note that he went unmentioned in this wiki article.)</dd>
<dd>4. That <i>many</i> of the audience voiced their support for Coulter but that <i>many</i> didn't voice their dissent. (The questions were split up evenly between detractors and supporters.)</dd>
<dd>5. That the fact that a supportive audience member happens to be the wife of an Iraq soldier is relevant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, to recap, this is basically what I'm saying: that the statement I quoted is one big distortion of the truth, in perhaps every possible way. If you want to rebut this claim alone instead of making vague inferences to my not seeing a big picture, be my guest. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 00:12, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So we have two points that are preventing the page from becoming unprotected: College campus speech and Coulter, Canada, and Vietnam War sections. Good Cop seemingly has abandoned Canada and Vietnam War. If Lou doesn't respond with his specific objections rather than ad hominems consisting of "you're not getting the big picture here", can we unprotect this page please? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article was not locked because of Good Cop or even the Vietnam dispute. In fact, I think Good Cop has hardly ever even directly edited the article. It was locked because of a now-banned user's demand for documentation about Coulter's TV appearances and to a lesser extent, over another editor exerting ownership over one clause of the article. It wasn't much of an edit war to begin with, so I've requested unprotection myself. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 18:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I would remove her from this category because Ann Coulter is not a journalist, she is a writer/commentator. As she is not a journalist, she cannot be a journalist accused of fabrication or plagiarism. I just removed Al Franken from the same category for the same reason.

Faulty reasoning. Since you find this sort of thing relevant, why don't you accuse Lou Sanders of bias, since on his userpage he states about Ann Coulter: "I don't necessarily love her, but I respect her brilliance."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter as a speaker</span></h2>
<p>Ann Coulter is a very popular writer of books and columns. She has strong opinions, and she states them bluntly, and those traits are pretty relevant to her popularity and notability. They are present in her books, which are bestsellers; and in her columns, which are run in about 100 newspapers. She also frequently appears on television shows, where she is typically a major figure, and where she typically states her strong opinions bluntly. Like most important thinkers and writers, Coulter also makes speeches, some of them on college campuses. Like speeches anywhere, these have a much smaller audience than her writing or television appearances.</p>
<p>Because of her strong opinions and statements, and because undergraduates like to heckle, she frequently has hecklers at her college and university speeches. The fact that she has them is, IMHO, reasonably relevant to her notability.</p>
<p>But the individual speeches, hecklers, etc. are something different. Does it matter what an individual heckler says or does? IMHO, it usually doesn't. Is the heckling notable? In most cases, it doesn't seem to be. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> says that "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." It then expands on that. Coulter's speeches are typically local events, with little impact beyond the local campus. They tend to be covered in the student newspaper, and sometimes in the paper from the college's city or town. It's really, really hard to see individual speeches and heckling incidents as notable in and of themselves, and even harder to see them, other than collectively, as relevant to Ann Coulter's notability. Yet the main article discusses five (5) of these incidents, taking up more space than all the coverage of her columns. Not very encyclopedic, IMHO. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 22:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it covers the situation to say that Coulter's speeches are typically local events. I would contend that, in the era of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a>, it's reasonable to suppose that a college speaker's audience now includes the Internet. For example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH4SzjwO9UU" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH4SzjwO9UU" rel="nofollow">Ann Coulter educating liberals at a college</a>, which I would not characterise as having "little impact beyond the local campus." (This clip was included in a recent documentary film on Coulter, <i>Is It True What They Say About Ann?</i>), cf. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_at_the_2006_White_House_Correspondents%27_Association_Dinner_57ca.html" title="Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner">Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner</a>: did he kill on the 'Net or bomb in the room? Apparently both.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is the case whether or not the speaker is consciously playing to the wider audience, and it seems reasonable to suppose that speakers are increasingly conscious of this wider audience. In the Colbert example, various commentators opined that the 'Net was his true intended target audience.</dd>

<dd>Good points. It IS true that events of all kinds can now be shown or described on the Internet, making them accessible to billions of people in every country of the world. But if a child's birthday party is put on YouTube, it's still primarily a family event. If the child does something extremely cute and it catches fire on YouTube, that doesn't make him an international figure, and it doesn't make his birthday party an international event. (People won't know his name, for example. His cute action probably won't be watched too much a year from now. He's just a little kid who did something especially cute that was briefly newsworthy.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that college speakers' speeches are now distributed internationally, and that speakers take that into account. (Birthday parties and the mothers who host them, too.) I think that most of these events, even the ones with lots of creative hecklers/cute children, are still primarily local events. I think that the kid who brought <i>Mein Kampf</i> for Coulter to sign isn't very relevant to Coulter's notability, nor are any of the others in that clip. They're just generic hecklers, and she gets hecklers wherever she makes one of her $30,000 speeches. Creative heckling doesn't make for encyclopedic notability. As it says in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, notability is not the same as "fame" or "importance" or "newsworthiness." <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I concur. The article was on long-term semi-protection -- {{sprotected2}} -- beginning Nov 30 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90996827" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90996827" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), and before that had been on "short-term" semi-protection for quite some time, because of incessant vandalism. When it was switched to fully protected, the the semi-protection was "overwritten", and so once the full protection was taken off it became altogether unprotected. I suspect this was a mere oversight, owing to different admin's doing the semi-protection, the full protection, and the un-protection. At any rate, the vandalism has wasted no time in beginning again, so semi-protection seems only sensible. -- Lonewolf BC 05:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've made the request for the restoring of long-term semi-protection. I trust that this meets with general approval. -- Lonewolf BC 05:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent changes to college speeches</span></h2>
<p>I made a few changes regarding this section. I removed the republican group president's comments and replaced that "big distortion of the truth" statement with a relevant and accurate one. My changes can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=104991467&amp;oldid=104990317" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=104991467&amp;oldid=104990317" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Lou Sander has taken it upon himself to make edits as well. I, however, don't agree with them. He removed Ann's response to a question from an audience member of a speech: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=104999367&amp;oldid=104991467" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=104999367&amp;oldid=104991467" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. He removed the portion that stated what groups the protesters were affiliated with: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=104999870&amp;oldid=104999367" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=104999870&amp;oldid=104999367" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I feel both these edits are removing relevant facts that explain the respective situations. I'm 99% sure that most of us did not agree on these changes that he made, and that he's taken, in a sense, a unilateral approach to editing, such that it suits his POV. Are most of us in agreement with his changes and if not, would you guys feel okay pursuing an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">RfAr</a> in this case?

You sure don't seem to let the article have a Neutral Point of View but you probably feel that you do. Try seeing the big picture about that. If you want to include things like hecklers at speeches, yhou really should give both sides. Why don't you do taht?

<dd>First, you'll find your assertions are proven baseless and false when you see that I've made <i>one</i> total edit to this article in my entire edit history. The edit was to take out a completely false statement and distortion of the truth, as proven above in another section of this talk page. So your theory that I'm making biased edits basically falls flat. Secondly, nobody has edited <i>my</i> writing or the changes that I made, so when you say, "if you don't want [your] writing to be edited mercilessly, do not submit it," you're assuming that the edits that I disagree with are from changes to passages I wrote, but that is not the case. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 08:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quote you're referring to is in the sub-section "Speeches at college campuses" in the section entitled "Notable controversies regarding opinions and remarks". I guess since it's a controversial remark from one of her speeches at a college campus it seems to be in the right place.

And in the past, I've had problems when an issue of notability was decided by one person saying "it was widely reported" and the other said "not notable", which is why I mentioned the Google search coupled with Fox News and Coulter's own website.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit wars</span></h2>
<p>I just realized two new edits by 209.247.22.57 where he basically just removed relevent, contextual information to the section we all seem to have our eye on: "Speeches at college campuses". These are changes that I'm sure very few people would agree on. I think a semi-protect might be in order, as well as an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">RfAr</a>. I'm also going to see about getting an admin involved to address this user's various vandalism as well. It's been 12 or so hours since the unprotect and we've already got an edit war on our hands.

<dd>There is no one "the problem". There are several of them. One of them is that Ann Coulter says crazy stuff so often that it is considered normal for her, meaning "not notable" by some of her supporters here. Though any public figure saying some of these same "not notable" things would have it in their articles in a heartbeat. Imagine if John McCain or Barack Obama called someone "gay boy" or made a joke about putting rat poisoning in a judge's tea/coffee. Everyone would consider it very notable. Senator <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Biden_615e.html" title="Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a> said of Barack Obama "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." All he said was <i>clean</i> and somehow that's a racist and notable comment such that it gets on his wikipedia article. I find it really funny that people want to just take quotes out of the article because they think Ann Coulter deserves a double standard. The fact is: she is saying these things and these are notable things. If she says something particularly intelligent about a certain issue, I'm all for putting it in the article if it is notable. Politicians and political pundits occasionally have such quotes attributed to them. I am for the <i>truth</i>. <i>Not</i> for defaming her. She pretty much does that to herself and does not need my assistance.</dd>

<p>I would caution editors that if someone says outrageous things normally, said outrageous things, written in summary style read "X says outrageous things a lot" -ref--ref--ref--ref--ref--. There is not a double standard - we write summary style articles on every subject. Summary style means we summarize what is standard and mention what is notable. If the person is a comedian, the jokes they told last night are not notable. If someone is in a persistant vegitative state, but suddenly stands up, tells a joke, and dies without any explanation, that joke would be reported. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 19:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Honestly though, the fact that she says so many things means that a lot of her asides cannot be notable, right? I am no supporter of Coulter, but almost any random statement from her <i>is</i> more provocative than the statements of all politicians. We simply can't judge them based on how "crazy" they are—it must be an objective measure. This is not a different standard than anyone else. I'm sure, for example, that <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dole_1dcc.html" title="Bob Dole">Bob Dole</a> once said something about potatoes that once got him in a specialty journal. It wouldn't belong in his article any more than 99.999% of all blog-generated noise. Coulter has been covered extensively for some of her humor, but a lot of this crap—in depth coverage on every town paper to have cancelled her—is <i>just</i> crap. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 20:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Hipocrite, I disagree with your mass change to the article but I don't want to revert you because I see you as a "middle-ground" editor and I don't want to dissuade you from your participation on this page. I think your point that a section on style for someone who says controversial bullshit all the time should be written in summary form is very relevant. However, when someone as notable as Coulter says stupid shit all the time, she <i>also</i> gets a lot of press for what she says. I wish Google search did TV transcripts better, as I remember much more discussion on the Justice Stevens "joke". We do need to pay attention to notability, but we also need to pay attention that her controversial style renders many of her comments notable. Maybe not notable compared to her other quotations, but just like Ubiq said, if Obama joked about putting rat poison in Stevens' food, his presidential ambitions would be forever extinguished, not to mention the amount of media coverage it would receive. Of course, where this balance lies is extremely difficult, and thus while my personal assessment is that much of the info that you removed should be included, I'm not exactly going to tear my hair out trying to keep it in. There are a few passages which I think should be in, such as the Canada/Vietnam thing, but I'm willing to discuss the others. Can we maybe do as Ubiq suggests and go over some of them first? What do you think? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's an exerpt from Archived pages, on the topic of notability:
<dl>
<dd>"I do not believe this passage should be included on the main Ann Coulter page. I think there should be a controversies section that leads to a separate controversies page for Ann Coulter because there are more than enough controversial things she has said. She is a political pundit who gets attention through such means. This is a notable controversy because it is understood that she (like many other pundits) is supposed to know her historical facts. And it was clear that she did not know. If there was at one point she did know, then it was clearly not demonstrated in the interview that she knew at the time, as she was not able to recall any evidence. I'm sorry, but a mere unassured utterance of "Indochina?" does not qualify as evidence. She stated something she believed as if it were something she knew and could prove then and there. And that is why, regardless of whether or not the facts aligned with her assertion, it made her look like an "idiot". Regardless, and as stated previously, Kizzle's passage is unbiased and NPOV such that it doesn't make her look that way anyway, so I don't know your problem is. If you're wanting to improve her public perception (and after reading through this talk page I'm almost certain you are) or perhaps neutralize it, you'd want this passage to be included, since it clears up misconceptions about Canada's role in Vietnam as mistakenly reported by Bob McKeown. This is notable too. If anything, it defends her much more than it does make her look bad. Look through the comments on the various videos for this incident and you will see that many of the people who saw the video have the mistaken idea that she was wrong and treated her with adjectives and nouns accordingly. --Ubiq 18:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)"</dd>

The fact is: she is saying these things and these are notable things. If she says something particularly intelligent about a certain issue, I'm all for putting it in the article if it is notable. Politicians and political pundits occasionally have such quotes attributed to them. I am for the truth. Not for defaming her. She pretty much does that to herself and does not need my assistance."</dd>

<dd>Political pundits (to me anyway) are far closer on the spectrum to politician than they are to comedian, in terms of how they are expected to conduct themselves. Accordingly, their words should be treated as such. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 20:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say she was a comedian. Of course politicians would get extensive (and notable) coverage for saying the sorts of things that she says regularly. The difference is that she says this stuff all of the time, so it's only notable when it gets the level of coverage that a Tom Daschle misstep might. That's rare indeed because the media cover man-bites-dog stories, not Coulter-talks-crazy-once-again stories. As I and another editor pointed out, <i><b>judging a statement's notability on its "craziness" is a POV standard, but judging it by the quality of press coverage is not.</b></i> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 20:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't addressing you. I was addressing Hipocrite's comparison to that of a comedian. But it seems you and I are in a simple disagreement on the matter. I don't think weight and quantity of media coverage correlate with a statement's notability. I think judging by any standard not explicitly outlined in any rules/guidelines for NPOV would be considered POV, so I think saying "judging it by the quality of media coverage is not [POV]" would be false. I've already appointed out that statements she makes would be notable for politicians and other political pundits and that the double standard should not exist. You are saying, essentially, that the double standard should exist, and that she should be treated differently because she says stuff like this all of the time. This is a simple disagreement. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 21:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Chances are that your same text will not address new arguments by different editors. It's also highly annoying.)</dd>
<dd>You realize that judging whether a statement is "out of line" can't be anything but POV, right? Similarly, the only way to tell whether something is notable is whether it generated actual note. It so happens that Ann Coulter and George W. Bush could say the same thing such that Coulter could be dismissed as being Coulter while Bush would be hounded for the rest of his presidency. To cover both remarks the same would be a double standard; If Bush talked like Coulter just once it would probably merit its own article because of the commentary and reactions it would produce. Coulter? Not so much; she's made it her job to say crazy things. That's just the nature of notability.

<dd>You see that "out of line" is a POV, yes? Isn't a better standard, "if they are recorded and widely reported"?

Perhaps a statement that she has often been interupted by protestors on campuses, but to detail incident by incident is a failure to follow summary style. Can we find a way to write it without going into incident after incident after incident? How about a sentance "Coulter has, in the past, spoken at a number of college campuses.

<dd>I think you make a good point about the summary style. However, in regards to being "interrupted", a total of <i>one</i> of these cases she was heckled (with a pie). The other times she said "rude" things in response to questions asked to her in Q&amp;A sections. Or to quiet protestors leaving. I wouldn't be all against summing these cases up in a short little paragraph, but it couldn't be summed up in the way you wrote it and still be accurate. It would have to be something like "Coulter occasionally speaks at college campuses and is oftentimes met with protest.-ref- A pie was once thrown at her as well.-ref- She has also been noted for her crude remarks to detractors during Q&amp;A sections.-ref-ref-ref-ref-" I don't really see the pie mention as being necessary but it's not a big deal to me personally.

Wikipedia Policy: If someone mentions a negative thing like pieing in a biography of a living person, it is their responsibility to clearly demonstrate its relevance to the person's notability.

<dd>Your stab is a good one, IMHO. The lead sentence needs work: "Coulter has frequented many college campuses around the world..." Doesn't quite say it. She does more than frequent them, she speaks at them. As I understand it, sometimes she's part of a university-sponsored speaker program, sometimes she's invited by a student interest group (College Republicans, or whatever). And she may do it at campuses around the world, but I doubt it. (I'm only aware of U.S. speeches, and only U.S. speeches are cited in the article. She's basically a U.S., not an international, person.)</dd>

<dd>I thought the summary to be overall, a great recommendation by Hipocrite. The opening "Coulter's speeches at college campuses draw both praise and criticism from their audiences" is NPOV and accurate. I changed the ending from "Coulter has on occasion responded strongly to hecklers" to "Coulter has on occasion responded with insulting or <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic.html" title="Homophobic">homophobic</a> remarks towards opposers, protestors, and hecklers who attend her speeches." The word <i>strongly</i> is vague and not accurate to describe how, on occasion, she responds. Her remarks have been insulting and/or homophobic though. The word <i>hecklers</i> is not accurate either, as sometimes/oftentimes the people she insults are silent protestors or people who ask her questions she doesn't like during a Q&amp;A. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 03:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support precise language, but per WP:BLP we should be very careful tossing around words like "homophobic"; even the newspaper source says nothing more than that the remarks were "in reference" to the protester's sexuality. Even if we did find a source that we could attribute it to, we should think twice before putting it in as it might give undo weight. I'd much prefer treating these sections in summary style and leaving substantive criticism ("homophobic") to her politics sections. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 05:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ann called an opposer "gay boy" because he had a lisp. She also said, to exiting gay and lesbian students, "I believe the proper position is on your knees." Those seem like <i>very</i> homophobic statements. Indeed, if someone said [random racial epithet or insult generated from race stereotypes] to a [race/ethnicity] person, isn't that statement often referred to as <i>racist</i>? I believe so. Whether or not that makes one racist is up for debate, but I believe they're almost always, in such a case, referred to as <i>racist</i> remarks. Comparitavely, Ann's remarks are <i>homophobic</i>. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 05:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, "homophobic" is entirely unlike being blond or loud or even insulting, and editors should not engage in this kind of speculation. If it's so obvious to us in our armchairs that her remarks were homophobic, it begs the question of why a reporter did not call them such. As it turns out, better news sources strive to present factual events without an interpretive gloss (as obvious as it might seem to some). We should do the same, especially out of WP:BLP concerns. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 06:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kizzle made the point I was going to make. The section we had before Hipocrite's overhaul was devoid of such descriptive words. So now we have a summary that removes relevant information and does not accurately summarize what was there before. Perhaps we could say she has occasionally responded with "insulting, and perceivedly homophobic remarks." <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Biden_615e.html" title="Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a>'s article has that his statement was "perceived racism in his evaluation of Senator Obama". The statement in question, "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." seems a lot less racist than does Ann Coulter's remarks seem homophobic.

<dd>The strategy here should still be to attempt to put passages into summary style, but in controversial passages, it might be better to use verbatim quotations in order to combat putting editor interpretations into the article. Maybe we use quotations around certain phrases such as "gay boy" as in "Coulter has responded by using strong terms such as 'gay boy', etc."? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 09:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kizzle is right. We can't just say that it's racist just because of how it seems to us. It's not a double standard; original research is <i>never</i> allowed. Biden got lots of press for his remarks and the percieved racism of them, which makes them notabale (once again, "notable" is descriptive and not prescriptive on Wikipedia). Coulter was not reported in the same way, so drawing inferences that the media does not <i>is</i> original research. Incidentally, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Richards_0474.html" title="Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a>' remarks are more clearly racist, yes? They choose to quote his remarks without labelling them. Considering WP:BLP, that's really the only thing you can do. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 15:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC) There's a strong argument to simply summarize as Hypocrite has done.

<dd>I absolutely agree. This is the problem we had in the first place with summarizing these speeches. At some point (this point) the summary is not an accurate summary. That's my problem. I'm fine with not labeling it with descriptive words. It seems to me that we need to agree on one or the other though. The current summary is not accurate. Joe Biden and Ann Coulter both got enough press about their respective incidents, Joe Biden just got more. So why is that we should summarize this and leave out the actual quotes, and replace it with a summary that's not accurate? --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 22:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">To Ubiq on the notability of individual campus speeches</span></h3>
<p>We summarize because much of this stuff is simply not notable. You continually talk about how any politician would never get away with saying the things Coulter does. That's true, but treating noteworthy and non-noteworthy facts differently is the essence of being an editor.</p>
<p>It's not troubling we treat identical actions differently based on their notability. If the Pope publicly praised a movie, it might deserve mention in an article, but if Roger Ebert did, not so much.</p>
<p>This article is not St. Peter's rap sheet on Coulter, so it's not imperative to note every racist, homophobic, or mean thing she might have said or done. Frankly, this article would be several megabytes big if we tried to fully document every idiotic thing to crawl out of her mouth. Instead, we must include only what's noteable. Noteworthiness is not based on our subjective judgments, let alone what we find "newsworthy."</p>
<p>That said, we should certainly say how Coulter is considered to be mean, bigoted, and all the rest. We should also include several particularly noteworthy examples of her apparent bigotry and shock-jock tactics. However, we do not have to include every marginally bad thing written about her in every college newspaper. I don't know whether it would be a worthy endeavor to document her many faults, but it's certainly out of line with the hard-fought policies we've chosen for this project. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 04:16, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>As a professional political commentator, what she says influences how many people think about politics who don't have the time, resources or interest to do it themselves. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">User:Lou Sander</a> pointed out that she is an important speaker, which she is. Because she is important, her influence is increased that much more.</li>
<li>A political commentator must have a good understanding of political history, among other academic subjects, to provide relevant opinions and commentary.</li>
<li>When a political commentator makes a mistake regarding politics it is notable and relevant, to their quality and credibility. In this case Ms. Coulter said the Canadian government sent troops to Vietnam in support of the U.S.'s mission to assist South Vietnam in their fight against communist North Vietnam. This was wrong, and Ms. Coulter admitted it.</li>
<li>Her meanness, spiritual views or opinions are not what we are trying to note here: It was the inaccuracy of her assertion. If the CBC host hadn't called her on it, people unfamiliar with the truth would have thought that Canada sent troops to fight side by side with American troops AND allowed Americans to dodge the draft too.</li>

<dd>I agree, and I do think the CBC issue is another problem, probably notable, and I oppose removing it entirely. Do note this is <i>not</i> because of some notion of what we think a public figure ought to be, as some of your bullet points imply. It's simply because it was covered in non-trivial depth in national Canadian and US sources.</dd>
<dd>This is in reference to the section above about hecklers, protestors, ect. I mean only that outrageous/mean comments are par for Coulter and that each individual quip is not normally notable. Ubic has very often asserted otherwise because it would be a "double standard" not to treat Coulter's sexual orientation-baiting the same way that we would a nationally-significant politician. This is not the case; the coverage by reliable sources dictates. Notability is determined by actual note. Therefore, widespread coverage on her meanness/innacuracy is notable even when editors claim otherwise. By the same token, obscure non-coverage of a minor speach is not notable even when editors claim it is. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 06:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel I should apologize, I didn't realize your comments were regarding the notability of each and every speech she gives where protesters or hecklers show up. To save each other's time in the future I have a request. On a page where an editor like <a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">User:Ubiq</a> is arguing for/against several notability issues, could you please be more specific about which notability issue you are addressing? Don't get me wrong, I should have looked over the rest of the page more thoroughly in an effort to avoid confusion before making my post. If the title had been something like "To Ubiq re: notability of speeches" I would have known you weren't talking about the CBC thing. On that subject though I have a question. If I understand you correctly you believe the CBC interview is notable because it was covered in some depth by the national media rather than the accuracy of the information she presents? Is that what you are saying or have I misunderstood you again? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 07:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's correct. It could be that many respected commentaters (ie, those generally considered more reliable and influential that Coulter) have made many factual errors. If no reliable sources cover their mistakes, neither should we—no matter how much we believe that public intellectuals <i>should</i> get facts right. Doing so violates WP:N, WP:BLP, and almost certainly WP:OR. The CBC case, on the other hand, is more notable. That said, arguing about whether we include a relatively poorly-reported (possibly non-notable) "confession" on C-SPAN seems to be pushing a POV. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 16:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Your position <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> is that not enough reliable sources have covered this issue in depth. Why is the CBC interview not as reliable a source as Time? She made an assertion on camera the accuracy of which can be verified through official primary and secondary sources. The clip of the debate is available online at several sites: <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2663937" class="external text" title="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2663937" rel="nofollow">Ifilm</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84EjWeTMBZs" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84EjWeTMBZs" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8037306567729592302&amp;q=Ann+Coulter+%26+Canada" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8037306567729592302&amp;q=Ann+Coulter+%26+Canada" rel="nofollow">Google Video</a> and the entire program can be viewed <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" rel="nofollow">on the CBC page itself.</a> She clearly believes that the Canadian government supported the U.S. in the Vietnam war by sending soldiers, and appears to be disappointed that they did not send send soldiers to Iraq because of this belief. If Canada had been a participating ally of the U.S., it is very doubtful that the North Vietnamese would have allowed Canadian soldiers to enforce the cease-fire established by the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. The Canadian government confirms that it sent soldiers as peace keepers representing the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS) in 1973 while the U.S. withdrew. <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmvn" class="external text" title="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmvn" rel="nofollow">Canadian awards for participation in ICCS Operation Gallant.</a></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> if I understand what you are saying; The notability of information is less about fame, importance, and newsworthiness than it is about it's worth or ability to attract attention. This puzzles me because of the discussions you have been having with users on this talk page, it seems that your subjective judgment is that her error is not worthy of inclusion here.I apologize but I have not found any arguments you've made for this except your own judgment, whereas I maintain it is worthy due to her occupation and the influence she has over some people. Moreover, since notability depends on worth OR attracting attention, let us assume it does not meet the 1st criteria regarding worthiness and discuss it's ability to attract attention. This incident has drawn quite a bit of attention here and many other places on the internet. It attracted enough attention so that over two years later videos, commentary, and information about it are still being discussed and are readily available from many sources. I don't mean to sound petulant but if this interview had NOT attracted so much attention, information about it would be much harder to find because information that doesn't attract attention tends to be deleted rather than archived. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 23:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see why it may look like original research because of my statement that she clearly believed Canada sent combat troops <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a>, but I am not the first person to say this. For two years people on both sides have been having discussions over who is right and if a mistake was made. I am merely verifying that history agrees with those who say Canada did not send soldiers in a combat role to Vietnam in support of the U.S. and pointing this out on the talk page to discuss what should go into the article. I may be mistaken, but I have been operating under the assumption you've seen the interview in question. In case you haven't here is her statement: <i>"Canada used to be one of our most loyal friends and vice-versa. I mean Canada sent troops to Vietnam - was Vietnam less containable and more of a threat than Saddam Hussein?"</i> It sounds like she thought the Canadian government helped the U.S. contain the the threat we faced in the Vietnam conflict, but not in Iraq 2003. If you have time, I'd like to know how you interpret her comment and what you think she meant. On the subject of original research, here is what I understand original research is. (Please understand this is <b>not</b> meant to be included in the article it is a demonstration of what I understand original research to be) Ms. Coulter saw a memorial dedicated to Canadian citizens who came to the U.S., enlisted in the military, were sent to Vietnam and died. She misunderstood it to mean that the Canadian government sent Canadian troops to fight beside us in Vietnam. She then asserts her mistake on CBC and is corrected. People everywhere in walks of like make mistakes like that, so it sounds reasonable to me. I haven't seen anyone else explain it this way so these are all my own conclusions and as such original research. If it turned out that someone publishes a book or article asserting this point it would then no longer be original research as I understand the concept for the purposes of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I think she meant is not salient to this article. However, I think she probably meant something that she would have been wrong about. If she knew what she was talking about, she probably would have clarified the extent of Canadian support rather than have the host humiliate her on CBC. An editor's personal beliefs have no place in the article though. Publishing to a blog on this issue doesn't prevent it from being original research, but yes—if someone in the future writes about this in a reliable source, further commentary might be fair game.</dd>
<dd>As the <i>Time</i> article demonstrates, ours is not the only possible POV. The author there construes her comments as not mistaken. To have the article suggest what she "clearly" meant pretends that authoritative studies have proved what was in her mind. Frankly, there's an epistemological gap, and it wouldn't be a good idea to jump this gap even if WP:BLP, WP:N and WP:OR didn't exist. As it is, our policies absolutely preclude speculating on what she "really" meant and whether this "really" was an error. We must follow existing sources. FAIR makes a nice counterpoint to what the <i>Time</i> article says, and the issue can be left at that. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 01:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize for using the word clearly in my commentary <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a>, it was my impression you were arguing that this CBC interview should not be included at all. I had meant for the statement to be taken more as "clearly an argument can be made that she is wrong" rather than "clearly she is". It sounded like you were citing the Time article as a reason to keep it out completely, but if you want it to provide perspective I have no problem with that. I feel comfortable saying that there is clearly more than one way to see this interview, and different views are most welcome as long as we agree it (the CBC interview) merits inclusion. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There might be something notable about the voting irregularity, but it isn't in the first two paragraphs. She went to vote in a town election (notable?). She went to the right precinct, but they told her she was in the wrong place. She went to the place that matched her registration (wouldn't anybody?) and voted. Later on, a Democrat tried to make something of it, and it still hasn't been settled. The encyclopedia spends three paragraphs describing this.

McKeown disputed her assertion by saying "No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam," to which Coulter eventually said "I'll have to get back to you on that". In a subsequent C-SPAN interview, Coulter justified her statement by referring to the 10,000 Canadians who voluntarily signed up with the American troops, though admitting she was wrong that the Canadian government had sent troops, as well as taking a shot at McKeown:<sup id="_ref-fifth_estate_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fifth_estate" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<dd>Hip, it's more of a pragmatic inclusion. I stated above that I'm not a huge proponent of its notability (though the specific question got covered in Time Magazine and asked again on C-SPAN) but at a small paragraph consisting of verbatim quotes, the brief paragraph + redirect link prevents people from balooning this article into a debate about Canadian participation in the war, such as HowardDean's recent contribs. Think of it as a plug to prevent future leakage of info not about Coulter into the article, and at its proposed space, it's not exactly violating undue weight, and seeing as it's solely verbatim quotes while giving Coulter the last word, I think it's pretty neutral as well. The notability of the incident <i>does</i> rise above her general comments to just barely satisfy the policy Lou states below, though admittedly not by much. I like your tendency to make much of the fluff here into summary form, but I think this is something where we should use verbatim quotes rather than editor interpretations. Just my 2 cents. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry Lou, but some people (myself included) think it is notable, as she is someone who is expected to know her historical facts. Passage #1 is as about as NPOV as it gets. It is not, in any way, biased or malicious. It clears up the misconceptions about the particular event, actually. I (and others) have laid out several arguments demonstrating why various events are and are not notable, including this one. Do you care to demonstrate why it is (not notable x 4)?

I am <b>NOT</b> saying Ms. Coulter is useless, but as a commentator keeping track of her factual mistakes is relevant. If Ms. Coulter was an artist of some kind, her factual mistakes would not be relevant to include under her biography. Since opinions about her are so contentious, it is indeed a good idea to question issues like this as you and <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> have done.

No. Was the interview widely discussed and analyzed anywhere other than on the network that ran it? No. Is the interview an important part of the malicious agenda described above? Yes.

<p>Lou, you completely ignored Anynobody's argument (which I think is a very solid one) and you are repeating yourself on your opinon that it is not notable. Your conclusion (that this is not notable) is based on the assumption that <i>the agenda</i> is malicious, but you're not stating whose agenda is malicious. Keep in mind that you are using a very strong word here: malicious. If you're referring to the CBC, how can you go about <i>proving</i> that their intent was malicious? Also, even if you were able to prove this, it doesn't quite matter, as the <i>agenda of the NPOV description of the event (Passage #1) is NOT malicious</i>. You also state that the interview was not widely discussed <i>anywhere</i> other than on the network that ran it. This is not true. Do some google searches. I'd work with you on this but your premise that CBC and/or this article is highly questionable, and, in my opinion, <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfalsifiable.html" title="Unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a>. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 05:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for factual accuracy and all that, she said, almost as an aside, that Canada sent troops to Vietnam. The guy jumped on it and wouldn't get off it.

<dd>Since I've already argued this exact point with Good Cop (to which he couldn't respond with anything), I'll just copy and paste my argument here. In this I demonstrate that having <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">knowledge</a> about something is quite different from stating the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> about a certain thing (and very importantly so and relevant to the situation in this interview). I assert for one to know a fact, one must also have memory of the fact: "there are more than enough controversial things she has said. She is a political pundit who gets attention through such means. This is a notable controversy because it is understood that she (like many other pundits) is supposed to know her historical facts. And it was clear that she did not know. If there was at one point she did know, then it was clearly not demonstrated in the interview that she knew at the time, as she was not able to <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory.html" title="Memory">recall</a> any evidence. I'm sorry, but a mere unassured utterance of "Indochina?" does not qualify as evidence that she remembered. She stated something she believed as if it were something she knew and could prove then and there. And that is why, regardless of whether or not the facts aligned with her assertion, it made her look like an "idiot". Regardless, and as stated previously, Kizzle's passage is unbiased and NPOV such that it doesn't make her look that way anyway, so I don't know your problem is. If you're wanting to improve her public perception (and after reading through this talk page I'm almost certain you are) or perhaps neutralize it, you'd want this passage to be included, since it clears up misconceptions about Canada's role in Vietnam as mistakenly reported by Bob McKeown. This is notable too. If anything, it defends her much more than it does make her look bad. Look through the comments on the various videos for this incident and you will see that many of the people who saw the video, have the correct idea that she didn't know what she was talking about, have the mistaken idea that she was wrong and treated her with adjectives and nouns accordingly. --Ubiq 18:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)" Note that my mention of <i>you</i> was meant for Good Cop, not Lou, though there are cases it would apply here. Like Anynobody stated, a political pundit's credibility is quite relevant, and when someone makes a claim (that Canada sent troops to Vietnam) and can't back it up with something but an utterance of "Indochina?" then it does not matter whether her claim happened to be true. Suppose she'd said George Washington was the first U.S. President, to which Bob replied "No. John Adams was." Her reaction is very important. If she's able to rebut his claim by saying "No. Washington was. Elected in 1789. Alexander Hamilton was his treasurer and was a good one at that." then she's pretty much in the clear, no? But if she says, unconvincingly, "I think you're wrong...Hamilton?" she has not demonstrated that she has knowledge of her claim. And yes, this is relevant to her notability and her credibility. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 07:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have honestly tried to find instances where she has been 100% correct about something factual to balance the mistakes currently being discussed. The best I could do was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are a lot of bad Republicans; there are no good Democrats."</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview with Brian Lamb; August 11, 2002.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>She is right about the first part, there are a lot of bad Republicans like Tom Delay and Duke Cunningham. The second part is incorrect because there are good Democrats, for example <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesley_Clark_decd.html" title="Wesley Clark">Wesley Clark</a>. To make my motivations clear, I am registered as an independent and would like to see this article be as NPOV as possible. In the interests of compromise and balance; Can one of Ms. Coulter's fans please help us all by citing cases where she has cited accurate facts to prove her point on something. I get the impression that nobody here would dispute the notability of her using facts to prove her point to a reporter. The main problems I am encountering is that she tends to use hyperbole a lot and second that nobody seems to be keeping such a record, not even herself. Meanwhile she makes incorrect statements like she did in the CBC interview that are easy to get information about. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> please understand that in my mind Ms. Coulter hasn't proven to be a "useless" commentator yet.

To be clear I define a useless commentator as one who offers opinions and commentary based on incorrect facts and assumptions.

<dd>If an argument can't be sumarized into a short paragraph either it's too confusing or the arguer dosen't really have an argument and need to seek focus. Pick one. You can form your arguments in the form "This incident is notable because (short list) as documented in (short list). <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 19:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hip, it's more of a pragmatic inclusion. I stated above that I'm not a huge proponent of its notability (though the specific question got covered in <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-10,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-10,00.html" rel="nofollow">Time Magazine</a>, an <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2496" class="external text" title="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2496" rel="nofollow">article</a> on FAIR, and asked again on C-SPAN (see video on CBC site of her response on CSPAN) but at a small paragraph consisting of verbatim quotes, the brief paragraph + redirect link prevents people from balooning this article into a debate about Canadian participation in the war, such as HowardDean's recent contribs. Think of it as a plug to prevent future leakage of info not about Coulter into the article, and at its proposed space, it's not exactly violating undue weight, and seeing as it's solely verbatim quotes while giving Coulter the last word, I think it's pretty neutral as well. The notability of the incident <i>does</i> rise above her general comments to just barely satisfy the policy Lou states below, though admittedly not by much. I like your tendency to make much of the fluff here into summary form, but I think this is something where we should use verbatim quotes rather than editor interpretations. Just my 2 cents.--<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 19:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems you have two arguments - 1 it got covered in reliable sources and 2 people will put it back in if we take it out. I accept 1 as a valid arugment - unlike most of the other crufty crap I have removed, coverage in Time is relevent. I suggest you write exactly one paragraph that summarizes what was said in the Time magazine article, and in the Time magazine article only. I ignore argument 2, and believe that crufty crap can be kept out of articles via due vigilence by editors to fighting crufty crap that they both like and do not like. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 19:54, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The version I had previously had an extra para where I make one-sentence mentions of Cloud defending Coulter in his opinion piece, as well as FAIR's critique of Cloud giving Coulter a free pass, but that became a target for debate creep. As it stands, we're only talking about a paragraph. Let's use your style and put the Time + Fair links as pure citations next to the opening sentence, as I have added above, to indicate that the incident is, in fact, notable, and then let the verbatim quotes speak for themselves. Like I said, I appreciate the effort to change passages into summary style, but this is one where I think we need to stick to verbatim quotes in order to avoid debate creep and editor interpretations. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"If an argument can't be sumarized into a short paragraph either it's too confusing or the arguer dosen't really have an argument and need to seek focus." -Hipocrite. Sorry but I think that's an extraordinarily judgmental leap you're taking to say that. Not everything has to be in summary form. I like to make my points as clear as possible, as to not ignore important things I think the reader would bring up in a rebuttal. This doesn't mean "it's too confusing" or that "the arguer doesn't really have an argument". It means the argument is long, not short. Can't derive much out of length of an argument. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 22:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The trivial revert warring going on between Lou Sander and Ubiq is stupid. Here's an oppourunity for you two to justify "attend" vs "disrupt," paying careful attention to our core content policies. I will state for the record that it is transparently obvious that "Coulter is a frequent and controversial speaker on <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus.html" title="Campus">campuses</a>, receiving both praise and protest." is better than the convoluted and multiply subordinated "Coulter is a frequent and controversial speaker on <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus.html" title="Campus">campuses</a>, and her words are both praised and protested."

<dl>
<dd>Revert warring is preventable by discussing changes here before making them. Here's the complete passage:
<dl>
<dd><i>Coulter is a frequent and controversial speaker on college campuses, and her words are both praised and protested. On one occasion, during an appearance at University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her[67][68] Coulter has, on occasion, responded with insulting remarks towards hecklers and protestors who disrupt her speeches.[69][70][71][72]</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not 100% sure about "frequent," but I don't object to it. I agree she's controversial. I agree there is both praise and protest, but I don't think we've found the best way to express that yet. All the ways so far seem stilted to me. I don't disagree with them, I just hope to improve the wording. Maybe the word "controversial" says it all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What we have here is an important speaker who reacts when heckled or otherwise provoked. What often happens is that something she says creates a reaction, or a walkout, or whatever; her talk is often disrupted, and people are often ejected. She responds strongly and usually proportionally and in kind. When it's all over, other people typically criticize the reactors, or Coulter, or both. IMHO we need to talk about that in an evenhanded manner that doesn't include colored words like "homophobic," or "vicious," or "insulting," or "hateful," even though some people might want to include them, advance opinions/reasons why they are appropriate, etc. Specifically, I don't like "responded with insulting remarks," unless a source has characterized them as insulting. I don't like it even if somebody digs up such a source, since this is a BLP, and we are advised to be evenhanded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All who disrupt also attend. Some who attend do not disrupt. Coulter reacts to the former, not the latter. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I discuss/scream on the talk page. I seldom revert, let alone war, but will do both for controversial changes made without prior rational discussion. The sources for "disrupt" are already there: #69-Aja Ray's obscene words, gestures; his arrest. #70-physical attacks. #71-bad link. #72-noise drowned out the speech, two-party guy ejected. Seems fair to call these "disrupted." It's too long, but maybe "attend her speeches and make physical attacks(70) or are ejected or arrested.(69)(72)" Why not just "towards hecklers and protestors?(69)(70)(72)." <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 18:43, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's a clear example of her insulting remark to a student who asked her a question: "During her question-and-answer session, Coulter responded to both fans and protesters. One comment that drew strong audience reactions came from a young man who asked her if she didn't like Democrats, wouldn't it just be better to have a dictatorship?

<dd>She called him "gay boy", which is, <i>insulting</i>. What about his question was <i>disruptive</i> if she wasn't even speaking? Like I said, using "disruptive" implies that she only reacts in this way when someone is disruptive.

<dd>Oh. And Lou, why don't you respond to my argument in the above section instead of just leaving it? I'm beginning to notice a pattern of you doing this sort of thing: making a highly questionable assertion that's the premise of a conclusion that isn't agreed upon, then when someone holds you to it and debates it well enough for you not to have a decent rebuttal, you leave, only to come back days later with the same premise, only in a new section, hoping that everyone forgot the previous debate and that nobody will debate the "new" one. It gets old, really. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 19:53, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
