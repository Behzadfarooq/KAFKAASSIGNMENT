<p>PERSONAL DATA: Born August 24, 1949, in New York City, New York, but considers San Pedro, California, to be her hometown. Anna enjoys snow and water skiing, jogging, flying, scuba diving, reading, photography, and spending time with her daughters. Her mother, Mrs. Riley F. Tingle, resides in San Pedro, California. Father, deceased, July 3, 1982.</p>
<p>EDUCATION: Graduated from San Pedro High School, San Pedro, California, in 1967; received a bachelor of science in Chemistry and a doctor of Medicine from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1971 and 1976, respectively; completed a 1-year internship at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance, California, in 1977; received a master of science in Chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1987.</p>
<p>SPECIAL HONORS: Awarded a National Science Foundation Undergraduate Research Fellowship in 1970, 1971. Graduated from UCLA cum laude and with honors in chemistry. Recipient of: NASA Space Flight Medal; Lloyd’s of London Silver Medal for Meritorious Salvage Operations; Mother of the Year Award 1984; UCLA Professional Achievement Award, UCLA Medical Professional Achievement Award. NASA Exceptional Service Medal, 1999.</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE: After graduating from UCLA in 1971, Dr. Fisher spent a year in graduate school in chemistry at UCLA working in the field of x-ray crystallographic studies of metallocarbonanes. She co-authored 3 publications relating to these studies for the Journal of Inorganic Chemistry. She began medical school at UCLA in 1972 and, following graduation in 1976, commenced a 1-year internship at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance, California. After completing that internship, she specialized in emergency medicine and worked in several hospitals in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>NASA EXPERIENCE: Dr. Fisher was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. In August 1979, she completed a one year training and evaluation period, making her eligible for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Following the one-year basic training program Dr. Fisher’s early NASA assignments (pre-STS-1 through STS-4) included the following: Crew representative to support development and testing of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS); Crew representative to support development and testing of payload bay door contingency EVA procedures, the extra-small Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), and contingency on-orbit TPS repair hardware and procedures; Verification of flight software at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) -- in that capacity she reviewed test requirements and procedures for ascent, on-orbit, and RMS software verification -- and served as a crew evaluator for verification and development testing for STS-2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>For STS-5 through STS-7 Dr. Fisher was assigned as a crew representative to support vehicle integrated testing and payload testing at KSC. In addition, Dr. Fisher supported each Orbital Flight Test (STS 1-4) launch and landing (at either a prime or backup site) as a physician in the rescue helicopters, and provided both medical &amp; operational inputs to the development of rescue procedures. Dr. Fisher was also an on-orbit CAPCOM for the STS-9 mission.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher was a mission specialist on STS-51A which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 8, 1984. She was accompanied by Captain Frederick (Rick) Hauck (spacecraft commander), Captain David M. Walker (pilot), and fellow mission specialists, Dr. Joseph P. Allen, and Commander Dale H. Gardner. This was the second flight of the orbiter Discovery. During the mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada’s Anik D-2 (Telesat H) and Hughes’ LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1), and operated the Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME) device, and the 3M Company’s Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions (DMOS) experiment. In the first space salvage mission in history the crew also retrieved for return to earth the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI satellites. STS-51A completed 127 orbits of the Earth before landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 16, 1984. With the completion of her first flight, Dr. Fisher has logged a total of 192 hours in space.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher was assigned as a mission specialist on STS-61H prior to the Challenger accident. Following the accident she worked as the Deputy of the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office, and as the astronaut office representative for Flight Data File issues. In that capacity she served as the crew representative on the Crew Procedures Change Board. Dr. Fisher served on the Astronaut Selection Board for the 1987 class of astronauts. Dr. Fisher also served in the Space Station Support Office where she worked part-time in the Space Station Operations Branch. She was the crew representative supporting space station development in the areas of training, operations concepts, and the health maintenance facility.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher returned to the Astronaut Office in 1996 after an extended leave of absence to raise her family (1989-1996). When she first returned to the Astronaut Office, she was assigned to the Operations Planning Branch to work on the Operational Flight Data File (procedures) and training issues in support of the International Space Station. She served as the Branch Chief of the Operations Planning Branch from June 1997-June 1998. Following a reorganization of the Astronaut office, she was assigned as the Deputy for Operations/Training of the Space Station Branch from June 1998-June 1999. In that capacity, she had oversight responsibility for Astronaut Office inputs to the Space Station Program on issues regarding operations, procedures, and training for the ISS. She next served as Chief of the Space Station Branch of the Astronaut Office with oversight responsibility for 40-50 astronauts and support engineers. In that capacity, she coordinated all astronaut inputs to the Space Station Program Office on issues regarding the design, development, and testing of space station hardware. Additionally, she coordinated all Astronaut Office inputs to Space Station operations, procedures, and training and works with the International Partners to negotiate common design requirements and standards for displays and procedures. She also served as the Astronaut Office representative on numerous Space Station Program Boards and Multilateral Boards. Dr. Fisher is currently assigned to the Shuttle Branch and works technical assignments in that branch while awaiting an assignment as either a Space Shuttle crewmember on a Space Station assembly mission or as a crewmember aboard the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Hello, there are two bios of Anna Fisher in the United States astronauts list, one under the "A" and another under "F"&#160;:-?</p>
<p><a name="Should_say_.27tested_space_suits_for_women.27.3F" id="Should_say_.27tested_space_suits_for_women.27.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnna_Lee_Fisher_bfc6.html" title="Edit section: Should say 'tested space suits for women'?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Should say 'tested space suits for women'?</span></h2>
<p>According to Bettyann Holtzmann Kevles (BHK), in "Almost Heaven: The Story of Women in Space" ISBN: 0-7382-0209-6, published 2003, Fisher was largely responsible for the design of shuttle-era spacesuits tailored to fit women (that is to say that as an astronaut she worked closely with the engineers and tested the results, providing feedback which the engineers used). This is not in the wiki page, and is perhaps notable enough that it should be.</p>
<p>BHK apparently interviewed Fisher (along with many other astronauts and cosmonauts) for the book.</p>
<p>Although this is missing from the wiki, it *is* in the original NASA bio (quoted on this talk page), though it is nearly unrecognizable due to the use of NASA jargon: This bio credits her with work on "the extra small extravehicular mobility unit"! "Extravehicular mobility unit" "EMU" or even "anthropomorphic extravehicular mobility unit" (!) are NASA-speak for what we mere mortals prefer to call a "spacesuit". For example, if you look at the PDF documents referenced from the wikipedia page on spacesuit (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacesuit#External_links" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacesuit#External_links" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacesuit#External_links</a>) you will find these terms used. "Extra small" would seem to relate to the application for women. BHK also refers to the fact that Fisher is physically rather small, so this was of particular personal interest to her.</p>
<p>There's also a quote (or paraphrases perhaps) of Fisher commenting that "Women aren't small men, women are built differently", in the context of this idea being a hard-sell for NASA engineers.</p>
<p>I was using this reference in a paper referencing "personal technology for space", including spacesuits, and came across this bio. I'm not a regular wikipedian, but I would like to recommend putting the EMU design back on the main page, as it was something of a political and social landmark -- even if the NASA bio does rather play it down.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>In fairness, BHK has a definite angle in her treatment of the material. I wouldn't call her 'biased' (indeed she seems to be a very balanced journalistic observer), but obviously she's interested specifically in women's issues related to space, which might make this subject much more important to her than in the general history of space development.</p>
