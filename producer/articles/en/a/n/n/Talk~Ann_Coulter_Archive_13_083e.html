<p>Pardon me, I've been enjoying myself over at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest_Warrior_6648.html" title="Protest Warrior">Protest Warrior</a> lately so I apologize if this has been discussed. The following text has been inserted in the Plagiarism and Factual accuracy section.</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;"><i>On page 134 of Coulter's book, Slander, Coulter claims that during Reagan's Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan's approval ratings fell five percent, from 80 to 75%. A Christian Science Monitor article is cited from January 7, 1987. In actuality, the article states, Reagan's approval ratings fell from 63 to 47%.</i>
<p><i>Coulter relies heavily on the LexisNexis search, a program designed to search various newspapers with the use of keywords or phrases. Many of Coulter's claims are that various "left leaning" newspapers did not cover one event or story due to a hidden agenda. However, Coulter's use of keywords and phrases when searching, give her incomplete results. Many of her claims have come to light as false, having the newspapers she claims not covering a certain story, indeed covering it.</i></p>
<p><i>In Slander, Coulter alleges The New York Times did not cover NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt's death until two days after he died:</i></p>
<p><i>"The day after seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt died in a race at the Daytona 500, almost every newspaper in America carried the story on the front page. Stock-car racing had been the nation's fastest-growing sport for a decade, and NASCAR the second-most-watched sport behind the NFL. More Americans recognize the name Dale Earnhardt than, say, Maureen Dowd. (Manhattan liberals are dumbly blinking at that last sentence.) It took The New York Times two days to deem Earnhardt's death sufficiently important to mention it on the first page. Demonstrating the left's renowned populist touch, the article began, 'His death brought a silence to the Wal-Mart.' The Times went on to report that in vast swaths of the country people watch stock-car racing. Tacky people were mourning Dale Earnhardt all over the South!"</i></p>
<p><i>The The New York Times did cover Earnhart's death and covered it on the front page. Earnhardt died on February 18, 2001. Another article appeared in the Times on the front page, on February 19, 2001, one day later, after their intial front-page story, written by sportswriter Robert Lipsyte, making it two days in a row the The New York Times covered Earnhardt's death. Coulter cites an article indeed written two days later, by Rick Bragg, a Pulitzer Prize winner who grew up in the South, who wrote a personal piece on Earnhardt and his passing, bringing the total to three times in which the Times covered Earnhardt, three days in a row.</i></p>

<p>Several points seem to be specifically unsupported original research and the rest of it (which may be original research as well) is of questionable notability. It seems like an attempt to list occasions when Coulter was/appears to be inaccurate. This section, IMHO, should not be used to allow any editor to subjectively choose and list those instances. The examples chosen for inclusion, IMHO, should at least have been notable enough to have been written about in some reliable sources.

<dd>Good timing. I glanced at this section recently, and was about to comment once I looked more closely. I haven't researched your specific items, but the section seemed to me to be full of unreferenced and poorly referenced material, the likes of which can be deleted without comment. In addition to that, overall, this section is NOT very suitable for something in a biography of a living person. Editors should read the material on that subject, and try hard to comply. I believe that disinterested observers would see this section particularly, and several others as well, as attempts to defame the subject of the article. I avert my eyes from those who think that just because something can be referenced, it should be in this encyclopedia, and is not any sort of attempt to defame, etc. etc. etc. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 18:30, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> states that original research, "<i>includes unpublished material, for example, arguments, concepts, data, ideas, statements, or theories, or <u>any new analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position</u>.</i> (emphasis mine) With no external sources saying, "Here Coulter said X. And here is Y, proving X is wrong," I don't see how the above material can possibly be anything <u>other</u> than original research.

<dd>Based upon the above, I believe that this inserted text (which is supported by Franken's attack piece "Slander") should be removed as well. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 10:00, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I deleted the stuff about Reagan's popularity, since it was badly sourced (<a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>). The reference about the Christian Science Monitor pointed not to the CSM, but to an unspecified section of another book. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:49, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The material attempting to explain <i>why</i> Coulter is inaccurate appears to be original research. (Me, I think she's just making shit up instead of using L/N poorly.) But the material about her inaccuracies such as the NYT Earnhart article should remain. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 14:25, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO, editors who "think she's just making shit up" should consider recusing themselves from involvement in articles about "her" (unless, of course, their "thinking" is backed up by something very solid). The reason for my opinion on this is that it is EXTREMELY difficult to avoid expressing such a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Bias" title="WP:NPOV">prejudiced point of view</a> in one's edits.</dd>

<dd>The subject of this particular article is an accomplished attorney who provides hundreds of end notes (at Wikipedia we call them "references" or "cites") for her assertions. A very few of them are challenged by sometimes-qualified people, many of whom have a very anti-Coulter point of view. When the challenges are valid (which is infrequent), the errors are corrected in the next printing. Whatever one may think by reading this sometimes not-so-responsibly-written Wikipedia article, this is NOT an author who habitually "makes shit up." <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allow me to butt into a conversation that has nothing to do with me. Your point is very valid, Mr. Sander, every editor here should fear administrators abusing Wiki to their own selfish ends. (Not saying that is happening here, just saying it is a valid concern to have). I think considering the sheer number of editor's here though, even if an administrator holds a bias, there will be enough people to counteract it especially if every one is acting in good faith. It just makes it more difficult. Even moreso when there are people here not in good faith. It is important to have people who have a passion, both pro and con on the subject, contribute. That is the best method to reach NPOV. However, on the flip side, it does lead to choppy articles, but I guess you can't have it all. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 17:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no reason that an administrator should not be able to express his or her opinion on a subject provided it is within the normal limits of civility towards other editors and does not sidetrack the talk page into becoming a soapbox for his or her views. I doubt that people would be confused into thinking some random opinion of one of about a thousand administrators is the official opinion of Wikipedia, especially if that opinion is not in the article. Is someone really going to think that "Ann Coulter is making shit up" is the official position of the Wikimedia Foundation? This is all irrelevant; what's fundamentally important is the content of the article, and once again if you detect anything amiss in my article edits, feel free to call me on it, but until then let's try to use this space to discuss the article content. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For what it's worth, as the person who originally pointed out what appeared to be original research, it now appears that the material is validly sourced.

<dd>Ya, I recognize most of that material from the Coulter chapters in Franken's book. I was away for a few days, just a few points. First, Lou, when someone advises someone else to "consider recusing themselves from involvement in articles" because of their expressed viewpoints on the matter, they are, in fact, accusing them of unsurmountable bias as to be fit to edit this page. This is what the end result of your language produced whether or not you meant it. On a related point, I don't seem to be able to locate any edits or talk page suggestions of yours to this page that are not beneficial to the subject (I could easily be mistaken, but I don't have time to go through the diffs, lets just say a casual glance yields no results), so I would refrain from advising dis-involvement from other editors because of their apparent views on the subject. Unfortunately, you seem to have taken a habit of refraining from answering any of my posts directed at you, so I hope you will listen but I will not take your silence as agreement on the matter. What is more germane IMHO about this discussion is whether such material belongs on her biography page or on the book article pages. Why are we even thinking of devoting 4 whole paragraphs on her bio page to (pretty solid) charges of mis-representing sources when we can put the material on her book articles? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been on wikibreak for some weeks until recently, so I'm just noticing some of the changes that have been made. The lead image is the most eye-catching one.

<dd>Another agreement. The only potential reservation comes from the Fair Use rationale of using the book cover in an article not specifically about the book. I am comfortable making such a fair use defense but I don't think that it's standard practice in Wikipedia to claim fair use outside of the article which is *specifically* about the object at hand (the book, in this case). But it was certainly a much "nicer" (higher quality &amp; better aesthetics, IMHO) photo than the current one. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 04:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In defense of the image, this particular one was cropped for the thumbnail head shot on her site. It may not be the glam photo that Coulter fans want, but she seems to like it.

<dd>Rolling the eyes is not a comedic technique -- it is a relaxation technique similar to a sigh. None of that matters though.

<dd>While I'm quite clearly not a Coulter fan (look through the archive for one of my comments), I'd have to say I agree, it does look to me like she trying to be funny. Of course, she is probably be doing that because she has no idea what to say and/or knows she's losing the argument and/or how to respond seriously to the comments so instead chooses to try to make light of the situation (and given this is Fox News, they and most of their listeners would just let her get away with it rather then to wonder why she didn't respond) but I too am skeptical whether this merits inclusion. It does show IMHO how silly she is (both her actions and what she said) but unless it has merited great mention it probably isn't notable enough. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I actually don't see that segment, given Ann's well known positions on the issues, as that remarkable that it would merit space in the article. I also don't think her joking remarks about 'can I leave?' or 'Sean, help me!' elevate it to a significantly notable event. But as I mentioned above, if someone were to present the video segment with a properly neutral citation, I would not object to it. The issue I see is trying to justify the notability of this segment vs. countless others, but I can possibly see it being used as 'typical'. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have long wondered why editors so diligently seek and post negative material about Ann Coulter, but not about other controversial people, and why the negative material is so strongly enhanced and defended by those who post it. My eyes have recently been opened, however, and now I no longer wonder. Nevertheless, this IS a biography of a living person, and I believe we should refrain from posting such a huge amount of negative material, regardless of its being well- or poorly-sourced. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 18:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reviewing the video and many sources, I've put several facts and links into this section of the main article, including specific details of Canadian troops' nineteen-year presence in Vietnam/Indochina. It is false to claim that Canada did not send troops there, particularly in light of Coulter's clarifying "Indochina?" (Please remember that during the time Canadian troops were there, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Indochina_8ee2.html" title="French Indochina">French Indochina</a> was in turmoil, borders were being established and moved, and so forth.

<p>First off, I either hate Ann Coulter with all my heart or I think she's the greatest living American author, depending on whether you disagree with my suggestion here or not. I just wanted to get that out of the way, as I'm sure my personal motivations will be brought up. Now, to my actual suggestion: the plagiarism section as it stands is way too much. Not too much as in the material shouldn't exist somewhere, but on a biography page we really <i>really</i> shouldn't be devoting so much space to these claims. It's not that these claims do not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or are not sourced properly, but do we need to take 8 paragraphs on her bio page? For the whole passage about Slander, I'm going to move it off to the Slander website. Book-specific charges should be placed on each book's individual article. What should remain, ideally, is a 1-2 paragraph section (like it was before) that is equivalent of what's left when a daughter article is split off and a summary para remains. Blah blah iAuthenticate, blah blah Coulter's publisher's defended her, blah blah something else, and that's it. If we <i>really</i> want to keep all this here, I think a daughter article is quite necessary at this point, but I would much rather place the book-specific info on each book's page, as it makes much more organizational sense. What do other people think? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 19:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the article Ann claimed Canada send troups into the Vietnam war, but that it commonly claimed that they didn't. User Lou Sander claims that this is a fallacy. According to the articles on the subject although there was combat between member of the Canadian army, and members of various Vientamese groups, there does not appear to have been any <i>sending</i> of troups into Vietnam or into the war. Canada's involvment appears to be purely peripheral, so Ann's interviewer would appear to be correct at first glance. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 11:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a few problems with this material.</p>
<p><b>1)</b> I think it, at best, <u>exceedingly poor placement</u> to include <u>any</u> of this in the section of her article devoted to simply summarizing her television appearances. The section of the article devoted to "plagiarism and factual inaccuracy" seems "tailor-made" for this kind of thing, does it not?</p>
<p><b>2)</b> Simply including a video of the interview (regardless of whether it was from "youtube" or the network that broadcast the interview itself) is <u>not</u> a source sufficient to make the allegation that Coulter said anything inaccurate anything but <u>original research</u>.</p>
<p><b>3)</b> Lou's conclusion that the interviewer was wrong, while based on impressive research, is also original research.</p>
<p><b>4)</b> If there aren't many sources (qualifying under wikipedia policy) which actually accuse Coulter of making a mistake, I question the notability of the entire incident. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 12:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree. I think the correct way to handle this and similar 'incidents' or video segments is establish their notability by looking for some acceptable third party review that would count as a <i>secondary</i> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Just including the video with a WP description is insufficient and would be a combination of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and <i>primary</i> sourcing. For example, let's say that CNN reviews the segment on Fox and says that "last night Coulter appeared on Fox and said 'Canada sent troops to Vietnam' while we all know they did not" - that statement, attributed to CNN, can be used.

<p>I think the interview and commentary about it are relevent. Coulter's critics have sought to portray her as "uninformed" or "sloppy with facts", etc., in an attempt to silence her (or at least to get people to ignore her).</p>
<p>I studied the interview around a year ago. My impression is that Coulter and the interviewer were talking at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Coulter meant by "sent troops to Vietnam" either or both of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Canada's <b>government</b> sent its own soldiers to the area, to intervene in the the regional conflict which included Vietnam; or,</li>
<li>Canada (the nation itself) sent around 10,000 men to fight in the Vietnam war (but not as soldiers of the Canadian Army).
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia says, "several thousand Canadians joined the U.S. military and fought with the Americans in Vietnam; estimates range from 3,500 to 10,000." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War#Canadians_in_the_U.S._military" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War#Canadians_in_the_U.S._military" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The "interviewer" made no effort to clear up the conflict over terminology, but pounced on Coulter and used her remark against her. If he were a Wikipedian, his "edit" would have been reverted for "NPOV violations". It seemed like a partisan attack to me.</p>
<p>We could compare this to "America sent aid to tsunami victims". Some of that would be the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._government_e2f2.html" title="U.S. government">U.S. government</a> and some would be the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_people.html" title="American people">American people</a>.</p>
<p>We need to ask, in each case, did you mean the government or the people? Our readers will be interested to know which authors can or can't think fast on their feet, of course, but others will be interested to know (after the dust settles) what their <b>written positions</b> are.</p>
<p>It would be good to have a neutral description of this incident in Wikipedia, as there are thousands of references to it in the blogosphere. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Uncle Ed:</b> My fondest hope is that mention of this interview will never again return to the Ann Coulter article. It has been handled by some very bad editors in a way that has done a HUGE amount of harm to Wikipedia's reputation as a neutral source. I will do whatever it takes to keep it out, and I think I'll have a lot of help from other non-very-bad editors. But at the risk of waking sleeping rabid dogs, I gotta comment:</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) GMTA, but not <i>exactly</i> alike. I studied the film VERY carefully this morning. I definitely agree that the interviewer and Coulter were talking at cross purposes, but I've got a different idea about why. I think that when Coulter brought up "troops to Vietnam," she was talking about the peacekeeper-like Canadian troops who were there from 1954-1973. When the interviewer heard those words, he pounced, possibly/probably because the <b>fighting</b> in Vietnam is an extremely emotional and contentious subject to many Canadians. Coulter, with a puzzled look, reacted to the pounce by offering the more palatable "<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Indochina_8ee2.html" title="French Indochina">Indochina</a>?" which is what the area was called when Canada sent its peacekeeper-like troops there in 1954. When Coulter later said "I'll get back to you," I think she was trying to exit gracefully from an unwinnable argument in which she was very sure of her facts, but maybe not consciously aware of the extreme Canadian sensitivity to "Vietnam" and "troops" and other warlike words.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>2) I agree with your thinking that a widely-available neutral description of the incident would be a very good thing to have. I spent a lot of time this morning researching and marshalling facts about it, some of which are, IMHO, stunning. (Such as the number of troops that were there, their exact dates of arrival and departure, the number who died, the number who got a specific medal for their service, etc.) I wrote it all up, but before I could post it on the talk page, some kind soul put the non-notable, disgracefully negative POV, definitely-doesn't-belong-here reference to it out of its misery. <i>(Please, God, or Fate, or random variation and natural selection, or whoever/whatever determines this stuff, keep that piece of cruft D-E-A-D.)</i> The material for a neutral description exists, and is readily available to people of good intent who can make something great out of it.

<dd>Lou, I encourage you again to include your research, assuming it is properly sourced, in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War_b5d5.html" title="Canada and the Vietnam War">Canada and the Vietnam War</a>, where it is currently not mentioned. Then, if the issue comes up again here (e.g. someone finds a good secondary source discussing the specific Coulter interview) we would be able to properly refer to the facts you uncovered. And even if it never comes here to this article again, that info is useful as part of WP and belongs in its proper place.

<p>I agree this really has no place in the article. Coulter's own material certifies her as an ignorant and hateful nutter. Yet it seems fashionable lately to capture and deconstruct her every gaffe and stutter made on TV and make the judgement "OMG she totally got smacked down on TV." Most of this stuff is weak and non-notable; it reflects more on the obsession of her peanut-gallery critics than on her own lack of intelligence. If you want to look for legitimate negative material on her, just pick up one of her books and select a page at random. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 20:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I'm not arguing for a reinclusion, I have to say I would think the vast majority of people would assume that when you say Canada (or country X) sent troops to Vietnam, you meant the government. Indeed, I don't think it would occur to the vast majority of people you might mean citizens of that country joining other armies. It wouldn't occur to me that's for sure. There are severals regions for this. For starters, citizens joining other armies are there representing that armies country. A Canadian citizen in the US army in Vietnam is a (US) American soldier. Not a Canadian soldier. This is not at all the same as donations. While I think most people would similarly assume you were talking about the government, I think many people would at least appreciate and accept it if you refer to the citizens privately donating money. After all, these people are in a way representing their country. If someone wanted to refer to Canadian citizens joining the US Army to fight in Vietname, I would suggest they would have to make that clear (e.g. although the Canadian government didn't partake in the fight, their citizens did)... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:24, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I think the part about being a Grateful Dead fan is (a) well-referenced and (b) somewhat notable, as it points out a rather odd fact about her that is usually associated with liberals, which are coincidentally her biggest critics (and 'victims?' of her criticism). Personally, I'm not sure why 'Personal Life' was added to the end. I would think that it could all just go into the background and early life section, or maybe added as a single line to the opening paragraph. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 02:28, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know where "Personal life" came from, either, though I tried a bit to track it down.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Four candidates for permanent deletion</span></h2>
<p>Four items that have been discussed and deleted many times have just been restored to the article. They are the "troops in Canada" stuff, the "swimmingly" stuff, the "Adam Carolla non-interview" and a three-year-old book review. You can see the details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=72646670&amp;oldid=72634364" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=72646670&amp;oldid=72634364" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, though there may have been some changes since.</p>
<p>The ancient book review is, as <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> said when he deleted it, a "pointless opinion that sits on its own." In addition, it applies to a book that has its own article, which is a better place for it.</p>
<p>The other items have been discussed to death, and I believe there is <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html#Reasonable_consensus-building" title="WP:CON">consensus</a>, especially on "troops in Canada," that they do not belong in the article. There are many reasons to delete them, including that their relevance to Ann Coulter's notability has not been clearly demonstrated. That fact alone, plus their apparent agenda-pushing nature, possibly/probably puts them into the category of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Malicious_editing" title="WP:BLP">malicious edits</a> to the biography of a living person.</p>
<p>The Criticisms of Ann Coulter article was set up to receive material like this, and it needs more well-sourced items. These would be valuable additions, and would not be seen as malicious.</p>
<p>None of these four items legitimately belong in the Ann Coulter article. I say they should be removed until someone shows reasons for including them, which reasons must be stronger than the pages and pages of discussion that have led to their multiple removals. Editors who care about them should consider moving them to the Criticisms article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redundancy with Criticisms of Ann Coulter</span></h2>
<p>As a newcomer to this article, I only now read the 'Criticisms' article and I realize that much of it is redundant, if not a copy, of this article's content or vice-versa. I personally think all criticism should be folded back into this article (properly interweaved, vetted for proper sourcing, neutrally presented, balanced per BLP, etc), per WP policy of encouraging the interweaving of criticism. If not, then logically we would need to remove all criticism from this article and move it all (and point) to the other. I realize <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> have separate Criticism pages, but I think to do it for a living person is a bad idea and contradicts WP's policy or spirit. BTW, if there is currently a clear wiki-link from this article to the Criticism one then I missed it. Anyway, I think the current situation is not acceptable.

<dd>I agree, and would support a merger.

<dd>I would oppose a merger. A merger was heavily discussed a few weeks ago, but no consensus was reached. Then somebody just merged the two articles, which upset a lot of people who had worked hard at building consensus. Somebody else quickly un-merged the articles, and they've been that way ever since. One of the problems that led to the second article being set up is the great length of the main article. Somebody pointed out the criticism articles for Bill O'Reilly and maybe some others, and many saw that as a good thing to have here. But then instead of MOVING the criticisms, whoever did it just COPIED them. To really have a good setup, they should be deleted from the main article, which should then provide a link or links to the criticism. If somebody put some organization into the Criticism article, we'd have a well-organized place where criticisms could go without strife or constant deletion. The way the main article is right now, and with all the work going on in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WT%7EBLP_141f.html" title="WT:BLP">WT:BLP</a>, I'd expect a LOT of deletions of stuff that might be merged.

<dd>Well excuse my ignorance, but I just can't see how an article about a living person can be written with all the criticism separated out to a different article. Firstly, it contradicts WP policy/guideline of interweaving criticisms, secondly it is flat out illogical. Does that mean the main article only has the positive stuff and anything negative must be pointed to elsewhere? Or do we also have a separate article for the positive stuff? How can a balanced neutral picture possibly be presented that way? Unless I am totally missing the picture here, this is simply irrational and non-encyclopedic.

<dd>I read the Bill O'Reilly piece, I don't see it a necessary precedent. I did find this discussion from <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a>, another POV and troll magnent:
<blockquote>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because praise and criticism sections become magnets for trolls and POV pushers. With a criticism section, people will just keep turning up, slapping any old piece of negative stuff they find on Google, with no attempt to evaluate it or place it in context. Ensuring that both praise and criticism are woven into the text produces a more nuanced and three-dimensional piece of writing that's almost certainly closer to reality, because not black-and-white.

<dl>
<dd>You will note that they are all discussing a <i>section</i> rather than an article, but to me taking out the criticism to an <i>article</i> is even worse and is even more contra-indicated by the same logic. Beyond the troll magnet issue which Jimbo and SlimVirgin refer to, in the case of a separated Criticism section the key question I see is how can the Criticism-less, presumably mostly positive main article be neutral?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I do recognize the issue of excessive length, and for that we can presumably extract controversial <i>issues</i>, like specific TV segments or books that got a lot of press, but the key there would have to be the amount of <i>press coverage</i>, i.e. notability. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:32, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In criticism ARTICLES, <b>the idea is to have a balanced main article</b>, plus a Criticism article for the overflow criticism that doesn't belong in the main article. Example: There are a jillion Coulter statements and interviews that citable anti-Coulter sources have reported on. Some folks want to put them all in the main article, but that would make it unbalanced. The criticism article gives them a place to indulge their desires. Nobody minds too much, or complains about balance, because balance isn't expected. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:37, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should strive to incorporate <i>both</i> criticism and praise into the article. Crum makes a good point, if the criticism section gets overflow, why don't we offshoot specific topics or incidents? At least that wouldn't promote just a bash-Coulter daughter article where the fact that she got a D in an elementary school science project can be added... specific topics would help contain this type of creep. In addition, while you may not agree, I do think there does exist valid criticisms of Coulter (though not nearly as many as appear on this page), and if we adopt your proposal then this article will become whitewashed of any criticism and sucked out into the daughter article, which is <i>definetely</i> not NPOV. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 17:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original research?</span></h2>
<p>I'm trying to develop my understanding of just what constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Also, it's pretty obvious that one or two other editors are pretty shaky on their knowledge about it. Maybe somebody can help us all out. This appears in the Coulter article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is not the first incident of voting irregularity attributed to Coulter; she has consistently failed to explain the disparity in her stated age and the date of her first voter's registration. <font color="red">Her</font> original <font color="red">driver's license, issued in Connecticut, lists her birth date in December, 1961. The driver's license issued to her years later in Washington, D.C., lists the year as 1963. Coulter's own statements regarding her age conform to the date on her D.C. license.</font></i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i><font color="red">Coulter's first voter's registration was completed in 1980.</font> If the date on the D.C. license is correct , she first registered to vote at the age of sixteen, also an incident of voter fraud.</i> (Reference <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>) <i>If, however, the date on the Connecticut license is correct, she may be guilty of having given false information on her D.C. driver's license application, which is also a felony.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of all the material shown, only the stuff in <font color="red">red</font> appears in the reference.

<dd>Here is what the published source (Franken) says:
<blockquote>
<p>"She was born in 1961. Or 1963. Depending on whether you believe her old Connecticut driver's license (1961) or her newer D.C. driver's license. Ann claims the D.C. license is correct, which means that when she registered to vote she was 16. That, of course, would be voter fraud."</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>If voter fraud is a felony, then I am not sure if WP saying that, based on proper source, is OR, but we can always just use 'voter fraud' as in the source. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is original research, and I'm not sure Franken's book would be a reliable source for the issue either, as it is clearly partisan and written with an agenda. I guess we could use Franken's book, in the limited sense of saying this is an assertion that Franken has made. However, I think there should be a better source before this info is allowed to stay.

<dl>
<dd>Franken's book is no more partisan or written with an agenda then Coulter's books. The passage as it stands is definetely OR as Lou points out, but as WJhonson states, if we attribute this passage to Franken's book then it ceases to become OR, as long as we quote it correctly and within context. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 19:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>True, but as this is a biography of Coulter, I do think that there is a legitimate debate about the use of Franken as a reliable source here. Granted the reverse is also true. However, I do say in my post that "I guess we could use Franken's book, in the limited sense of saying this is an assertion that Franken has made.". But if we could find a better source with the same information then we should probably use that instead. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 19:57, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So then in the legitimate debate, you're saying that neither Coulter's books nor Franken's qualify under reliable sources? I would prefer to use both.

<dd>True, except I believe Franken provides his sources in the back of the book.

As <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> clearly states, the responsibility of proper sourcing lies squarely on the shoulders of the person wanting to include the information.

<dd>How did I question Lou's good faith or personally attack him? I questioned the logic behind his dismissal of material due to an uncritical assessment of bias rather than analyzing the veracity of the claim or of the quality of the sources Franken cited. There was no ill intent or malice towards Lou, I actually have a lot of respect for Lou, I just disagree with removing material because Franken doesn't like Coulter rather than the veracity of his statements. Are we really going to perform a blanket removal of all info from sources that do not like the subject of the article? That would be ludicrous. Given a dispute, analyzing his sources against <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and using those instead should be sufficient to settle this.

<dd>I agree with Malber on that particular site, but the article definitely lacks balance to the negative material. In my experience, almost every accusation of lying or other offenses ends up being wrong or weak. But editors here are intolerant of seeing that illustrated. A week or two ago there was quite a lot of very specific, NPOV detail about the plagiarism and factual accuracy accusations, but somebody took it out.</dd>

<p>If it is relevant to this article that a single reporter states she atttends a certain church and brings guests (and why is that importantor even relevant?) then it is certainly relevant that the officials of that church state they do not know her and and she is not a member. This looks like an obvious attempt by Coulter fans to rehabilitate her, since she frequently claims her Christiainity is the reason she makes her living attacking liberals. I found no Discusion refuting the citings of church officials. I added the balancing statement, assuming that someone has prevented the irrelevant citation from being removed. - getterstraight</p>
<p>This should be put under personal life:</p>
<p>Borcehr's "presentation points out the recent TIME Magazine profile of Coulter which implies that she is a member of Redeemer Presbyterian, an evangelical Christian church in New York, and yet the ministry at the church never seems to have heard of her!</p>
<p>The Redeemer church, "whose non-political stance is well-known, disavows all hateful and hostile speech," according to Borchers' presentation, had to "Google" her name to figure out who she was!

<dd>The reliable <i>Time</i> magazine reported some facts about her church attendance. Those facts are notable in a section about her religious beliefs. Her religious beliefs are part of her notability, since she proclaims them and since her book <i>Godless</i> is essentially about religion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Media Matters Straw Man</span></h2>
<p>I don't know who put those bullet points up citing examples of errors that Media Matters found with Coulter's works, but I haven't seen a straw man argument like that in a while. Someone went through and chose the least egregious examples along with characterizing them to the point as if they were just stupid. Where is this one?:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On Page 158, Coulter cited a study from the education journal Education Next in claiming that private-school teachers earn 60 percent less than public school teachers. Coulter wrote:</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 2002, Bob Chase, the president of the National Education Association (NEA), complained that teachers don't make as much as engineers ($74,920) or lawyers ($82,712). But I'm thinking, Why stop at engineers and lawyers? Why shouldn't kindergarten teachers earn as much as Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts? A better benchmark comparison for public school teachers might be private school teachers. Teachers in the private sector earn about 60 percent less than public school teachers.7 And their students actually learn to read.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>The study Coulter cited -- "Fringe Benefits" -- actually found that, "Starting pay in private schools begins at 78 percent that of public schools, rises to 92 percent of public school pay by a teacher's 12th year, and declines thereafter." <b>It is unclear where Coulter arrived at her "60 percent less" figure, but it certainly did not come from the source she cited.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Or this one:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On Pages 199-200, Coulter attacked "atheists" who "need evolution to be true." Citing what she presented as two Washington Post articles from May 15, 2005, Coulter wrote:</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although God believers don't need evolution to be false, atheists need evolution to be true. William Provine, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University, calls Darwinism the greatest engine of atheism devised by man. His fellow Darwin disciple, Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins, famously said, "Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."1 This is why there is a mass panic on the left whenever someone mentions the vast and accumulating evidence against evolution.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>The Washington Post articles Coulter cited are actually one article by Michael Powell, with the headline, "Doubting Rationalist," accompanied by the subhead, " 'Intelligent Design' Proponent Phillip Johnson, and How He Came to Be." <b>But nowhere in the article will one find the Dawkins quote Coulter cited.</b></i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lou, you should know by now I have a low-opinion of MediaMatters. I also think Coulter's errors it cites are very minor and simply attest to how partisan the organization is. That said, unfortunately, I think your last edit might be original research. Also, I think my edit might have contained an error. Apparently Media Matters says Coulter said private school teachers' salaries are not 60 percent <u>of</u> but 60 percent <u>less than</u> government school teachers. If that's an error I will fix that. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 16:21, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe "possible" would be better. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> says in part that "...the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources which provide information that is directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say." There's no doubt that I cited a reliable source providing directly related info. In fact, it's the same source quoted by MediaMatters. To me, the important thing here is that Media Matters says "she lies," and the other reference says "she doesn't."</dd>
<dd>You've got the 60% business right. A LOT of people don't know the difference between "60% of" and "60% less than." Someone could point it out in the article, but the risk of doing original research, not to mention confusing people who don't have a firm grasp of arithmetic. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 16:57, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

Your edit definitely contains information that is "directly related to the topic of the article" and adheres to what the sources say.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Columns: False and Misleading Citation</span></h2>
<p>In the <b>"Columns"</b> section, I deleted "Generally, her columns are highly critical of the liberal point-of-view. She has argued, for instance, that liberals' insistence on sexual freedoms belies their calls for restrictions in other areas of life, particularly on the issue of health. For example, she asserted that although liberals often lobby for public bans on smoking, they take far less precaution in their sexual health, citing the acts of anal sex and fisting as examples." (Cited reference <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607060007" class="external text" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607060007" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.)</p>
<p>The citation, falsely claimed to be from a column, is actually from a <i><a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Matters_696f.html" title="Media Matters">Media Matters</a></i> report on a radio show.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">International Campaign to End Landmines incident</span></h2>
<p>While the page is still protected I'd like to ask someone to help me improve this section.</p>
<p>I have a better source for this October 1997 incident mentioned in the "Television" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter's first national media appearance came after she was hired in 1996 by <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> as a legal correspondent. She was fired the next year after an exchange with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Muller_16ed.html" title="Bobby Muller">Bobby Muller</a>, president of the anti-war group <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_Veterans_of_America_Foundation_a4d7.html" title="Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation">Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation</a> who had been <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralysis.html" title="Paralysis">paralyzed</a> due to combat wounds. In response to Muller's claim that during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> American soldiers had stepped mainly on their own landmines, she reportedly said "No wonder you guys lost."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Coulter claimed that she did not know Muller was disabled.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's from the <i>Time</i> magazine cover story about her, by John Cloud, that right now is footnote number 5, and is the secondary source quoted by tertiary <i>Washington Post</i> source used in the paragraph about the incident.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Eight months later, Coulter’s relationship with msnbc ended permanently after she tangled with a disabled Vietnam veteran on the air. Robert Muller, co-founder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, asserted that “in 90% of the cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up [in Vietnam]—Ann, are you listening?—they were our own mines.” (Muller was misquoting a 1969 Pentagon report that found that 90% of the components used in enemy mines came from U.S. duds and refuse.) Coulter, who found Muller’s statement laughable, averted her eyes and responded sarcastically: “No wonder you guys lost.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to rewrite the paragraph in a more precise and accurate way:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter's first national media appearance came after she was hired in 1996 by <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> as a legal correspondent.

<p>I would appreciate it if some registered user would make the replacement in the aforementioned section. Thank you, 216.119.139.84 03:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You certainly DO have a better source. The original source in <i>Time</i> gives a different picture than does Howard Kurtz second-hand comments on it in his opinion column.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I propose to replace all after "hired in 1996 by MSNBC as a legal correspondent" with this verbatim from the <i>Time</i> article:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The network dismissed her at least twice: first in February 1997, after she insulted the late Pamela Harriman, the U.S. Ambassador to France, even as the network was covering her somber memorial service. <s>Coulter said Harriman was one of those women who "used men to work their way up" and suggested "Sharon Stone or Madonna" as her replacement.</s> Even so, the network missed Coulter's jousting and quickly rehired her. Eight months later, Coulter's relationship with MSNBC ended permanently after she tangled with a disabled Vietnam veteran on the air. Robert Muller, co-founder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, asserted that "in 90% of the cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up [in Vietnam]--Ann, are you listening?--they were our own mines." (Muller was misquoting a 1969 Pentagon report that found that 90% of the components used in enemy mines came from U.S. duds and refuse.) Coulter, who found Muller's statement laughable, averted her eyes and responded sarcastically: "No wonder you guys lost." <s>It became an infamous--and oft-misreported--Coulter moment. The Washington Post and others turned the line into a more personal attack: "People like you caused us to lose that war."</s></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The current editorialized version doesn't cover both her firings, and omits the important fact of Muller's misquoting his facts. The Harriman stuff and the business about the exact wording of the "lose the war" comment are pretty trivial, so needn't be included. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 04:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on Arabs and Muslims</span></h2>
<p>This section is misnamed and isn't properly focused. Read the citations. Her comments are mostly about airport security, not about "Arabs and Muslims." She prominently mentions Arabs and Muslims as potential security risks, and discusses the whys and wherefores of her opinions on that subject. She doesn't really get involved in other aspects of Arab ethnicity or Muslim religious beliefs. I don't know exactly what title would be best for this section, but somebody should definitely rename it. Maybe "Coulter on Arabs and Muslims as security risks."<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, here is part of her quote:
<blockquote>
<p>We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>I think here she is not referring to airport security but Arabs in general. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see why you might think that. I think she was referring to supporters of the 9/11 bombers, many of whom are Arabs and Muslims (but many of whom are not, and in any event the A&amp;M among them are only a tiny fraction of the whole number of A&amp;M). Those are our points of view. The point is that her remarks about Arabs and Muslims are all, or nearly all, made in a security context. Isn't it a misrepresentation to leave that context out of this section of the article? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 16:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the overall context leading to her above comments was airport security related. But her statements, as quoted, are rather far sweeping ("invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them") and go well beyond airport security. As such, I would think that the current title is reasonable, whereas limiting it to "Arabs and Muslims as security risks" would be too narrow given these broad statements. I think your point is that the title is not reflective of the fact that the <i>context</i> was security, which of course I agree with, but I also think that her views and the context are fairly self explanatory to the reader. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 17:09, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What is fairly self-explanatory to THIS reader is that Wikipedia is wrongly and irresponsibly attributing <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_Rushdie_d1a4.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>-like and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_cartoons.html" title="Danish cartoons">Danish cartoons</a>-like aspects to Ann Coulter.

<dd>In this particular case, the quote stands on its own. If you feel that it should be introduced in a different way, feel free to suggest the wording. BTW, having read the 'Satanic Verses' I don't recall Rushdie saying anything negative about Arabs or Islam, though I am aware that some perceived it that way. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:40, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Here are some comments I made before an edit conflict. I think they may still be helpful.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statements are sweeping, but only towards individuals who support terrorism against the United States and those who lead them into that political stance. What, worldwide, 90-95% of terrorist killings were sponsored by Muslims? And in their region by Arabs? If so, it's appropriate to point out that within the race and/or religion there are internal problems that affect others that demands greater scrutiny <i>in a security context</i>. I think regarding Coulter's sweeping statements it would be well to remember Winston Churchill's remark, "I do not resent criticism, even when, for the sake of emphasis, it parts for the time with reality".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter responds to attempts to shade or compromise what she feels are valid principles with vivid pictures of her opponents entangled in the consequences of denying those principles. For example some argue profiling will wound Arab pride. So she writes an airline slogan, "You are now free to move about the cabin--not so fast, Mohammed!" creating a memorable presentation of the plain argument "It's silly to be afraid of offending them, how bad could it get, they're big enough to take it". But out of context, this could be misinterpreted as simply scorning all Arabs and Muslims.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's another example of this in section (which ought to be corrected or removed):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I think airlines ought to start advertising: 'We have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by Arabs.'" When asked what Muslims should do for travel, she responded that they, "could use flying carpets."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The actual source says <i>in the context of egging her on,</i> "How <i>would</i> Arabs travel" [to avoid civil rights abuses]. The implication being that the abuses complained about in such nuisance lawsuits would be so traumatic that they must be avoided at all costs. The flying carpets comment being shorthand for "You're entangled in denying realities as bad as the denial I just brought up; it's silly to worry about Muslims being turned into victims. Even to those who know Muslims only in the broadest possible stereotypes, Middle-easterners have never had a reputation for not being resourceful." As it stands now, you might conclude she was bringing up the exaggerated stereotype for its own sake, rather than to help <i>emphasize her argument</i>. It is thus not part of a larger "controversial trend"--which is alone what this section should be about. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 19:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, I am open for any other ideas for the intro that you think will be 'more accurate' but will cover her quote. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:47, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lou, I think the first criterion of this section being in the article is that it originated an actual controversy. Not just controversy among the politically correct asking "what's to be done with this Ann Coulter person?" I believe this subject meets this criterion, because of the "invade their countries" comment. It was brought up twice in her interview with Katie Couric about <i>Slander</i>, and it wasn't even in the book. Coulter later said it was a comment that followed her around. Although it was apparently her opponents that stirred up the controversy, it was ground Coulter chose to defend.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This controversy highlighted follow-up comments along the same lines both before and after Coulter's defense on the Today Show. And they didn't all have to do with airline security, they also had to do with national security and the need for heightened scrutiny of the source culture and religion of at least 9 out of ten of the terrorist actions around the world. <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092001.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092001.asp" rel="nofollow">This column</a> spells out her airline and national security proposals, nine days after the attacks. Coulter claims it was the bone of contention that caused National Review Online to drop her column and terminate her editorship.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter also might be considered a notably early proponent, as a columnist and TV pundit, of assaulting the host countries of terrorists with retaliatory force.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I would add the ideas of national security, heightened scrutiny and early proponent of retaliatory force to the intro (if it can be fit into an intro sentence or two). Then add back in her responses to the "invade their countries" comment from the Today show and add her response to the phrase in <i>How to Talk to a Liberal</i> (Now more than ever) as new material. (I can get citations and text for these), and drop the airline stuff unless it's presented as instances of Coulter incorporating the subject into her humorous remarks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "rag-head" stuff was picked up by blogs (not college student bloggers as the section says now), Cybercast News Service, and a few columnists. Tony Snow on his show called it "exhibitionism" and that it was like "she pulled her dress over head to get attention". I'm inclined to agree that it wasn't a real controversy.</dd>

<p><b>Thanks to all for their thoughtful comments.</b> I've read and re-read the section in the article, slept on the matter, then read the section again (plus this section and all or most of the citations). I want to modify my original premise and propose a better solution. Here it is:</p>
<p>The section "Coulter on Arabs and Muslims" is misnamed and isn't properly focused. Read the cited sources. Her comments are mostly about responding to 9/11, not about Arabs and Muslims. She prominently mentions Arabs (mostly) and Muslims (almost not at all) as potential security risks, and discusses the whys and wherefores of her opinions. She doesn't really get involved in other aspects of Arab ethnicity or Muslim religious beliefs.</p>
<p>I propose to replace this:</p>

<p>The entire controversy section needs to be redone. Upon my review, the only sub-section that should remain is the 'Jersey Girls' section. It cites the incident on the <i>Today Show</i>, and reactions from Hillary Clinton, and Rahm Emanuel who urged a boycott of her book. This is the only one that cites significant controversy that arose due to her comments. The 'NY Times bombing' section points to a short comment on <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i> and a negative comment from Colmes cited by E&amp;P, the 'Coulter on Arabs and Muslims' section cites a negative reaction from bloggers, and the 'Coulter on Evolution' cites negative reaction from evolutionists as might be expected. If there isn't significant reaction from the mainstream press, it is not notable controversy. If a quotation is listed without also citing a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that describes the controversy, then the inclusion is because the editor feels that the comments are controversial. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 13:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Lou</span></h2>
<p>Lou, this is about the Television section again. I wasn't really concerned about how the section was going to be fixed as long as it was corrected by the better source. But the <i>Washington Post</i> article includes the report that Coulter didn't know the representative was disabled. Seeing the exerpt from <i>Time</i> down in black and white, I think it looks kind of harsh on Coulter's end without that disclaimer. The source is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A208-2005Apr19?language=printer" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A208-2005Apr19?language=printer" rel="nofollow">The Conservative Pin-Up Girl</a>. The excerpt by Kurtz is "I did note that, according to Coulter, the vet was appearing by satellite and she didn't know he was disabled." Let me know what you think. Here is the full citation if you decide you want to use it: "Kurtz, Howard.

<dd>When I cleaned up the section, I almost kept the "she didn't know he was disabled" part, but I decided to keep things simple. Looking again at <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, especially

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm thinking that I should have left it in. We say the guy she argued with is disabled. If we are to be responsible, neutral, and factual, we also need to say that she didn't know it. At worst, this is a borderline case, and we do harm by leaving out the other pertinent facts.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Age?</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>In 2002, an opinion column in the Washington Post stated that in 1980, Ann Coulter registered to vote in New Canaan, CT. A Connecticut driver's license lists her birth date in December, 1961. But a driver's license issued to her years later in Washington, D.C., says she was born in December, 1963.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What the issue is here isn't particularly clear. I would guess the voting age in Connecticut is 18 so if she were born in 1963, she wouldn't yet be illegible to vote but this is not clear from the paragraph... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:57, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Kyaa. The age business is in here only because of a previous malicious attempt to impute a felony to the lady. "Her driver's license says she's 40. Her old driver's license says she's only 38. If she's only 38, it follows that she wasn't 18 when she registered to vote in CT. That's a felony in FL (and by implication it's a very bad thing in CT)." The mind boggles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The age question is a legitimate aspect of Ann Coulter, but definitely not connected with voting. It should be removed from this section.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photo again</span></h2>
<p>This was discussed recently (visible in archive 6) but I think it needs to be brought up again. The current lead photo IMHO needs to be replaced. While it's a photo released on her website, to me anyway it's highly unflattering and makes her look like she's anorexic and is much worse IMHO then the Time photo (which despite her objections, is decent enough, it's quite clear that it's distorted so it doesn't give her an unflaterring look). Her site has several others to choose from <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/gallery.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/gallery.cgi" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. We could take one of the ones with her and someone else and get wikipedia to only show her as the thumbnail... The photo is one of the best in actually showing her and at a decent size (perhaps that's why she looks so unflattering? who knows...) however I personally believe it would still be better to use another photo for the lead. Perhaps this one? <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/photo.cgi?image=annblack.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/photo.cgi?image=annblack.jpg" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

<p>Folks, please don't put the reference to her birthdate in the first sentence where it mentions 'born: ...'. This just looks bad.

<p>I'm thinking that the former stuff in the lead, about "stronger national security measures" and "closer scrutiny of Arabs and Muslims" really should be restored. They are the major ideas in her 9/11 writings, and quite a few of her post-9/11 columns covered those exact themes. Thirty of those columns were reprinted, mostly under the heading "This is War" in <i>How to Talk to a Liberal.</i> We don't have to cite all of them to state the points she was unambiguously making. In addition to the illustrative "invade their countries" quote, the other sources cited in the article back up the deleted material. Though as the article stands now, they are said to illustrate some sort of anti-A&amp;M sentiment, they are primarily about national/airport security. I'm reluctant to restore the security/Arabs stuff myself, but I think it should go back in. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:53, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As long as every lead/intro is followed by a quote (or otherwises linked to a reliable source) that essentially says the same thing, possibly in greater detail, I would have no problem.

<dd>I hear what you are saying, but we aren't just presenting Coulter's words and prefacing them with brief explanations. We're presenting Ann Coulter's views on certain important matters. Every word and thought of hers doesn't need a supporting reference, as long as her opinions are fairly and accurately presented, and can be verified. The business about national security and stronger scrutiny of A&amp;M is notable and is supported by many verifiable citations in the section. There are dozens more, if needed.</dd>

<dd>Here is another example of the principle: "Coulter frequently speaks against liberals and Democrats" is absolutely accurate, truthful, and not very controversial. To speak out against L&amp;D doesn't connote anything negative about the speaker. Not much verification is required, and it's not quite "original research" to say "frequently" about something so obvious and uncontroversial.</dd>

<dd>On the other hand "Coulter frequently lies" (for example) is something different, because of the negative connotations of lying. Such a negative and potentially libelous statement, due to the principles of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> needs to be carefully supported by strong, accurate, and specific citations. The word "frequently," in this context, needs to be clearly shown NOT to be "original research," because it is negative and controversial.</dd>

<dd>I still think the deleted material about about "stronger national security measures" and "closer scrutiny of Arabs and Muslims" should be restored, because it is the essence of what she says about U.S. response to 9/11. It would probably be better to preface the quotation (which is just a more explicit citation) with "For example,...", and maybe to include more citations if somebody feels they are needed. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:25, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She does talk about closer scrutiny of A&amp;M but also specifically talks about needing to "invade, kill and convert", which is a somewhat harsh and non-PC way to address the problem. Hence any intro would either need to cover those suggestions also, or none at all, as it is now.

<dd>I don't think you folks are seeing the difference between <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literal_and_figurative_language.html" title="Literal and figurative language">literal and figurative language</a> here. Also, it leads one astray when one focuses on words chosen for their shock value, at the expense of understanding what is really being said, literally and figuratively, about the subjects at hand. For example, many have been led astray by <i>"We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity."</i> If one were to change "Christianity" to "Islam," one would have a summary of the specific, historical methods of Muslims when conquering non-Muslim countries. Could it be that she was saying "what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?"

<dd>Of course. But when an editor takes literally what a writer says figuratively, he/she isn't doing readers a favor. Nor is one doing any favors by giving heavy weight to jokes or hyperbolic comments made for emphasis. Seventy pages of reasoned discourse, presented over many months in syndicated columns, about stronger national security measures, including closer scrutiny of Arabs, are not rendered meaningless, or unimportant, or "not what she's really talking about" when she utters the words "magic carpet" or "raghead" at a speech or on TV. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'ts not like she's been presenting calm, rational arguments for weeks, with the occasional extreme outburst like this one. Her columns are always over-the-top, and often feature eliminationist rhetoric. You say comments like this should be interpreted figuratively. On the contrary, since she's been quite consistent in what she says, it should be interpreted that she means what she says. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 02:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I beg your pardon? She DID present rational arguments for weeks, clothed in her customary style, which is often, but not always, calm. (Calmness would add nothing to the <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">rationality</a> of her arguments.) What she consistently said and says is that there should be stronger national security measures with closer scrutiny of Arabs. Many are misled by the fact that she sometimes illustrates her points hyperbolically. If you doubt me, read the cited source for the quote we have been discussing. Read, especially, the six (6) paragraphs leading up to the two (2) paragraphs quoted. IMHO, she means what she says in them. Literally.

<dd>Here is my take, FWIW. WP considers <i>synthesis</i> as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. In the case of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> every rule is scrutinized more, and in the case of <i>negative</i> information, even more so. Hence we must only cite complete statements; any <i>logical combination</i> of facts would become synthesis, i.e. OR, i.e. <i>verboten</i>.</dd>
<dd>In our own case here, if someone (reliable) said "Coulter filed a false voter registration" and someone else (reliable) said "filing false voter registration in FL is a felony" then we can reproduce the individual duly-sourced statements separately, but we cannot, as WP, create a single connecting statement that concludes that Coulter is liable for a felony offense. Of course, if an acceptable <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> made the connection, we can cite whatever that source said. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 17:30, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><i>"The day after seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt died in a race at the Daytona 500, almost every newspaper in America carried the story on the front page. Stock-car racing had been the nation's fastest-growing sport for a decade, and NASCAR the second-most-watched sport behind the NFL. More Americans recognize the name Dale Earnhardt than, say, Maureen Dowd. (Manhattan liberals are dumbly blinking at that last sentence.) It took The New York Times two days to deem Earnhardt's death sufficiently important to mention it on the first page. Demonstrating the left's renowned populist touch, the article began, 'His death brought a silence to the Wal-Mart.'

<p><i>The The New York Times did cover Earnhart's death and covered it on the front page. Earnhardt died on February 18, 2001. Another article appeared in the Times on the front page, on February 19, 2001, one day later, after their intial front-page story, written by sportswriter Robert Lipsyte, making it two days in a row the The New York Times covered Earnhardt's death. Coulter cites an article indeed written two days later, by Rick Bragg, a Pulitzer Prize winner who grew up in the South, who wrote a personal piece on Earnhardt and his passing, bringing the total to three times in which the Times covered Earnhardt, three days in a row.</i></p>

<p>Several points seem to be specifically unsupported original research and the rest of it (which may be original research as well) is of questionable notability. It seems like an attempt to list occasions when Coulter was/appears to be inaccurate. This section, IMHO, should not be used to allow any editor to subjectively choose and list those instances. The examples chosen for inclusion, IMHO, should at least have been notable enough to have been written about in some reliable sources.

<dd>Good timing. I glanced at this section recently, and was about to comment once I looked more closely. I haven't researched your specific items, but the section seemed to me to be full of unreferenced and poorly referenced material, the likes of which can be deleted without comment. In addition to that, overall, this section is NOT very suitable for something in a biography of a living person. Editors should read the material on that subject, and try hard to comply. I believe that disinterested observers would see this section particularly, and several others as well, as attempts to defame the subject of the article. I avert my eyes from those who think that just because something can be referenced, it should be in this encyclopedia, and is not any sort of attempt to defame, etc. etc. etc. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 18:30, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO, editors who "think she's just making shit up" should consider recusing themselves from involvement in articles about "her" (unless, of course, their "thinking" is backed up by something very solid). The reason for my opinion on this is that it is EXTREMELY difficult to avoid expressing such a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Bias" title="WP:NPOV">prejudiced point of view</a> in one's edits.</dd>

<dd>The subject of this particular article is an accomplished attorney who provides hundreds of end notes (at Wikipedia we call them "references" or "cites") for her assertions. A very few of them are challenged by sometimes-qualified people, many of whom have a very anti-Coulter point of view. When the challenges are valid (which is infrequent), the errors are corrected in the next printing. Whatever one may think by reading this sometimes not-so-responsibly-written Wikipedia article, this is NOT an author who habitually "makes shit up." <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allow me to butt into a conversation that has nothing to do with me. Your point is very valid, Mr. Sander, every editor here should fear administrators abusing Wiki to their own selfish ends. (Not saying that is happening here, just saying it is a valid concern to have). I think considering the sheer number of editor's here though, even if an administrator holds a bias, there will be enough people to counteract it especially if every one is acting in good faith. It just makes it more difficult. Even moreso when there are people here not in good faith. It is important to have people who have a passion, both pro and con on the subject, contribute. That is the best method to reach NPOV. However, on the flip side, it does lead to choppy articles, but I guess you can't have it all. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 17:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no reason that an administrator should not be able to express his or her opinion on a subject provided it is within the normal limits of civility towards other editors and does not sidetrack the talk page into becoming a soapbox for his or her views. I doubt that people would be confused into thinking some random opinion of one of about a thousand administrators is the official opinion of Wikipedia, especially if that opinion is not in the article. Is someone really going to think that "Ann Coulter is making shit up" is the official position of the Wikimedia Foundation? This is all irrelevant; what's fundamentally important is the content of the article, and once again if you detect anything amiss in my article edits, feel free to call me on it, but until then let's try to use this space to discuss the article content. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ya, I recognize most of that material from the Coulter chapters in Franken's book. I was away for a few days, just a few points. First, Lou, when someone advises someone else to "consider recusing themselves from involvement in articles" because of their expressed viewpoints on the matter, they are, in fact, accusing them of unsurmountable bias as to be fit to edit this page. This is what the end result of your language produced whether or not you meant it. On a related point, I don't seem to be able to locate any edits or talk page suggestions of yours to this page that are not beneficial to the subject (I could easily be mistaken, but I don't have time to go through the diffs, lets just say a casual glance yields no results), so I would refrain from advising dis-involvement from other editors because of their apparent views on the subject. Unfortunately, you seem to have taken a habit of refraining from answering any of my posts directed at you, so I hope you will listen but I will not take your silence as agreement on the matter. What is more germane IMHO about this discussion is whether such material belongs on her biography page or on the book article pages. Why are we even thinking of devoting 4 whole paragraphs on her bio page to (pretty solid) charges of mis-representing sources when we can put the material on her book articles? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been on wikibreak for some weeks until recently, so I'm just noticing some of the changes that have been made. The lead image is the most eye-catching one.

<dd>Another agreement. The only potential reservation comes from the Fair Use rationale of using the book cover in an article not specifically about the book. I am comfortable making such a fair use defense but I don't think that it's standard practice in Wikipedia to claim fair use outside of the article which is *specifically* about the object at hand (the book, in this case). But it was certainly a much "nicer" (higher quality &amp; better aesthetics, IMHO) photo than the current one. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 04:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I'm quite clearly not a Coulter fan (look through the archive for one of my comments), I'd have to say I agree, it does look to me like she trying to be funny. Of course, she is probably be doing that because she has no idea what to say and/or knows she's losing the argument and/or how to respond seriously to the comments so instead chooses to try to make light of the situation (and given this is Fox News, they and most of their listeners would just let her get away with it rather then to wonder why she didn't respond) but I too am skeptical whether this merits inclusion. It does show IMHO how silly she is (both her actions and what she said) but unless it has merited great mention it probably isn't notable enough. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I actually don't see that segment, given Ann's well known positions on the issues, as that remarkable that it would merit space in the article. I also don't think her joking remarks about 'can I leave?' or 'Sean, help me!' elevate it to a significantly notable event. But as I mentioned above, if someone were to present the video segment with a properly neutral citation, I would not object to it. The issue I see is trying to justify the notability of this segment vs. countless others, but I can possibly see it being used as 'typical'. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have long wondered why editors so diligently seek and post negative material about Ann Coulter, but not about other controversial people, and why the negative material is so strongly enhanced and defended by those who post it. My eyes have recently been opened, however, and now I no longer wonder. Nevertheless, this IS a biography of a living person, and I believe we should refrain from posting such a huge amount of negative material, regardless of its being well- or poorly-sourced. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 18:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would add that we are not to add any "extra" information that is not in the source cited, nor draw any conclusions in the article about the source information. That would be original research.

Also the part about her not so far clarifying her age is also OR, unless a reliable source has actually said that, and the source is cited in the statement.

Canadian diplomats were involved in negotiations between Washington and Hanoi and successive Canadian governments, both Liberal and Conservative, maintained that Ottawa was an impartial and objective peacekeeper, an innocent and helpful bystander negotiating for peace and administering aid to victims of the war. However, Cabinet papers, confidential stenographic minutes of the truce commissions as well as top-secret American government cables revealed Canada to be a willing ally of US counterinsurgency efforts. ... Canadian delegates engaged in espionage for the US Central Intelligence Agency and aided the covert introduction of American arms and personnel into South Vietnam while they spotted for US bombers over North Vietnam. ...

<p>After reviewing the video and many sources, I've put several facts and links into this section of the main article, including specific details of Canadian troops' nineteen-year presence in Vietnam/Indochina. It is false to claim that Canada did not send troops there, particularly in light of Coulter's clarifying "Indochina?" (Please remember that during the time Canadian troops were there, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Indochina_8ee2.html" title="French Indochina">French Indochina</a> was in turmoil, borders were being established and moved, and so forth. The Canadian troops were there to deal with those things.)

I just wanted to get that out of the way, as I'm sure my personal motivations will be brought up. Now, to my actual suggestion: the plagiarism section as it stands is way too much. Not too much as in the material shouldn't exist somewhere, but on a biography page we really <i>really</i> shouldn't be devoting so much space to these claims. It's not that these claims do not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or are not sourced properly, but do we need to take 8 paragraphs on her bio page? For the whole passage about Slander, I'm going to move it off to the Slander website. Book-specific charges should be placed on each book's individual article. What should remain, ideally, is a 1-2 paragraph section (like it was before) that is equivalent of what's left when a daughter article is split off and a summary para remains. Blah blah iAuthenticate, blah blah Coulter's publisher's defended her, blah blah something else, and that's it. If we <i>really</i> want to keep all this here, I think a daughter article is quite necessary at this point, but I would much rather place the book-specific info on each book's page, as it makes much more organizational sense. What do other people think? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 19:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the article Ann claimed Canada send troups into the Vietnam war, but that it commonly claimed that they didn't. User Lou Sander claims that this is a fallacy. According to the articles on the subject although there was combat between member of the Canadian army, and members of various Vientamese groups, there does not appear to have been any <i>sending</i> of troups into Vietnam or into the war. Canada's involvment appears to be purely peripheral, so Ann's interviewer would appear to be correct at first glance. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 11:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The question seems to be: when (or if) Canadians were actually <i>sent</i> in Indochina (references please!), and whether the region of Indochina was at the time officially Vietnam. Coulter made the direct claim "Troops into Vientnam", so that what we should deal with. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 11:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>User:Lou Sander, this discussion involves the article and not myself, please discuss it on the arctile talk page. It seems to me that in a strictly technically sense, Canada did not "send troops to Vietnam". However, I find myself agreeing that this particular TV appearance is not particularily important. Coulter's more notable comments, not to mention her book, are more than enough to convey to any reader her delightful personality and intelligence. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 12:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a few problems with this material.</p>
<p><b>1)</b> I think it, at best, <u>exceedingly poor placement</u> to include <u>any</u> of this in the section of her article devoted to simply summarizing her television appearances. The section of the article devoted to "plagiarism and factual inaccuracy" seems "tailor-made" for this kind of thing, does it not?</p>
<p><b>2)</b> Simply including a video of the interview (regardless of whether it was from "youtube" or the network that broadcast the interview itself) is <u>not</u> a source sufficient to make the allegation that Coulter said anything inaccurate anything but <u>original research</u>.</p>
<p><b>3)</b> Lou's conclusion that the interviewer was wrong, while based on impressive research, is also original research.</p>
<p><b>4)</b> If there aren't many sources (qualifying under wikipedia policy) which actually accuse Coulter of making a mistake, I question the notability of the entire incident. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 12:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tend to agree. I think the correct way to handle this and similar 'incidents' or video segments is establish their notability by looking for some acceptable third party review that would count as a <i>secondary</i> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Just including the video with a WP description is insufficient and would be a combination of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and <i>primary</i> sourcing. For example, let's say that CNN reviews the segment on Fox and says that "last night Coulter appeared on Fox and said 'Canada sent troops to Vietnam' while we all know they did not" - that statement, attributed to CNN, can be used. We may also include in that case (without editorial comment) the reference to WP's own <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War_b5d5.html" title="Canada and the Vietnam War">Canada and the Vietnam War</a>. But we as WP <i>cannot</i> act as CNN - we are not a news network, we are an encyclopedia whose task is to <i>summarize</i> secondary sources, not to be a secondary source ourselves.

<dd>Lou, if you can back up your research about the Canadian participation with appropriate sources, the place to include it IMO is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War_b5d5.html" title="Canada and the Vietnam War">Canada and the Vietnam War</a>.

<p>I think the interview and commentary about it are relevent. Coulter's critics have sought to portray her as "uninformed" or "sloppy with facts", etc., in an attempt to silence her (or at least to get people to ignore her).</p>
<p>I studied the interview around a year ago. My impression is that Coulter and the interviewer were talking at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Coulter meant by "sent troops to Vietnam" either or both of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Canada's <b>government</b> sent its own soldiers to the area, to intervene in the the regional conflict which included Vietnam; or,</li>
<li>Canada (the nation itself) sent around 10,000 men to fight in the Vietnam war (but not as soldiers of the Canadian Army).
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia says, "several thousand Canadians joined the U.S. military and fought with the Americans in Vietnam; estimates range from 3,500 to 10,000." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War#Canadians_in_the_U.S._military" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War#Canadians_in_the_U.S._military" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The "interviewer" made no effort to clear up the conflict over terminology, but pounced on Coulter and used her remark against her. If he were a Wikipedian, his "edit" would have been reverted for "NPOV violations". It seemed like a partisan attack to me.</p>
<p>We could compare this to "America sent aid to tsunami victims". Some of that would be the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._government_e2f2.html" title="U.S. government">U.S. government</a> and some would be the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_people.html" title="American people">American people</a>.</p>
<p>We need to ask, in each case, did you mean the government or the people? Our readers will be interested to know which authors can or can't think fast on their feet, of course, but others will be interested to know (after the dust settles) what their <b>written positions</b> are.</p>
<p>It would be good to have a neutral description of this incident in Wikipedia, as there are thousands of references to it in the blogosphere. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your analysis may well be true, or maybe not, but the point is that it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and hence inadmissible. If you can find an appropriate <i>secondary and reliable</i> source discussing this issue, it would be admissable IMO. Otherwise, we as WP can't analyze primary video segments, nor rely on bloggers to do it for us, and certainly not in BLP cases. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Uncle Ed:</b> My fondest hope is that mention of this interview will never again return to the Ann Coulter article. It has been handled by some very bad editors in a way that has done a HUGE amount of harm to Wikipedia's reputation as a neutral source. I will do whatever it takes to keep it out, and I think I'll have a lot of help from other non-very-bad editors. But at the risk of waking sleeping rabid dogs, I gotta comment:</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) GMTA, but not <i>exactly</i> alike. I studied the film VERY carefully this morning. I definitely agree that the interviewer and Coulter were talking at cross purposes, but I've got a different idea about why. I think that when Coulter brought up "troops to Vietnam," she was talking about the peacekeeper-like Canadian troops who were there from 1954-1973. When the interviewer heard those words, he pounced, possibly/probably because the <b>fighting</b> in Vietnam is an extremely emotional and contentious subject to many Canadians. Coulter, with a puzzled look, reacted to the pounce by offering the more palatable "<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Indochina_8ee2.html" title="French Indochina">Indochina</a>?" which is what the area was called when Canada sent its peacekeeper-like troops there in 1954. When Coulter later said "I'll get back to you," I think she was trying to exit gracefully from an unwinnable argument in which she was very sure of her facts, but maybe not consciously aware of the extreme Canadian sensitivity to "Vietnam" and "troops" and other warlike words.</dd>

<dd>2) I agree with your thinking that a widely-available neutral description of the incident would be a very good thing to have. I spent a lot of time this morning researching and marshalling facts about it, some of which are, IMHO, stunning. (Such as the number of troops that were there, their exact dates of arrival and departure, the number who died, the number who got a specific medal for their service, etc.) I wrote it all up, but before I could post it on the talk page, some kind soul put the non-notable, disgracefully negative POV, definitely-doesn't-belong-here reference to it out of its misery. <i>(Please, God, or Fate, or random variation and natural selection, or whoever/whatever determines this stuff, keep that piece of cruft D-E-A-D.)</i> The material for a neutral description exists, and is readily available to people of good intent who can make something great out of it.

Then, if the issue comes up again here (e.g. someone finds a good secondary source discussing the specific Coulter interview) we would be able to properly refer to the facts you uncovered. And even if it never comes here to this article again, that info is useful as part of WP and belongs in its proper place.

<p>I agree this really has no place in the article. Coulter's own material certifies her as an ignorant and hateful nutter. Yet it seems fashionable lately to capture and deconstruct her every gaffe and stutter made on TV and make the judgement "OMG she totally got smacked down on TV." Most of this stuff is weak and non-notable; it reflects more on the obsession of her peanut-gallery critics than on her own lack of intelligence. If you want to look for legitimate negative material on her, just pick up one of her books and select a page at random. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 20:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I'm not arguing for a reinclusion, I have to say I would think the vast majority of people would assume that when you say Canada (or country X) sent troops to Vietnam, you meant the government. Indeed, I don't think it would occur to the vast majority of people you might mean citizens of that country joining other armies. It wouldn't occur to me that's for sure. There are severals regions for this. For starters, citizens joining other armies are there representing that armies country. A Canadian citizen in the US army in Vietnam is a (US) American soldier. Not a Canadian soldier. This is not at all the same as donations. While I think most people would similarly assume you were talking about the government, I think many people would at least appreciate and accept it if you refer to the citizens privately donating money. After all, these people are in a way representing their country. If someone wanted to refer to Canadian citizens joining the US Army to fight in Vietname, I would suggest they would have to make that clear (e.g. although the Canadian government didn't partake in the fight, their citizens did)... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:24, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Four items that have been discussed and deleted many times have just been restored to the article. They are the "troops in Canada" stuff, the "swimmingly" stuff, the "Adam Carolla non-interview" and a three-year-old book review. You can see the details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=72646670&amp;oldid=72634364" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=72646670&amp;oldid=72634364" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, though there may have been some changes since.</p>
<p>The ancient book review is, as <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> said when he deleted it, a "pointless opinion that sits on its own." In addition, it applies to a book that has its own article, which is a better place for it.</p>
<p>The other items have been discussed to death, and I believe there is <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html#Reasonable_consensus-building" title="WP:CON">consensus</a>, especially on "troops in Canada," that they do not belong in the article. There are many reasons to delete them, including that their relevance to Ann Coulter's notability has not been clearly demonstrated. That fact alone, plus their apparent agenda-pushing nature, possibly/probably puts them into the category of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Malicious_editing" title="WP:BLP">malicious edits</a> to the biography of a living person.</p>
<p>The Criticisms of Ann Coulter article was set up to receive material like this, and it needs more well-sourced items. These would be valuable additions, and would not be seen as malicious.</p>
<p>None of these four items legitimately belong in the Ann Coulter article. I say they should be removed until someone shows reasons for including them, which reasons must be stronger than the pages and pages of discussion that have led to their multiple removals. Editors who care about them should consider moving them to the Criticisms article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redundancy with Criticisms of Ann Coulter</span></h2>
<p>As a newcomer to this article, I only now read the 'Criticisms' article and I realize that much of it is redundant, if not a copy, of this article's content or vice-versa. I personally think all criticism should be folded back into this article (properly interweaved, vetted for proper sourcing, neutrally presented, balanced per BLP, etc), per WP policy of encouraging the interweaving of criticism. If not, then logically we would need to remove all criticism from this article and move it all (and point) to the other. I realize <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> have separate Criticism pages, but I think to do it for a living person is a bad idea and contradicts WP's policy or spirit. BTW, if there is currently a clear wiki-link from this article to the Criticism one then I missed it. Anyway, I think the current situation is not acceptable.

<dd>I would oppose a merger. A merger was heavily discussed a few weeks ago, but no consensus was reached. Then somebody just merged the two articles, which upset a lot of people who had worked hard at building consensus. Somebody else quickly un-merged the articles, and they've been that way ever since. One of the problems that led to the second article being set up is the great length of the main article. Somebody pointed out the criticism articles for Bill O'Reilly and maybe some others, and many saw that as a good thing to have here. But then instead of MOVING the criticisms, whoever did it just COPIED them. To really have a good setup, they should be deleted from the main article, which should then provide a link or links to the criticism. If somebody put some organization into the Criticism article, we'd have a well-organized place where criticisms could go without strife or constant deletion. The way the main article is right now, and with all the work going on in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WT%7EBLP_141f.html" title="WT:BLP">WT:BLP</a>, I'd expect a LOT of deletions of stuff that might be merged.

<dd>Well excuse my ignorance, but I just can't see how an article about a living person can be written with all the criticism separated out to a different article. Firstly, it contradicts WP policy/guideline of interweaving criticisms, secondly it is flat out illogical. Does that mean the main article only has the positive stuff and anything negative must be pointed to elsewhere? Or do we also have a separate article for the positive stuff? How can a balanced neutral picture possibly be presented that way? Unless I am totally missing the picture here, this is simply irrational and non-encyclopedic. But I am certainly open to hear more opinions. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read the Bill O'Reilly piece, I don't see it a necessary precedent. I did find this discussion from <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a>, another POV and troll magnent:
<blockquote>
<p>"It 's always better to weave praise and criticism throughout the article, rather than creating separate sections that turn into POV magnets."</p>

<dl>
<dd>And this:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>WHY is it better to have criticsm weaved into the article rather than as a section in its own right? Please explain.DocEss 20:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because praise and criticism sections become magnets for trolls and POV pushers. With a criticism section, people will just keep turning up, slapping any old piece of negative stuff they find on Google, with no attempt to evaluate it or place it in context. Ensuring that both praise and criticism are woven into the text produces a more nuanced and three-dimensional piece of writing that's almost certainly closer to reality, because not black-and-white.

<dl>
<dd>You will note that they are all discussing a <i>section</i> rather than an article, but to me taking out the criticism to an <i>article</i> is even worse and is even more contra-indicated by the same logic. Beyond the troll magnet issue which Jimbo and SlimVirgin refer to, in the case of a separated Criticism section the key question I see is how can the Criticism-less, presumably mostly positive main article be neutral?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I do recognize the issue of excessive length, and for that we can presumably extract controversial <i>issues</i>, like specific TV segments or books that got a lot of press, but the key there would have to be the amount of <i>press coverage</i>, i.e. notability. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:32, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the examples, which make a lot of sense. (See below for criticism ARTICLES). Also I apologize if you think I offered the O'Reilly stuff as a "necessary precedent." It's just an example of how some of the better editors have handled the special case of articles about controversial people.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those articles (and especially this one) are troll magnets in themselves, and there are always one or two resident editors who, in Jim Wales' words, "slap any old piece of negative stuff they find on Google, with no attempt to evaluate it or place it in context." It's not hard to spot those creatures here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>They specialize in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Malicious_editing" title="WP:BLP">malicious editing</a>, and they won't follow basic rules, won't discuss their edits, claim everything they think is notable IS notable just because they say it is, restore cruft that is deleted after long discussion, like to follow a short factual sentence with five negative long ones, etc. Part of this is inferior editing skills, but a lot is just an anti-Coulter agenda. It isn't helpful when the latter is promoted on the talk page by senior people ("I think she just makes shit up", etc.).</dd>

<dd>It would be great if this article had an environment where we could interweave praise and criticism, but I don't think we're there yet. (If we are, I'd like to see some examples.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In criticism ARTICLES, <b>the idea is to have a balanced main article</b>, plus a Criticism article for the overflow criticism that doesn't belong in the main article. Example: There are a jillion Coulter statements and interviews that citable anti-Coulter sources have reported on. Some folks want to put them all in the main article, but that would make it unbalanced. The criticism article gives them a place to indulge their desires. Nobody minds too much, or complains about balance, because balance isn't expected. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:37, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should strive to incorporate <i>both</i> criticism and praise into the article. Crum makes a good point, if the criticism section gets overflow, why don't we offshoot specific topics or incidents? At least that wouldn't promote just a bash-Coulter daughter article where the fact that she got a D in an elementary school science project can be added... specific topics would help contain this type of creep. In addition, while you may not agree, I do think there does exist valid criticisms of Coulter (though not nearly as many as appear on this page), and if we adopt your proposal then this article will become whitewashed of any criticism and sucked out into the daughter article, which is <i>definetely</i> not NPOV. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 17:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm trying to develop my understanding of just what constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Also, it's pretty obvious that one or two other editors are pretty shaky on their knowledge about it. Maybe somebody can help us all out. This appears in the Coulter article:</p>

The driver's license issued to her years later in Washington, D.C., lists the year as 1963. Coulter's own statements regarding her age conform to the date on her D.C. license.</font></i></dd>

<dl>
<dd><i><font color="red">Coulter's first voter's registration was completed in 1980.</font> If the date on the D.C. license is correct , she first registered to vote at the age of sixteen, also an incident of voter fraud.</i> (Reference <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>) <i>If, however, the date on the Connecticut license is correct, she may be guilty of having given false information on her D.C. driver's license application, which is also a felony.</i></dd>

<dd>Here is what the published source (Franken) says:

</dd>
<dd>If voter fraud is a felony, then I am not sure if WP saying that, based on proper source, is OR, but we can always just use 'voter fraud' as in the source. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is original research, and I'm not sure Franken's book would be a reliable source for the issue either, as it is clearly partisan and written with an agenda. I guess we could use Franken's book, in the limited sense of saying this is an assertion that Franken has made. However, I think there should be a better source before this info is allowed to stay.

<dl>
<dd>Franken's book is no more partisan or written with an agenda then Coulter's books. The passage as it stands is definetely OR as Lou points out, but as WJhonson states, if we attribute this passage to Franken's book then it ceases to become OR, as long as we quote it correctly and within context. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 19:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>True, but as this is a biography of Coulter, I do think that there is a legitimate debate about the use of Franken as a reliable source here. Granted the reverse is also true. However, I do say in my post that "I guess we could use Franken's book, in the limited sense of saying this is an assertion that Franken has made.". But if we could find a better source with the same information then we should probably use that instead. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 19:57, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So then in the legitimate debate, you're saying that neither Coulter's books nor Franken's qualify under reliable sources? I would prefer to use both.

<p>If it is relevant to this article that a single reporter states she atttends a certain church and brings guests (and why is that importantor even relevant?) then it is certainly relevant that the officials of that church state they do not know her and and she is not a member.

<p>The Redeemer church, "whose non-political stance is well-known, disavows all hateful and hostile speech," according to Borchers' presentation, had to "Google" her name to figure out who she was!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Media Matters Straw Man</span></h2>
<p>I don't know who put those bullet points up citing examples of errors that Media Matters found with Coulter's works, but I haven't seen a straw man argument like that in a while. Someone went through and chose the least egregious examples along with characterizing them to the point as if they were just stupid. Where is this one?:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On Page 158, Coulter cited a study from the education journal Education Next in claiming that private-school teachers earn 60 percent less than public school teachers. Coulter wrote:</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 2002, Bob Chase, the president of the National Education Association (NEA), complained that teachers don't make as much as engineers ($74,920) or lawyers ($82,712). But I'm thinking, Why stop at engineers and lawyers? Why shouldn't kindergarten teachers earn as much as Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts? A better benchmark comparison for public school teachers might be private school teachers. Teachers in the private sector earn about 60 percent less than public school teachers.7 And their students actually learn to read.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>The study Coulter cited -- "Fringe Benefits" -- actually found that, "Starting pay in private schools begins at 78 percent that of public schools, rises to 92 percent of public school pay by a teacher's 12th year, and declines thereafter." <b>It is unclear where Coulter arrived at her "60 percent less" figure, but it certainly did not come from the source she cited.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Or this one:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On Pages 199-200, Coulter attacked "atheists" who "need evolution to be true." Citing what she presented as two Washington Post articles from May 15, 2005, Coulter wrote:</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although God believers don't need evolution to be false, atheists need evolution to be true. William Provine, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University, calls Darwinism the greatest engine of atheism devised by man. His fellow Darwin disciple, Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins, famously said, "Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."1 This is why there is a mass panic on the left whenever someone mentions the vast and accumulating evidence against evolution.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>The Washington Post articles Coulter cited are actually one article by Michael Powell, with the headline, "Doubting Rationalist," accompanied by the subhead, " 'Intelligent Design' Proponent Phillip Johnson, and How He Came to Be." <b>But nowhere in the article will one find the Dawkins quote Coulter cited.</b></i></dd>

<dd>Lou, you should know by now I have a low-opinion of MediaMatters. I also think Coulter's errors it cites are very minor and simply attest to how partisan the organization is. That said, unfortunately, I think your last edit might be original research. Also, I think my edit might have contained an error. Apparently Media Matters says Coulter said private school teachers' salaries are not 60 percent <u>of</u> but 60 percent <u>less than</u> government school teachers.

There's no doubt that I cited a reliable source providing directly related info. In fact, it's the same source quoted by MediaMatters. To me, the important thing here is that Media Matters says "she lies," and the other reference says "she doesn't."</dd>
<dd>You've got the 60% business right. A LOT of people don't know the difference between "60% of" and "60% less than."

Your edit definitely contains information that is "directly related to the topic of the article" and adheres to what the sources say.

<p>In the <b>"Columns"</b> section, I deleted "Generally, her columns are highly critical of the liberal point-of-view. She has argued, for instance, that liberals' insistence on sexual freedoms belies their calls for restrictions in other areas of life, particularly on the issue of health. For example, she asserted that although liberals often lobby for public bans on smoking, they take far less precaution in their sexual health, citing the acts of anal sex and fisting as examples."

<p><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is an official policy. It's kind of long, making it hard to understand unless you read it carefully and repeatedly.</p>
<p>Here is the policy in its official nutshell:</p>

<td><b>This page in a nutshell:</b> Articles about living persons must adhere <u>strictly</u> to NPOV and verifiability policies. Be very firm about <u>high-quality</u> references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced negative material about living persons should be removed immediately from both the article and the talk page. Responsibility for justifying controversial claims rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim.</td>

<p>Here are some key points taken verbatim from the body of the policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biographies of living people should be written responsibly, conservatively, and in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.</li>
<li>The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an advocacy journalism point of view.</li>
<li>Information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers should be handled with caution, and, if derogatory, should not be used at all.</li>
<li><i>(For non-public figures such as family members):</i> Editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability. ...Material from primary sources should generally not be used unless it has first been mentioned by a verifiable secondary source.</li>
<li>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid. It is not our job to be sensationalist, ...</li>
<li>If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability.</li>
<li>The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">International Campaign to End Landmines incident</span></h2>
<p>While the page is still protected I'd like to ask someone to help me improve this section.</p>
<p>I have a better source for this October 1997 incident mentioned in the "Television" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter's first national media appearance came after she was hired in 1996 by <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> as a legal correspondent. She was fired the next year after an exchange with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Muller_16ed.html" title="Bobby Muller">Bobby Muller</a>, president of the anti-war group <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_Veterans_of_America_Foundation_a4d7.html" title="Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation">Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation</a> who had been <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralysis.html" title="Paralysis">paralyzed</a> due to combat wounds. In response to Muller's claim that during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> American soldiers had stepped mainly on their own landmines, she reportedly said "No wonder you guys lost."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Coulter claimed that she did not know Muller was disabled.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's from the <i>Time</i> magazine cover story about her, by John Cloud, that right now is footnote number 5, and is the secondary source quoted by tertiary <i>Washington Post</i> source used in the paragraph about the incident.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Eight months later, Coulter’s relationship with msnbc ended permanently after she tangled with a disabled Vietnam veteran on the air. Robert Muller, co-founder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, asserted that “in 90% of the cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up [in Vietnam]—Ann, are you listening?—they were our own mines.” (Muller was misquoting a 1969 Pentagon report that found that 90% of the components used in enemy mines came from U.S. duds and refuse.) Coulter, who found Muller’s statement laughable, averted her eyes and responded sarcastically: “No wonder you guys lost.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to rewrite the paragraph in a more precise and accurate way:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter's first national media appearance came after she was hired in 1996 by <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> as a legal correspondent.

<dd>You certainly DO have a better source. The original source in <i>Time</i> gives a different picture than does Howard Kurtz second-hand comments on it in his opinion column.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The network dismissed her at least twice: first in February 1997, after she insulted the late Pamela Harriman, the U.S. Ambassador to France, even as the network was covering her somber memorial service. <s>Coulter said Harriman was one of those women who "used men to work their way up" and suggested "Sharon Stone or Madonna" as her replacement.</s> Even so, the network missed Coulter's jousting and quickly rehired her. Eight months later, Coulter's relationship with MSNBC ended permanently after she tangled with a disabled Vietnam veteran on the air. Robert Muller, co-founder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, asserted that "in 90% of the cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up [in Vietnam]--Ann, are you listening?--they were our own mines." (Muller was misquoting a 1969 Pentagon report that found that 90% of the components used in enemy mines came from U.S. duds and refuse.) Coulter, who found Muller's statement laughable, averted her eyes and responded sarcastically: "No wonder you guys lost." <s>It became an infamous--and oft-misreported--Coulter moment. The Washington Post and others turned the line into a more personal attack: "People like you caused us to lose that war."</s></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The current editorialized version doesn't cover both her firings, and omits the important fact of Muller's misquoting his facts. The Harriman stuff and the business about the exact wording of the "lose the war" comment are pretty trivial, so needn't be included. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 04:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm concerned that the intelligent design advocate category remain. It would seem a bit out of place to have the category here without at least noting in brief that Coulter has chosen to voice an opinion on the subject. Perhaps, for sections removed to the articles on her books, we could create a small section (perhaps entitled "Other Views"), which would quickly and simply note such things as, "In <i>Godless</i>, Coulter advocates the concept of Intelligent Design", or some such simple sentence. Otherwise, the category would appear at first glance to be unfounded, and then we'd have editors removing the category. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 00:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All this stuff is amply covered in the article on the book, and the book is the only place where Coulter mentions it with any emphasis. (Therefore that's where coverage of it belongs.) Even in the book, evolution/intelligent design only comes up by way of one point in its numerous arguments: 1) MAIN POINT OF THE BOOK: Liberals besmirch religion, but their core beliefs amount to a religion themselves. 2) SEVEN MAJOR ILLUSTRATIVE POINTS: Here are their sacraments, holy writ, martyrs, clergy, churches, doctrine of infallibility, and cosmology. All are amply illustrated and expanded on. 3) ADDITIONAL ILLUSTRATIVE POINT: There's also their creation myth: Darwin's theory. The mythical nature of the liberal creation belief is illustrated by casting doubt on its authenticity, much support for the doubt being shown by the work of intelligent design advocates. A subordinate point is that if anyone doubts the liberals' creation myth, they brand him/her as a crazy religious kook. As she predicts, many have pounced on the creation myth stuff, usually implying that he/she's a crazy religious kook or intelligent design freak. She isn't really even advocating intelligent design -- just detailing it as an opposing view to the liberal creation myth. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 02:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on Arabs and Muslims</span></h2>
<p>This section is misnamed and isn't properly focused. Read the citations. Her comments are mostly about airport security, not about "Arabs and Muslims." She prominently mentions Arabs and Muslims as potential security risks, and discusses the whys and wherefores of her opinions on that subject. She doesn't really get involved in other aspects of Arab ethnicity or Muslim religious beliefs. I don't know exactly what title would be best for this section, but somebody should definitely rename it. Maybe "Coulter on Arabs and Muslims as security risks."<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, here is part of her quote:
<blockquote>
<p>We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>I think here she is not referring to airport security but Arabs in general. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see why you might think that. I think she was referring to supporters of the 9/11 bombers, many of whom are Arabs and Muslims (but many of whom are not, and in any event the A&amp;M among them are only a tiny fraction of the whole number of A&amp;M). Those are our points of view. The point is that her remarks about Arabs and Muslims are all, or nearly all, made in a security context. Isn't it a misrepresentation to leave that context out of this section of the article? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 16:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the overall context leading to her above comments was airport security related. But her statements, as quoted, are rather far sweeping ("invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them") and go well beyond airport security. As such, I would think that the current title is reasonable, whereas limiting it to "Arabs and Muslims as security risks" would be too narrow given these broad statements. I think your point is that the title is not reflective of the fact that the <i>context</i> was security, which of course I agree with, but I also think that her views and the context are fairly self explanatory to the reader. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 17:09, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statements are sweeping, but only towards individuals who support terrorism against the United States and those who lead them into that political stance. What, worldwide, 90-95% of terrorist killings were sponsored by Muslims? And in their region by Arabs? If so, it's appropriate to point out that within the race and/or religion there are internal problems that affect others that demands greater scrutiny <i>in a security context</i>. I think regarding Coulter's sweeping statements it would be well to remember Winston Churchill's remark, "I do not resent criticism, even when, for the sake of emphasis, it parts for the time with reality".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Coulter responds to attempts to shade or compromise what she feels are valid principles with vivid pictures of her opponents entangled in the consequences of denying those principles. For example some argue profiling will wound Arab pride. So she writes an airline slogan, "You are now free to move about the cabin--not so fast, Mohammed!" creating a memorable presentation of the plain argument "It's silly to be afraid of offending them, how bad could it get, they're big enough to take it". But out of context, this could be misinterpreted as simply scorning all Arabs and Muslims.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's another example of this in section (which ought to be corrected or removed):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I think airlines ought to start advertising: 'We have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by Arabs.'" When asked what Muslims should do for travel, she responded that they, "could use flying carpets."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The actual source says <i>in the context of egging her on,</i> "How <i>would</i> Arabs travel" [to avoid civil rights abuses]. The implication being that the abuses complained about in such nuisance lawsuits would be so traumatic that they must be avoided at all costs. The flying carpets comment being shorthand for "You're entangled in denying realities as bad as the denial I just brought up; it's silly to worry about Muslims being turned into victims. Even to those who know Muslims only in the broadest possible stereotypes, Middle-easterners have never had a reputation for not being resourceful." As it stands now, you might conclude she was bringing up the exaggerated stereotype for its own sake, rather than to help <i>emphasize her argument</i>. It is thus not part of a larger "controversial trend"--which is alone what this section should be about. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 19:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My problem with it is that her quote then goes on to say how the US should "invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them".

However, I am open for any other ideas for the intro that you think will be 'more accurate' but will cover her quote. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:47, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lou, I think the first criterion of this section being in the article is that it originated an actual controversy. Not just controversy among the politically correct asking "what's to be done with this Ann Coulter person?" I believe this subject meets this criterion, because of the "invade their countries" comment. It was brought up twice in her interview with Katie Couric about <i>Slander</i>, and it wasn't even in the book. Coulter later said it was a comment that followed her around. Although it was apparently her opponents that stirred up the controversy, it was ground Coulter chose to defend.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This controversy highlighted follow-up comments along the same lines both before and after Coulter's defense on the Today Show. And they didn't all have to do with airline security, they also had to do with national security and the need for heightened scrutiny of the source culture and religion of at least 9 out of ten of the terrorist actions around the world. <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092001.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092001.asp" rel="nofollow">This column</a> spells out her airline and national security proposals, nine days after the attacks. Coulter claims it was the bone of contention that caused National Review Online to drop her column and terminate her editorship.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter also might be considered a notably early proponent, as a columnist and TV pundit, of assaulting the host countries of terrorists with retaliatory force.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I would add the ideas of national security, heightened scrutiny and early proponent of retaliatory force to the intro (if it can be fit into an intro sentence or two). Then add back in her responses to the "invade their countries" comment from the Today show and add her response to the phrase in <i>How to Talk to a Liberal</i> (Now more than ever) as new material. (I can get citations and text for these), and drop the airline stuff unless it's presented as instances of Coulter incorporating the subject into her humorous remarks.</dd>

<dd>The "rag-head" stuff was picked up by blogs (not college student bloggers as the section says now), Cybercast News Service, and a few columnists. Tony Snow on his show called it "exhibitionism" and that it was like "she pulled her dress over head to get attention". I'm inclined to agree that it wasn't a real controversy.</dd>

<p><b>Thanks to all for their thoughtful comments.</b> I've read and re-read the section in the article, slept on the matter, then read the section again (plus this section and all or most of the citations). I want to modify my original premise and propose a better solution. Here it is:</p>
<p>The section "Coulter on Arabs and Muslims" is misnamed and isn't properly focused. Read the cited sources. Her comments are mostly about responding to 9/11, not about Arabs and Muslims. She prominently mentions Arabs (mostly) and Muslims (almost not at all) as potential security risks, and discusses the whys and wherefores of her opinions. She doesn't really get involved in other aspects of Arab ethnicity or Muslim religious beliefs.</p>

<p>The entire controversy section needs to be redone. Upon my review, the only sub-section that should remain is the 'Jersey Girls' section. It cites the incident on the <i>Today Show</i>, and reactions from Hillary Clinton, and Rahm Emanuel who urged a boycott of her book. This is the only one that cites significant controversy that arose due to her comments. The 'NY Times bombing' section points to a short comment on <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i> and a negative comment from Colmes cited by E&amp;P, the 'Coulter on Arabs and Muslims' section cites a negative reaction from bloggers, and the 'Coulter on Evolution' cites negative reaction from evolutionists as might be expected. If there isn't significant reaction from the mainstream press, it is not notable controversy. If a quotation is listed without also citing a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that describes the controversy, then the inclusion is because the editor feels that the comments are controversial. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 13:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Lou</span></h2>
<p>Lou, this is about the Television section again. I wasn't really concerned about how the section was going to be fixed as long as it was corrected by the better source. But the <i>Washington Post</i> article includes the report that Coulter didn't know the representative was disabled. Seeing the exerpt from <i>Time</i> down in black and white, I think it looks kind of harsh on Coulter's end without that disclaimer. The source is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A208-2005Apr19?language=printer" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A208-2005Apr19?language=printer" rel="nofollow">The Conservative Pin-Up Girl</a>.

Here is the full citation if you decide you want to use it: "Kurtz, Howard.

<dd>I'm thinking that I should have left it in. We say the guy she argued with is disabled. If we are to be responsible, neutral, and factual, we also need to say that she didn't know it. At worst, this is a borderline case, and we do harm by leaving out the other pertinent facts.</dd>

<p>What the issue is here isn't particularly clear.

<dd>I agree with Kyaa. The age business is in here only because of a previous malicious attempt to impute a felony to the lady. "Her driver's license says she's 40. Her old driver's license says she's only 38. If she's only 38, it follows that she wasn't 18 when she registered to vote in CT. That's a felony in FL (and by implication it's a very bad thing in CT)." The mind boggles.</dd>

<dd>The age question is a legitimate aspect of Ann Coulter, but definitely not connected with voting. It should be removed from this section.

<p>This was discussed recently (visible in archive 6) but I think it needs to be brought up again. The current lead photo IMHO needs to be replaced. While it's a photo released on her website, to me anyway it's highly unflattering and makes her look like she's anorexic and is much worse IMHO then the Time photo (which despite her objections, is decent enough, it's quite clear that it's distorted so it doesn't give her an unflaterring look). Her site has several others to choose from <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/gallery.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/gallery.cgi" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. We could take one of the ones with her and someone else and get wikipedia to only show her as the thumbnail... The photo is one of the best in actually showing her and at a decent size (perhaps that's why she looks so unflattering? who knows...) however I personally believe it would still be better to use another photo for the lead.

<dd>I think: 1) Earlier birthdate is compatible with Connecticut voting at 18, so it's the one to go with. 2) Later birthdate might be a lady trying to seem younger, or a celebrity trying to avoid unwanted attention to personal matters, etc. 3) The matter of differing birthdates isn't important and isn't related to her notability. I'd remove all reference to it. Or if somebody just HAS to get it in, mention the discrepancy in the Personal section at the end. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:24, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That seems to be in slight contradiction to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Specifically, the "Privacy of birthdays" subsection says "Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution." The problem here is that although <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> says that in some cases we should "err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date" we have contradictory information about the specific year.</dd>

<p>Folks, please don't put the reference to her birthdate in the first sentence where it mentions 'born: ...'. This just looks bad. You don't see references in that spot for other biographical articles. If you're going to address this age discrepancy thing, then address it elsewhere in the article and reference it there. But the opening sentence mention of her birthdate should only be for her most commonly accepted birthdate with no reference. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 00:08, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on responding to 9/11</span></h2>
<p>I'm thinking that the former stuff in the lead, about "stronger national security measures" and "closer scrutiny of Arabs and Muslims" really should be restored. They are the major ideas in her 9/11 writings, and quite a few of her post-9/11 columns covered those exact themes. Thirty of those columns were reprinted, mostly under the heading "This is War" in <i>How to Talk to a Liberal.</i> We don't have to cite all of them to state the points she was unambiguously making. In addition to the illustrative "invade their countries" quote, the other sources cited in the article back up the deleted material. Though as the article stands now, they are said to illustrate some sort of anti-A&amp;M sentiment, they are primarily about national/airport security. I'm reluctant to restore the security/Arabs stuff myself, but I think it should go back in. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:53, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first citation is about, and is heavily critical of, the U.S. DOT, especially of then-secretary Norman Mineta. A small but notable part of it is an advocacy of, very specifically, <i>ethnic,</i> not <i>racial,</i> profiling. The second citation is not from Coulter at all, or about "racial profiling." It's a gripe from Islamonline.net about Coulter's joke about Helen Thomas getting close to the president. (If you doubt me, read the cited sources.)</dd>

<dd>I hear what you are saying, but we aren't just presenting Coulter's words and prefacing them with brief explanations. We're presenting Ann Coulter's views on certain important matters. Every word and thought of hers doesn't need a supporting reference, as long as her opinions are fairly and accurately presented, and can be verified. The business about national security and stronger scrutiny of A&amp;M is notable and is supported by many verifiable citations in the section. There are dozens more, if needed.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Here is another example of the principle: "Coulter frequently speaks against liberals and Democrats" is absolutely accurate, truthful, and not very controversial. To speak out against L&amp;D doesn't connote anything negative about the speaker. Not much verification is required, and it's not quite "original research" to say "frequently" about something so obvious and uncontroversial.</dd>

<dd>On the other hand "Coulter frequently lies" (for example) is something different, because of the negative connotations of lying. Such a negative and potentially libelous statement, due to the principles of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> needs to be carefully supported by strong, accurate, and specific citations. The word "frequently," in this context, needs to be clearly shown NOT to be "original research," because it is negative and controversial.</dd>

<dd>I still think the deleted material about about "stronger national security measures" and "closer scrutiny of Arabs and Muslims" should be restored, because it is the essence of what she says about U.S. response to 9/11. It would probably be better to preface the quotation (which is just a more explicit citation) with "For example,...", and maybe to include more citations if somebody feels they are needed. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:25, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She does talk about closer scrutiny of A&amp;M but also specifically talks about needing to "invade, kill and convert", which is a somewhat harsh and non-PC way to address the problem. Hence any intro would either need to cover those suggestions also, or none at all, as it is now. Just leaving a watered-down PC suggestion of 'closer scrutiny' in the lead is not NPOV, IMO. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:43, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Amen, "raghead", "anyone who isn't named mohammed and doesn't smell bad" and telling muslims to use "flying carpets" should not be characterized as "closer scrutiny".

<dd>I don't think you folks are seeing the difference between <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literal_and_figurative_language.html" title="Literal and figurative language">literal and figurative language</a> here. Also, it leads one astray when one focuses on words chosen for their shock value, at the expense of understanding what is really being said, literally and figuratively, about the subjects at hand. For example, many have been led astray by <i>"We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity."</i> If one were to change "Christianity" to "Islam," one would have a summary of the specific, historical methods of Muslims when conquering non-Muslim countries. Could it be that she was saying "what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?"

Nor is one doing any favors by giving heavy weight to jokes or hyperbolic comments made for emphasis. Seventy pages of reasoned discourse, presented over many months in syndicated columns, about stronger national security measures, including closer scrutiny of Arabs, are not rendered meaningless, or unimportant, or "not what she's really talking about" when she utters the words "magic carpet" or "raghead" at a speech or on TV. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'ts not like she's been presenting calm, rational arguments for weeks, with the occasional extreme outburst like this one.

(Calmness would add nothing to the <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">rationality</a> of her arguments.) What she consistently said and says is that there should be stronger national security measures with closer scrutiny of Arabs. Many are misled by the fact that she sometimes illustrates her points hyperbolically. If you doubt me, read the cited source for the quote we have been discussing. Read, especially, the six (6) paragraphs leading up to the two (2) paragraphs quoted. IMHO, she means what she says in them. Literally.

<dd>Here is my take, FWIW. WP considers <i>synthesis</i> as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. In the case of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> every rule is scrutinized more, and in the case of <i>negative</i> information, even more so. Hence we must only cite complete statements; any <i>logical combination</i> of facts would become synthesis, i.e. OR, i.e. <i>verboten</i>.</dd>
<dd>In our own case here, if someone (reliable) said "Coulter filed a false voter registration" and someone else (reliable) said "filing false voter registration in FL is a felony" then we can reproduce the individual duly-sourced statements separately, but we cannot, as WP, create a single connecting statement that concludes that Coulter is liable for a felony offense.

<dd>The trouble is that the cited statutes have nothing to do with Ann Coulter. Except, of course, if Wikipedia's intention is to defame her by implying a connection between her behavior and a crime of which she has not been accused.

<dd>It is not for elections officials or encyclopedia editors to determine when a person commits a felony. IMHO, it is defamatory for an encyclopedia to imply that a person has done so, in spite of an editor's original research. What end, other than backhandedly defaming Ann Coulter, is served by quoting statutes that some editor thinks/hopes she may have violated, but that she has not been accused of? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:48, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the same reason they do it on the nightly news - because by giving two different birthdays on two different official documents (lying on either of which would be a felony), it is difficult to convience of circumstances where she didn't violate the law. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 19:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Could you be more specific about that? The nightly news, at least where I live, is extremely circumspect about accusing people of crimes, about mentioning the possible penalties for crimes that have not even come to the indictment phase, etc. What the encyclopedia is doing here is reporting a minor controversy at a polling place, then quoting a felony statute that applies to willful provision of false information, all in the absence of any mention of felony accusations, hearings, indictments, etc. I just don't see what purpose it serves, other than to defame Ann Coulter. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 20:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(outdent) I must agree with Lou here. I the case of the address debacle, I can see many potentially innocent explanations for the mistake. People do change addresses a lot, and mistakes can happen. By adding the ominous statement about a felony, WP appears to be implying that she is a potential felon, which is not WP's job. If some reputable source said it, that would be fine to report. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:10, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to make things interesting, I happen to agree with Raul. If the allegations of falsified voter registration are prominent enough to be mentioned, then we should say what kind of law they are breaking. Contrary to Lou's opinion, we, as Wikipedia editors, are <i>not</i> determining whether or not she committed a felony, we are instead informing the reader that the allegations being made <i>would constitute</i> a felony if proven. We shouldn't simply act on a knee-jerk "Oh this sentence is negative" as a reason to refrain from putting allegations of wrongdoing in context.--<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:34, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To me it seems that adding that 'felony' statement after the wrong address bit <i>appears</i> like WP itself is being judgmental and malicious. If someone else (reputable etc) said it, fine, but for us to chime in like that has a nasty tone, while our tone should be neutral. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:04, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Nothing notable seems to have happened, except that the formerly-accessible citation has been moved to the newspaper's paid archives. Looks like there wasn't anything to the "allegation of improper activity." Maybe the whole non-notable incident deserves to be deleted.

<dd>I think this all comes down to the information in the reliable sources cited and, pardon the pun, Lou "hit the nail on the head" with the first paragraph of his above edit. I was unable to check the the Palm Beach Post archive becuse it requires you to pay but The New York Post is free, and while it states, "<i>Knowingly voting in the wrong precinct is a felony in Florida</i>," it doesn't say <u>any</u> officials have charged her with doing so (or even <u>think</u> she did). The article simply says the officials want to know why she voted in the wrong precinct. If it was reported that a person profiled in wikipedia was under investigation for being in a car accident while having alcohol in their car, we should report the accident and the investigation but not blithely, "DUI is a Felony in such-in-such a state." To do so, I think would be <u>incredibly</u> prejudicial and POV. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 01:21, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure what anecdote you're referring to, but I disagree if you're saying <u>just because</u> something is mentioned in a reliable source it is inherently suitable for inclusion in a wikipedia article.

<dd>We shouldn't mention it because we are an encyclopedia, not a sensationalist tabloid. We shouldn't mention it because the incident has gone nowhere in six months and the one-month deadline has expired. We shouldn't mention it because Ann Coulter is a living person. We shouldn't mention it because it seems malicious to do so. We shouldn't mention it because it serves no purpose to mention it, other than to defame Ann Coulter. We shouldn't mention it because it puts almost unbearable strain on the assumption of good faith. We shouldn't mention it because, by juxtaposing a report of a minor polling place incident with the citation of a felony statute that nobody but a few editors thinks is relevant, Wikipedia and those editors are, by innuendo and false association, painting Ann Coulter with a felony brush. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:55, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to pile on what Lou has already said: even stating what she allegedly has done and to state the statute and then draw a conclusion from the two is still original research. To say she's committed a felony is drawing a conclusion from the legal statute. She's not an indicted felon until she's actually, you know, indicted.

<p>Here is a question Coulter answered in an interview she gave to <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/196/story_19646.html" class="external text" title="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/196/story_19646.html" rel="nofollow">belief.net.</a></p>
<p>So what do you think really happened? Did God create the world in six days? Did he create each species separately? Did he set a chain of causation in motion? Did he "cause" evolution in the sense that all the species are related to each other but God guided their descent?</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are unanswerable questions--except the latter. God did not "cause" evolution because evolution doesn't exist. Thus, for example, He also didn't "cause" unicorns. My faith and reason tell me that God created the world and I'm not particularly interested in the details. I'll find out when I meet my Maker.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Coulter clearly dismisses <i>biological</i> evolution as a complete explanation of life being on earth, but she doesn't embrace specific creation or intelligent design either. She claims agnosticism on the subject, but is familiar enough with the issues to write that non-<i>biological</i> evolution (that is, intelligent life arriving from other planets) is a possible agent to explain the history of life on earth (see next question in the interview).</p>

On the other hand, she's a prominent thinker and writer, so whatever she writes has a certain notability just because she writes it.

Their complete misunderstanding of Natural Selection is intriguing. Miss Coulter is quoted below as an expert AND at the same time admitting ignorance.

<blockquote>
<p>Ann Coulter is stunned. How is it, she asks, that she could go through 12 years of public school, then college and law school, and still not know that it was Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution that fueled Hitler’s ovens. “I never knew about the link between Darwin and Hitler until after reading Richard Weikart’s book,” said Coulter, a popular conservative columnist and a featured expert on the new Coral Ridge Hour documentary, Darwin’s Deadly Legacy, which airs August 26 and 27. Hitler, she said, “was applying Darwinism. He thought the Aryans were the fittest and he was just hurrying natural selection along.”</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute on French Ann Coulter article</span></h2>
<p>There is a potential problem emerging on the French Wikipedia. For over a year there have been a number of false, contextless, unverifiable and trivial (not to mention non-representative) quotes being employed in the article. I have tried to fix them, but they become quickly reverted. The two reverters are Georgio and Sakharov. Sakharov hasn't bothered to discuss the problem and now he wants to call in "wikipompiers", some kind of mediator. Georgio says he has an "advanced" level of English on his user page, so assuming good faith, its hard to understand how he could contribute such gross mistranslations to the article. I wrote this on the discussion page:</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is an example of one of his improper quotations:</p>
<p>Concerning the Middle-East, after the outrages of 11 September 2001:</p>
<p>We must/should invade the Muslim countries, kill their chiefs and convert them to Christianity. - We ought to ask to see the passports, including the domestic flights, and search any suspect male individual with swarthy skin - The Congress must/should pass a law ordering all Arabs to leave the country."</p>
<ol>
<li>Coulter doesn't mention "The Muslim countries". She mentions the countries where the people rejoice and dance.</li>
<li>The second sentence is not verifiable.</li>
<li>The third sentence is false also, she had written, «&#160;Congress <b>could</b> pass a law ordering all <b>Arab aliens</b> to leave the country.</li>
</ol>
<p>This kind of false quotation tests the assumption of good faith rather arduously.</p>

<dd>An IP tries to translate maladroitly certain quotations of the article, and to remove others of them. She is aggressive ("You are confused") and masters French badly. The necessary references are on the page of the English-speaking wiki.</dd>

<dd>Fabwash answered the call, and has corrected some of the solecisms (I think all non-quotation related) in the article. Then he says he wants a list of the original sources for the quotations, so he can check the translations. I oblige him this evening and describe how Georgio left parts out and/or included extraneous material in nine of about 17 cases-all tending to cause one to dislike Coulter more than the original would have. Stay tuned. Maybe mediation is more common on the French wiki than the English. 216.165.199.50 04:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Franken piece</span></h2>
<p>71.112.48.244 00:44, 16 October 2006 (UTC) I think, perhaps, some of the wording in this entry is a bit too soft on Coulter. It says that Coulter "responded to these and similar claims" in a column. Not really. She ignored a few major claims, such as that she registered to vote at age 16, or the claim that she overloaded a LN search to make the NYT look bad. Also, she claimed in her column that Franken intentionally made it look as though Evan &amp; Norman Thomas weren't related. False. Franken used an endnote, just like Ann.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But she implied that the volume of space dedicated to the Evan &amp; Norman Thomas mistake was calculated to overshadow its partial truthfulness. In the <i>Time</i> Cloud piece she says she didn't want to reveal her birthdate for security purposes. Also in the column piece she said had disputed enough claims, establishing the source of the claims as too unreliable to acknowledge. 216.165.199.50 07:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We now have five (5) college campus incidents listed under "Notable controversies." None of them seem to have been notable beyond the campuses on which they took place. (Most of the citations are from student newspapers; the others are from wire services, and are over a year old.)</p>
<p>Really, folks, it is <b>not</b> notable when some students walk out on a speaker and the college paper reports it. Why are we cluttering our encyclopedia with this cruft?</p>
<p>I propose that we limit the number of incidents in this section to three (3). When a new one comes up, we drop an older one, possibly keeping one or two of the old ones if they are more notable than the typical college student protest. Other than that, we could just permanently get rid of the latest, very insignificant, incident at USF. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:10, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your general analysis of several of these college student walkouts; most are not noteable. I completely disagree with an arbitrary limitation of "incidents" in this or any other section or article. The only criteria for inclusion should be the ones on which Wikipedia is based: NPOV, verifiability, and not original research. If size in an article becomes an issue then we create more articles. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 17:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I propose we get rid of Philander Smith and leave the others at this time. USF is only notable because it's recent. The Philander phlap is in the past, and wasn't very big at its biggest. It's not so much the size of the article that's the problem, but that some people see fit to include every little protest as a "Notable controversy." It seems to me notable that she inspires opposition on campuses, but that a few examples should serve to illustrate it. Arizona and Connecticut are notable because of the coverage they got. Indiana wasn't ever very notable, and sure isn't notable right now, but maybe it can stay for a while. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 21:32, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't removed that from the article but I can suggest several possible reasons. Most important is that I have difficulty seeing where it even fits in with the article as the events are nearly 100 years apart, on opposite sides of the country, and are focused on entirely different newspapers. Further, the assertion is completely unsourced as its asserted link with Coulter's comments. I think those are sufficient reasons to remove the statement from this already-long article. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 00:22, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I referenced a collection of Ann Coulter's controversial statements and saw that they were deleted. This was my first edit ever, so I was careful to check that they complied with Wiki requirement (in that each article is well referenced, often have video).</p>
<p>It seems weird to link to her columns and yet not be balanced by pointing to another well-cited reference that provides commentary on those columns and a number of her television appearances (86 at least).</p>
