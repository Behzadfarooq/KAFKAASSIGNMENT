<p>I like your username - my own anonymous email address is cyanonym@hotmail.com.</p>
<p>A word of warning: when comments are posted, the raw text appears without vocal inflections or body language; the lack of these nonverbal cues tends to make the raw text appear to be more terse/rude than the sender actually intended. This is stating the obvious, but people seem to forget it in the heat of the moment. In Wikipedia, it sometimes results in an exchange of insults during a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_disputes_over_articles_150c.html" title="Wikipedia:Current disputes over articles">dispute over the content of an article</a>. So my word of warning is this: don't be surprised if someone makes comments to you that seem unnecessarily brusque; and try not to take it personally. It is a side-effect of the medium.</p>

<p>Hi, Ann! I've reverted an edit done by you in EU, since Ceuta and Melilla are part of EU. My arguments are at the talk page of EU. Please, don't be angry at me&#160;;) I hope you're enjoying Wikipedia, I've been here for a couple of weeks and it's great fun! I noticed we share a common interest: European Union. So, see you around. Feel free to write me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarco_Neves_4f1c.html" title="User:Marco Neves">Marco Neves</a></p>

<dd>remove borders around pictures</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why? It was clearer before. Is there a Wiki-policy on that? --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnn_O%27nyme_6af0.html" title="User:Ann O'nyme">Ann O'nyme</a> 22:55, 29 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Borders existed in publishing to mark the location where a picture would be inserted in the printing process. That was there only function, in the days of <i>hot metal</i>. Computer pages don't need them.</li>
<li>Borders don't always appear cleanly on some browsers. Some of us some months ago had a problem where the border would not line up correctly around some pictures. On occasion pictures would not be centred in the box but appear to the left or the right, leaving a hideous overly large border on one side of the picture and throwing captions into chaos. It was discussed and it was agreed that the border command was not necessary and was simply a design hangover from the hot metal pre-computerisation days that people, copying the look of pre-DTP newspapers. The options were either to go through a pointless and tedious process of designing a whole new set of commands to ensure borders worked OK on <i>all</i> browsers and then changing tens of thousands of commands around pictures, check every picture placed on a page in every conceivable browser to make sure it worked, and if it didn't go through an equally pointless exercise of continually changing the specifications to get it right through a time-consuming process of trial and error, or simply remove a command that in practice had no design benefit, was irrelevant to computer layout but which simply threw up problems for some people using some forms of some browsers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brion specifically said the command could safely be removed, having been told of the problems arising. Since then, few users include the command (given that most cut and paste the command list from past articles and most articles written in the last few months dropped the command). Where the border exists it is usually in old articles that predate the discovery that it could go hideously wrong on some browsers. Where it is found it is generally removed. (Similarly the old tab commands that were used for pictures is where found is being replacing by the &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; command, because the tab command mucks up pictures or lets text overwrite images occasionally. And the idea of leaving out a pixel specification has also come unstuck when it turned out that the presumption that the picture would automatically be placed correctly proved incorrect, as pictures shot off the page and again collided with text.</p>
<p>Leaving out the border command makes the page cleaner, less <i>hot metal</i> looking and makes the picture appear correctly in all browsers. Keeping it in involves the risk that someone on some form of browser may be presented with a deformed page, with a picture to the left or right in the box, sometimes indeed <i>bigger</i> than the box, and with captions all skewed all over the place. I hope that clarifies the situation. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 01:56, 30 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Glad to help. BTW you're addicted? NOOO! Break free, now. Kick the habit!&#160;:-) Otherwise you'll <i>never ever ever</i> escape the curse of wiki, and find yourself dreaming of edits, waking up in cold sweats muttering <i>revert, revert</i> or worst of all, find when you wake up that in your sleep you've written in your memory a 30K article on some topic, which you will then <i>have</i> to write down immediately; to hell with job, marriage, wedding plans, funerals, holidays, you'll find yourself saying "I've gotta finish that article <i>now</i>!!!" or "OK. Christmas dinner, or that paragraph on Christopher Columbus . . . mmm . . . which do I want?"!!! Or in other words, as you may have realised by now, wiki is more addictive than heroin (and if you are on a pay per minute system, almost as expensive!!!) lol&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 04:52, 30 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Suicide bombing" was created because on the contrary of what append for centuries (at least in Greek-judeo-roman-christian-muslim world) the attacker planed to die in the attack. In fact suicide is even the very key part of the plan.
<ul>
<li>First point: It's a new war tactics. A new concept. A neologism is needed. (Previous exemples: guerilla, blitzkrieg...)</li>
<li>Second and very important point: By committing suicide, the attacker breaks centuries-old traditions. The attack is against the Greek-judeo-roman-christian-muslim civilisation! (May be why "kamikaze" wasn't reused...) Therefore "suicide bombing".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Do a google search for "bombing" and "suicide bombing" and you'll have confirmation that "suicide bombing" is more informative.</dd>
<dd>Look for "bombing" in <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>. No need for "homicide". Bombing and especially "suicide bombing" is about killing people, everybody got it.</dd>
<dd>"Suicide bombing" is prefered to "homicide bombing" because it's older and widely used: "about 181,000" google hits to "about 3,300".</dd>
<dd>Redefining vocabulary is not NPOV. It is not information. It a well-known propaganda strategy. It is vandalism.</dd>
