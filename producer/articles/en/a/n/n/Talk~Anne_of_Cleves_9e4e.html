<p>Anne of Cleves is cool</p>

<p>I find it very difficult to believe that Anne, who undoubtedly found her husband to be disgusting, would ever "purposely make him dislike" her, when most people feared him and he had already put to death one wife and was rumored to have had another murdered.</p>

<p>"William (Wilhelm&#160;?) was a Catholic personally..." but what was Anne&#160;? It later says she converted to Catholicism. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 05:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I'm sure you already know, during the Protestant Reformation, Henry VIII had broken away from the Roman Catholic faith and formed the Church of England. This was a very tumultuous period throughout Europe. Anne's brother Duke William, though Catholic, arranged for her marriage to the King of England for political reasons -- as usually was the case for royal marriages. Their [Anne and William's] brother-in-law was also John Frederick, Elector of Saxony and head of the Protestant Confederation of Germany, which made for an advantageous marriage for Henry. Upon marriage, she left the Catholic faith of her birth and converted to the King's faith. When both Henry VIII and his son Edward VI died, Henry's daughter Mary I, a life-long practicing Catholic (through her mother Catherine of Aragon), became queen and tried to 'force' England back to Catholicism. Hence the nickname "Bloody Mary". By this time, and since Anne was on good terms with her one-time step-daughter, she had converted back to Catholicism. Makes complete sense. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialwon_7780.html" title="User:Dialwon">Dialwon</a> 05:25, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the marriage between King Henry VIII and Queen Anne had not been consummated and subsequently annulled on that basis would it not be a plausible argument to suggest that she never legally held the style and title of Queen of Enlgand? An annulment in the laws of England suggests that a marriage, whether it had been solemnised or not, was null and void and of non effect and effectively supposes that the marriage never occurred. On that basis, should we now suppose that Queen Anne was always and only Princess Anne of Cleves (or Prinzessin Anna von Kleve) rather than the higher position of Queen Anne? I compare her with the late Diana, Princess of Wales in that Princess Diana was never legally styled and accorded the title of Princess Diana and although she was always referred to as such it had just the same effect as referring to Princess Anne of Cleves as Queen Anne of England?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. For a few months Anne was considered Queen of England. Even if the marriage was later annulled, she still counts as being Queen of England during that period - the fact that she was called Queen of England and so forth cannot be taken back by an annulment, and annulments are not generally considered to do that. She is on every list of queens consort that I've ever seen. Also worth noting that she was not merely Princess of Cleves. She was, upon the divorce, given the style of the King's sister, and given the according precedence and so forth. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:33, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I appreciate that she was acknowledged as the Queen during the few months that they were married but under English and cannon law an annulment reverses the act of marriage that had happened before. Queen Anne upon her annulment reverted to be being Princess Anne but i'm confused. An annulment means that the marriage never really took place (as far as i'm aware) and so how can she possibly be considered King Henry VIII's wife whether she had been acknowledged as such or not. The King was married six times according to history but was he really? or was he married five times or even four times (considering the way he annulled his marriage to Queen Catherine). On her tomb at Westminster Abbey, is enscribed Anne of Cleves whereas on Anne Boleyn's tomb is enscribed Queen Anne Boleyn. I cannot see how she can ever seriously be regarded as having been the wife of Henry VIII and thus be Queen. However, if they had divorced rather than had an annulment that would be different. She would be posthumously entitled to be known as Queen Anne and her divorce settlement would be equally understandable. An annulment however changes the status of the individual to being seen as if they had never married. Therefore, Queen Anne can only ever have been Princess Anne as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Under canon law, no marriage of Henry VIII was annuled, so I'm not sure what you're getting at. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 02:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Under cannon law, a marriage between Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves WAS annulled because annulment on the grounds of a non-consummated marriage is permitted under cannon law. As this was the case, Anne of Cleves seized to be the wife of Henry VIII as if she had never been his wife <i>null and void and of none effect</i>. Those words imply to me <i>null and void = no longer valid</i> and <i>of none effect= as if it had never happened</i>. If it was <i>of none effect</i> then she was never Queen. In fact, if the marriage was annulled on that basis then she remained Princess Anne of Cleves. If the marriage had been annulled on the ground of her precontract with the Marquess of Lorraine then effectively she was the common law wife of the Marquess of Lorraine and therefore an effective Marchioness of Lorraine (i'm not saying that she was). Take for example Catherine of Aragaon, after her annulment she reverted to being the Princess Dowager of Wales because the marriage had been annulled on the grounds that Catherine of Aragaon's marriage to Prince Arthur had been consummated. As a result, she reverted to her previous style of Princes Dowager of Wales because that was the only title that Catherine was entitled to under English and cannon law as if the marriage had been <i>of none effect</i>. Similarily, her daughter was stripped off her title and style of Princess and referred to as The Lady Mary because was granted as a courtesy title as the bastard daughter out of wedlock. She was deemed to be illegitimate because the marriage was invalid and of <i>none effect</i>. How then can we justify Anne of Cleves as being Queen of England? I think we can justify Catherine of Aragaon as being Queen of England for five main reasons (1) the marriage was never legally annulled. I think the King was guilty in this instance of granting himself an immediate divorce (considering his word was law) and used political figures to make it seem as if everything was done by the book and above board (2) Princess (or Lady) Mary became Queen of England following her succession and annulled the divorce by act of parliament (3) On Catherine of Aragon's tomb is <i>Catherine, Queen of England</i> (4) There was not one person (not a single solitary person) who could prove/disprove that the marriage between Prince Arthur and Princess Catherine had been consummated and (5) The Pope had granted Catherine of Aragon and Prince Henry two papal dispensations one on the grounds that the marriage had been consummated and one of the grounds that it had not and which gave Henry VIII the right to marry her. As a result, I believe posthumously we should review whether the King was legally married to six women or whether he had married six women and was only legally married to five. In my personal opinion, I don't think we should even include Princess Anne as having been a Queen Consort at all considering she later went on to be the <i>King's sister</i>. isn't that incestious? I realize that including her as a Queen Consort has historical precendence and that's why I don't mind her being among the list so much but shouldn't we debate in this article on whether or not she was legally the King's wife AT ALL!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't directly explain why Anne of Cleves' tomb does not have her styled as 'Queen' or 'Queen of England'. But I think I can explain why the tombs of both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn do. I think it may have a lot to do with both Mary I and Elizabeth I wanting to strengthen the legitimacy of their thrones -- not only through their father, Henry VIII, but through their mothers as well (especially in context of the recent War of the Roses, where legitimacy was a central issue). In this respect, of course both Mary I (daughter of Catherine) and Elizabeth I (daughter of Anne Boleyn) would have 'Queen' and/or 'Queen of England' on their mothers' tombs, further legitimizing their own reigns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anne of Cleves had no issue -- certainly no issue who became sovereign and saw to it that her tomb too identified her as 'Queen'. But both Anne and Mary I, her one-time step-daughter, were on good terms after Henry's death. Upon Anne's death, Mary could've styled her tomb as 'Queen', but didn't. Again, it makes sense, though, that Mary saw to it that her own mother's tomb was so styled. Elizabeth and her mother's tomb too. Still, puting the tombs aside, I think you made a good point about Anne of Cleves being styled Queen despite the annulment of her marriage to Henry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the comparison to Diana, though, only women born to the title can be styled 'Princess [Whatever]'. Upon marrying Charles, Diana was 'Princess of Wales', among other titles. Upon their divorce, she was no longer Princess of Wales or a princess, though people to this day still incorrectly call her 'Princess Diana'. Anne of Cleves was married to the King of England for several months and was addressed as 'Queen' throughout that period, though her marriage would come to be annulled. Again, I think you raised a good argument about whether or not she should be styled as 'Queen Anne of England'. But for a period she was. Technically, Diana was never 'Princess Diana', even when Princess of Wales. She was not born to that styled title. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialwon_7780.html" title="User:Dialwon">Dialwon</a> 04:57, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
