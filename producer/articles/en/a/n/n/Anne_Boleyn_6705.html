<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Boleyn_6705.html" title="Edit section: The birth controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The birth controversy</span></h2>
<p>Due to a lack of parish records from the period, historians do not agree when Anne Boleyn was born. Evidence from the 16th century is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various authors. An Italian historian, writing in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1600.html" title="1600">1600</a>, suggested that she had been born in <a href="../../../1/4/9/1499.html" title="1499">1499</a>, whilst <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_More_90f1.html" title="Thomas More">Sir Thomas More's</a> son-in-law suggested a much later date of <a href="../../../1/5/1/1512.html" title="1512">1512</a>. All other guesses fall within this period of <a href="../../../1/4/9/1499.html" title="1499">1499</a> to <a href="../../../1/5/1/1512.html" title="1512">1512</a>. Nowadays, the academic debate centres around two key dates: <a href="../../../1/5/0/1501.html" title="1501">1501</a> and <a href="../../../1/5/0/1507.html" title="1507">1507</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Two authorities on the period, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Ives_da0e.html" title="Eric Ives">Eric Ives</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retha_Warnicke_e713.html" title="Retha Warnicke">Retha Warnicke</a> (both of whom have written biographies of Anne), disagree. Ives, a British historian and legal expert, promotes the 1501 date, while Warnicke, an American scholar and gender historian, prefers 1507. Some other writers, like Paul Friedmann, Norah Lofts and Hester W. Chapman, have suggested that a birth date somewhere between 1501 and 1507 – such as <a href="../../../1/5/0/1504.html" title="1504">1504</a> – is the best approximation.</p>
<p>The key piece of surviving written evidence in the argument is <a href="http://www.nellgavin.com/boleyn_links/boleynhandwriting.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nellgavin.com/boleyn_links/boleynhandwriting.htm" rel="nofollow">a letter Anne wrote in about 1514</a>. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education in The Netherlands. Professor Ives insists that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen at the time of its composition. Professor Warnicke argues that the spelling is too juvenile and phonetic for someone in her very early teens, and is therefore clearly the work of a young child of about seven, mature handwriting notwithstanding.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Boleyn_6705.html" title="Edit section: Childhood and family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Childhood and family</span></h2>
<p>Anne was the daughter of Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Boleyn_e2b8.html" title="Thomas Boleyn">Thomas Boleyn</a>, later 1st Earl of Wiltshire and 1st Earl of Ormonde, and his wife, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Boleyn%2C_Countess_of_Wiltshire_d5f4.html" title="Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire">Lady Elizabeth Boleyn</a> (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), daughter of the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Howard%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Norfolk_3a9a.html" title="Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk">2nd Duke of Norfolk</a>. It is not known for certain where she was born, but it was either at her family's mansion, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blickling_Hall_c442.html" title="Blickling Hall">Blickling Hall</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, or at their favourite home, <a href="../../../h/e/v/Hever_Castle_2ae0.html" title="Hever Castle">Hever Castle</a> in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>.</p>
<p>It was later rumoured that she had been born with six fingers on her left hand (at the time considered a sign of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">the devil</a>.) Although this legend is popular, it has recently been questioned on the grounds that there is no contemporary evidence to support it. None of the many eyewitness accounts of Anne Boleyn’s appearance – some of them meticulously detailed – mention any deformities, let alone a sixth finger. Moreover, as physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil it is difficult to believe that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any deformities. On the basis of this evidence, many academics dismiss this story.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>She had two siblings. As with Anne, it is not known for certain when they were born, but it seems clear that her sister, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Boleyn_84ad.html" title="Mary Boleyn">Mary</a>, was older than she was. Mary’s children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister; as did Anne’s daughter, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_4e8e.html" title="Elizabeth I">Elizabeth</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Their brother <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boleyn%2C_Viscount_Rochford_94a2.html" title="George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford">George</a> may have been older, depending on when one believes Anne herself was born, since George was definitely born sometime around <a href="../../../1/5/0/1504.html" title="1504">1504</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In later life, Anne did not have a particularly close relationship with her father, but in her childhood she seemed anxious to please him. Her relationship with her sister Mary was initially affectionate, but they quarrelled over her choice of husband and were not on speaking terms at the time of her death. She enjoyed a much happier relationship with her mother and her brother, both of whom she appears to have been very close to.</p>
<p>At the time of Anne’s birth, the Boleyn family was considered one of the most respectable families in the English aristocracy,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> although they had only held a title for four generations. Later, they were criticised for being social-climbers, but this was a political attack against them. In the words of one of her biographers, ‘Tradition also tells us that the Boleyns were a family of London merchants, and again tradition leads us astray. Anne Boleyn was born a great lady [of the aristocracy].’<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Her great-grandparents included a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Mayor_of_London_f1d7.html" title="Lord Mayor of London">Lord Mayor of London</a>, a <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke.html" title="Duke">duke</a>, an <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl.html" title="Earl">earl</a>, two aristocratic ladies and a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a>; amongst her relatives she numbered the Howards, one of the pre-eminent families in the land. She was certainly more aristocratic than either <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Jane_Seymour_bce9.html" title="Lady Jane Seymour">Jane Seymour</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_Parr_39ab.html" title="Catherine Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, two of Henry's other English wives.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anne's father was a respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_of_England_2c03.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII</a>, who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. He continued his career under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>, who came to the throne in <a href="../../../1/5/0/1509.html" title="1509">1509</a>. In <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Thomas Boleyn's professionalism and charm won many admirers, including Archduchess <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margarete_of_Austria_1d28.html" title="Margarete of Austria">Margaret of Austria</a>, the daughter of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_e28f.html" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian I</a>, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_674b.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. She was currently ruling <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">The Netherlands</a> on behalf of her father and she was so impressed with Boleyn that she offered his youngest daughter Anne a place in her household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be 12 years old to have such an honour, but Anne might have been somewhat younger, as Margaret affectionately referred to her as "<i>La petite Boleyn</i>".<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> She made a good impression in The Netherlands with her manners and studiousness and lived there from the spring of <a href="../../../1/5/1/1513.html" title="1513">1513</a> until her father arranged for her to continue her education in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> in the winter of <a href="../../../1/5/1/1514.html" title="1514">1514</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, she was a favoured lady-in-waiting to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_of_France_85ca.html" title="Claude of France">Queen Claude of France</a> and also acted as an interpreter whenever any high-ranking English visitors came to the French court. In the queen's household, she completed her study of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and acquired a thorough knowledge of French culture and <a href="../../../e/t/i/Etiquette.html" title="Etiquette">etiquette</a>. She also developed an interest in fashion and religious philosophy that called for reform of the Church. Her European education ended in the winter of 1521 when she was summoned back to England on her father's orders. She sailed from <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a>, which was then still an English-possession, in January 1522.</p>

A portrait of Anne Boleyn painted some years after her death. Her most recent biographer has called it very close to ‘the real Anne Boleyn.’<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></div>

<p>Anne Boleyn was not conventionally beautiful for her time. She was too thin and her colouring was considered by some to be too dark. However, many observers were impressed by her dark eyes and long, dark hair. One <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> who met Anne in 1532 wrote that she was "not one of the handsomest women in the world", but others thought she was "<i>competent belle</i>" ("quite beautiful") and "<i>young and good-looking.</i> " One historian has compiled all the descriptions and concludes thus:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“She was never described as a great beauty, but even those who loathed her admitted that she had a dramatic allure. Her dark complexion and black hair gave her an exotic aura in a culture that saw milk-white paleness as essential to beauty. Her eyes were especially striking: “black and beautiful” wrote one contemporary, while another averred they were “always most attractive,” and that she “well knew how to use them with effect.”</i><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>People seemed primarily attracted by Anne's charisma. She made a good impression with her fashion sense, inspiring many new trends amongst the court ladies. In hindsight, she was probably the biggest English fashion icon of the early 16th century. William Forrest, author of a contemporary <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poem.html" title="Poem">poem</a> about <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Aragon_0c7a.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, complimented Anne's "passing excellent" skill as a dancer. "Here," he wrote, "was [a] fresh young damsel, that could trip and go."<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“Anne’s charm lay not so much in her physical appearance as in her vivacious personality, her gracefulness, her quick wit and other accomplishments. She was petite in stature, and had an appealing fragility about her… she shone at singing, making music, dancing and conversation… Not surprisingly, the young men of the court swarmed around her.”</i><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>She was a devout <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> in the new tradition of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_Humanism_8eda.html" title="Renaissance Humanism">Renaissance Humanism</a> (calling her a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> would be an overstatement). She also gave generously to charity and sewed shirts for the poor. In her youth she was "sweet and cheerful" and enjoyed <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, drinking <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a>, and gossiping.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> She was also brave and emotional. Yet, according to her enemies, Anne could also be extravagant, neurotic, vindictive and bad-tempered.</p>

<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Aragon_0c7a.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, Henry VIII's first wife</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Immediately on her return to England, Boleyn became a lady-in-waiting to Queen <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Aragon_0c7a.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, Henry VIII's <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> wife. Catherine was popular with many people, although she had been inactive in politics and court life for some time. All her sons by Henry had died young and Henry was anxious for an heir to his throne in order to preserve the monarchy and prevent civil war.</p>
<p>Boleyn made her court début at a masquerade ball in March 1522, where she performed an elaborate dance accompanying the king's younger sister, several other great ladies of the court and his <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistress_%28lover%29.html" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a> – Anne’s sister, Mary. Within a few weeks of this performance, Boleyn was known as the most fashionable and accomplished woman at the court and she has been referred to as a "glass of fashion".<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this time, she was being courted by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Percy%2C_6th_Earl_of_Northumberland_a352.html" title="Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland">Henry Percy</a> the son of the Earl of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> around 1522. The exact nature of their relationship is unclear. Many novels and cinematic adaptations of Anne’s life have romanticised the tale by describing how the young lovers consummated their union. However, it is worth noting that it would have been impossible to break their betrothal if it had been consummated and several of her biographers have pointed out that Anne had seen too many reputations ruined to risk hers. A Catholic author, George Cavendish, who disliked Anne but was friendly with Henry Percy, later stated categorically that the two had not been lovers. It thus seems unlikely that their relationship was sexual.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The romance was broken off in 1523 when Lord Henry's father refused to support the engagement. A romantic legend has it that the liaison was secretly broken up by Cardinal Wolsey, Henry’s chief minister, because King Henry desired Anne for himself<a href="http://englishhistory.net/tudor/ab-percy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://englishhistory.net/tudor/ab-percy.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It is impossible to say if this is true and historians are divided on the issue.</p>
<p>According to George Cavendish, Anne was briefly sent from court to her family’s countryside estates, but it is not known for how long. When she returned to court she gathered a clique of female friends and male admirers around herself, but became famous for her ability to keep men at arm's length. The poet <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Thomas_Wyatt_cbbf.html" title="Sir Thomas Wyatt">Sir Thomas Wyatt</a>, wrote about her in the poem, <a href="http://www.nellgavin.com/ThomasWyatt/" class="external text" title="http://www.nellgavin.com/ThomasWyatt/" rel="nofollow">Whoso List to Hunt</a>, in which he described her as unobtainable and headstrong, despite seeming demure and quiet.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> In <a href="../../../1/5/2/1525.html" title="1525">1525</a>, Henry VIII became enamoured with her and began his pursuit.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anne's sister, Mary, had previously been King Henry's short-term lover, during the time that she was married to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carey_%281490-1528%29_dd82.html" title="William Carey (1490-1528)">Sir William Carey</a>, a gentleman of the king's Privy Chamber. There is a rumour that Mary bore Henry an illegimate child. This idea has been the subject of many novels, but it is discounted by most historians.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> It is believed that Henry's affair with Mary had been finished for some time when he became involved with her younger sister.</p>

Henry VIII. He bombarded Anne with dozens of love-letters.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Anne resisted his attempts to seduce her and she refused to become his mistress. She rejected the king’s initial advances by saying, “I beseech your highness most earnestly to desist, and to this my answer in good part. I would rather lose my life than my honesty.”<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> The king was more attracted to her because of this refusal and he pursued her relentlessly, even after she left the court to return to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>. Historians are divided over Anne’s motivations in rejecting Henry – some say it was virtue and others say it was ambition. Eventually, he proposed and she accepted. However, she decided not to sleep with Henry before their marriage, as pre-marital intercourse would mean that any children they had would be born out of legitimate wedlock. It is often thought that Henry's infatuation with her led him to seek a way to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annul.html" title="Annul">annul</a> his existing marriage. However there is good evidence that Henry made the decision to end his marriage with Queen Catherine because she hadn't delivered a male heir. Henry and his ministers applied for an annulment from the Vatican in <a href="../../../1/5/2/1527.html" title="1527">1527</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Boleyn was kept in the background, but by 1528 it was common knowledge that Henry intended to marry her. Anne’s relatives promoted her cause and they had many supporters at court. Initially, however, she kept herself out of politics. She revelled in her newfound lifestyle - Henry paid for everything, and she accumulated a large wardrobe of gowns, furs and jewels. She was given her own staff of servants, several ladies-in-waiting and new palace apartments.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/5/2/1529.html" title="1529">1529</a>, it seemed as if Pope <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_VII_a0b6.html" title="Clement VII">Clement VII</a> was no nearer to granting Henry an annulment than he had been in <a href="../../../1/5/2/1527.html" title="1527">1527</a>. Anne's <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">spies</a> reported that part of the problem was that the Emperor <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V_25cb.html" title="Charles V">Charles V</a>, Catherine of Aragon’s nephew, had taken Clement captive. Henry saw that Clement was thus unlikely to give him an annulment from the emperor's aunt. As political tension mounted overseas, the court was thrown into turmoil back home, since Cardinal Wolsey’s loyalty to the Boleyns was called into question.</p>
<p>Convinced that he was treacherous, Boleyn maintained pressure until Wolsey was dismissed from public office in 1529. After being dismissed, the cardinal begged Boleyn to help him return to power, but she refused. He then began a secret plot to have Anne forced into exile and began communication with Queen Catherine and the Pope, to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest and had it not been for his death from a terminal illness in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1530.html" title="1530">1530</a>, he might have been executed for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>. A year later, Queen Catherine was banished from court and her old rooms were given to Anne.</p>

</div>
<p>With Wolsey gone, Anne Boleyn became the most powerful person at court. She had considerable power over government appointments and political matters.</p>
<p>Her exasperation with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Vatican</a>’s refusal to make her queen also persuaded her to promote a new alternative to Henry. She suggested that he should follow the advice of religious radicals like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Tyndale_c39a.html" title="William Tyndale">William Tyndale</a>, who denied Papal Authority and believed that the monarch should lead the church. When <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Warham_c0a0.html" title="William Warham">William Warham</a>, the conservative <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, died, Boleyn had her family's chaplain — <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cranmer_521e.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a> — appointed to the vacant position. She also supported the rise of the radical <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cromwell_5e03.html" title="Thomas Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a>, who became the king's favourite new adviser.</p>
<p>During this period, Boleyn also played an enormous role in England's international position by solidifying an alliance with France. She established an excellent rapport with the French <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambassador.html" title="Ambassador">ambassador</a>, Giles de la Pommeraye, who was captivated by her. With his help, she arranged an international conference at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a> in the winter of <a href="../../../1/5/3/1532.html" title="1532">1532</a>, in which Henry hoped he could enlist the support of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_I_of_France_1152.html" title="Francis I of France">Francis I of France</a> for his new marriage.</p>
<p>Before going to Calais, Henry bestowed upon Anne the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marchioness_of_Pembroke_14a1.html" title="Marchioness of Pembroke">Marquessate of Pembroke</a>, making her the first English female commoner known to become a noble in her own right by creation, rather than through inheritance. Anne’s family also profited from the relationship; her father, already Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire and – by means of a deal made by the King with Anne’s Irish cousins, the Butler family – <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Ormonde_a0e0.html" title="Earl of Ormonde">Earl of Ormonde</a>. Thanks to Anne’s intervention, her widowed sister Mary received an annual <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pension.html" title="Pension">pension</a> of £100, and Mary's son, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Carey%2C_1st_Baron_Hunsdon_1250.html" title="Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon">Henry Carey</a>, received his education in a prestigious <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cistercian.html" title="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> monastery.</p>

<p>The conference at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a> was a political triumph, since the French government finally gave its support for Henry's re-marriage. Immediately upon returning to <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover.html" title="Dover">Dover</a> in England, Henry and Boleyn went through a secret wedding service, finally enjoying a sexual relationship after seven years.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> She became pregnant within a few months and, as was the custom with royalty, there was a second wedding service, which took place in London on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/3/1533.html" title="1533">1533</a>.</p>
<p>Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen in time for Boleyn's coronation in June 1533. In defiance of the Pope, Cranmer now declared that the English Church was under Henry’s control, not Rome's. This was the famous "Break with Rome", which signalled the end of England's history as a Roman Catholic country. Few people were aware of the significance at the time, and even fewer were prepared to defend the Pope's authority. Queen Anne was delighted at this development – although she remained a Catholic, she believed the Papacy was a corrupting influence on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Her residual Catholic tendencies can be seen in the ostentatious devotion to the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Mary_d301.html" title="Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a> throughout her Coronation displays.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>After her coronation, she settled into a quiet routine to prepare for the birth of her child. She was deeply distressed when Henry was infatuated with a lady of the court, which provoked their first serious fight. The affair was brief, since Henry wanted nothing to jeopardise his wife's pregnancy.</p>
<p>Henry and Boleyn's child was born slightly prematurely on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/3/1533.html" title="1533">1533</a>, at the king's favourite palace, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Palace_9718.html" title="Greenwich Palace">Greenwich Palace</a>. The child was a girl who was christened <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>, in honour of Henry's mother, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_of_York_57be.html" title="Elizabeth of York">Elizabeth of York</a>. She was given a splendid christening, but Boleyn feared that Catherine's daughter, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a>, would threaten Elizabeth’s position. Henry soothed his wife's fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatfield_House_e9b3.html" title="Hatfield House">Hatfield House</a>, where Princess Elizabeth was living with her own magnificent staff of servants. The country air was better for the baby's health, and Boleyn was an affectionate mother who regularly visited her daughter.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> Her visits were also scenes of friction between her and Princess Mary, who referred to her as "my father’s mistress," while Boleyn called Mary "that cursed bastard."</p>

<p>Boleyn had a larger staff of servants than Catherine; there were over 250 servants to tend to her personal needs, everything from priests to stable-boys. There were also over 60 maids-of-honour who served her and accompanied her to social events. In return, their parents hoped the queen would act as a good mistress and arrange a suitable marriage for them. She maintained a strict control over her maids’ morals and spiritual well-being, chastising Margaret Shelton when she was caught writing poetry in her prayer book. She also employed several priests who acted as her <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">confessors</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaplain.html" title="Chaplain">chaplains</a>, and religious advisers. Her favourite was the religious moderate <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Parker_33ca.html" title="Matthew Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, who would become one of the chief architects of the modern <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> under her daughter Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>Her reputation as a religious reformer spread through Europe, and she was hailed as a heroine by Protestant figures; even <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> viewed her rise to the throne as a good sign. She also saved the life of the French radical Nicolas Bourbon, who was <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_sentence.html" title="Death sentence">sentenced to death</a> by the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">French Inquisition</a>. She appealed to the French royal family, who spared Bourbon’s life as a favour to the English queen. Bourbon would later refer to her as "the queen whom God loves". Although she championed religious reform, especially translating the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, she did not challenge the sacred Catholic doctrine of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transubstantiation.html" title="Transubstantiation">Transubstantiation</a>. She was also a generous patron of charity, distributing alms to poor relief and funds to educational foundations.</p>
<p>As queen, she presided over a magnificent court. In the <a href="../../../1/5/0/1500s.html" title="1500s">16th century</a>, royals were expected to be extravagant in order to convey the strength of the monarchy. Anne spent huge sums on gowns, jewels, head-dresses, ostrich-feather fans, riding equipment, and the finest furniture and upholstery from across the world. Numerous palaces were renovated to suit her elaborate tastes.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>A group of young gentlemen continued to visit the queen’s quarters, where they flirted with her ladies-in-waiting and, with permission, danced with the queen. She never stepped beyond propriety, however, even going so far as to reprimand them if they became too jovial with her or her maids. There was nothing new in this, for a group of young men had also served as Catherine of Aragon’s adherents in the 1510s; it was only later that this behaviour would harm Anne’s reputation.</p>
<p>Boleyn's married life was stormy; the royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Henry's frequent infidelities greatly upset his new wife, who reacted with tears and rage to each new mistress. For his part, Henry found Boleyn’s strident opinions about religion and politics irritating, and he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal. Her second pregnancy resulted in a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> in the summer of 1534.</p>
<p>The French ambassador reported on the frosty atmosphere between the royal couple at a banquet in 1535. When he asked Boleyn about it later in the evening, told him that she felt utterly lonely and that she could feel the eyes of the entire court spying on her. This pressure inflamed her temper, and she clashed with her uncle, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Howard%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk_ff04.html" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk</a>, when she discovered his loyalty to her was suspect. When her sister <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Boleyn_84ad.html" title="Mary Boleyn">Mary</a> secretly married a commoner, she exiled her from court. Both sisters refused to apologise to one another and Mary wrote a letter proclaiming her steadfast love for her new husband. Anne later relented by sending the newlyweds a magnificent wedding present, but she still refused to receive them back to court.</p>
<p>Boleyn was also blamed for the tyranny of her husband’s government. She was said to have pushed Henry to sign his old adviser Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_More_90f1.html" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a>'s death warrant when he was beheaded in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1535.html" title="1535">1535</a> for refusing to break his oath of loyalty to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_III_fefa.html" title="Pope Paul III">Pope Paul III</a>. Whilst Anne did not like More, there is no evidence that she advocated his death. It is unlikely she defended him, but he had acknowledged her as queen instead of Catherine so there was no reason for her to demand his death. She was queen for only 1000 days.</p>

Upon hearing the news of her death, Henry and Anne reportedly decked themselves in bright yellow clothing. Some historians have interpreted this as public displays of joy regarding Catherine's death, but others have pointed out that yellow was Spain's national colour of mourning during the era, and was worn out of respect for the deceased.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> It is doubtful that the royal couple would have publicly celebrated Catherine's death, as Henry considered her to be the Princess Dowager, as the widow of his brother Prince Arthur.</p>
<p>Rumours circulated that Catherine had been poisoned (both Anne and Henry being blamed); the rumours were born after discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that the blackness of Catherine's heart was not due to poisoning, but due to cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> In the aftermath of Catherine’s death, Anne attempted to repair relations with Catherine's daughter, Mary, but she was once again rebuffed.</p>

For most observers, this personal loss was the beginning of the end of the royal marriage. What happened next is one of the most controversial periods of English history, given that it is both a personal tragedy and indicative of larger political trends governing the Tudor monarchy at this period.</p>
<p>As Anne recovered from her miscarriage, Henry declared his marriage was cursed by God. Jane Seymour was moved into new quarters and Anne's brother was refused a prestigious court honour, the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, which was instead given to Jane Seymour's brother.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Boleyn_6705.html" title="Edit section: Theories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theories</span></h3>
<p>Historians still debate over why these extraordinary events took place. There are four main theories about Anne Boleyn's demise, which the Oxford historian Steven J. Gunn described as historical "trench warfare".</p>
<ul>
<li>Guilty as charged: The English historian George W. Bernard is the only modern historian to argue that Anne was guilty of adultery and treason. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> he wrote, "Perhaps the safest guess for a modern historian is that Anne had indeed committed adultery with Norris and briefly with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Smeaton_9ad2.html" title="Mark Smeaton">Mark Smeaton</a> and that there was enough circumstantial evidence to cast reasonable doubt on the denials of the others."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A romantic victim: The traditional theory is that Anne was the victim of her husband's cruelty and that her failure to produce a son meant that Henry would stop at nothing to get rid of her. The famous Tudor historian, Sir <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Rudolph_Elton_d694.html" title="Geoffrey Rudolph Elton">Geoffrey Elton</a> believed that "Anne and five men were put to death by due process of law because the king wished to marry again...Henry had now so far discarded scruple that to get his way he was prepared to appear as a cuckold and a victim of witchcraft".<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A political attack: The most popular theory is that Anne was removed by a palace plot orchestrated by her enemies. An alliance with Spain was becoming desirable for various reasons, and Anne was so unpopular with the Spanish royal family, that her presence was a serious obstacle to progress. Thomas Cromwell, her one-time supporter and the King's chancellor, therefore realized Anne would have to go. He was more than prepared to sacrifice five innocent men to do it (who were also Anne's friends and might, therefore, object to her destruction if they were left alive).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sexual heresy: This theory was first promoted by American academic, <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retha_Warnicke_e713.html" title="Retha Warnicke">Retha Warnicke</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. She argues that there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that the fetus Anne miscarried in January <a href="../../../1/5/3/1536.html" title="1536">1536</a> may have appeared deformed to 16th century eyes; this led to the belief that the queen might have links to perverse sexual practices and the Occult. Her so-called lovers were, probably, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> and were thus equally likely to be victimised by 16th century sexual prejudices. Warnicke's theories are not widely accepted in academic circles, but several books by David Loades and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Guy_0c29.html" title="John Guy">John Guy</a> suggested that they could be taken seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Execution" id="Execution"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Boleyn_6705.html" title="Edit section: Execution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Execution</span></h2>
<p>George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on May 17th. Lord and Lady Kingston, the keepers of the Tower, reported that Anne seemed very happy, and ready to be done with life. She was reported to have said, when Lord Kingston brought her the news that the King had commuted her sentence from burning to beheading, and had employed a swordsman from Calais for the execution, rather than having a Queen beheaded with the common axe: "He shall not have much trouble, for I have a little neck. I shall be known as <i>La Reine sans tête</i> ['The Headless Queen']!"</p>
<p>They came for Anne on the morning of May 19th to take her to the Tower Green, where she was to be afforded the dignity of a private execution. The Constable of the Tower wrote this of her:</p>
<p><i>This morning she sent for me, that I might be with her at such time as she received the good Lord</i> (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Communion.html" title="Communion">i.e. took Communion</a>)<i>, to the intent I should hear her speak as touching her innocency alway to be clear. And in the writing of this she sent for me, and at my coming she said, "Mr. Kingston, I hear I shall not die afore noon, and I am very sorry therefore, for I thought to be dead by this time and past my pain ". I told her it should be no pain, it was so little. And then she said, "I heard say the executioner was very good, and I have a little neck", and then put her hands about it, laughing heartily. I have seen many men and also women executed, and that they have been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has much joy in death. Sir, her <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almoner.html" title="Almoner">almoner</a> is continually with her, and had been since two o'clock after midnight.</i></p>
<p>She wore a plain, dark gown with a mantle of ermine. Her long, dark hair was bound up and she wore a headdress, although sources are contradictory about what else she wore beyond these specific points. She made a short speech:</p>
<p><i>Good Christian people, I am come hither to die, for according to the law, and by the law I am judged to die, and therefore I will speak nothing against it. I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that, whereof I am accused and condemned to die, but I pray God save the king and send him long to reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never: and to me he was ever a good, a gentle and sovereign lord. And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge the best. And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all, and I heartily desire you all to pray for me. O Lord have mercy on me, to God I commend my soul.</i></p>
<p>She then knelt upright (in French-style executions, with a sword, there was no block.) Her final prayer consisted of her repeating, "To Jesus Christ I commend my soul; Lord Jesus receive my soul." Her ladies removed the headdress and tied a blindfold over her eyes. The execution was swift, comprising of a single stroke: according to one tale, the swordsman was so taken with Anne that he said, "Where is my sword?" and then beheaded her so she would think that she had just a few moments longer to live and would not know that the sword was coming.</p>
<p>Across the river the Scots reformer Alesius accompanied Thomas Cranmer as he walked in the gardens of Lambeth Palace. They may have heard the cannon fire from the Tower, signalling the end, for the Archbishop looked up and proclaimed: "She who has been the Queen of England on earth will today become a Queen in Heaven". He then sat down on a bench and wept.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The government had failed to provide a proper coffin for Anne. So, her body and head were put into an arrow chest and buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Peter_ad_Vincula_fb4b.html" title="St. Peter ad Vincula">St. Peter ad Vincula</a>. Her body was one that was identified in renovations of the chapel under the reign of Queen Victoria, so Anne's final resting place is now marked in the marble floor.</p>

<p>For twenty years after her death, Anne was seldom discussed, although in ultra-Catholic circles several dark legends were deliberately nurtured - particularly the stories of her deformities which were concocted to prove that she had been linked to the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a> through <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. These legends eventually formed the basis of a piece of propaganda by an exiled Jesuit priest, Father <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Sander_17ca.html" title="Nicholas Sander">Nicholas Sander</a>, who published his various allegations in <a href="../../../1/5/7/1576.html" title="1576">1576</a>. He also added elaborations which suggested Anne Boleyn had actually been her husband's biological daughter, that she had slept with her brother and had been sexually active from childhood. By the 17th century, Catholic historians of the Reformation moderated these allegations into the charge that Anne had simply been a promiscuous and immoral woman, but stopped suggesting that she had been a witch. This critical view has been expressed by various historians since, although generally they no longer present their views based on a politico-religious bias. The extreme criticisms of Anne formed the imaginative basis of the bestselling British novel, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Other_Boleyn_Girl_706a.html" title="The Other Boleyn Girl">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>.</i></p>
<p>After <a href="../../../1/5/5/1558.html" title="1558">1558</a>, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine by English Protestantism, particularly through the works of the ultra-Protestant propagandist, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Foxe_34bc.html" title="John Foxe">John Foxe</a>, who argued that Anne had saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism (as he saw it) and that God had provided proof of her innocence and virtue by making sure her daughter, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_4e8e.html" title="Elizabeth I">Elizabeth I</a>, later became queen. As a result of this view, many English nobles displayed pictures of Anne in their homes, in order to show their loyalty to Elizabeth and the Protestant monarchy. Although this veneration of Anne diminished in the 18th and 19th centuries, the idea of her as a Protestant heroine was recently resurrected by an English historian, Joanna Denny.</p>
<p>A more common view in the 18th and 19th centuries was the image of Anne as a romantic victim; a strong-willed and beautiful woman who was destroyed by her husband, who was presented as a brutal tyrant by most popular historians. A 19th century biography of Anne by Margaret Benger was particularly fulsome in her praise of Anne, as was one entitled <i>Star of the Court,</i> by Serena Banbury. Famous writers and novelists who subscribed to this view of Anne (which persisted into the 20th century) included <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Austen_1c14.html" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Strickland_cfc8.html" title="Agnes Strickland">Agnes Strickland</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Plaidy_aebf.html" title="Jean Plaidy">Jean Plaidy</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell_Anderson_627d.html" title="Maxwell Anderson">Maxwell Anderson</a>. The play and Oscar-winning movie <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_the_Thousand_Days_fb18.html" title="Anne of the Thousand Days">Anne of the Thousand Days</a></i> is inspired by this interpretation of Anne's life, as is Donizetti's opera <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Bolena_e6eb.html" title="Anna Bolena">Anna Bolena</a>. Various popular novels have also adopted this sympathetic idea of Anne Boleyn.</p>
<p>Finally, in the latter half of the 20th century, academic historians who were determined to study Henry VIII's government and court as serious political and cultural institutions argued that Anne Boleyn had been one of the most ambitious, intelligent and important queens in European history. They researched her political sympathies, patronage network and influence over foreign policy and religious affairs. This led to several academic studies of her life, the most famous of which are the two biographies written by the British historian, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Ives_da0e.html" title="Eric Ives">Eric Ives</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Starkey_ce40.html" title="David Starkey">David Starkey</a> is another historian who keenly promotes this interpretation of Anne. Combined with the intellectual force of feminism, which has interpreted Anne Boleyn in a highly favourable light, most academic histories write about her with respect and sympathy. The work of American academic, <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retha_Warnicke_e713.html" title="Retha Warnicke">Retha Warnicke</a>, focuses on the gender prejudices of the early 16th century and their role in Anne Boleyn's rise and fall.</p>
<p>There have been various treatments of her life by popular historians like Marie Louise Bruce, Hester W. Chapman, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norah_Lofts_10fe.html" title="Norah Lofts">Norah Lofts</a>, Carolly Erickson, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Weir_b4c7.html" title="Alison Weir">Alison Weir</a>, Lady <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonia_Fraser_43f0.html" title="Antonia Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a> and Joanna Denny.
