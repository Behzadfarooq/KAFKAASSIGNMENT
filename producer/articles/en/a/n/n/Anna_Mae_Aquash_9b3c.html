She soon moved to Boston where she met members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) who were protesting against the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayflower_II_64a4.html" title="Mayflower II">Mayflower II</a> celebration at Boston Harbor, boarding and seizing the ship on Thanksgiving Day of 1970. Anna Mae was active in creating the Boston Indian Council (now the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Indian_Center_of_Boston_38a3.html" title="North American Indian Center of Boston">North American Indian Center of Boston</a>).</p>

<p>On March 20, 2003 two men were indicted for the murder of Anna Mae Pictou Aquash: Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud, a homeless <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakota.html" title="Lakota">Lakota</a> man, and John Graham (aka John Boy Patton), a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Tutchone_615b.html" title="Southern Tutchone">Southern Tutchone</a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athabascan.html" title="Athabascan">Athabascan</a> man from <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehorse%2C_Yukon_b5b1.html" title="Whitehorse, Yukon">Whitehorse</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon.html" title="Yukon">Yukon</a>, Canada. Although Theda Clark, Graham's adopted aunt, seems also to have been involved, she was not indicted.</p>
<p>On February 8, 2004 Arlo Looking Cloud was tried before a U.S. federal jury and five days later was found guilty. On April 23, 2004 he was given a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Although no physical evidence linking Looking Cloud to the crime was presented, a videotape was shown in which Looking Cloud admits to being at the scene of the murder but claims that he was unaware that Aquash was going to be killed. In that video, in which Looking Cloud is interviewed by Detective Abe Alonzo of the Denver Police Department and Robert Ecoffey, the Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Law Enforcement Services, taped on March 27, 2003, he states that Graham was the triggerman.<a href="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Looking Cloud is appealing his conviction.<a href="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>John Graham is currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia. On June 22, 2006 his extradition to the United States to face charges on his alleged involvement in the murder was ordered by Canada's Minister of Justice, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vic_Toews_4345.html" title="Vic Toews">Vic Toews</a>. Graham is appealing this order and is presently under house arrest, with conditions.</p>
<p>Graham adamantly denies any involvement in the death of Anna Mae. He claims that the U.S. government threatened to name him as the murderer of Anna Mae if he "didn't co-operate". Claiming that he last saw Annie Mae on a drive that took them from Denver to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where he left her at a "safe house" (in his own words, in an interview with Antoinette Nora Claypoole), Graham explains why he believes he is being charged as her murderer:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...in the mid-80s or sometime about there.</dd>
<dd>The FBI showed up at my home in the Yukon, and asked me all kinds of questions about Anna Mae and the death. They were trying to say I was there, or I knew about it, or I was aware of it. And I had to tell them I wasn't aware, I wasn't around there and I wasn't involved in her killing at all.</dd>
<dd>And they wanted me to name leadership that would have given the order to that effect, to kill Anna Mae. And they were trying to tell me they would put me in the witness protection program, they would change my identity, they would relocate me if I would go to testify in front of the federal Grand Jury in South Dakota against the AIM leadership.</dd>
<dd>So I told them I couldn't do that because it never happened.</dd>
<dd>I never, ever received orders of any kind like that from any of the AIM leadership. And so I wouldn’t do it; I wouldn't cooperate with them.</dd>
<dd>And they left. Then they came back a year or so later and said.... if I didn't cooperate with them to put this information on the AIM leadership, then I would be facing all these charges myself."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The question of Graham's innocence or guilt has divided AIM and AIM leadership, with some (including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Trudell_2cba.html" title="John Trudell">John Trudell</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Means_3bda.html" title="Russell Means">Russell Means</a>) arguing that he was, in fact, the triggerman and others arguing that he is merely a <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapegoat.html" title="Scapegoat">scapegoat</a>.</p>
<p>Leonard Peltier, America's best known American Indian prisoner, has made five public statements on the U.S. government's case against Looking Cloud and Graham. In his first public writing on the case, in 1999, he stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I have not said anything up until now because I do not want to be involved in an investigation carried out in part, by Robert Ecoffey and the RCMP. Ecoffey was responsible for much of the terror and corruption that existed on Pine Ridge in the early 70's. The RCMP, working with the FBI, submitted a fabricated statement against me over a year after I was arrested by them in Canada. This statement has been used to justify my continued incarceration. Who would trust such sources to carry out an investigation into one of the many, many, people who were murdered in conjunction with the FBI on Pine Ridge during that era? I did not want to be involved in this, but now it looks like I must submit a public statement documenting my stance because I very much fear that innocent people will be railroaded as I have, into prison, and the governments of Canada and the U.S. will be happy to have given AIM the image of a vicious and corrupt terrorist organization which we absolutely were not."<a href="http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2005/02/37981.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2005/02/37981.php" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Subsequent to these statements, on February 2, 2005, a communiqué was issued through the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee (LDPC) by Robert Robideau, Co-Director of the LPDC. The communiqué stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“There is compelling evidence that has recently come to our attention regarding John Graham that compels Leonard Peltier to dissasociate [sic] himself and the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee from John Graham and the John Graham Defense Committee… Leonard wants to make it very clear he wants justice to run its course and that he wants to also make it clear that he had no involvement in this matter and hence cannot associate himself with those alleged to have committed this crime against Indian people.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, Robideau requested in three separate correspondences that the John Graham Defense Committee "remove all of Leonard's support letters, expressions, web site and support web sites from their official web site.”<a href="http://indigenouswomenforjustice.org/compel.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://indigenouswomenforjustice.org/compel.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> As of July, 2006 the John Graham Defense Committee had not complied with this request.<a href="http://www.grahamdefense.org/news_peltier1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grahamdefense.org/news_peltier1.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://www.grahamdefense.org/news_peltier2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grahamdefense.org/news_peltier2.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://www.grahamdefense.org/20041206peltier.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grahamdefense.org/20041206peltier.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>Graham has refused to take a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygraph_test.html" title="Polygraph test">polygraph test</a>,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_iwj"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/n/Anna_Mae_Aquash_9b3c.html#endnote_iwj" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/n/Anna_Mae_Aquash_9b3c.html#endnote_iwj" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></sup></span> something neither requested by the courts, his attorneys or the Canadian government. An independent group of women known as the Indigenous Women for Justice, convinced of Graham's guilt, demanded that he "take a test".</p>
<p>One of Anna Mae’s daughters, Denise Maloney Pictou, has worked closely with various groups, most notably as the Executive Director of the Indigenous Women for Justice<a href="http://www.indigenouswomenforjustice.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indigenouswomenforjustice.org/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, who are convinced of Graham's guilt. She has stated that she believes her mother was killed by AIM members who "thought she knew too much. She knew what was happening in California, she knew where the money was coming from to pay for the guns, she knew the plans, but more than any of that, she knew about the killings."<a href="http://jfamr.org/denise_interview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jfamr.org/denise_interview.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Aquash’s other daughter, Debbie Pictou Maloney, is a Constable with the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police_60d8.html" title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> and has been active in the Annie Mae Justice Fund.<a href="http://www.annamaejustice.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annamaejustice.com/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>Denise Maloney Pictou claims that Paul DeMain, managing editor of <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_from_Indian_Country_7e5f.html" title="News from Indian Country">News from Indian Country</a></i>, arranged (through Richard Two Elk) for Arlo Looking Cloud to call her at home. She claims that Looking Cloud confessed to her the story that has become known as "The FBI story." Neither Debbie nor Denise personally knew Looking Cloud at the time and cannot verify that the caller was indeed him, although he mentioned speaking to the daughters in his videotaped testimony of March 27, 2003.<a href="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo_2.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>The case is rife with rumor. Paul DeMain stated that Anna Mae was killed in part because, she knew that Leonard Peltier actually killed the agents. Peltier sued in an attempt to force DeMain and News From Indian Country to reveal the confidential sources upon which this statement was based upon. Shortly after the trial of Arlo Looking Cloud, during which KaMook Nichols testified that Peltier had bragged to her, her sister and Annie Mae about shooting the agents, Bob Robideau on behalf of Leonard Peltier entered into negotiations with DeMain in order to have the lawsuit dismissed. (see testimony of KaMook Nichols: www.jfamr.org)</p>
<p>The current investigation into Anna Mae's murder and original research from which Pictou bases some of her conjecture came from the efforts of Anna Mae's second cousin, Robert Pictou-Branscombe. Branscombe originally began his efforts in the early 1990s, receiving at least some of his "ground-breaking information" from a Denver Police Department detective named Abe Alonzo.</p>
<p>There are many theories about who may have been behind the murder of Anna Mae. John Trudell fingers <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Banks_3037.html" title="Dennis Banks">Dennis Banks</a>, stating in both the 1976 Butler and Robideau trial and the Looking Cloud trial that Banks told him about the killing before the body had been identified.<a href="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/trudell.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/trudell.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> In Dennis Banks' autobiography, <i>Ojibwa Warrior</i>, he states that he was informed by John Trudell that the body that had been found was Annie Mae. Banks states that he did not know until that time that Aquash had been killed.</p>
<p>Although Arlo Looking Cloud did testify in a video that he was present at the murder and that John Graham pulled the trigger, Looking Cloud did admit on the tape that he was making his statement while under the influence of "a little bit of alcohol."<a href="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> In his recent appeal, filed by attorney Terry Gilbert who has replaced his trial attorney Tim Rensch, Looking Cloud has retracted his "confession" stating that it was false. He is appealing on the grounds that his trial counsel was ineffective in that he failed to object to the introduction of his videotaped statement, failed to object to hearsay statements of Anna Mae Aquash, failed to object to hearsay instruction for the jury, and failed to object to leading questions by the prosecution to Robert Ecoffey.<a href="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>Though some are alleged to have believed Annie Mae to be a federal agent, she did not work for the federal government (COINTELPRO).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
