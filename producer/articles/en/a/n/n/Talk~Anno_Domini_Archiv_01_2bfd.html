<p>The objection by non-Christians to the use of AD is not that it refers to an date that used to be thought to be the date of Jesus' birth. It is that it means 'In the Year of Our Lord' and as such does not apply to non-Christians. It is not the year of Our lord, it is the year of Your lord. Its an expression of Christian belief, and is simply not right for a non-believer to use it. I personally have much less problems with BC, and I think others do, but since the thing comes as a parcel the only non-biased way to do it is to use CE and BCE. Which are, by the way, very common here in Europe. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rev_of_Bru_9d33.html" title="User:The Rev of Bru">The Rev of Bru</a> 18:26, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Technically, the initials 'BC' are also acknowledging something special. The term Christ is derived from the Greek translation of the Hebrew "Messiah". To say "BC" is to acknowledge that the Messiah promised in the Torah and Prophets has already come. To my knowledge, only Christians would acknowledge that, although the Qu'ran also gives Jesus (Isa) the title "Al Masih". --202.186.110.51 03:25, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The word "month" is from pagan religions for moon. Should we not drop the word "month" because it is bigoted? This seems to be the logic of the people that want to drop AD and BC.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Half the month and all the days of the week too. But seriously, I understand the desire for the change. AD basically goes against one of the fundamental beliefs of Judaissm, Moon-day isn't much of a threat. Despite understanding the issue, and agree that a change is needed for something more universal for the whole of the world's cultures and religions I don't see the point since it's still based off the Christian designation of the birth of Jesus Christ. Christians shouldn't have an issue with the change since the date still represents His birth, but they will.&#160;:sigh: if it were up to me I'd change to the whole system to <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_epoch.html" title="Unix epoch">Unix_epoch</a> to accomodate for all these internetworked computers spanning the globe.

<p>Question about "erae": is this the proper plural of "era". Isn't the Latin word "aera" already a plural (the plural of aes)? If so, "erae" can't be right. -- SJK</p>
<dl>
<dd>dunno. Don't have a Latin dictionary here, and I don't know the nominative.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dictionary confirms era to be derived from the plural of <i>aes</i>, <i>aeris</i>. The difference in number and the fact that we dropped the <i>a</i> show that this is an English rather than a Latin word, so the plural is the normal <i>eras</i>.</p>

<hr />
<p>I would say so, and I would rename the article Common Era. Anno Domini is not a noun or an adjective. "Common Era" is. -- SJK</p>
<p>I would strongly say no. They are two different terminologies used often by different people for the same numbering system. Using either CE or AD would be seen as POV siding with one side of the debate over the other. Similarly creating redirects would be seen as biased because whichever got the main page would be seen as the the <i>winner</i>, the redirect the relegated loser. The only NPOV way of doing this is to allow separate articles to exist on a related but different topic.</p>
<p>Re NPOV, by the way, the article did contain rather a lot of POV bits.</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be <i>technically</i> correct to put the number after AD but to say it is <i>correct</i> is factually wrong. The technical correctness comes from the latin, a language we don't speak any more. In english it is used by 99 times out of 100 in the form {number} AD. Language evolves and AD {number} is no longer widely used, no more than kyne remains the correct old plural for cow! {number} AD has through sheer usage evolved into an unambiguously correct term. When we all resort to using latin as our language of discourse we can start insisting on people following the latin terminology literally again.</li>
<li>It is wrong to say that BCE and CE are the terms used in academia. They are the terms used by <i>some</i> academics, just as BC and AD are also used by some. Some accept both, some accept only one. To state categorically that <i>either</i> is the language of academics when it is still an issue of bitter debate in some academic circles is POV.</li>
<li>The statement that some christians are unhappy with replacing BC/AD by BCE/CE because it will make them less popular is factually wrong. Their argument is that it would make them less visible, marginalising religion. Taken together with a range of issues that would marginalise religion, they suspect it may have an impact on popularity longterm on christianity. But using BCE/CE on its own is not a matter of popularity but visibility. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 06:12 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be silly to have two separate pages for the same thing as CE/AD are just different names for exactly the same thing. Also if someone is going to be unhappy with a dating system centred around the birth of Christ, I dont't see how just changing the name is going to make this ok.</p>

<dd>I don't think the Nazis did anything like that...maybe some of the more mystical members of the party did, since a lot of them wanted to go back to an idealized prehistoric Germany. Hitler didn't believe in that stuff though. There were terms like "thousand year Reich" but that just referred to the previous two reichs. Since Hitler set up the Third, I don't think he was trying to rewrite the calendar. I can't think of any instance where any Nazis ever used anything but the normal date, and I know Hitler talked about the future with normal dates, like "by 1950 we will do such and such", etc. But I could be wrong&#160;:) I also don't know anything about the Franco's Spain, so I don't know what they did with the calendar. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 03:43 17 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About the AD 2003/2003 AD, isn't the discussion futile? Properly the year should be in Roman numerals? Besides, isn't Latin word order flexible enough to accomodate such moves?

<dd>The Byzantines didn't use AD years, they started with the creation of the world. I forget exactly what year they considered it to be in 1000, but it was somewhere between 6000 and 7000. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 00:51, 30 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Ugh. I have several criticisms of this article as it currently stands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Christian dating schemes in the West. In Europe &amp; the related parts of North Africa &amp; the Near East, years were identified most frequently by the name of an official, such as an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archon.html" title="Archon">archon</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consul.html" title="Consul">consul</a>. (Both the <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livy.html" title="Livy">Livy</a> identify their years by naming the consuls in office.) <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> dates the beginning of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_War_fd52.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a> in a relative sense, counting the number of years from several events, as well as providing the year of various priesthoods (Book II, ch.6). The Greeks later used a scheme of dating from the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">First Olympiad</a>, but they counted the number of games celebrated, which occured every year.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There was also the Seleucid Era, which dated events from the death of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, &amp; was in use as late as the 8th century; &amp; the Spanish Era, which dated events from 38 BC, &amp; was used as late as <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isidore_of_Seville_9c52.html" title="Isidore of Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> in the 7th century. Dating by AUC was actually quite rare, since even the Romans were uncertain about the actual year their city was founded in.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Early Christian Methods of Dating. It took several generations for the Christian community to settle on the use of <i>Anno Domini</i>. One early practice was to date from the end of the persecution of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocletian.html" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>. Another was to date <i>Anno Passionis</i>, from the date of the <b>Death</b> of Christ, not his birth -- which is a far more important event to the Christian Religion. ISTR that this event was traditionally dated to the consulate of the Gemini (i.e., L. Rubellius Geminus &amp; C. Fufius Geminus in AD 29), but I have been unable to find my reference for that fact; this event has been dated varyingly from AD 28 to AD 32. (I remember the character in <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Sprague_de_Camp_1bb8.html" title="L. Sprague de Camp">de Camp's</a> <i>Lest Darkness Fall</i> remarking that if the protagonist wanted to know what the exact year was from Christ's birth, he should ask a priest.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also at this time, dating by <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiction.html" title="Indiction">indiction</a> was common, especially in official documents. I'm not sure how late this method was used, only that it was probably discontinued by AD 1000.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article is correct about the Byzantines dating <i>Anno Mundi</i>. However the exact year A.M. varied from place to place due to disagreements over just how it should be calculated. And regnal years were frequently given as an aid to further identify a date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, I believe that Bede was known <b>not</b> for his use of Anno Domini, but for inventing the use of "Before Christ" for dates.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The section <b>Other Eras in Common Use</b> I'm puzzled why this is here. Isn't the discussion under <a href="../../../e/r/a/Era.html" title="Era">Era</a> enough? We lack similar sections under the articles linked to. (Although a mention/discussion of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> is necessary. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 16:48, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>

<p>Removed the last paragraph since it didn't make much sense. The Gregorian calendar started in 1582, so dating something in the year of the Gregorian calendar wouldn't start the measure in 1 A.D.</p>

<p>From the text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>These abbreviations are usually placed after the year number. In strict literal latin, the number should follow AD, but in practice, the number has generally come to be placed in front of the letters, e.g. "<a href="../../../1/_/_/1.html" title="1">1 A.D.</a>" (there being no year 0), etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not a fan of proscriptive over descriptive usage, but I have to say the only places I have encountered the abbreviation "AD" <b>after</b> the number are (1) on Wikipedia, &amp; (2) in clearly illiterate context. Would someone like to demonstrate to me that contemporary English has changed about this point when I wasn't looking, or should I consider that someone is trying to slip in a justification to excuse her/his persistent mistakes? If it's the latter, I'll happily delete these sentences &amp; fight to the death to keep it from our pendantic shores. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:53, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see AD after the number all the time...and by "all the time" I mean, generally so often that I can't think of specific example...but I will look for one. (Obviously it's wrong, but for some people AD and BC don't really mean anything anymore, so it doesn't really matter, I don't think.) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 06:36, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The use of CE and BCE is much more prevalent in North America than in the rest of the world. This can be seen in website usage of these terms. In Europe the terms are not at all common. Also, the statement 'This usage is preferred in much academic writing,...' would perhaps be more accurate as 'This usage is preferred in some academic writing,...'</p>
<p>Does anyone object to my editing the text to take account of these points? <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">User:Arcturus</a> 19th June 2004.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but the image here "a monk, in a scriptorium" is a bit silly. It should either be Dionysius Exiguus (or at leas a <i>scythian</i> monk) or then an early calendar or something.

<dd>The Anno Domini era is the only system in everyday use in the Western hemisphere, and the main system for commercial and scientific use in the rest of the world. Secularists, both Christian and non-Christian, however, object to a system based upon an event in the Christian faith; for this reason, the same epoch is also referred to as the Common Era, abbreviated CE.</dd>

<p>This is a very interesting and well done article. I'm new to this, so I don't feel qualified to make any changes myself, but I have a couple minor comments.<br />
- In regard to Charlemagne moving to the A.D. system for political reasons, I thought you were going to say something about the fact that he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas Day of A.D. 800, a nice round number. He may have even been <i>trying</i> to foster some millenarian ideas that would culminate in himself, but I don't know much about that.<br />
- The B.C./A.D. system does not imply that Jesus was born in 1 B.C., as is stated several times in this article. 1 B.C. is "the first year before Christ," while A.D. 1 is "the first year of our Lord." Thus, the system implies that Christ was born in A.D. 1. -MatthewT, 6 Sep 2004</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding BC/AD, note that our modern count of years is simply the extension of the year numbers assigned to known events by previous authors. To determine when Christ was born in this system we must consult the originator of the system, Dionysius Exiguus. Although he does use the term "Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi" (in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ) at the head of his table, he prefers the term "annus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi" (the year since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ) in his discussion, making it clear that his epoch was Christ's Incarnation (or conception), not his birth. Furthermore, he only uses the term relative to his table of Easter dates beginning AD 532, thus if he had referred to AD 1 he would have meant the (proleptic) Easter one year after Christ's Incarnation. Combining this with the standard instituted by Bede for historians that 1 BC precedes AD 1 means that Dionysius placed Christ's Incarnation on the date we now call March 25, 1 BC. This implies that Christ was born nine months later on December 25, 1 BC according to Dionysius and in agreement with the article. Christ's actual Incarnation or birth is an entirely separate question. For Dionysius' table and discussion in both Latin and English see <a href="http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm" class="external text" title="http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm" rel="nofollow">Cyclus Decemnovennalis Dionysii or Nineteen Year Cycle of Dionysius</a>. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 23:18, Sep 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I object to the following sentence in the introduction:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Christian Era is the only system in everyday use in the Western World, and the main system for commercial and scientific use in the rest of the world.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_epoch.html" title="Unix epoch">Unix epoch</a> is assumed to have begun January 1, 1970T00:00:00Z, and is the dominant time stamp system on most computers. It is correlated to the Gregorian Calendar, but it is also correlated to dozens of other calendar systems transculturally. For commercial and scientific use, Unix time is both more common (in sheer number of transactions using it) and more universal. It is also misleading, as the grocer in my neighborhood (Vancouver, BC) hangs a chinese calendar, various religious organizations follow their specific calendars, and the calendar most popular in some sections of town is the Malaysian official which covers the Islamic, Budhist, and a half-dozen other ethnic/religious dating systems. There is no monolithic "Western World". Furthermore, almost no one in western culture dates an object, a check or a memo, "AD"; there is no common use of the specificity of the term.</p>
<p><br />
I disagree. The Unix Epoch is defined as 1/1/1970, setting its place in 1970 AD. Your grocer in Vancover puts '2005' on his checks, which is the very definition of 'everyday use'. The very fact that he is using 2005 -- which can only mean 2005 AD -- is sufficient to demonstrate use. You would undoubtably recognize a difference between 'Canadian' and 'American' despite the fact that many (if not most) people consider the former to belong to the latter. Likewise 'Western World' exists whether you recognize such a thing or not. It is an objective distinction, not dependent upon your opinions.</p>

<p>I just did a brief survey of my history textbooks and they all have one of the following:</p>
<p>A.D. xxxx</p>
<p>xxxx C.E.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we expect textbooks to be a bit more rigid about putting the A.D. before the date, and of course a random sampling of <i>my</i> textbooks is hardly conclusive, but why is it that this article does not at any point refer to the abbreviations as "A.D., B.C., C.E., B.C.E." instead of "AD, BC, CE, BCE"? If we decide that either format is acceptable (and I would like to be shown evidence that version without periods <i>is</i> acceptable in an academic or scholarly context—I'll take whoever's word for it that such evidence exists, but I would like to be shown it nonetheless), we should at least include a note in the article to that effect.

<p>Yes, maybe that's what should be done, but most references to CE/BCE should then be taken out of this article. Perhaps just a single mention of the controversy should remain, with a link to the new CE/BCE article. I hate CE and BCE so I would be happy to have mention of them expunged from this article.

<p>I think that in fact this page should be title <b>Christian Era</b>. Anno Domini is the <i>designation</i> used for years <i>in</i> the Christian Era. The Christian Era itself (as first defined by Dionysius Exiguus in 52whatever) is the <i>era</i> that we are talking about here ... AD is simply a way of designating a number as being meaningful within that era. See <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_era.html" title="Calendar era">calendar era</a> for an idea of what an era is. <i>Anno Domini</i> is not an era; it is a designation.

<dd>"Christian Era ... This was introduced about the year 527 by Dionysius Exiguus, a Scythian monk resident at Rome, who fixed its starting point in the year 753 from the foundation of Rome, in which year, according to his calculation, the birth of Christ occurred. Making this the year 1 of his era, he counted the years which followed in regular course from it, <i>calling them</i> years "of the Lord", and we now <i>designate</i> such a date A.D.

<dd>Well, I linked to this article in the common era article (it's the first link). I would personally argue that they are not the same <i>thing</i> (and certainly they are not the same <i>topic</i>). I would agree that they coincide perfectly in terms of dates, but from a post-modern perspective, one is christo-centric and the other is not, which makes them different. I would argue that, instead, the Common Era primarily is a neutral Era, and secondarily that it coincides with the Christian Era as a matter of pragmatic convenience; in other words, it would have been better, but impracticable, to choose a new starting point. It's a different point of view on the subject than you might have, but valid in a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-modern.html" title="Post-modern">post-modern</a> (thus relative) sense, ignoring the politically correct (taken as revisionistic) sense.

<dd>Well, I think if numerically identical, that is BC=BCE, and AD=CE for any year, than we should merge them (I won't personally). The fact there were numbering differences in the past means little. Often synonomis emerge due to seperate histories. There's only one <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> article. We don't write a seperate article from the "Spanish/Argentine" side, and another from the British side. It's merged into one, since it refers to one thing.

<dd>Isn't it obvious, like by definition, that a Biblical scholar would assume that Jesus existed? The idea that there should be "if he existed at all" in there seems ludicrous.

<p>There is remarkably little evidence for a Historical Jesus. Even Christians admit that the only evidence they have for him are the gospels, which are not, and were not written as, historical documents. Most unbiased scholars discount the events claimed in the gospels... which leaves no evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">historicity of Jesus</a> for more. There are some documents from around ~2CE that mention christians... but that doesnt mean that there was a historical Jesus Christ.

<p>I know that paragraph is a little bit off topic, yet someone put that in, so I'd like to comment on the accuracy. The way to calculate "in the year of ROC" is using the year in AD minus 1911.

<dd>You are confusing many different events. The Wuchang uprising on 10 October 1911 was the event that <i>led to</i> the creation of the Republic of China—the republic was not created on that day. The republic was declared by Sun Yat-sen on 1 January 1912, which he also declared to be the first day of the Gregorian calendar in China. However, the republic ceased to exist the next year when China descended into a period of warlordism, which did not end until Chiang Kai-shek overthrew the Beijing warlord in late 1928 and decreed the new Republic of China to be in existence beginning 10 October 1928 (note the same date in different years). The Gregorian calendar was reaffirmed effective 1 January 1929 by outlawing the traditional calendar. 1929 was also the first year that ROC years were actually used, but they were backdated to 1912. Although you are correct that the ROC year is AD-1911, such a calculation should not be in the article—only the first year should be in the article. 1911 is year 0 of the calculation. 1912-1911=1, thus 1912 was the first year. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 6 July 2005 02:19 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have a right to be confused. I am not sure what the editor who added that paragraph had in mind. He mentions Italy, France, and Spain, which were part of the Western Roman Empire until its dissolution in the fifth century. When Bede wrote his <i>History</i> in 731, they were not part of any empire and they certainly weren't "more important places". The Holy Roman Empire did not begin until 834. The only part of the Roman Empire still in existence in 731 was the Eastern Roman Empire which was the most important place at that time, especially its capital Constantinople. But its historians usually used the Alexandrian Era, which is just as good as any other very long term era. Besides Constantinople, the British Isles, including Northumbria, were indeed the most important places. Continental centers of learning, mainly in monasteries, were established a century later by disciples of Bede himself. The editor seems to be of the opinion that a plethora of regnal dating systems were in use, which simply wasn't the case in my opinion. I'm not sure how to better word that paragraph. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 20:58, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would have thought the year of Jesus's death would be a much more natural starting point to use for both theological and historical reasons.</p>
<p>Theologically, the death and resurrection of Christ are far more important to Christians than his birth. Historically, Jesus was famous at the time of his death and therefore it has more and better historical evidence than the time of his birth.</p>

<dd>This depends on the luck of history. Many different Christian counts of years have been used over the last two millennia. The dominant Christian count during the first millennium did not even refer to Christ—it was the Anno Mundi (in the year of the world) era counted from Creation (several counts existed), used by almost all Western (originally Latin) Christians for the first five centuries, and by Eastern (originally Greek) Christians until AD 1700 when Russia adopted the AD count, and even by some Eastern Christians privately to this day. Relative to Christ, in AD 457 Victorius bagan his 532-year Easter table in the year we now call AD 28, where Easter is an annual celebration of Christ's Resurrection. During the first three centuries it was an annual remembrance of his Crucifixion. Sometimes both were combined into the Parousia. The errors in Victorius's table caused it to be replaced. Bede's great influence caused the count by Dionysius Exiguus to dominate. The habit of writing brief notices of what happended in a specific year in the margins of Easter tables caused the AD count to be used historically as well, even before Bede by Irish monks. Ironically, Dionysius does not even mention Christ's birth or Nativity, instead he always refers to his Incarnation or conception, which by the time he wrote in AD 525 was firmly fixed on 25 March, nine months before 25 December, which had been fixed as his Nativity in the fourth century. I'm not sure why Dionysius uses the Incarnation of Jesus as opposed to his Resurrection. After all, he only created a new Easter table just like Victorius (which was to replace it), and did not use his count of years for any historical purpose. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 21:43, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Joe Kress changed the bit about scientific numbering. I reworded it again in an attempt to put in it in a wider perspective. What I mean to say is that the AD/BC numbering deviates from the standard western numbering system. But I wonder if the year 0 is only used in astronomical numbering. Isn't it used more generally in science, or is it just that the problem only presents itself in astronomy? Also, it makes sense to mention why the year 0 is omitted in the christian numnering system (the Romans didn't know a zero). And how often does one need a precision of one year? Rarely, I presume. And finally, how common is the numbering without a zero? There was quite some dispute over when the 20th century started, so one can't state that the non-zero option is the most common one. Actaually, most people celebrated it on 1 January 2000 (not 2001), but that was probably not for this reason. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 08:40, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am certain that the classical Romans knew about the number zero. We are taught that they did not know about zero because virtually all books and articles on the history of numbers only discuss number <i>symbols</i>, not number <i>words</i>. They had two perfectly good Latin words meaning <i>nothing</i> which would mean <i>zero</i> in an arithmetic context, <i>nulla</i> and <i>nihil</i>. I am certain that any arithmetic treatise by a classical Roman author would mention zero via these words. I suspect that some Roman may have even used a symbol for zero, the obvious choice being the initial of the Latin words, N, just as C from <i>centum</i> means 100 and M from <i>mille</i> means 1000. N was actually used at least once by Bede or a colleague about 725 in an <a href="../../../e/p/a/Epact.html" title="Epact">epact</a> table reprinted in the <i>Corpus Christianorum</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Be that as it may, it has no bearing on the article because the Romans did not invent the AD era. But the person who did, <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysius_Exiguus_a225.html" title="Dionysius Exiguus">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, certainly knew about zero because he used it in the same table where he introduced the AD era, although in a different column. See my discussion in <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_zero.html#Bede" title="Year zero">year zero#Bede</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No other scientific discipline besides astronomy uses a year zero. Archaeology uses several methods to date events, but none are negative years. "Years before present" literally means the number of radiocarbon years before 1950, but often means the same thing as "years ago", before 2000 or 2005. Of course, BC or BCE is also used, producing a number about 2000 smaller, and is preferred for historical dates because the artifacts thus dated can be correlated with historical dates obtained from written sources, which never use a year zero. <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dendrochronology.html" title="Dendrochronology">Dendrochronology</a> (tree rings) can be dated to a single year, but use BC/BCE. Geology usually uses "years ago". I can't think of any other scientific discipline that refers to years before the AD era.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Precision to a single year is normal for the first three centuries BC. Indeed, an error of one year is serious. No historian uses a year zero, which itself is over 99% of all recorded dates before the AD era (astronomy's use of zero is negligible).</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I just wonder about that last phrase; <i>astronomy's use of zero is negligible</i>. Do you mean by that that astronomy uses such big numbers that whether one uses a system with or without a zero doesn't really matter (as opposed to in archaeology). The only problem I can think of is with something like a supernova before 0 that was recorded at the time but later expressed with the BC/AD notation. And that would only be the case with European records. If they were Chinese the discrepancy would be so obvious that confusion is unlikely. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 10:46, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're concern is warranted. I didn't like the phrase myself after re-reading it. I should have said "astronomy's use of zero is negligible by comparison, much less than 1%". Astronomy habitually uses a year 0, but the total of all astronomical dates in all books is very small compared to the total of all historical dates in all books, mostly because many more historical books are written than astronomical books. Furthermore, the phrase did not refer to a precision of one year, thus it should have been in another paragraph. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 06:58, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>CDThieme, ArbCom merely ruled that I can't change BCE to BC or CE to AD in any article. I'm quite permitted to do anything else that is in accordance with Wikipedia policy. Eg, where appropriate, I can remove BCE and CE, replace a reference to, say "around 2000 BCE" to "around 4,000 years ago", remove references to "(the) Common Era" or "Before (the) Common Era".

I suppose prolific editors have to accept that that will be the case from time to time in the current climate on WP. But to address your specific point, I have always edited in good faith, and there has been no finding to the contrary. Anyway, the question here is whether (1) there is support for the statement (in which case the statement can, at the very least, be revised so that it better reflects the evidence), and (2) whether, in any event, it is relevant to an article on "Anno Domini"?, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 21:51, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I have against it is that, in world terms, it is little used and little understood. On google searches BC has precedence over BCE by a margin of 9 or 10 to 1, in real life (bearing in mind that google searches on the subject will give greater weighting to usage by the US and by academia) it has been estimated at 50 to 1. It's a question of conveying information clearly to as wide an audience as possible, and that means using terminology a wide audience will understand. Here, I am not against making reference to the term "Common Era", and would agree that it is inappropriate to delete it (after all, we're in the business of providing useful information, not deleting it). What I am questioning is the usefulness of the sentence afterwards, which is "This terminology is often preferred in interfaith dialog". That sentence is meaningless for this article, has no providence (or at least no providence for which a source is provided), and suggests the terminology is far more prevalent than in fact it is (and if I'm wrong on this, it ought to be possible to provide sources to contradict me - and ought to be possible to be more exact than the imprecise word "often"), <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 09:12, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Squell, thank you for your suggestion, which is to add "because of its less overt religious implications", but I am still going to remove it as it is a statement that I do not believe to be generally true. For example, many Jewish scholars use CE because it is, in their view, not Christian, rather than because CE is less overt - had AM notation been used instead, they would not object. The difficulties in explaining the arguments and history in using the term "Common Era" appear to have been discussed in some detail above, and to have led to a new breakaway article at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> being created to discuss the issue. The sentence preceding it makes clear that there is more to be read on "Common Era" if a reader so chooses - thereby encouraging the reader to learn more about it.

Note that I don't say that using BC/AD implies a belief in the divinity of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, but rather that some of those who use CE believe that. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 22:27, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then you should agree that ".. as a recognition that [...] <i>foo</i> <b>should not</b>" is too strong language. It was also tautological because it said the same thing about christianity twice. If you don't mind, I think this Talk section has been blown tremendously out of proportion for such a <i>small</i> piece, and second, I'm very content with dpbsmith's last edit, which is a major improvement over anything that was here previously squell 00:17, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would be fine with rewording it with other language, but I feel that it is important to include that at least some people feel that BC/AD are religiously charged, and hence prefer BCE/CE. As stated below, I am not happy with the current version as it implies that CE is only used in "interfaith" dialog. I would agree that this is being blown out of proportion, but it was jguk's incessant revert warring that started it. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 19:47, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that the version I reverted to did indeed include "in the US", and was simply the version that CDthieme was defending. From the table of contents of the reference Sortan added, I gather that it is an inherently religious book (be it jewish or christian centric, I don't care) which to me makes it immediately suspect to draw any conclusion from.

<dd>This is largely a tempest in a teapot created by a single determined editor. Every source I've seen says "CE" is preferred in interfaith dialog (especially in regards to Judaism). Every source says that CE is preferred by people as an alternative to the perceived religious bias of BC/AD (whether the bias is real or imaginary is up for debate, but that fact that some people think it has a bias is not). I would be very interested to have a source which gives an alternative reason for the growing use of CE, or that BC/AD is preferred in interfaith dialog. These facts aren't disputed anywhere but here, and mostly by one single person, and there is no need to qualify statements that aren't contested. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 21:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not quite sure which book you're talking about, but neither of the sources I added are "engaging" in religion, but "talking" about it. I also don't think its appropriate to shunt criticism of Anno Domini to the Common Era article. That article deals with the criticism of Common Era, this article should deal with the criticism of Anno Domini. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 19:47, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, there is just one dominant year numbering, and AD and CE are two names for it. Calling it CE is a cognitive choice out of preference or political correctness, to avoid the christian association. So <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> should host all pro- and contra points (as it does now), while <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">Anno Domini</a> should simply talk about how the dating scheme itself.

<dd>I disagree. That there are criticisms of Anno Domini and its perceived religious bias (along with the abbreviations AD and BC) is directly related to this article dealing with "Anno Domini". The criticism is not really directly related to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a>, and saying move it there is no more appropriate than saying move the criticism to <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_calendar.html" title="Hebrew calendar">Hebrew calendar</a>, or <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_calendar.html" title="Islamic calendar">Islamic calendar</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 21:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made my last comment here before noticing that someone had added the Cunningham and Starr source. Whoever it was, thanks - a quotable reference is just what this discussion needed. I'm not sure how best to segue the reference into the text. Now we have something quotable to latch a comment onto, I have made a short "Common Era" section to discuss this - but I'm not sure it flows as well as it could (and also I think the way the reference was initially added didn't help the flow - but that's a small matter that can be corrected, providing the reference is far more valuable than the cost of fixing that). I'd be grateful if others can help word the new "Common Era" section better though - it may now be demonstrably correct, but it's worded too stiltily, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 21:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(I'll add my comment here as this is where I intended it to go before the edit conflict.) Apologies to other editors for having to edit war to make my edit stick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anno_Domini&amp;diff=32279455&amp;oldid=32266764" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anno_Domini&amp;diff=32279455&amp;oldid=32266764" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, but I do believe it deserves to be considered on its merits rather than to be blindly reverted by CDThieme. Whilst I have been writing this comment, it seems someone's jumped in to protect the page, which wasn't my intention. As noted above, I'm grateful that we now have a quotable source, which in turn allows us to make a specific comment about the issue. We need to make the text flow better, and I believe my edit in a step in the right direction there, though I also believe it is not the last word.
