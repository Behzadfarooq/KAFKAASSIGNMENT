<p><i><b>Annihilation</b></i> is a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> crossover event highlighting several relatively under-used <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_space.html" title="Outer space">outer space</a>-related characters of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a>.</p>
<p><i>Annihilation</i> started with a 48-page one-shot issue entitled <i>Annihilation: Prologue</i> which hit the stores on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and then followed by four 4-issue limited series: <i>Annihilation: <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Surfer_9bd6.html" title="Silver Surfer">Silver Surfer</a></i> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a> 2006), <i>Annihilation: <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super-Skrull_0e31.html" title="Super-Skrull">Super-Skrull</a></i> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a> 2006), <i>Annihilation: <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_%28comics%29.html" title="Nova (comics)">Nova</a></i> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">April 19</a> 2006), and <i>Annihilation: <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronan_the_Accuser_b627.html" title="Ronan the Accuser">Ronan</a></i> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">April 26</a> 2006). The event concludes with a 6-issue miniseries entitled <i>Annihilation</i>, bringing the four stories together. The mini-series <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Drax_the_Destroyer_fe3e.html" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax the Destroyer</a>: Earth Fall</i> (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a> 2005) was a prelude to the event.</p>

<p>In this series, by Keith Giffen and Mitch Breitweiser, Drax is seen on a ship with <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paibok.html" title="Paibok">Paibok</a>, Lunatik, and the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Brothers_%28comics%29_311c.html" title="Blood Brothers (comics)">Blood Brothers</a>. They are to be transported to an intergalactic prison, but the ship crashes on Earth under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives. His intelligence comes back to him at random intervals during his fight with the other prisoner. When he is seemingly killed by the Skrull Paibok, a new body emerges from the remains, appearing to have lost some of his strength and resilience, as well as his ability to fly and shoot energy blasts.</p>
<p>However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle. He also takes the role of protector of a young Alaskan girl named Cammi whom he seems determined to protect at all costs. This Drax with a new body defeats Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers. The mini-series ends with Drax and Cammi back on a prison ship.</p>

<p>The prologue to the Annihilation event, written by <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Giffen_1f78.html" title="Keith Giffen">Keith Giffen</a> with art by <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Kolins_a420.html" title="Scott Kolins">Scott Kolins</a>, depicts <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanos.html" title="Thanos">Thanos</a> of <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28moon%29.html" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a> at the edge of the universe and his conversation with <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Marvel_Comics%29_6774.html" title="Death (Marvel Comics)">Death</a>, who reveals that "Something Wonderful" is about to happen, and that Thanos would do well to learn from it.</p>
<p>Death appears to be referring to the coming of a massive insectoid military force (revealed to be called the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilation_Wave_aa28.html" title="Annihilation Wave">Annihilation Wave</a>) through the expanding edge of the universe known as "The Crunch," which immediately sets to the destruction of the <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyln.html" title="Kyln">Kyln</a> structures — artificial moons that serve as both galaxy-wide power generators and a death-row prison *— that orbit the Crunch. The emergence of this force and the destruction of the <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyln.html" title="Kyln">Kyln</a> are referred to in captions as "Annihilation Day."</p>
<p>The Annihilation Wave cuts a swath to the planet of <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xandar.html" title="Xandar">Xandar</a>, where it quickly destroys the planet's surface and seemingly wipes out all of the Nova Corps, leaving <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_%28comics%29.html" title="Nova (comics)">Richard Rider</a> as the organization's only survivor.</p>
<p>Seemingly unrelated to the Annihilation Wave story, the Prologue also shows the arrest of the <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kree-Skrull_War_b277.html" title="Kree-Skrull War">Kree</a> <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronan_the_Accuser_b627.html" title="Ronan the Accuser">Ronan the Accuser</a> in the midst of his duties; the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Surfer_9bd6.html" title="Silver Surfer">Silver Surfer</a>'s realization of something being amiss; and the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super-Skrull_0e31.html" title="Super-Skrull">Super-Skrull</a> in hiding on a Kree starbase. These segments serve as starting points for the four Annihilation mini-series.</p>
<p>On the one-shot's final page, the leader of the Annihilation Wave, and potentially the overall villain of the Annihilation story, is revealed to be <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic_Four_3810.html" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a> foe <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilus.html" title="Annihilus">Annihilus</a>.</p>

<p>Four days after the Annihilation Wave struck Xandar, Nova wakes up to find out he is the sole survivor. In an attempt to carry them both to safety, Nova allows Xandarian Worldmind to install both the entire Nova Force and the Worldmind itself within his body.</p>
<p>However, despite the risk that the Nova Force may drive him insane, Nova refuses to flee to safety. Instead, he saves two other survivors of the attack on Xandar, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drax_the_Destroyer_fe3e.html" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax the Destroyer</a> (who identifies himself as "Drax, who may or may not have a past in destroying.") and Drax's companion, Cammi. After bringing the two refugees to Nycos Aristedes, Nova then agrees to assist <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasar_%28comics%29.html" title="Quasar (comics)">Quasar</a> in protecting the fleeing inhabitants of that planet.</p>
<p>After Nova uses his power to open a stargate large enough to accommodate the entire planet's population, he and Quasar batter the Annihilation Wave in an effort to buy time for the refugees. With the combination of the Nova Force and the Worldmind's calculating capability, Nova puts up a good fight, but realizes that he will eventually lose.</p>
<p>Over the continued objections of the Worldmind, Nova and Quasar accept Drax's advice to ignore the fleet and attack <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilus.html" title="Annihilus">Annihilus</a> personally. Annihilus easily defeats them, stealing Quasar's quantum bands and energy, and apparently killing Quasar himself. However, when Annihilus connects to Nova in order to consume the Nova Force, the Worldmind overrides Annihilus' control to the ships, irrevocably ordering them to attack one other. Furious by this, Annihilus withdraws while Nova flees.</p>
<p>With the evacuation fleet safely through the stargate, Nova and the Worldmind agree that, rather than delivering the Worldmind and Nova Force immediately to safety, the two of them will remain united to fight Annihilus. Nova reunites with Drax and Cammi, and asks Drax for lessons in how to destroy.</p>

<p>This series focuses primarily on an attempt by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilus.html" title="Annihilus">Annihilus</a> to capture the current and former <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_of_Galactus_56c6.html" title="Herald of Galactus">Heralds of Galactus</a>, as well as <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactus.html" title="Galactus">Galactus</a> himself, presumably in order to study and harness their <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Cosmic_e6eb.html" title="Power Cosmic">Power Cosmic</a>. The <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Surfer_9bd6.html" title="Silver Surfer">Silver Surfer</a> learns of the Annihilation Wave and of the attempt by Annihilus's "Seekers" to capture the various heralds, primarily through the use of "Currs," dog-like beasts on leashes made out of cosmic energy. During the course of the four issues, the Seekers succeed in killing former herald <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air-Walker_09b0.html" title="Air-Walker">Air-Walker</a> and in capturing <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrax.html" title="Terrax">Terrax</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morg.html" title="Morg">Morg</a>.</p>
<p>Although Terrax's fate is unrevealed, Annihilus kills Morg in an unsuccessful attempt to drain his power. Several of the other former heralds, <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firelord.html" title="Firelord">Firelord</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Shift_%28comics%29_0eef.html" title="Red Shift (comics)">Red Shift</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardust_%28Marvel_Comics%29_2058.html" title="Stardust (Marvel Comics)">Stardust</a>, decide to fight a war against the Annihilation Wave, while the first herald, the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallen_One_9c29.html" title="Fallen One">Fallen One</a>, carries out its own mission for <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanos.html" title="Thanos">Thanos</a>, another of Marvel's "cosmic" characters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Surfer elects to return to Galactus in order to help protect Galactus from Annihilus's attacks and preserve Galactus's role as a necessary element in the balance of the universe. The Surfer returns to his role as Galactus's herald and easily defeats an entire attacking fleet, as well as the Seekers' leader, "Ravenous," despite Ravenous's claims to be equal to the Surfer due to empowerment with "the opposing force," which is apparently the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negative_Zone_6073.html" title="Negative Zone">Negative Zone</a>'s equivalent of the Power Cosmic. Despite Galactus' insistence, the Surfer refuses to kill Ravenous.</p>
<p>In a side plot, Galactus reveals that the Annihilation Wave's destruction of the <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyln.html" title="Kyln">Kyln</a> may have freed two Galactus-level beings, "Tenebrous" and "Aegis." Thanos, guided by "Skreet," a fairy-like "chaos mite," and by <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Marvel_Comics%29_6774.html" title="Death (Marvel Comics)">Death</a> herself, allies first with Annihilus, then with Tenebrous and Aegis.</p>

<p>This series focuses on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super-Skrull_0e31.html" title="Super-Skrull">Kl'rt, the Super-Skrull's</a> attempts to stop the Annihilation Wave from destroying the planet where his son lives and to come to terms with his own past and nature. It begins with Kl'rt leading a valiant but unsuccessful defense of a Skrull planet from the Annihilation Wave. Kl'rt reflects on his past as one of the Skrull Empire's most powerful and loyal defenders, and on the irony that his many failures (particularly against the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic_Four_3810.html" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a>) have made him a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pariah.html" title="Pariah">pariah</a> within the empire.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Kl'rt and a young Skrull engineer, R'Kin, travel to the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negative_Zone_6073.html" title="Negative Zone">Negative Zone</a> in order to seek a method of stopping the "Harvester of Sorrows," a planet-buster weapon, from destroying Zaragz'Na, the planet which Kl'rt's son lives on. In the Negative Zone, Kl'rt locates "Hawal," the warden of a prison planet and designer of the Harvester. Kl'rt tortures Hawal into designing a virus that can destroy the Harvester and unites the planet's prisoners into an army. Two prisoners that feature particularly prominently are "Praxagora", last survivor of a robotic race, and "Preak," an alien with the ability to duplicate itself.</p>
<p>As Kl'rt's fleet prepares to attack the Harvester, R'Kin volunteers to pilot the ship carrying the virus. Although Kl'rt's fleet fights bravely in order to create a diversion, the virus ship never appears. Disillusioned by the Super-Skrull's savage tactics and resentful over his own father's death in one of Kl'rt's earlier campaigns, R'Kin chose to sell out Kl'rt to the Annihilation Wave, turning the virus over to Annihilus's forces unused. Kl'rt, Praxagora, and Preak are captured, and Zaragz'Na is destroyed.</p>
<p>As R'Kin and the Harvester's commanders mock the captives with the remains of Zaragz'Na, the Super-Skrull uses his rarely employed power of hypnosis to force R'Kin to free the three captives. Preak sacrificies himself holding off pursuers, while Praxagora heads to the center of the Harvester, planning to detonate her core and destroy the weapon at the cost of her own life.</p>
<p>Kl'rt chases and captures R'Kin, who explains that in his opinion, Kl'rt is a ruthless villain who sacrifices other people, such as R'Kin's father. Based on this understanding of the Super-Skrull, R'Kin proposes that the two of them escape from the ship, allow Praxagora to destroy it, then claim credit with the empire as heroes. Instead, the Super-Skrull traps R'Kin, leaving his limbless torso in a ship. R'kin is left to hope that Kl'rt's plans succeed, and kill him. Meanwhile, the Super-Skrull leaves to save Praxagora.</p>
<p>In the ship's core, Kl'rt decides that he will not sacrifice any more people for his cause. Using his powers, he absorbs Praxagora's near-infinite release of energy himself, allowing her time to escape the ship, then releases the energy, destroying the Harvester.</p>
<p>The series ends twenty years after the attack of the Annihilation Wave. In the epilogue, Praxagora is telling Kl'rt's story to a group of young Skrulls and explains that by making his sacrifice to destroy the Harvester of Sorrows, Kl'rt finally had become what he had always wanted to be: a hero.</p>

<p>Ronan lands on Godthab Omega, where he finds an encampment of exiled <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kree.html" title="Kree">Kree</a>, including his old friend Korath, and learns that Tana Nile has joined "The Graces," a group of cosmicly powered women led by <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamora.html" title="Gamora">Gamora</a>. After defeating cosmic characters <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebula_%28comics%29.html" title="Nebula (comics)">Nebula</a> and Stellaris, Ronan ends up in battle against Gamora herself, who has gained the power cosmic since her last appearance. However, their conflict, as well as several others, are actually caused by the manipulation of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorian.html" title="Glorian">Glorian</a>, who is using the energy from their battles to attempt to reshape the world.</p>
<p>Just as Glorian's plan approaches completion, the Annihilation Wave attacks Godthab Omega. Ronan, Korath, Gamora, and Glorian all battle Annihilus's forces, and Tana Nile is killed in the battle, preventing Ronan from proving his innocence. Undeterred, Ronan resolves to return to the Kree, violating his exile to warn them of the coming danger.</p>

<p>205 days after Annihilation Day, <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_%28comics%29.html" title="Nova (comics)">Richard Rider</a> has formed an army, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Front_%28comics%29_9910.html" title="United Front (comics)">United Front</a>, to oppose the Annihilation Wave. His land-based army includes <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drax_the_Destroyer_fe3e.html" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax the Destroyer</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamora.html" title="Gamora">Gamora</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronan_the_Accuser_b627.html" title="Ronan the Accuser">Ronan the Accuser</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star-Lord_4d31.html" title="Star-Lord">Peter Quill</a>, while his outerspace forces consist primarily of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firelord.html" title="Firelord">Firelord</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Shift_%28comics%29_0eef.html" title="Red Shift (comics)">Red Shift</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardust_%28Marvel_Comics%29_2058.html" title="Stardust (Marvel Comics)">Stardust</a>, former <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_of_Galactus_56c6.html" title="Herald of Galactus">Heralds of Galactus</a>. As Rider's ground troops attempt to <a href="../../../w/i/t/Withdrawal_%28military%29.html" title="Withdrawal (military)">retreat</a> under crushing odds, Firelord attacks the enemy command ship, capturing their Queen and causing the enemy forces to collapse in confusion, at the possible cost of his own life. After inspecting Firelord's comatosed body, Rider and Quill question the Queen, who reveals that while the United Front forces fought the Annihilation Wave, Thanos, Tenebrous and Aegis had already attacked Galactus and the Silver Surfer, defeating them both. Believing the Power Cosmic to be within his grasp, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilus.html" title="Annihilus">Annihilus</a> orders his troops to kill the remaining former Heralds of Galactus.</p>
<p>Thanos kidnaps <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondragon.html" title="Moondragon">Moondragon</a> and rips off her ear, which he sends to Drax to warn him that her fate is in his hands. Drax believes that Thanos wants him to stay away or he will kill Moondragon. Drax resolves to kill Thanos for it is his destiny. Meanwhile, Ronan kills some Kree officials who refuse to acknowledge him. Nova fights Ravenous, who returns with a series of others under his control. Annihilus presses Thanos for the result on how the power cosmic can be used biologically, which he will apparently use on Galactus, the Silver Surfer and Morg. Thanos tells him that he will have the answer soon.</p>
<p>Nova and his allies battle the forces of Annihilus; during the conflict a huge energy spike restores the Super-Skrull to his full power. In the aftermath of the battle Nova learns of the conflict on Earth, and he sends out a warning to the heroes about the cosmic conflict, vowing to remain to try to save them all. Drax stays behind the battle lines as he tries to head towards the forces of Thanos to complete his mission once and for all.</p>
<p>Moondragon confronts Thanos, where he reveals his role to Moondragon in the event, telling her that he helped out Annihilus merely to sate his curiosity as to how everything would play out in the end. However, it soon becomes apparent to Thanos that for once he himself has been played for a fool; Annihilus, feigning ignorance of the principles behind Thanos's Power Cosmic draining technology, has instead secretly reverse engineered and reconfigured the massive device into a "Galactus-Bomb" of sorts. If detonated, this will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the universe. In the meanwhile, Drax's mystical homing abilities allow him to home in on Thanos, who through sheer coincidence has come into Drax's sensitivity range. Compelled by his "programming," Drax forces his way onto the Annihliation Wave ship on which Galactus is imprisoned/harnessed and where Thanos is attempting to activate a failsafe he had himself previously built into the device for just such a contingency.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Thanos, his fail-safe is constructed in such a way that he cannot disengage from it once activated, nor can he stop or pause the process once begun, as it could set the Galactus-Bomb off prematurely. As Drax locates and confronts the nearly helpless Thanos, he proceeds to tear through a last ditch, hastily erected force field, and punches straight through Thanos's body, tearing his heart from his chest, as the child <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Marvel_Comics%29_6774.html" title="Death (Marvel Comics)">Death</a> watches.</p>
<p>Drax is now free of the "madness" that has gripped him up until the moment that he successfully killed Thanos, and his daughter Moondragon is at last able to reason with him and inform him of the impending activation of the "Galactus-Bomb;" together they manage to concoct an alternate strategy for freeing Galactus (thereby depriving the Annihliation Wave of its most fearsome weapon since its other weapon, the Harvester of Sorrows, was previously destroyed by the Super-Skrull).In the meantime, Ronan the Accuser, Kl'rt the Super Skrull, and a small band of allies arrive on the homeworld of Kree House Fiyero. In the course of battle, it is quickly revealed that House Fiyero sold out to Ravenous and Annihilus; it was due to these machinations that the Kree Empire did not field nearly as many troops against the Wave as would normally have been expected, since House Fiyero was the <i>de facto</i> ruler of the Kree Empire in the absence of the missing <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Intelligence_5030.html" title="Supreme Intelligence">Supreme Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In a pitched battle, Ronan almost single-handedly defeats not only the 'Royal Guard' of House Fiyero and a small army of Ravenous' minions, but also manages to kill off Ravenous with a single, titanic blow from his cosmi-rod. Finally, after passing judgement on the merchant-ministers of House Fiyero (in short, a "guilty" verdict followed by the vaporization of that entire body), Ronan discovers that the ministers had at some point in time managed to get ahold of the Supreme Intelligence itself, transport it against its will to the Fiyero Homeworld, and render it comatose. Ronan says his goodbyes to the Supremor—apparently incapable of being revived from its undead (essentially mindless) state—and kills it with his weapon. He emerges from the citadel to a massive throng of Kree warriors, who unanimously call on him to become their new emperor.</p>
<p>As these events transpire in Kree space, back on board the Annihilation ship, Drax's gambit appears to pay off; he successfully deduces that Silver Surfer's Power Cosmic—the same cosmic energy being siphoned from Galactus himself and used to imprison him and the Surfer, as well as run the massive planet-destroying device—is the only type of energy substitute that can "fool" Thanos' safeguards. Upon being freed from his prison by Drax, the Surfer in turn lets loose a well-placed, tremendous blast of cosmic energy; almost immediately afterward an angry and seemingly revitalized Galactus is last seen unleashing devastating energies against Annihilus' fleet, destroying the device itself in a matter of moments.</p>
<p>Galactus and the Silver Surfer, freed by Drax from Thanos' prison, emerge from Thanos' starship. Drax and Moondragon are teleported by Galactus to one of the Kree worlds out of harm's way as Galactus proceeds to decimate the Annihilation Wave with the full onslaught of his power. Silver Surfer is sent ahead by Galactus to herald the imminent destruction, which easily vaporizes a Watcher as the unleashed "Galactus obliteration perimeter" wipes out at least three star systems in the process. Nova, Peter Quill and Phyla-Vell have teleported close to Annihilus' flagship and are preparing to make the last jump when Galactus' energy wave arrives. Annihilus, finding that he has been betrayed by Thanos and undone by Galactus, uses Quasar's quantum bands to protect himself from the energy blast.</p>
<p>On the Kree homeworld of Hala, Ravenous' forces begin to attack from the atmosphere, as reports of the Annihilation Wave being destroyed start coming in. The Kree below hear the reports themselves, and begin their own attack on Ravenous' battle ships. The Kree attack comes in the form of entire building complexes that are rocket propelled at Ravenous' forces. Ronan and his Kree battalions join the battle in flight.</p>
<p>As Galactus leaves the destruction of the Annihilation Wave, Annihilus emerges from the wreckage of his flagship. Cursing Galactus, he vows to rebuild his power, but Nova arrives, having survived Galactus' energy wave as well as encasing Peter Quill and Phyla-Vell in an energy bubble. Nova swears to end Annihilus and the two begin a fierce battle. Phyla-Vell attempts to join, but finds that Nova has sealed her and Quill in their bubble, wanting to face Annihilus alone. Using the quantum bands, Annihilus proves to be too much for Nova. Phyla-Vell forces her way out of the bubble and attacks Annihilus, attempting to wrest the quantum bands from him. Annihilus throws her aside, but the quantum bands abandon Annihilus and join with Phyla-Vell. Annihilus fights on, but Nova surmises that the gap in Annihilus' armor is his mouth, forcing his hand down Annihilus' throat and tearing out his insides, yelling "This is for the Nova Corps!!" Both Annihilus and Nova slump to the ground as Nova looks up to see the veiled figures of Thanos and Lady Death looking over him and smiling. Nova tells them "Better luck next time".</p>
<p>The remainder of the story is a summary by Nova to his Nova Corps verbal log explaining the series of events that followed after Galactus was freed and Annihilus was destroyed. Nova recovers from his injuries, and mentions being offered honorary Kree status by Ronan. Ravenous sued for peace after the destruction of the Annihilation Wave. A treaty between his forces and the Kree was signed with Ravenous ceded certain Kree territories and all of the former Skrull Empire in order to end the hostilities. The Silver Surfer returned to Galactus' side, with Galactus' appetite apparently bigger then ever. Firelord begins hunting down the remaining Centurions in a quest to avenge Xandar's destruction and the deaths of his fellow heralds. Super-Skrull, Praxagora and Drax have all disappeared. Phyla-Vell has begun debating on picking up where Quasar left off. Cammi is last seen with Skreet on her shoulder. Nova debates on his future and wonders if he should return home to Earth.</p>
<p>On Kree-Lar, former capital of the Kree Empire, now seat of the territories ceded to Ravenous, Ravenous oversees a birthing by one of Annihilus' Queens. The story ends with Ravenous presenting a reborn Annihilus to the remaining Annihilation Wave.</p>
