<p>Where does the Talamasca fit in? Does it make sense to be a separate page that talks about its purpose and its main characters like Petyr Van Abel and David Talbot or does it make sense to just define it? I wasn't even sure where this belonged so I wanted to get some thoughts.... --<a href="../../../j/p/i/User%7EJpittman_00d7.html" title="User:Jpittman">Jpittman</a> 02:27, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would make sense to make a seperate Talamasca page. Especialy since someone might put in a prank article pretending its real. Like they tried to do with Borges's imaginary land of Tlon. The Talamasca could make a fun article. There is enough to make it long. In my more romantic or crazy moments, I've thought of Wiki as a sort of Talamasca. A loose association of "scholars" working to gather all the information we can even on less respected matters. Accepting all information and loosely filtering it. An open inquirery into all things. We watch and are always there. The character Arron describes the Talamasca along these lines in the Witching Hour to the character Michael Mayfair. I'm just being indulgent. Still fun though to think along these lines. Rice created a complex myth system with the Talamasca which is very rich. It is the perfect kind of alternative history for an article. Tons of characters and events to get into. The Mayfairs should get a seperate page also.--Case 19:17, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know who gets off or got off writing about Mrs. Rice's reputation and popularity being damaged by her post on Amazon. I and the Rice readers I know never even heard about it, so I don't think it was at all a significant event in her writing history. What a few bloggers in their small community might say is not all that relevant to the great number of readers who genuinely enjoyed "Blood Canticle."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I second that. I actually removed the part about where she allegedly had written with bad English.</dd>

<li>Added the link to the reply posted on Amazon.com. I admire Anne for taking a stand - It was certainly long overdue. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrae_dd38.html" title="User:Drae">Drae</a> 09:54, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>...I'm sorry, you say you ADMIRE her for that? It was nothing more than a lengthy, self-indulgent rant, a more literate version of, ironically, many fanfiction-writing teens' old "DUN LEIK, DUN REED!!! H8TRZ!!" rants. Don't get me wrong; her books are... fine. But that little tantrum shows a woman with the vocabulary of an entire dictionary but, alas, all the maturity of a self-important 13-year-old fangirl. Her prose is lovely much of the time, but if I'm to judge by her little "episode" on Amazon, she should stick to novels and leave essay-writing waaaaay alone. I won't comment on how silly it seems to me that she refuses to so much as have an editor LOOK at her work (mostly because I haven't read her most recent, editor-free books, I just happen to know that people should very rarely be allowed to edit their own book completely by themselves, and it strikes me as kind of arrogant to assume one can do it and get consistently good prose), because it's a moot point here. That was NOT the most mature response to criticism that she could have pulled out. Defending your work is fine, but jeez, stop whining just because somebody didn't like your latest novel as much as the rest of them; it's rather uncooth, and not really befitting a reknowned author.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I do think it damaged her reputation, because I've met people that had never read her before, then read that and instantly said they never wanted to bother. Heck, after reading that, I'm inclined NOT to read her later work myself. Granted, I wasn't a diehard fan to begin with, but sheesh. Lord help us if she discovers her own Wikipedia page! /jk</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Seriously, though, folks, do keep in mind though that just because something hurts a reputation does not mean book sales or the quality of her writing will go down. I don't doubt that some people became curious to see what the fuss was all about, and have since bought or read the book to check for themselves. Controversy sells; it's why The Da Dinci Code sold so many copies even with bland characters.</li>

<ul>
<li>Just because you hadn't heard of that post, does not mean it wasn't infamous, though, EliasAlucard. I don't even normally actively look for Anne Rice information, and I still heard whispers of the infamous "Anne Rice Amazon.com tantrum" on other sites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>In any case, though, Drae, while I very much disagree with your opinion on her Amazon comment, I would still like to take the chance to thank you quite sincerely for adding the link.

<dd>The facts remain, that she has written many vampire books, and although a majority of them are within <i>The Vampire Chronicles</i>, not all are. Therefore, it is better suited just to mention that she's famous because of her Vampire books.</dd>
<dd>Second, of course there are a lot more readers of her books that aren't goths or whatever. But it's not everyday an author brings such an impact to the goth-culture because of her/his books. So leave that part as well. I don't know if all of these different but similar IP adresses are from the same person, but I advise you to get a registered account, and sign your names when you're going to discuss something on the talk pages from now on.</dd>

<dd>You idiot. I'm not threatening you. It's not my draft. I haven't written even 20% of this Anne Rice Article. Stop assuming things like you actually knew something. This article is by any means not mine. I do not own it. But as little as it is mine, it's even less yours. You're an anon user. I've got over 2000 edits in my edit history. I'm taking Wikipedia seriously. How many edits have you done? It's a handful, less than 10 edits all in all. Stop reverting, because you're braking the 3-revert-rule. In fact, I've edited this article more than you have edited anything on Wikipedia. If you got something to add, do it (provided that it's true), if you've seen something you know isn't true, remove it. But stop changing everything to the same thing but with different words. You can do that for an entire eternity. The article was fine as it was. Stop reverting it, or else you'll be banned by the ops for a revert war.</dd>

<dd>You go ahead and enjoy your life. Leave Wikipedia to us who don't have one. And if you're going to respond, don't write 59 000 letters just to prove some stupid point. And for the last time, the version with the opening paragraph that you dislike isn't my version. I didn't write that one. It's still better than your shitty version though. My wording of "you better" is a threat? When did I write that anywhere on this talk page? Moron.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, this is a clear sign of how stupid you are: <i>"So for the last time ...she is a popular mainstream writer ...NOT a Goth writer. Much like Bram Stoker is NOT a Goth writer."</i> Nowhere in the article does it state or allege that she is a Goth writer. All it says, is that she's had influence on the goth culture today. There's a clear difference, you stupid idiot. If you can't tell the difference between such simple stuff, then stop editing here altogether. No one wants your help here.</dd>

<p>I have no interest in getting into a revert war over this, and if it's changed again, I'll leave it alone. However, according to annerice.com, her daughter died at 5 <a href="http://www.annerice.com/ac_Biography.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annerice.com/ac_Biography.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in 1972 <a href="http://www.annerice.com/ph20030114.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annerice.com/ph20030114.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I trust this over external third party sites. Being born in 1966 doesn't necessarily mean that she was 6 years old when she died in 1972; it depends on the dates of birth/death. Clearly, she died before her sixth birthday. To further illustrate, I was born in 1978, but I'm 26 years old. At first glance, this may not make sense (since it's 2005, I should be 27, right?). Well, I was born in September, so I'm 26 for two more months, even though this is the 27th year since 1978. I'm guessing that it was a similar situation for Anne Rice's daughter. --<a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">Myles Long/cDc</a> 17:41, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not interested in a revert war either. I just can't take that anonymous user seriously. He changed it to 1971 for instance. I think his IP should be banned. He should use his registered account since he claims he has one. And all of his messages are just confusing. I feel like erasing all of them since they're not making any sense, and they're very incoherent to read... and quite frankly, a waste of time. Anyway, I forgot to add "and" at the age issue.

You, as mentioned is proof positive that this is NOT an open forum.</p>

<dd>Thanks for that one Hall. If she died in 1972, and you changed it to 1971, how could it be my mistake? She was barely 2 months from 6. It never was about pride from my part. Look, I just think that your edits suck. Plain and simple. You come waltzing in here, and act all high and mighty, calling everything about the article bad and stupid, and everyone else too. Then you make changes. Changes I don't like. Then you refuse to login and sign your comments. Do you know how confusing and what kind of chaos all of your messages are? The very fact that you refuse to sign in just to prove a stupid point, proves you to be a hypocrite when you accuse us of pride. Please go away. Stop editing. We don't need you here, really. You're just wasting our time. Also, until next time you're going to accuse me and everyone else of bad English, get this straight: You <b>are</b> equals you're. <i>Your</i> is not the same thing.

<p>I don't think it's good form to reprint her entire response. First off, it interrupts the flow of the article. Second, reproductions of text normally go on Wikisource. Third, we don't own the copyright. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 01:44, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with this; however, as someone just re-added the Amazon letter, perhaps we should open it up to discussion so that we have some consensus and don't get into an edit war. Any other opinions? I'll delete the letter again in a few days if people don't generally think that we should keep it. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 19:13, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for the long wait before a reply... I somehow missed your post.&#160;:( Anyway, if you can make an argument that Quadell's concerns aren't valid (or aren't sufficiently valid enough to warrant the removal of the text), people may be willing to consider reinstating the text. Objection number three is the most important -- if you can't prove that copyright is in the public domain, whether or not it interrupts the article's flow to have the text of the letter in there is a moot point. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 23:07, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Linking is fine, since it's not a violation of copyright to link to something, and I do think that it's worth it to make the text accessible -- I just agree with Quadell's thoughts on putting the actual text in the article. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 23:07, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where did Anne Rice deny trying LSD? The original reference came from an interview. Is she trying to deny a previous admission? <i>After smoking marijuana and experimenting with LSD for about a year Anne had a disturbing vision. She began wondering what happens when a person dies and if that person knows they are dead.</i> --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 06:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was curious about the above comment, since the current page no longer has any mention of LSD, so went trawling back through the History to check. A quick googling shows that the connection has been widespread, but does anyone know the truth? Is it that she previously admitting to it, but has now back-tracked, or is it that she never said anything of the sort, but finally "denied" years of third-party speculation. To be honest, I've always thought that "seeing through a vampire's eyes" is more akin to MDMA use, but then even that could just have been speculated from someone who had never used it, having read enough reports from people who had. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 21:52, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe she began writing the Vampire Chronicles after the death of her daughter, but I don't have any source to back it up. If anybody can provide such source, then I believe a sentence or paragraph should be added in the "The Vampire Chronicles" section mentioning such.--<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandridge_62cd.html" title="User:Sandridge">Sandridge</a> 01:11, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>See "Prism of the Night - A biography of Anne Rice" by Katherine Ramsland. Anne Rice began writing "Interview with the Vampire" some months after her daughter's death, rewriting an old short story of the same title which she had written some years before. However, at this time she did not intend to write a whole series.</p>

<p>I question the source of the following statement, "It has been rumoured that the second film's theatrical release was based solely on its producers' wish to capitalize on the death of Aaliyah." What is the source of this rumor? Perhaps it just isn't explained well, but obviously the producers planned on releasing the film or they wouldn't have produced it, and production obviously began before Aaliyah's death since she is in the movie. I'd like to remove this sentence altogether, but thought I'd see what other people thought first.--<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandridge_62cd.html" title="User:Sandridge">Sandridge</a> 01:11, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does she currently reside in La Jolla or somewhere in the Coachella Valley? La Jolla is on the coast, and not even particularly close to the Coachella Valley, which is in the desert.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anne Rice has recently left La Jolla and has moved to Rancho Mirage, a desert community.

<p>I've removed a comment about her reply in amazon.com being "a single unbroken paragraph". I suspect this is entirely due to the limitations of the amazon interface, which converted her newlines into spaces. Toby Douglass 18:03, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having just read this article for the first time, it seems to me that the sections on diabetes and her relocation could be rolled into the biographical section. I feel it interrupts the flow of the article to have these sections intermingled with sections on her books and her responses to critics/fans. Just a thought. --GentlemanGhost 10:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

From the section, one would think that she was renouncing writing about vampires because she'd become a Catholic. In fact, she kept writing about vampires after her conversion, her post doesn't really address the religious question, and she seems to be saying that she's glad the Chronicles are over because some fans are giving her a hard time about her not writing the way they want her to. I'm thinking that sentence should be cut. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 19:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to know about where &amp; when Anne Rice's fans started becoming disheartened with the series &amp; what went wrong. (I know that Memnoc was a huge dissapointment &amp; that the gay &amp; yaoi fans concidered either Merrick or Blood &amp; Gold to be "the final straw." &amp; even just information on the changes in her website over the years (easily accessed by inputting her html in at archive.org) &amp; maybe the comic addaptions of her books from America &amp; Japan (there's an official manga &amp; loads of doujinshi).</p>
