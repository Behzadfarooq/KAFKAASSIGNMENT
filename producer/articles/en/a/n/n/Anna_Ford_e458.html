<p>Anna Ford's parents were both <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_theatre_47e0.html" title="West End theatre">West End</a> actors, with her father having declined an offer from <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Goldwyn_4013.html" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> to work in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. He later decided to become a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>, and took Anna and her four brothers to live at <a href="../../../e/s/k/Eskdale%2C_Cumbria_73f2.html" title="Eskdale, Cumbria">Eskdale</a> in the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_District_79ed.html" title="Lake District">Lake District</a>. She went to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_school.html" title="Primary school">primary school</a> at St. Ursula's School, <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigton.html" title="Wigton">Wigton</a>.</p>
<p>Ford studied <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">Economics</a> at the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_University_of_Manchester_bd2e.html" title="Victoria University of Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a> and was president of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Manchester_Students%27_Union_3970.html" title="University of Manchester Students' Union">students' union</a> in 1966. After a failed marriage to Dr Alan Bittles and a spell as an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_University_3bc9.html" title="Open University">Open University</a> tutor, Anna Ford was 30 by the time she joined <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada_Television_60a4.html" title="Granada Television">Granada Television</a> as a researcher in 1974, being told she was too old to be a newsreader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1471987.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1471987.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> She joined the BBC in 1976, and worked on <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomorrow%27s_World_0c78.html" title="Tomorrow's World">Tomorrow's World</a></i> in 1977.</p>
<p>In 1978 she moved to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Television_News_3c84.html" title="Independent Television News">ITN</a>, becoming the network's first female newsreader. Fellow newsreader <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Bosanquet_b8ce.html" title="Reginald Bosanquet">Reginald Bosanquet</a> was inspired to write poetry for her: <i>I prayed, I vowed, that I'd be good; and many people thought I would; but then I got my just reward; 18 nights with Anna Ford</i> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1471987.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1471987.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Ford helped ITN to launch <i><a href="../../../t/v/-/TV-am_113e.html" title="TV-am">TV-am</a></i> in 1981, with its original high-brow "mission to explain". But with fierce competition from the BBC's casually styled <i>Breakfast Time</i>, TV-am was re-launched in a perceived "dumbing-down" of the station. Ford was involved in a notable incident, in which she threw her wine over <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Aitken_6239.html" title="Jonathan Aitken">Jonathan Aitken</a> to express her outrage over his involvement in the unwelcome transformation.</p>
<p>She rejoined the BBC in 1986, becoming part of the presentation team for both <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One's</a> <i><a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Six_O%27Clock_News_a70b.html" title="BBC Six O'Clock News">Six O'Clock News</a></i> and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_4_eb17.html" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a> <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/Today_programme.html" title="Today programme">Today</a></i> programme in 1989. From 1999 she fronted the re-launched lunchtime <i><a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_O%27Clock_News_e94c.html" title="BBC One O'Clock News">One O'Clock News</a></i>. In February 2003, Ford experienced one of her more challenging broadcasts when she lost her voice live on-air. She had to resort to drinking water on air, and the decision in the end had to be taken to replace Ford with the available <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Raworth_9949.html" title="Sophie Raworth">Sophie Raworth</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Ford announced her plans to retire from broadcasting in April 2006 in order to pursue other interests while she <i>still has the interest and energy</i> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4390160.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4390160.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> She also talked tough on ageism, stating: <i>I might have been shovelled off into <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_24_e203.html" title="BBC News 24">News 24</a> to the sort of graveyard shift, and I wouldn't have wanted to do that because it wouldn't have interested me.

<p>Ford was always a thoroughly professional newsreader, thought of as both a male fantasy figure due to her good looks and also a feminist icon due to her determined progress in a previously all-male world, with Sir <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Day_e50a.html" title="Robin Day">Robin Day</a> once commenting that: <i>all men wanted to sleep with Anna Ford</i> - even though Ford's feisty personality and pleasure in speaking her mind had meant Ford had previously pushed him into a bush. Her love of academic study, and the writing of a book <i>Men - a documentary</i> in 1985 have given her a rather prim and aloof public reputation, at odds with her actual character.</p>

<p>Ford, under her newsreader image, has always had a sense of theatre, fun and self-humour. As a student she toured Manchester's nightclub sets with a guitar for £5 a night, and always wished she could still be a nightclub singer, saying: <i>You only have one life and it isn't a rehearsal. You may as well have fun.</i></p>
<p>She turned down the chance of a part in the film <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chariots_of_Fire_e5ad.html" title="Chariots of Fire">Chariots of Fire</a></i>, but in 1983 her duet with <a href="../../../n/o/d/Noddy_Holder_51b7.html" title="Noddy Holder">Noddy Holder</a>, a cover version of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakin%27_Stevens_c037.html" title="Shakin' Stevens">Shakin' Stevens</a> hit "You Drive Me Crazy", reached number 37 in the UK pop charts (<a href="http://lifestyle.uk.msn.com/celebrity/article.aspx?cp-documentid=558667" class="external autonumber" title="http://lifestyle.uk.msn.com/celebrity/article.aspx?cp-documentid=558667" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/28/nford28.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/04/28/ixnewstop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/28/nford28.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/04/28/ixnewstop.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006190555,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006190555,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>). She also appeared on the BBC's <i>Stars Sing the Beatles</i>, with her version of "<a href="../../../h/e/r/Here%2C_There_and_Everywhere_19e7.html" title="Here, There and Everywhere">Here, There and Everywhere</a>". In December 2005 she was a guest presenter of <i><a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_I_Got_News_For_You_715d.html" title="Have I Got News For You">Have I Got News For You</a></i> - even though team captain <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hislop_1212.html" title="Ian Hislop">Ian Hislop</a>'s publication <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Eye_4f62.html" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i> had appraised her as a 'talented autocue reader' on her retirement</p>
<p>She has stated that her biggest regret is having turned down repeated invitations to appear on the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morecambe_and_Wise_76d7.html" title="Morecambe and Wise">Morecambe and Wise</a> Show.</p>

<p>Ford had an early marriage to Dr Alan Bittles dissolved before her television career, and in the late 1970's she was briefly engaged to TV news <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchorman.html" title="Anchorman">anchorman</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Snow_c163.html" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> <a href="http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/012705/r012705_01.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/012705/r012705_01.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> She then married newspaper cartoonist Marc Boxer, with whom she had two daughters Claire and Kate, before he died of a brain tumour in 1988 at their home in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Sussex_9ac8.html" title="East Sussex">East Sussex</a>.</p>
<p>But it is the price of celebrity and the safety of her daughters that causes her concern, and partly resulted in her presentational style. In September 1999 she was involved in an incident when a man broke his way into the BBC newsroom at <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_White_City_04d4.html" title="BBC White City">White City</a>, while in 2000 a stalker, later jailed, turned up at Ford's home at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentford.html" title="Brentford">Brentford</a>. She has also been constantly plagued by threatening letters from <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazis</a>, for no other reason than she once read an article on the news that they objected to.</p>
<p>She was then briefly engaged in 2003 to former Astronaut <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Scott_6b67.html" title="David Scott">David Scott</a>, with whom she was photographed. Ford briefly became the subject of, rather than the reader of, news stories in August 2001, when she lost a high profile court case. She claimed unsuccessfully that photographs of her in a bikini with David Scott taken by a press photographer in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majorca.html" title="Majorca">Majorca</a> with a powerful <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoom_lens.html" title="Zoom lens">zoom lens</a> and published in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_newspapers_in_the_United_Kingdom_4d98.html" title="List of newspapers in the United Kingdom">British media</a> constituted an invasion of her privacy <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1471987.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1471987.stm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
