<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Bassett_0327.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Bassett was born to Herb Bassett and Elizabeth Chamberlain Bassett near <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browns_Park_%28Colorado%29_01d4.html" title="Browns Park (Colorado)">Browns Park</a>, but in <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>, the second of two daughters, her sister Josie being born in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>. Herb Bassett was twenty years senior to Elizabeth Chamberlain Bassett, and the couple moved to Browns Park some time around the early <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a>.</p>
<p>Herb Bassett had a profitable <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a> ranch which straddled both Utah and <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and partly in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and often did business with notable outlaws of the era, such as <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Cassidy_581d.html" title="Butch Cassidy">Butch Cassidy</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kid_Curry_860b.html" title="Kid Curry">Kid Curry</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Ketchum_65bb.html" title="Tom Ketchum">Black Jack Ketchum</a>, selling them horses and beef for supplies. Both Ann and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josie_Bassett_2c48.html" title="Josie Bassett">Josie Bassett</a> were attractive young women, well taught by their father in the arts of horse riding, roping, and shooting. Both were educated early on in prominent boarding schools, and were intelligent and articulate in their speech, but both chose to return to the life of ranching.</p>
<p>By the time Ann Bassett was 15, she had become involved romantically with Butch Cassidy. Her sister, Josie, also dated members of the gang, to include <a href="../../../e/l/z/Elzy_Lay_d117.html" title="Elzy Lay">Elzy Lay</a>. Outlaws <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Kilpatrick_8dc9.html" title="Ben Kilpatrick">Ben Kilpatrick</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carver_%28Wild_Bunch%29_ce21.html" title="William Carver (Wild Bunch)">Will "News" Carver</a>, who were both later members of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Bunch_39a9.html" title="Wild Bunch">Wild Bunch</a> gang, also dated the sisters. It was through these associations that Bassett was first exposed to the outlaw life.</p>
<p><a name="Outlaw_life" id="Outlaw_life"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Bassett_0327.html" title="Edit section: Outlaw life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Outlaw life</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, several cattle barons in the area made attempts to purchase the Bassett ranch from the Bassett's. When they refused, several began to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustle.html" title="Rustle">rustle</a> their cattle. Ann Bassett and her sister Josie in turn rustled cattle from the opposing cattle barons. This led to a <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feud.html" title="Feud">feud</a>, and resulted in the cattlemen bringing in <i>killer for hire</i> <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Horn_b544.html" title="Tom Horn">Tom Horn</a> to deal with what the wealthy cattlemen deemed to be rustlers. Horn did eliminate several known rustlers during that time, and later he did kill two known rustlers who were known to be associated with the Bassett family, Islam Dart and Matt Rush, in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>. However, Horn did not take any actions against the Bassett's, and his killing of Dart and Rush was due to another matter unrelated to the Bassett issue.</p>
<p>By 1896, Josie Bassett was heavily involved in a relationship with Elzy Lay, Cassidy's closest friend. Josie had also became involved with Cassidy shortly after his release from an eighteen month prison sentence, during which time Ann was involved with Ben Kilpatrick. When Elzy Lay began a relationship with a woman named Maude Davis, Josie became involved with Will "News" Carver, and Ann returned to her involvement with Cassidy. Through their relationships with the outlaws, and in exchange for their supplying the outlaws with beef and fresh horses from their ranch, the two sisters were in a position to get assistance from Cassidy and his gang in dealing with certain cattlemen who were pressuring them to sell.</p>
<p>This association was a deterrent that kept cowboys hired to harass the sisters from doing so, for fear of retribution from the outlaws. There was even one report that Kid Curry, easily the most feared member of the Wild Bunch gang, once paid a visit to several cowboys known to be employed by the cattlemen, warning them to leave the Bassett's alone. That cannot be confirmed, but although the problems with the wealthy cattlemen's association continued well into <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>, by late <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a> the problems were rare, and there was little pressure placed on the sisters to sell their ranch. Despite the seemingly constant changes in romantic partners by both the Bassett sisters and the gang members, there is no report of there ever being any animosity as a result of this, and it seemed to simply be the accepted way that things were.</p>
<p>Although both sisters were taking part in the fight against the powerful cattlemen's associations, it was Ann that had became best known, and newspapers as well as friends had dubbed her "Queen Ann Bassett". In early <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>, Bassett joined Cassidy at "Robbers Roost". Elzy Lay, having ended his relationship with Josie Bassett, joined them with his girlfriend Maude Davis. According to reports of the day, Bassett and Davis were two of only five women ever allowed into the "Robbers Roost" hideout, the other three being Josie Bassett, the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundance_Kid_26e0.html" title="Sundance Kid">Sundance Kids</a> girlfriend <a href="../../../e/t/t/Etta_Place_3569.html" title="Etta Place">Etta Place</a>, and Wild Bunch gang member <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Bullion_7b81.html" title="Laura Bullion">Laura Bullion</a>.</p>
<p>By April, 1897, the two women were sent home so Cassidy and his gang could concentrate on their next robbery. Cassidy would continue his romantic involvement with Bassett off and on for another four years, seeing her whenever he was near her ranch. The total length of their relationship was around seven years, but was interrupted often with his being away, and for an eighteen month period when he was in prison starting in 1894, during which time she was involved with Ben Kilpatrick.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> Bassett had married a rancher by the name of Henry Bernard. Shortly after the marriage, she was arrested for cattle rustling. She stood <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial.html" title="Trial">trial</a>, but was <a href="../../../a/c/q/Acquitted.html" title="Acquitted">acquitted</a> and released. The marriage lasted six years, ending in divorce, with Bernard helping Bassett and her sister Josie in maintaining their ranch.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Bassett_0327.html" title="Edit section: Bassett girls in later life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bassett girls in later life</span></h2>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, most of the outlaws associated with the Bassett Girls were either dead or had been captured by lawmen. Ann Bassett never saw Cassidy again after he first departed for South America. Josie Bassett is alleged to have been involved off and on with Will Carver until he was killed by lawmen in 1901. Several other outlaws from lesser known gangs drifted in and out of the ranch, usually visiting only to obtain beef or fresh horses, and have a place to stay for a few days. Elzy Lay reportedly visited the ranch again in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, shortly after his release from prison, before moving on to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> where he lived out the remainder of his life as a respectable businessman. Herb Bassett died on July 30, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>.</p>
<p>Ann Bassett remarried in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> to cattleman Frank Willis. The couple remained in Utah, where they began ranching, and where she remained for the rest of her life. Willis reportedly loved her dearly, and the two worked closely together in their business. Before she died, she requested that she be cremated, and that her remains be spread across her birthplace in northern Utah. However, Willis is alleged to have grieved greatly over her death, and was unable to complete that task, keeping her ashes in his car for the remainder of his life. When he died in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, their family buried Ann Bassett's ashes in an undisclosed location in Browns Park.</p>
<p>Josie Bassett lived most of her life on her fathers property, operating the ranch, and choosing a mostly outdoor life, with camping, fishing and hunting being her primary hobbies. She eventually moved, in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, to a homestead near <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernal%2C_Utah_d811.html" title="Vernal, Utah">Vernal, Utah</a>, where she began ranching. Josie was romantically linked to many outlaws of the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, and some prominent men of the early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, and married five times. During the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> she became well known for supplying beef at no cost to families in need during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. She also <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rum-running.html" title="Rum-running">bootlegged</a> <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a> during that time. In later life she was described as a reclusive eccentric, often talking to neighbors about the days of excitement in her youth.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Bassett_0327.html" title="Edit section: The alleged Ann Bassett-Etta Place connection">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The alleged Ann Bassett-Etta Place connection</span></h2>
<p>Ann Bassett has often been accused of having actually been <a href="../../../e/t/t/Etta_Place_3569.html" title="Etta Place">Etta Place</a>, the girlfriend of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundance_Kid_26e0.html" title="Sundance Kid">Sundance Kid</a>, and who mysteriously disappeared from all public records in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> not long after his death. According to the reports, Bassett had led a double life, dating Cassidy as <i>Ann Bassett</i>, and dating the Sundance Kid as <i>Etta Place</i>. Some speculation even indicates that she was involved with both outlaws at the same time, of course with their full knowledge, and that by <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, when in their company, she simply went by the name of Etta Place.</p>
<p>However, although they were likely close in age, the dates do not match up when comparing Place's time in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. At the time, there are documented instances showing Bassett to have been in Wyoming and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency_cc8a.html" title="Pinkerton National Detective Agency">Pinkerton</a> reports give almost identical descriptions of both women, listing both with classic good looks, articulate speech and intelligence, the same hair color, describing both as being good with a rifle and riding a horse, and describing both as being <a href="../../../p/r/o/Promiscuous.html" title="Promiscuous">promiscuous</a> with both having taken several lovers. Author and researcher Doris Karren Barton indicates in her <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> book, <i>"Queen Ann Bassett: Alias Etta Place"</i> that often when Bassett is absent from historical records, Place is actively traveling with Cassidy and the Sundance Kid/Harry Longabaugh, and when Place is absent from historical records, Bassett is visible.</p>
<p>However, Barton excludes the fact that when Place was most definitely in South America with Cassidy and Longabaugh in 1903, Bassett was most definitely under arrest for cattle rustling in Utah, and recently married. Place had without a doubt departed for South America with Longabaugh in August, 1902, not to return to the United States, specifically <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, until the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>. Bassett was most definitely married, incarcerated, tried, and released over a span of several months in 1903.</p>
<p>When comparing the only legitimate photograph of Place with the best photograph of Bassett, the two women do look similar. Both are pretty, with similar facial features, hair color, and physical build. However, most <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historian.html" title="Historian">Historians</a> discount the claims, and they were actually two separate people, not one in the same. Ann Bassett and Etta Place definitely knew one another, and were alleged to have been at the "Robbers Roost" hideout at the same time on more than one occasion, but they were not the same person.</p>
<p>It is more likely, although also prone to inconsistencies, that Etta Place could have actually been a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothel.html" title="Brothel">brothel</a> owner named <a href="../../../e/u/n/Eunice_Gray_47d5.html" title="Eunice Gray">Eunice Gray</a>, who established that business in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth%2C_Texas_7bf1.html" title="Fort Worth, Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a> around 1909. Gray died in a fire in 1962. Prior to that, there were at least two people who could have confirmed as to whether Place was in fact Eunice Gray. Female Wild Bunch gang member <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Bullion_7b81.html" title="Laura Bullion">Laura Bullion</a> was one. She died in 1961. The last known person who actually knew Etta Place, and who could have confirmed as to whether Eunice Gray actually was Etta Place was Ann's sister, Josie, who died in 1963. There are no indications that she was ever asked to do so.</p>
