<p>Born in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, he was the youngest son of Michel-Etienne Turgot, "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost_%28civil%29.html" title="Provost (civil)">Provost</a> of the merchants" of Paris, and Madeleine Francoise Martineau de Brétignolles, and came of an old <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Norman</a> family. He was educated for the Church, and at the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_Sorbonne_0c67.html" title="Collège de Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>, to which he was admitted in <a href="../../../1/7/4/1749.html" title="1749">1749</a> (being then styled <i>abbé de Brucourt</i>). He delivered two remarkable <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> dissertations, <i>On the Benefits which the Christian Religion has conferred on Mankind</i>, and <i>On the Historical Progress of the Human Mind</i>. The first sign we have of his interest in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a> is a letter (1749) on <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banknote.html" title="Banknote">paper money</a>, written to his fellow student the abbé de Cicé, refuting the abbé Terrasson's defence of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Law_%28economist%29_f11c.html" title="John Law (economist)">John Law</a>'s system. He was fond of verse-making, and tried to introduce into <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> verse the rules of Latin prosody, his translation of the fourth book of the <i><a href="../../../a/e/n/Aeneid.html" title="Aeneid">Aeneid</a></i> into classical <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexameter.html" title="Hexameter">hexameter</a> verses being greeted by <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> as the only prose translation in which he had found any enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In 1750 he decided not to take holy orders, giving as his reason, according to <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Samuel_du_Pont_de_Nemours_3eb7.html" title="Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours">Dupont de Nemours</a>, "that he could not bear to wear a mask all his life."</p>

<p>In 1752 he became <i>substitut</i>, and later <i>conseiller</i> in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parlement_of_Paris_b100.html" title="Parlement of Paris">parlement of Paris</a>, and in 1753 <i><a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/Ma%C3%AEtre_des_requ%C3%AAtes.html" title="Maître des requêtes">maître des requêtes</a></i>. In 1754 he was a member of the <i>chambre royale</i> which sat during an exile of the <i>parlement</i>. In Paris he frequented the salons, especially those of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7oise_d%27Issembourg_d%27Happoncourt%2C_Madame_de_Graffigny_7f38.html" title="Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny">Mme de Graffigny</a>—whose niece, Mlle de Ligniville ("Minette"), afterwards <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Adrien_Helv%C3%A9tius_c5ef.html" title="Claude Adrien Helvétius">Mme Helvétius</a> and his lifelong friend, he is supposed at one time to have wished to marry—<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_Rodet_Geoffrin_4eec.html" title="Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin">Mme Geoffrin</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Anne_de_Vichy-Chamrond%2C_marquise_du_Deffand_807a.html" title="Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand">Mme du Deffand</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanne_Julie_Eleonore_de_Lespinasse_6a8f.html" title="Jeanne Julie Eleonore de Lespinasse">Mlle de Lespinasse</a> and the duchesse d'Enville. It was during this period that he met the leaders of the "<a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiocrat.html" title="Physiocrat">physiocratic</a>" school, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francois_Quesnay_bda9.html" title="Francois Quesnay">Quesnay</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_de_Gournay_4cf6.html" title="Vincent de Gournay">Vincent de Gournay</a>, and with them Dupont de Nemours, the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Morellet_6fa8.html" title="André Morellet">abbé Morellet</a> and other economists.</p>
<p>In 1755 and 1756 he accompanied in his tours of inspection in the provinces Gournay, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intendant.html" title="Intendant">intendant</a> of commerce, whose bye-word on the government's proper involvement in the economy, <i>"<a href="../../../l/a/i/Laissez_faire.html" title="Laissez faire">laisser faire, laisser passer</a>"</i>, would pass into the vocabulary of economics. In 1760, while travelling in the east of France and Switzerland, he visited <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, who became one of his chief friends and supporters. All this time he was studying various branches of science, and languages both ancient and modern. In 1753 he translated the <i>Questions sur le commerce</i> from the English of Josias Tucker, and in 1754 he wrote his <i>Lettre sur la tolérance civile</i>, and a pamphlet, <i>Le Conciliateur</i>, in support of religious tolerance. Between 1755 and 1756 he composed various articles for the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A9die.html" title="Encyclopédie">Encyclopédie</a></i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, and between 1757 and 1760 an article on <i>Valeurs des monnaies</i>, probably for the <i>Dictionnaire du commerce</i> of the abbé Morellet. In 1759 appeared his <i>Eloge de Gournay</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot%2C_Baron_de_Laune_866a.html" title="Edit section: Intendant of Limoges, 1761-74">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Intendant of Limoges, 1761-74</span></h2>
<p>In August 1761 Turgot was appointed <i>intendant</i> of the genéralité of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limoges.html" title="Limoges">Limoges</a>, which included some of the poorest and most over-taxed parts of France; here he remained for thirteen years. He was already deeply imbued with the theories of Quesnay and Gournay, and set to work to apply them as far as possible in his province. His first plan was to continue the work, already initiated by his predecessor Tourny, of making a fresh survey of the land (<a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadastre.html" title="Cadastre">cadastre</a>), in order to arrive at a more just assessment of the <i><a href="../../../t/a/i/Taille.html" title="Taille">taille</a></i>; he also obtained a large reduction in the contribution of the province. He published his <i>Avis sur l'assiette et la repartition de la taille</i> (1762–1770), and as president of the <i>Société d'agriculture de Limoges</i> offered prizes for essays on the principles of taxation. Quesnay and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor%C3%A9_Mirabeau_e584.html" title="Honoré Mirabeau">Mirabeau</a> had advocated a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_tax.html" title="Flat tax">proportional tax</a> (<i>impôt de quotité</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>), but Turgot proposed a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_tax.html" title="Progressive tax">distributive tax</a> (<i>impôt de repartition</i>). Another reform was the substitution for the <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Corv%C3%A9e.html" title="Corvée">corvée</a></i> of a tax in money levied on the whole province, the construction of roads being handed over to contractors, by which means Turgot was able to leave his province with a good system of highways, while distributing more justly the expense of their construction.</p>
<p>In 1769 he wrote his <i>Mémoire sur les prêts à intérêt</i>, on the occasion of a scandalous financial crisis at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angoul%C3%AAme.html" title="Angoulême">Angoulême</a>, the particular interest of which is that in it the question of lending <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> at <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interest.html" title="Interest">interest</a> was for the first time treated scientifically, and not merely from the ecclesiastical point of view. Turgot's opinion was that a compromise had to be reached between both methods. Among other works written during Turgot's intendancy were the <i>Mémoire sur les mines et carrières</i>, and the <i>Mémoire sur la marque des fers</i>, in which he protested against state regulation and interference and advocated free competition. At the same time he did much to encourage agriculture and local industries, among others establishing the manufacture of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limoges_porcelain.html" title="Limoges porcelain">porcelain at Limoges</a>. During the famine of 1770–1771 he enforced on landowners "the obligation of relieving the poor" and especially the <i>métayers</i> dependent upon them, and organized in every province <i>ateliers</i> and <i>bureaux de charité</i> for providing work for the able-bodied and relief for the infirm, while at the same time he condemned indiscriminate <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_%28virtue%29.html" title="Charity (virtue)">charity</a>. It may be noted that Turgot always made the curés the agents of his charities and reforms when possible. It was in 1770 that he wrote his famous <i>Lettres sur la liberté du commerce des grains</i>, addressed to the controller-general, the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Marie_Terray_b6d6.html" title="Joseph Marie Terray">abbé Terray</a>. Three of these letters have disappeared, having been sent to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI</a> by Turgot at a later date and never recovered, but those remaining demonstrate that <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a> in grain is to the interest of landowner, farmer and consumer alike, and in too forcible terms demand the removal of all restrictions.</p>

<p>Turgot's best known work, <a href="http://fare.tunes.org/books/Turgot/refl_fdr.html" class="external text" title="http://fare.tunes.org/books/Turgot/refl_fdr.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses</i></a> (<a href="http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/turgot/reflecti" class="external text" title="http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/turgot/reflecti" rel="nofollow"><i>Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth</i></a>), was written early in the period of his intendancy, ostensibly for the benefit of two young Chinese students.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Written in 1766, it appeared in 1769–1770 in Dupont's journal, the <i>Ephémérides du citoyen</i>, and was published separately in 1776. Dupont, however, made various alterations in the text, in order to bring it more into accordance with Quesnay's doctrines, which led to a coolness between him and Turgot.</p>
<p>In the <i>Réflexions</i>, after tracing the origin of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">commerce</a>, Turgot develops Quesnay's theory that the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_%28economics%29.html" title="Land (economics)">land</a> is the only source of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">wealth</a>, and divides society into three classes, the productive or agricultural, the salaried (the <i>classe stipendice</i>) or artisan class, and the land-owning class (<i>classe disponible</i>). After discussing the evolution of the different systems of cultivation, the nature of exchange and barter, money, and the functions of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a>, he sets forth the theory of the <i>impôt unique</i>, i.e. that only the net product (<i>produit net</i>) of the land should be taxed. In addition he demanded the complete freedom of commerce and industry.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot%2C_Baron_de_Laune_866a.html" title="Edit section: Turgot as minister, 1774-76">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Turgot as minister, 1774-76</span></h2>
<p>Turgot owed his appointment as minister of the navy in July 1774 to <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Ph%C3%A9lypeaux%2C_comte_de_Maurepas_d0c7.html" title="Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas">Maurepas</a>, the "Mentor" of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_of_France_d0a6.html" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XVI</a>, to whom he was warmly recommended by the abbé Very, a mutual friend. His appointment met with general approval, and was hailed with enthusiasm by the <i>philosophes</i>. A month later (24 August) he was appointed comptroller-general. His first act was to submit to the king a statement of his guiding principles: "No bankruptcy, no increase of taxation, no borrowing." Turgot's policy, in face of the desperate financial position, was to enforce the most rigid economy in all departments. All departmental expenses were to be submitted for the approval of the comptroller-general, a number of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinecure.html" title="Sinecure">sinecures</a> were suppressed, the holders of them being compensated, and the abuse of the <i>acquits au comptant</i> was attacked, while Turgot appealed personally to the king against the lavish giving of places and pensions. He also contemplated a thorough-going reform of the <i><a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferme_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_f685.html" title="Ferme Générale">Ferme Générale</a></i>, but contented himself, as a beginning, with imposing certain conditions on the leases as they were renewed—such as a more efficient personnel, and the abolition for the future of the abuse of the <i>croupes</i> (the name given to a class of pensions), a reform which Terray had shirked on finding how many persons in high places were interested in them, and annulling certain leases, such as those of the manufacture of gunpowder and the administration of the royal mails, the former of which was handed over to a company with the scientist <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lavoisier.html" title="Lavoisier">Lavoisier</a> as one of its advisers, and the latter superseded by a quicker and more comfortable service of <i>diligences</i> which were nicknamed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach.html" title="Stagecoach"><i>"turgotines"</i></a>. He also prepared a regular budget. Turgot's measures succeeded in considerably reducing the deficit, and raised the national credit to such an extent that in 1776, just before his fall, he was able to negotiate a loan with some <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> bankers at 4%; but the deficit was still so large as to prevent him from attempting at once to realize his favourite scheme of substituting for indirect taxation a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_value_tax.html" title="Land value tax">single tax on land</a>. He suppressed, however, a number of <i><a href="../../../o/c/t/Octroi.html" title="Octroi">octrois</a></i> and minor duties, and opposed, on grounds of economy, the participation of France in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, though without success.</p>
<p>Turgot at once set to work to establish free trade in grain, but his edict, which was signed on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">13 September</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a>, met with strong opposition even in the <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conseil_du_roi.html" title="Conseil du roi">conseil du roi</a></i>. A striking feature was the preamble, setting forth the doctrines on which the edict was based, which won the praise of the <i>philosophes</i> and the ridicule of the wits; this Turgot rewrote three times, it is said, in order to make it "so clear that any village judge could explain it to the peasants." The opposition to the edict was strong. Turgot was hated by those who had been interested in the speculations in grain under the regime of the abbé Terray, among whom were included some of the princes of the blood. Moreover, the <i>commerce des blés</i> had been a favourite topic of the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon_%28gathering%29.html" title="Salon (gathering)">salons</a> for some years past, and the witty <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinando_Galiani_90ff.html" title="Ferdinando Galiani">Galiani</a>, the opponent of the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiocrats.html" title="Physiocrats">physiocrats</a>, had a large following. The opposition was now continued by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon-Nicholas_Henri_Linguet_79dd.html" title="Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet">Linguet</a> and by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Necker_aac9.html" title="Jacques Necker">Necker</a>, who in 1775 published his <i>Essai sur la législation et le commerce des grains</i>. But Turgot's worst enemy was the poor harvest of 1774, which led to a slight rise in the price of bread in the winter and early spring of 1774 - 1775. In April disturbances arose at <a href="../../../d/i/j/Dijon.html" title="Dijon">Dijon</a>, and early in May took place those extraordinary bread-riots known as the <i>guerre des farines</i>, which may be looked upon as a first sample of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, so carefully were they organized. Turgot showed great firmness and decision in repressing the riots, and was loyally supported by the king throughout. His position was strengthened by the entry of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillaume-Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Lamoignon_de_Malesherbes_fe12.html" title="Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes">Malesherbes</a> into the ministry (July 1775).</p>
<p>All this time Turgot had been preparing his famous <i>Six Edicts</i>, which were finally presented to the <i>conseil du roi</i> (January 1776). Of the six edicts four were of minor importance, but the two which met with violent opposition were, firstly, the edict suppressing the <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Corv%C3%A9e.html" title="Corvée">corvées</a></i>, and secondly, that suppressing the <i>jurandes</i> and <i>maîtrises</i>, by which the craft <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild.html" title="Guild">guilds</a> maintained their privileges. In the preamble to the former Turgot boldly announced as his object the abolition of privilege, and the subjection of all three <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estates_of_the_realm.html" title="Estates of the realm">Estates of the realm</a> to taxation; the clergy were afterwards excepted, at the request of Maurepas. In the preamble to the edict on the <i>jurandes</i> he laid down as a principle the right of every man to work without restriction. He obtained the registration of the edicts by the <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Lit_de_justice.html" title="Lit de justice">lit de justice</a></i> of 12 March, but by that time he had nearly everybody against him. His attacks on privilege had won him the hatred of the nobles and the <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parlement.html" title="Parlement">parlements</a></i>, his attempted reforms in the royal household, that of the court, his free trade legislation, that of the <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Financiers.html" title="Financiers">financiers</a></i>, his views on tolerance and his agitation for the suppression of the phrase that was offensive to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestants</a> in the king's <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation.html" title="Coronation">coronation</a> oath, that of the clergy, and his edict on the <i>jurandes</i> that of the rich bourgeoisie of Paris and others, such as the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_de_Conti_e779.html" title="Prince de Conti">prince de Conti</a>, whose interests were involved. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Antoinette_cf2c.html" title="Marie Antoinette">The queen</a> disliked him for opposing the grant of favours to her <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protege.html" title="Protege">proteges</a>, and he had offended <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabrielle_de_Polastron%2C_comtesse_de_Polignac_d6b5.html" title="Gabrielle de Polastron, comtesse de Polignac">Mme. de Polignac</a> in a similar manner.</p>
<p>All might yet have gone well if Turgot could have retained the confidence of the king, but the king could not fail to see that Turgot had not the support of the other ministers. Even his friend Malesherbes thought he was too rash, and was, moreover, himself discouraged and wished to resign. The alienation of Maurepas was also increasing. Whether through jealousy of the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ascendancy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:ascendancy">ascendancy</a> which Turgot had acquired over the king, or through the natural incompatibility of their characters, he was already inclined to take sides against Turgot, and the reconciliation between him and the queen, which took place about this time, meant that he was henceforth the tool of the Polignac <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clique.html" title="Clique">clique</a> and the <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/i/%C3%89tienne_Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_duc_de_Choiseul_1586.html" title="Étienne François, duc de Choiseul">Choiseul</a> party. About this time, too, appeared a pamphlet, <i>Le Songe de M. Maurepas</i>, generally ascribed to the comte de Provence (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVIII_of_France_e25a.html" title="Louis XVIII of France">Louis XVIII</a>), containing a bitter <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caricature.html" title="Caricature">caricature</a> of Turgot.</p>
<p>Before relating the circumstances of Turgot's fall we may briefly resume his views on the administrative system. With the physiocrats, he believed in an <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightened_absolutism.html" title="Enlightened absolutism">enlightened political absolutism</a>, and looked to the king to carry through all reforms. As to the parlements, he opposed all interference on their part in legislation, considering that they had no competency outside the sphere of justice. He recognized the danger of the recap of the old parlement, but was unable effectively to oppose it since he had been associated with the dismissal of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9_Nicolas_Charles_Augustin_de_Maupeou_d4d8.html" title="René Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou">Maupeou</a> and Terray, and seems to have underestimated its power. He was opposed to the summoning of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_States-General_16c0.html" title="French States-General">states-general</a> advocated by Malesherbes (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_6.html" title="May 6">6 May</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>), possibly on the ground that the two privileged orders would have too much power in them. His own plan is to be found in his <i>Mémoire sur les municipalités</i>, which was submitted informally to the king. In Turgot's proposed system, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landed_proprietor.html" title="Landed proprietor">landed proprietors</a> alone were to form the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electorate.html" title="Electorate">electorate</a>, no distinction being made among the three orders; the members of the town and country municipalités were to elect representatives for the district municipalités, which in turn would elect to the provincial municipalités, and the latter to a grande municipalité, which should have no legislative powers, but should concern itself entirely with the administration of taxation. With this was to be combined a whole system of education, relief of the poor, etc. Louis XVI recoiled from this as being too great a leap in the dark, and such a fundamental difference of opinion between king and minister was bound to lead to a breach sooner or later. Turgot's only choice, however, was between "tinkering" at the existing system in detail and a complete revolution, and his attack on privilege, which might have been carried through by a popular minister and a strong king, was bound to form part of any effective scheme of reform.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot%2C_Baron_de_Laune_866a.html" title="Edit section: The fall of Turgot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The fall of Turgot</span></h2>
<p>The immediate cause of Turgot's fall is uncertain. Some speak of a plot, of forged letters containing attacks on the queen shown to the king as Turgot's, of a series of notes on Turgot's budget prepared, it is said, by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Necker_aac9.html" title="Jacques Necker">Necker</a>, and shown to the king to prove his incapacity. Others attribute it to the queen, and there is no doubt that she hated Turgot for supporting <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Gravier%2C_comte_de_Vergennes_c70e.html" title="Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes">Vergennes</a> in demanding the recall of the comte de Guines, the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambassador_%28diplomacy%29.html" title="Ambassador (diplomacy)">ambassador</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, whose cause she had ardently espoused at the prompting of the Choiseul clique. Others attribute it to an intrigue of Maurepas. On the resignation of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillaume-Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Lamoignon_de_Malesherbes_fe12.html" title="Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes">Malesherbes</a> (April 1776), whom Turgot wished to replace by the abbé Very, Maurepas proposed to the king as his successor a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonentity" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nonentity">nonentity</a> named Amelot. Turgot, on hearing of this, wrote an indignant letter to the king, in which he reproached him for refusing to see him, pointed out in strong terms the dangers of a weak ministry and a weak king, and complained bitterly of Maurepas's irresolution and subjection to court intrigues; this letter the king, though asked to treat it as confidential, is said to have shown to Maurepas, whose dislike for Turgot it still further embittered. With all these enemies, Turgot's fall was certain, but he wished to stay in office long enough to finish his project for the reform of the royal household before resigning. This, however, he was not allowed to do, but on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">12 May</a>, was ordered to send in his resignation. He at once retired to <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Roche-Guyon_7ae3.html" title="La Roche-Guyon">La Roche-Guyon</a>, the château of the duchesse d'Enville, returning shortly to Paris, where he spent the rest of his life in scientific and literary studies, being made vice-president of the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Inscriptions_et_Belles-Lettres_e628.html" title="Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres">Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a>.</p>
<p>In character Turgot was simple, honourable and upright, with a passion for justice and truth. He was an idealist, his enemies would say a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doctrinaire" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:doctrinaire">doctrinaire</a>, and certainly the terms "natural rights," "natural law," frequently occur in his writings. His friends speak of his charm and gaiety in intimate intercourse, but among strangers he was silent and awkward, and produced the impression of being reserved and disdainful. On one point both friends and enemies agree, and that is his <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brusquerie" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:brusquerie">brusquerie</a> and his lack of tact in the management of men; Oncken points out with some reason the "schoolmasterish" tone of his letters, even to the king. As a statesman he has been very variously estimated, but it is generally agreed that a large number of the reforms and ideas of the Revolution were due to him; the ideas did not as a rule originate with him, but it was he who first gave them prominence. As to his position as an economist, opinion is also divided. Oncken, to take the extreme of condemnation, looks upon him as a bad physiocrat and a confused thinker, while <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Say_6627.html" title="Leon Say">Leon Say</a> considers that he was the founder of modern political economy, and that "though he failed in the 18th century he triumphed in the 19th."</p>
