<p>Coulter became involved in some controversy for a statement she made on <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_d905.html" title="CBC">CBC</a>'s news program <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fifth_Estate_12d7.html" title="The Fifth Estate">The Fifth Estate</a>. During a conversation with the host, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_McKeown_5c53.html" title="Bob McKeown">Bob McKeown</a>, Coulter asserted that Canada sent troops to Vietnam. McKeown disputed her assertion. While Canada did not send combat troops to Vietnam in support of the United states. They did <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War_b5d5.html" title="Canada and the Vietnam War">send noncombat troops to Indochina in the 1950s and again to Vietnam in 1972</a>.<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-10,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-10,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> In a later CSPAN interview, Coulter admitted she was wrong about the actions of the Canadian government, but justified her comments based on 10,000 Canadians who volunteered for the US military.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<dd>Sigh... here we go again. How is neutrality preserved in this passage? Where is the mention of Coulter's important admission on C-SPAN which the pro-Coulter people always glaze over? Why do we have to put the details of Canada and Vietnam on a bio page about Coulter when we supply the redirect link? What about the fact that Coulter, in her mea culpa, never once referred to these non-combat peacekeepers? I must respectfully disagree with your usage of summary style in this one instance, as I can't for the life of me understand why you want to use editor interpretations rather than verbatim quotes. If it's a matter of space, we're only talking about the difference of a few lines. Just as we get into problems about the college speech section as to what descriptors we can or can't use, by using verbatim quotes we truly allow the reader to decide for themselves without deciding the debate for them. Some people think that Coulter was right, that Bob McKeown was incorrect in his isolated assertion that "Canada did not send troops to Vietnam", as Canada <i>did</i> send non-combat peacekeeping troops in 1954 and again at the very end of the war to oversee the ceasefire. Some people also think that Coulter's point, taken in the context of her general point about Canada's relationship with the U.S. and an analogy to Iraq, was correctly disputed by McKeown, and that he was referring to combat troops when he said "troops". Your proposed passage has clearly sided with one of these points of view. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To summarize my above passage:
<ol>
<li>Add Coulter's verbatim mea culpa from C-SPAN as it is there now.</li>
<li>Re-word your summary with verbatim quotes from the interview, as you are excising context about her general point. If all the interview consisted of Ann saying "Canada sent troops to Vietnam" and McKeown saying "No they didn't", then I'd agree with Lou et al. But there is context that is missing, and at the space the passage currently takes up, we can afford to include it.</li>
<li>Provide redirect link to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War_b5d5.html" title="Canada and the Vietnam War">Canada and the Vietnam War</a> to syphon off content that does not belong on a bio page about Coulter.</li>

<dd>I have no problem with any of your requests contingent on reliable sourcing. The language I used was direct from the Time article. Can you propose alternative language that does not make our article look like a quotefest?

<dd>It's hard for me to determine what specific criteria renders my passage such a subjective term as a "quotefest"&#160;;) 3 main quotes are all I care about:
<ul>
<li>Coulter on CBC - "Canada used to be...one of our most...most loyal friends, and vice versa. I mean, Canada sent troops to Vietnam. Was Vietnam less containable and more of a threat than Saddam Hussein?" <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" rel="nofollow">video</a></li>
<li>McKeown on CBC - "No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam" <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" rel="nofollow">video</a></li>
<li>Coulter on CSPAN - "Yes, 10,000 Canadian troops, at least. There is a War Memorial to them, at least for most of that. The Canadian Government didn't send troops [...] but [...] they came and fought with the Americans. So I was wrong. It turns out there were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada... People keep saying: "well, he didn't tell you that they - 10,000 troops - ran across to sign up with the Americans..." I don't think he knew, he's a bubblehead <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Baxter_0c65.html" title="Ted Baxter">Ted Baxter</a>" <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html" rel="nofollow">video (click on US response)</a></li>

<dd>Because excessive quoting makes us not an encyclopedia but a politics information board. We are not here to argue about politics. We are here to describe Ann Coulter.

<dd>Sorry but your claims and opinions are pretty much meaningless, Lou. I've debated this with you in above sections. As predicted, you ignored my points and are restating your claim right here, so just read above a few sections and respond to the actual points I've made instead of just repeating yourself. I've noticed over the past few weeks you've failed on a consistent basis to provide good points or counterpoints, yet you keep repeating your opinion on the matter as if it means much at this point. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 00:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Allow me to butt in here. First, I ask that Ubiq remember to keep it <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and that one of the suggestions from <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> is to sometimes disengage from an argument when it gets heated. Perhaps that is what Lou is doing. But on to my larger point. This entire debate about how to present this CBC appearance has gone on for quite some time despite its dubious notability. Because I have issues with the video under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, the only coverage of this story was in the Time article about Ms. Coulter. There has been no independant coverage of this incident, and as such does not qualify for inclusion under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.

<dd>Sorry but I responded to the independant coverage question below. I just noticed your question (maybe I should start reading from top to bottom, instead of the other way around). The video clip from CBC is a primary source, which although not per se forbidden, is discouraged by Wikipedia because it often leads to original research which is disallowed. Here's the test of notability, IMO, you can find entire articles solely on her "Jersey girls" comments. She was interviewed on numerous shows based solely on those comments.

<dd>Ram: I'm being civil. I ask that you assume the assumption of good faith. Thanks. Lou is known for leaving arguments (that <i>weren't heated</i> I might add, so your suggestion that he's ignoring my points for the reason of resolving something is false) only to start the exact same argument a day or two later. It's always "I haven't seen any clear demonstration that it is [notable]" without citing legitimate reasons why or answering peoples' points why it <i>is</i> notable. I assumed good faith the first 3 or 4 times he did it. It's a bit different now.</dd>

<dd>I will only deal with the Time article because the other's do not qualify as reliable sources due to their polemic nature, IMO. Time mentions this in a larger article about Coulter and complaints of innaccuracies. It also supports her. The mention is not about the incident itself. To me that would mean "independent". If a reliable source mentions this incident on its own terms and not in a laundry list of other things, then I will consider a step towards notability. So my opinion is clearly NOT false. You and I may view this differently, but please let's have some humility. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 19:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Look at the <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2496" class="external text" title="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2496" rel="nofollow">FAIR</a> article. Is this article polemic? How so?

How is this polemic? It's possible I could be misinterpreting what you're saying but it seems like you think "independent" should mean "seemingly politically neutral". Taken from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent sources</a>, "an independent source is a source which describes a topic from the outside." How are these articles <i>not</i> describing the topic (of her interview with Bob McKeown) from the outside? If you can point these things out to me, I'd appreciate it. The thing about the "laudry list" to me is a point not worth rebutting, as there seems to be plenty of references/sources on wikipedia that have events mentioned/described in such a manner. Yet, the events described are rarely considered less notable because of it. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 20:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me clarify... when I said "polemic", I meant in terms of using the website as a source in general, not that their presentation of this issue was biased. Fair.org is a self proclaimed liberal media watchdog group seeking to counterattack conservative misinformation. It exists to refute conservative arguments. WorldNetDaily although it claims to be independant, on a cursory review it is apparent that it has a conservative "mindset". I mean, Ann Coulter has a banner on their page! In almost all cases, these sites on their own, would not be considered a reliable source of information, except for information about themselves. Again I ask, has this issue been covered in any other <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> published works besides Time? If it has, it should be included. The other question is the mention in Time and the C-Span, and CBC videos enough to show notability on its own? Some say yes, I say no. But my larger point is considering there doesn't seem to be any agreement on how to even present it, shouldn't we first reach a consensus if it should even be included? As to your last point. I agree there are many problem articles on Wikipedia, just see <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. But we have to take it on a step by step basis. Just because a bad article exists now, doesn't mean it will be here forever. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 21:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still don't see how these aren't <i>independent</i> sources. It sounds like, by your definition, any source that has a hint of political bias is not a reliable source. By this measure, we wouldn't be able to use <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_News_e423.html" title="Fox News">Fox News</a> as a source, because there is very clear and blatant conservative bias on their part. Similarly to how you said, "[FAIR] exists to refute conservative arguments", I could easily say "Fox News exists to perpetuate misinformation, and provide entertainment and opinion based 'news' to push its neoconservative agenda". Should we not use them? Also, has FAIR or World News Daily been shown to have poor verifiability? You said "in almost all cases, these sites on their own, would not be considered a reliable source of information, except for information about themselves." I don't see any legitimate reason for saying that and your reasoning seems to be because of political bias. Let me ask, <i>who</i> besides yourself "would not consider" it a reliable source of information and why? Reliable to me would mean that there's been consistent credibility and verifiabilty, sans subjective interpretations of events. Look at the actual articles. How are these articles more politically biased than any <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_News_e423.html" title="Fox News">Fox News</a> or <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> article or "news" story?</dd>

<dd>Concerning your larger point, the only person not seemingly agreeing with kizzle's passage is Lou. He simply just doesn't want it in the article though. He hasn't once provided evidence or an argument that the passage is biased or not NPOV. All he's done is make vague inferences that kizzle (or other editors, "some people" he likes to say) are malicious in their editing. If you can look over the passage and tell me what you think, it would be greatly appreciated (and I can find it for you, as it may not be found easily on this page, just ask).

That goes to FAIR and WORLDNETDAILY as a reliable source not to their independence. TIME is a bit different. If FAIR and WorldNet are considered reliable sources then yes they would qualify as independant in this matter, since they in fact have articles solely dedicated to this issue. To answer your questions about what separates these from Fox and CNN is this. Fox and CNN, have copy edit staffs, ombudsmen, research departments, and other procedures in place to make sure that their stories are factually accurate (even if it always isn't). I don't know if the other organizations mentioned have these safeguards, and considering their upfront bias (not perceived or a matter of opinion as with Fox and CNN, after all both Fox and CNN officially deny any bias), it should give editors here caution when using them as sources <i>in general</i>. I have no fault with the specific articles but only with the source. To use a really extreme example: If Stormfront.org, did a fair and accurate article on the dangers of alcoholism, I wouldn't not use it here on Wikipedia not because of what the article says but rather because of who wrote it. (I am not saying any of those organizations are anywhere near to Stormfront--the allusion is just illustrative). Finally, I don't have any problems with the passage using quotes (although I usually prefer summarizing info, but Kizzle's point is fair and may be a good exception), but I know Lou and apparently Hipocrite did have issues with it.<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 23:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ram: I looked over this paragraph: "Please do not make assumptions about my motives, desires, or biases. It is uncivil and uncalled for. I am not questioning your motives arguing for the inclusion of this issue, please give me the same courtesy!" and couldn't think of one thing I said that warranted that repsonse. Then I looked over my paragraph and noticed "I don't see any legitimate reason for saying that and your reasoning seems to be because of political bias." and how you might have taken it the wrong way. I meant to say that your reasoning that these articles shouldn't be considered reliable seems to be because of the fact that <i>the sites writing them</i> have political bias. Sorry. I need to word things better. I have absolutely no clue or hint that you, personally are biased and I wouldn't accuse you of it.</p>
<p>As far as your argument goes, it sounds like you're saying that FAIR and World Net Daily actually have claimed they are politically affiliated or biased. This is not the case with World Net Daily. FAIR, on their about page, mentions that they're progressive. I don't know that that necessarily disqualifies them or renders their articles illegitimate. Also, in regards to Fox News and CNN having editing teams to make sure they are accurate, we have no clue that either of them don't put slant first and accuracy second, so I don't see it as a good point. Fox News has been shown to flat out lie on occasions. As far as your comparison with alcoholism and stormfront.org, I see that as a weak analogy. FAIR <i>specializes</i> on the topics of credibility, "fairness", and accuracy. If anything, I'd say that should help their case in why they are reliable on this event, since credibility is exactly what this event is about. I can only go a couple more times about this, at some point we'll have to just agree to disagree. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 00:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about taking your comments the wrong way, I guess we're even now. With regard to WND, fair enough, although their allegiance to the right is pretty apparent from viewing their website. Just to be clear, I am not saying their articles aren't legitimate, but that under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> we should be cautious using it as a source where there has been no corresponding coverage in other non-biased, mainstream, reliable sources. Here TIME has covered it, but I don't know if that is sufficient. I brought up the procedures at Fox and CNN because under the old RS section (there's been some edit warring there recently), these were factors lending the source to reliability. The page has since been refactored and those principles have been lost but see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&amp;oldid=60456561" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&amp;oldid=60456561" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. I am sure Foxnews would disagree that they have told any "lies" in their news reporting, and am sure the targets of Fair would disagree with your characterizations. But in any case, I agree let's just agree to disagree. I'm not going to edit war over this and my objections are duly noted.<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 00:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I definitely agree that caution should be important in considering what is reliable. As far as your reference to WND being conservative, I also agree. They even have an article claiming soy milk makes you gay. But your original point regarding this was that Fox News and CNN don't declare a political leaning, so they deserve the benefit of the doubt as an RS. I was just, essentially, trying to point out that since neither FAIR or WND declare a clear affiliation, there is very little difference between Fox News, CNN, FAIR, and World Net Daily in terms of reliability. They all have their leanings, and none of them admit to being politically affiliated (with the exception of FAIR somewhat). I personally consider none of them unbiased as a whole, but will admit that some of their articles/stories aren't biased or unreliable, meaning I think these articles/stories should be looked at on a case by case basis to determine if they are reliable. I'm sure the subject of reliability of a source on wikipedia could be debated endlessly, especially when clear and definitive standards aren't stated. Makes it kind of unfair for us but that's life I guess. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 00:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This matter appears in <i>Time</i> as an example of an alleged mistake that really is NOT a mistake. At the risk of posting a great wall of text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Coulter has a reputation for carelessness with facts, and if you Google the words "Ann Coulter lies," you will drown in results. But I didn't find many outright Coulter errors. One of the most popular alleged mistakes pinging around the Web is from her appearance on Canadian TV news in January, when Coulter asserted that "Canada sent troops to Vietnam." Interviewer Bob McKeown said she was wrong. "Indochina?" Coulter tried. McKeown said no. Finally, Coulter said haltingly, "I'll get back to you." "Coulter never got back to us," McKeown triumphantly noted, "but for the record, like Iraq, Canada sent no troops to Vietnam." What he didn't mention was that Canada did send noncombat troops to Indochina in the 1950s and again to Vietnam in 1972.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If the Vietnam material goes into the article, it should not do so under color of deception.

<dd>3) The topic is <i>not</i> about whether what she said was a factual error. It was, in coincidence and technically, a true statement (though she admitted being wrong).

<p>Jesus Christ people (don't edit my comment). If you don't like reading mountains of text than go find another talk page, as there are more than several issues being tossed around here.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Notability</b>: As I have stated before, I'm not a huge proponent of its notability, and to answer Ramsquire's question, there were no interviews that were scheduled solely to deal with her assertion. <b>But</b>, you have the Time piece, CSPAN interview, FAIR, WorldNetDaily, and a shitload of views on YouTube (which is obviously not an objective measurement) <i>covering a single, specific question in a one-hour program on CBC</i>. So while she was never scheduled to come on and discuss specifically her controversial assertion on say Hannity and Colmes, CSPAN, Time, and the CBC website thought it fit to cover this one specific question out of an hour-long program. It's not as big as the Jersey Girls, but its more notable than many of her comments. Given the doubt, and the fact that the proposed passage lets her have the final say, and that it's only 3 quotes, we're not violating undue weight, nor <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Lou's criteria of notability consisting of "It is one but of hundreds of interviews she has done" is ridiculous, as so was her interview on the Today Show where he asked her about the Jersey Girls comments, and yet we cover that.</li>
<li><b>Time Piece</b>: I have no problem including Time, but I frankly must vehemently disagree with than not including the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting criticism of Cloud's piece. The Time piece is inarguably an opinion piece, and while it comes from a major reputable news source, it is still an opinion piece. Leaving out the other side, which is best represented by FAIR's critique, is failing adhering to NPOV. Yes, FAIR is a liberal-leaning organization, but for what they exhibit in slight partisanship, they more than make up in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Hell, Drudge is abashedly partisan and yet Wikipedia uses Drudge as citations, primarily because what he says can most of the time be verified. In FAIR's (and MediaMatters btw) case, these things can be verified through the transcripts and date of broadcasts they publish along with their critique. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and its corresponding criteria for sourcing, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, says that we must be "careful" of using partisan sources, but when that source superbly satisfies <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then I believe it merits inclusion. Subsequently, I proposed earlier to have a brief paragraph afterwards, mentioning the Cloud piece as well as the FAIR criticism of the Cloud piece, but that was rejected by others here, so I kept it brief and simple: 3 quotes and a re-direct link on a question that got specifically covered in Time, CSPAN.</li>
<li><b>Rant</b> (optional read): I have heard the mantra that Lou and other pro-Coulter people have constantly re-asserted: Bob McKeown was wrong. Why was he wrong? Because you say that Coulter didn't necessarily mean "military" troops when she said: "Canada sent troops to Vietnam". The word "troops" could mean <i>non-combat</i> "troops" as well as <i>combat</i> "troops". Thus, there are two issues to consider: First, whether Ann Coulter was right:
<ol>
<li>That Coulter was referring to the non-combat definition and referring to the 240 non-combat peacekeeping troops in order to "contain" the "threat" that Vietnam posed, and thus, while her mea culpa subsequent to the interview never mentioned these non-combat troops, she was absolutely right.</li>
<li>That Coulter was referring to the combat definition, and, like she explicitly said on CSPAN, she was wrong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The second issue is whether or not McKeown was right:
<ol>
<li>That McKeown was referring to the non-combat definition of "troops", and thus was absolutely wrong, as at least 240 non-combat peacekeeping troops were sent to Vietnam.</li>
<li>That McKeown was referring to the combat definition of "troops", and thus was absolutely right, as Canada <i>never</i> sent any combat troops.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>My question to you then: If we're going to give Coulter the benefit of the doubt, and assume that she meant non-combat, then why can't we give McKeown the benefit of the doubt and assume that he meant combat troops? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>So Lou, are you arguing that Coulter was wrong when she said she was wrong? If so, that's your original research - the fact remains she admitted making a mistake.

<dd>Kizzle, you've stated repeatedly that you are not a huge proponent of its notability. Well neither are Lou and I. So why is this debate so ongoing?

<dd>She said "So I was wrong" and the way this is described in the article is that she was "admitting she was wrong". I don't see how this is a "characterization". Nor do I see how reproducing a rather lengthy quotation by her made on C-SPAN constitutes "synthesis". Synthesis is drawing together varied unrelated or tangentially related facts from numerous different sources to produce a new and original conclusion - here we have a quotation of an exchange on the CBC documentary followed by a lengthy quotation by her made on C-SPAN about that documentary - there's no synthesis going on and it is left to readers to decide on the matter. It looks here like you're trying to suppress references to the CBC interview because you don't like the way it reflects on Coulter. However, it is not our job (or your job) but to suppress information. What we do is lay out the information so that readers can decide for themselves. <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixth_Estate_40d8.html" title="User:Sixth Estate">Sixth Estate</a> 19:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No. As I said in the first block, this is a notable event covered by independent sources and must be included in the article, including the FAIR response. It's not at all clear what she was admitting to, and no third party thought it worthwhile to comment on in either case. The use of primary sources in articles must be well-justified, and this wrinkle of the story is not. How on earth are you drawing the conclusion I'm trying to suppress references based on how I feel about Coulter? <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 22:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, saying "So I was wrong" is the very definition of a mea culpa, independent of whatever motive you'd like to imbue my passage with. Second, you're fundamentally misunderstanding <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and the role of primary sources. There's no original analysis or point to be made or advanced (reproduce the proposed prose indicating this if you disagree), and I can't see how the CSPAN interview isn't relevant to the CBC interview, especially since she's referring specifically to him, the Canada/Vietnam claims, and calling McKeown a "bubblehead Ted Baxter". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calling it a "mea culpa" is certainly OR <i>and</i> POV. Considering how sarcastic she is, her admission is ambiguous at best: "So I was wrong. <i>It turns out there were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada</i>... People keep saying: 'well, he didn't tell you that they - 10,000 troops - ran across to sign up with the Americans...' I don't think he knew, he's a bubblehead Ted Baxter." Moreover, none of this was covered by any third party, which shows that it is not, in fact, notable. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 05:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

She corrected herself and said that "The Canadian Government didn't send troops" (which you conveniently omitted from your post). Once we have established that the incident is notable (which we have), then the reader is entirely disserviced by excluding an <i>extremely</i> relevant comment by Coulter <i>commenting specifically on the question</i>. I can't believe you're seriously arguing not to include this comment along with the CBC quote. You're doing the readers a disservice by censoring (yes, censoring) pertinent information (a comment from her <i>specifically talking about the incident in question</i> for goodness sake!) that helps the reader form a more complete impression of what Time Magazine called "one of the most popular alleged mistakes" that Coulter has made. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 08:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this case, the primary source has not been published by a reputable publisher, so the question about inclusion is moot. WP:BLP demands we remove it. Putting this question aside, it's still a question of editorial judgment, and relevance alone cannot be the deciding factor. Millions of primary datapoints may be relevant to many subjects, but we always prefer to use secondary sources that are verifiable with other reliable sources. In this case, the meaning and importance of her remarks are unclear since no media ever picked up on it, which is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">red flag</a> that inclusion would be inappropriate. As for OR, I can't shake the fact that you're certain that her statement is an admission. We seem to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#What_is_excluded" title="Wikipedia:No original research">building a particular case favored by some editors</a>. But again, even if that's not the case, no reliable (or even verifiable) source has published on her remarks as being in relation to this incident, and WP:BLP demands even more caution toward the relevence of primary sources. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 01:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How is a television interview with Coulter on CSPAN not a "reputable publisher"? It's not like it's a print article that claims Coulter said something, <i>as we can see for ourselves what she said on the video</i>, unless you also think its possible that CBC doctored the video as well. As for the last half of your post, your opinions are interesting, but they are not grounded in policy. As I stated above, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not deal with primary sources and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and its passage on the use of primary sources does not deal with notability. The topic has already been determined to be notable, and a comment <i>by Coulter</i> on television remarking about the CBC interview is relevant. How can we truly say that the reader has come to a fair assessment of the situation if we leave out Coulter's own subsequent words on the incident? The answer is we can't. As for your assessment that I am "building a particular case", back up your claim by reproducing the specific prose that you think is advancing a position. The mere selection of quotes, however, which you also admit are relevant to the issue and satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, does not qualify as "advancing a viewpoint".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clear demonstration</span></h2>
<p>Ann Coulter once criticized the Jersey Girls. The episode appears in her Wikipedia biography. I offer this as a clear demonstration of its relevance to her notability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coulter's criticism was very widely read: it appeared in a book that topped the New York Times bestseller list</li>
<li>It was very widely discussed in mainstream sources afterward</li>
<li>Hillary Clinton denounced it on the floor of the U.S. Senate</li>
<li>Rahm Emanuel denounced it on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives</li>
<li>9/11 Commission member Tim Roehmer, speaking as an individual, also denounced it</li>
<li>Clinton, Emanuel and Roehmer were all importantly involved in the nationally very important 9/11 investigations that led to the Jersey Girls becoming notable.</li>

<dd>Thing is Lou, I think everyone concedes that the CBC interview is not as notable as the Jersey Girls comments. The question is, is the mention of it in TIME (and in other sources-- whose reliability I dispute), and her subsequent discussion of it on C-SPAN sufficient to state it's notability. Whether it happened two years ago, yesterday, in te 80's is irrelevant. Was it notable when it happened? I don't know, and lean towards it being not. Other's disagree. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 22:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They haven't done too well at providing a clear demonstration of its relevance to Ann Coulter's notability.

<dd>Here's what your argument looks like Lou: Let's say I don't want <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakeem_Olajuwon_609b.html" title="Hakeem Olajuwon">Hakeem Olajuwon</a> to have a Wikipedia article. I want to argue that Hakeem Olajuwon isn't a well known or popular person, so I list the number of people who know who <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is, the number of people who talk about him, and the number of people/groups that support him. I come to the conclusion that Hakeem Olajuwon is not well known because not nearly as many people know who he is, so in conclusion, he shouldn't have a wikipedia article. The fact is, they are both well known, just George W. Bush is <i>more</i> well known. There are degrees/levels of certain things, like how well known someone is and the notability of an event. All you demonstrated was that the Jersey Girls incident was <i>very</i> notable, but you did not demonstrate that the CBC interview <i>wasn't</i> notable. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 23:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just feel that it is an attempt to get biassed and possibly malicious content into a persons biography. I'm almost sure of it in fact. I guess its my editorial judgement. My boyfriends too.

<dd>I don't think you understand who has to prove what. You are stating that this passage is "biased and possibly malicious content". Yet you are admitting that this is based purely on a <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judgment_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Judgment (philosophy)">judgment</a> from the "feelings" or inclinations from you and your boyfriends. You are also claiming that you aren't assuming good faith because of a "lack of a clear demonstration of this matters relevance to Ann Coulters notability" (Lou?) If you want your "feelings" to mean something here, you're going to have to provide evidence that we haven't demonstrated relevance clearly per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and that the passage is "biased and possibly malicious" per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>.

I get the impression you'll be away for the weekend but if you are able to write something, I look forward to discussing it Monday when you return. In the meantime I'm going to use a modified version of the example provided by <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> to add my thoughts on a clear demonstration of why the CBC interview should be included.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann Hart Coulter is an American <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columnist.html" title="Columnist">columnist</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_commentator.html" title="Political commentator">political commentator</a>. Her error about Canadian military history is relevant to her role as a political commentator.</li>
<li>John Cloud defended her in a 2005 article in Time magazine titled "Ms. Right".</li>
<li>Canadian political commentator <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Michael_Grace_40f5.html" title="Kevin Michael Grace">Kevin Michael Grace</a> remarked on it <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/insite/COMMENTARY/2005/2/4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/insite/COMMENTARY/2005/2/4.html" rel="nofollow">in a commentary transcript on the CBC page.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I could have listed some more bullets, but they would have been a bit shaky like a few of <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a>'s seem to. To be clear, I mean no disrespect toward you <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> and I completely agree that the Jersey Girls comments merit inclusion. I am only saying that points like:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was very widely discussed in mainstream sources afterward</li>
<li>Clinton, Emanuel and Roehmer were all importantly involved in the nationally very important 9/11 investigations that led to the Jersey Girls becoming notable.</li>
</ul>
<p>are weak because the first one fails to cite specifically any of those sources. The second point doesn't cite a source either, appears to be a statement based on original research, and may be incorrect as it could be argued that 9/11 and their involvement itself guaranteed notability. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Addressing the two points about the Jersey Girls: It's correct that they include no citations. But they <i>could</i> include them IMHO, and they probably <i>would</i> include them if there was doubt that they were true, and/or if they were going into an encyclopedia article. IMHO, as it is, they are just part of a discussion IMHO, and their accuracy is pretty obvious. IMHO, they demonstrate relevance to Coulter's notability by pointing out that her Jersey Girls comments received much more media attention than do most of her others, and by pointing out that the critics named weren't merely commentators, but were seriously involved in the events being discussed. Unless you disbelieve the points, they are pretty strong arguments for relevance to her notability, IMHO. (By contrast with her other comments like the one about Justice Stevens, look at how widely the media noted it, and look at the status of those who criticized it. IMHO it was very narrowly noted, and the critics were minor commentators.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed I too remember the Jersey Girls incident being covered in the national media quite extensively. My point is that a person who missed that coverage could rightly insist that point be disregarded unless the specific coverage was cited. I don't know how they could have missed it, but to a person who did our assertion that it was covered may appear biased. That hasn't happened yet because I think all of us participating in this topic agree on it receiving said coverage, and it may not ever happen. Don't get me wrong <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a>, I'm sure you can get the sources if it were necessary I'm just saying better to put them in from the start. In my CBC argument, I know I saw Ann Coulter admit she was wrong on C-Span but I don't have any references so I left it off my point list for just that reason. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 20:06, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO, we're looking here for why the CBC interview is important enough to Coulter's notability to be included in her encyclopedia article. Did it launch or destroy a career? (I don't think so.) Was it widely discussed in major forums? (Not that I can see.) Did it mark any major turning point? (It didn't seem to.) IMHO, from everything I've seen so far, it just wasn't a very important event. It was a short interview on a very small network, and there was nothing very notable about it. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 21:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That we are, and I would have assumed if you disagreed with the points I raised you would have addressed them rather than defending your failure to include sources. Perhaps it is my fault for attempting to explain why I listed only three bullets as opposed to the six in the Jersey Girls example, I did not mean to get off-topic so I apologize if you thought I was. Is Canadian media not notable? It sounds like that it was you are implying. It is becoming difficult to assume good faith on your part when you ignore the evidence of notability provided by not just myself but others like <a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a>, and <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a>. In the interest of clarity <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a>, would you please explain why "there was nothing very notable about it" and why these points do not show otherwise?</dd>

<p>Lou, the national broadcast network of Canada is not trivial. And like they point out, the <i>Time</i> article calls it her most-cited alleged error. I believe it would be notable for that reason alone.

<dd>It's hard to find references for this, but the CBC's budget and staff are about 10% of those of CNN. Probably its number of viewers is on the same scale. The CBC is a wonderful national asset, but it isn't very important in the big scheme of things. (Fine distinction: <b>The CBC</b> is notable because it's Canada's national network, because it programs for natives in the frozen wastelands, because it's bilingual, etc. <b>The CBC's broadcasts</b> are typically NOT notable, because they reach a small audience, are programmed mostly for Canadians, etc. The words of notable entities are not necessarily notable themselves.)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a>'s bullet points put the demonstration all in one place, but they are very weak bullets, IMHO. 1) Her notability doesn't depend on her knowledge of disputed points of Canadian history; 2)&amp;3) Dozens of her remarks are mentioned in mainstream media. If that's the criterion for including a remark in the article, I have a LOT of remarks I want to include.</dd>

<dd>The CBC is a respected international broadcaster and the <i>fifth estate</i> has won a number of international Emmys over its 20 some years on the air. As well, the interviewer, Bob McKeown is also an NBC journalist who has done numerous interviews and docs for <i>Dateline NBC</i>. You are grasping at straws here, I'm afraid, by trying to dismiss CBC as a notable source. As for the CBC's budget, in 2004 was about $1 billion <a href="http://www.friends.ca/news/Fact_Sheets/factsheets03130301.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.friends.ca/news/Fact_Sheets/factsheets03130301.asp" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, CNN's budget was about $220 million in 2002<a href="http://www.stateofthenewsmedia.org/narrative_cabletv_newsinvestment.asp?cat=6&amp;media=5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stateofthenewsmedia.org/narrative_cabletv_newsinvestment.asp?cat=6&amp;media=5" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> (higher than CNBC and Fox combined). Even accounting for the differences between the US and Canadian dollar CNN's budget is actually a fraction of CBC's. Perhaps the reason it's "hard to find" references for your claim that the CBC's budget and staff is 10% of CNN's is because it's just not true? Frankly, the fact that you are now making up facts out of whole cloth doesn't exactly bode well for your argument.<a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixth_Estate_40d8.html" title="User:Sixth Estate">Sixth Estate</a> 18:29, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lou, have you actually watched the program (you can view it online)? While many of its subjects are Canadian it also reports on a number of international topics, including the documentary on Fox News which is not "about Canada".</dd>

<dd>You have glossed over my refutation of your demonstrably false claim that "the CBC's budget and staff are about 10% of those of CNN". I have two questions for you. First, where in the world did you come up with this and second are you willing to admit that your statement was wrong? Clearly you were grasping at straws when you came up with it and now you will "keep looking" for something, anything, you can use to try to dismiss the source. As for being or not being the "equal" of CNN, are you aware of just how many American news reporters and anchors come from the CBC or move back and forth from the CBC to American networks (including CNN)? <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Stewart_2b4a.html" title="Brian Stewart">Brian Stewart</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Morrison_4874.html" title="Keith Morrison">Keith Morrison</a>, Hilary Brown, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jennings_2f0c.html" title="Peter Jennings">Peter Jennings</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_MacNeil_051a.html" title="Robert MacNeil">Robert MacNeil</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kent_0961.html" title="Peter Kent">Peter Kent</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_McKeown_5c53.html" title="Bob McKeown">Bob McKeown</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Champ_9b35.html" title="Henry Champ">Henry Champ</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morley_Safer_328f.html" title="Morley Safer">Morley Safer</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Kent_c5a8.html" title="Arthur Kent">Arthur Kent</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheila_MacVicar_854d.html" title="Sheila MacVicar">Sheila MacVicar</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Newman_3ed3.html" title="Kevin Newman">Kevin Newman</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Phillips_04ed.html" title="Mark Phillips">Mark Phillips</a> to name just a few.

<dd>Explaining where I got the 10%: When trying to compare CBC's viewership and demographics with that of other networks more familiar to me, I Googled various phrases. I didn't find anything, so I called a professional reference librarian at my local public library, which is the largest suburban library in Pennsylvania. She called back some time later, saying that she and an associate had looked at all their resources, plus the Internet, and that all they could find was something that said CBC's budget was about 10% of that of CNN. I didn't ask for a source, because I had no reason to doubt her, and because this is just a discussion page, not an encyclopedia article where such sources are required. Also, it seemed very reasonable to think that CBC is a network about a tenth the size of CNN, since Canada's population is about a tenth of that of the United States.</dd>

<dd><i><b>"The Canadian Government didn't send troops"</b></i> (Ann Coulter, C-SPAN interview). The fact that you think Coulter was wrong when she said she was wrong is of no importance here. Do you see why that is or do you want to keep playing games? I have no time for gameplaying but if you insist we can bring in a mediator who will have even less time for your games than we do. Your choice. As for significance, as <i>Time Magazine</i> has referred to the CBC incident as one of Coulter's "most popular alleged mistakes" we have a major American media outlet stating the comment's significance. Perhaps you now want to allege that Time has only 10% of the staff and budget of <i>US News &amp; Word Report</i> and shouldn't be taken seriously? Your OR and unique interpretation of Coulter's use of the word "troops", so unique that Coulter herself does not accept it, is pure OR and is completely irrelevant here, on a page discussion the Ann Coulter article. Wikipedia is not a debating society so if you want to argue about matters that are irrelevant to this article go somewhere else. <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixth_Estate_40d8.html" title="User:Sixth Estate">Sixth Estate</a> 05:06, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>KIZZEL: Talking about somebody's mind boggling hypocricy seems to be more than a little uncivil. Trotting out a dozen examples is only fouling our nest with more incivility, isn't it? The purpose of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> is to encourage us to work together in harmony. Let by-gones be by-gones. Two wrongs don't make a right.

<dd>I looked at some of your examples. Mostly he seems to be making general comments about things. I didn't see anything where he used your name or directed anything at you. Seemed to have you on ignore, in fact. #7, #10, #11, #12 seem to hit the nail on the head. What's wrong with them? Nobody was ridiculed or called names. Nobody is personally targeted. Where's the incivility in that?</dd>
<dd>I've got to say that it does seem that some editors are trying to slime Anne Coulter. They look for ways to say she's a liar without actually saying it. I don't see very much actual trying to make a good article, which of course requires neutrality. Why is it so hard to admit that Canada sent troops to Viet-Nam? I feel that it is for the reason that admitting it would make it look like Mrs. Coulter wasn't lying. The truth is that there were troops there and she was right, even though she maybe didn't realize it. 209.244.43.248 05:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If that's the criterion for including a remark in the article, I have a LOT of remarks I want to include.</i></dd>
<dd>*1 The topic is not exclusively Canadian, it is about an issue of American/Canadian relations during the Vietnam conflict.</dd>
<dd>*2 and 3 appear to be one point so I'll address them bother here. Mention in the mainstream media is not the only requirement, but it helps show notability. I for one would welcome any cited remarks from other mainstream sources.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a>: 1) The point is that Ann Coulter is notable for her acerbic/outlandish/insightful commentary on American liberals and related topics. What she says casually in an unscripted interview about things that took place before she was born and when she was a child, and that are not directly related to American liberalism, isn't very relevant to her notability. 2&amp;3) The point is that most of what Coulter says is mentioned in the mainstream media. Some of it is mentioned so much, and discussed in such depth, that it becomes clearly relevant to her notability. The Jersey Girls stuff is an example. The post-9/11 stuff is another. Next to those, this is nothing (but that's just my opinion).</dd>
<dd>I for one would welcome more material that clearly demonstrates the relevance of this incident to her notability. It seems like there might be some, but nobody other than you is presenting it in a brief, easily comprehended way. Your material is a good start at such a demonstration, but for the reasons stated above, I myself don't think it's very strong. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 02:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

The problem here is she believes the things she says and she holds herself out to be a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_commentator.html" title="Political commentator">political commentator</a>, please take a moment to read the linked article. To be clear I am not saying she believes liberals should be rounded up and shot or that the NYT should be bombed, she just wishes they'd shut up. If she admitted that she is, for lack of a better comparison, a "fake" political commentator in the same way that professional wrestlers are "fake" I would feel like you do on the CBC thing. She says she's "real", so we should treat her as such.</dd>
<dd>Though I do appreciate your criticism and I am enjoying our debate, I do have a separate concern. I must point out that many others on this page have made points that may be even stronger than mine. Your statement about mine being the only points worthy of this level discussion, which I took to be a compliment, comes at the expense of several editors here. I have seen <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a>, <a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixth_Estate_40d8.html" title="User:Sixth Estate">Sixth Estate</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand Luke</a> among others make points worthy of your attention.</dd>
<dd>Also I noticed you wanting to know if Canada did send troops to Vietnam. The answer is no, they sent peace keepers. Canada was a neutral party in the Paris Peace Accords, they and some other neutral countries sent peace keepers to enforce a cease fire while the U.S. withdrew in 1973. They were there to ensure that the terms of the cease fire and withdrawal were enforced. Personally I find it ludicrous that the North Vietnamese would accept peace keepers who they had fought against. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_and_the_Vietnam_War_6760.html" title="Australia and the Vietnam War">Australia and New Zealand sent troops to Vietnam. Among others, but they were the only former British possesions that sent "troops".</a> <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We aren't communicating well about point 1). Her field is contemporary American liberalism. She's not a noted commentator on Mexican matters, or matters regarding St. Pierre and Miquelon, or even matters involving our friend and neighbor Canada. Because of that, her notability has little to do with what she says about Mexico or Canada or little islands in the North Atlantic. If she confuses Alberta and Saskatchewan, as many Americans do, it really doesn't affect her notability.</dd>
<dd>Others have, indeed, made points. But they haven't been able put them together into anything like a clear demonstration of something. Not everyone is able to do that, so there's no fault in their failure. But until somebody does it (you?), their isolated points aren't a part of the "clear demonstration of relevance to notability" that is required of us in controversial situations.</dd>
<dd>Troops are commonly understood to be members of military forces. "Soldiers, collectively" is a common definition. Combat soldiers are troops, civilian guerillas are not. Peacekeeping soldiers are troops; peacekeeping civilians are not. Indian soldiers keeping the peace in Africa, even if unarmed and unwilling to take the life of even a fly, are Indian troops, because they are Indian soldiers. Canada sent soldiers, uniformed members of her armed forces, a.k.a. troops, to Vietnam. That fact is clearly demonstrated on <i>Veterans Affairs Canada</i> sites <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmic" class="external text" title="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmic" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> and <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmvn" class="external text" title="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmvn" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. More evidence is available elsewhere, such as by Googling "Vernon J. Perkins". Much good could result if reasonable people could agree that Canada did, indeed, send troops to Vietnam. What do you say? Do you agree that those soldiers who earned those medals were "troops?" <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 06:55, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While she does concentrate on liberals, she will also go after conservatives who she disagrees with. Though even if she was exclusively a commentator on liberals, she should still know that Canada is where liberal lefty draft dodgers went, and conservative fighters of communism came here. If they had been our ally during the war, would they have let our draft dodgers hide out there? Or let their citizens join our Army as opposed to just sending them over under Canadian command? (Please note: I'm not asking that question to get the info in. I just don't understand how you can reconcile these facts and not see how it doesn't affect her credibility as a "liberal commentator" if she misunderstood a liberal refuge like Canada during the war.)</dd>
<dd>I realize troops is a generalization, but she explained that the troops she meant were the fighting kind. Peace keepers are soldiers under the command of an international body or treaty. <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Michael_Grace_40f5.html" title="Kevin Michael Grace">Kevin Michael Grace</a> among others (FAIR) point out she was referring to Canada and America as the best of friends during Vietnam, and not going in to Iraq after sending troops to "Indochina" is some sort of betrayal of friendship. When troops operate as peace keepers they cease to directly represent their country. (For example American soldiers as part of a UN deployment become peace keepers when they don the blue helmet. They will be taking orders, not from the United States military but from whichever country is in charge of that particular UN mission. This concept is the same whether the troops in question are being deployed as UN, NATO, or the International Commission For Supervision And Control Service - ICSC. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> I provided a link to the same page earlier to prove my point; the award isn't for service to Canada it is to recognize participation in the ICSC and other treaty deployments in Southeast Asia. I think the U.S, military also awards similar medals to troops who participate in deployments under another flag. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:01, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No one denies that Canada sent those soldiers to Vietnam, so you can cease going on as though someone does. Further, everyone but you (or almost everyone) recognizes that those soldiers don't matter, here, because Coulter's claim that "Canada sent troops to Vietnam" was a claim that Canada sent American-allied troops to take part in the Vietnam war, in the manner of Australia. It was not merely a claim that Canada sent <i>some</i> soldiers to Vietnam for <i>some</i> purpose during that time. There is thus no need to delve into the hairsplitting question of whether the sending of the peace-keepers should be considered "sending troops" -- which of course depends upon exactly what one means by "troops" and by "sending troops", so that there is no single right answer. If, for arguement's sake, we take your view on that point as right, Coulter is nevertheless wrong. Much good would result if you would be so reasonable as to admit that -- foremostly that we could all cease wasting time on this red herring. -- Lonewolf BC 08:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What a weekend! LouSander asks for agreement that Canada sent troops to Vietnam, and provides proof that they did. SixthEstate won't even answer the question, saying a lot about him/her. Kizzle won't answer the question either, and maintains it's totally irrelevant in an argument about whether Canada sent troops to Vietnam. AnyNobody doesn't answer it. All three, instead of answering it, go on and on about other subjects. Then LoneWolf says that no one denies that Canada sent soldiers to Vietnam. Priceless!</p>
<p>Then Lonewolf says that "Coulter's claim that "Canada sent troops to Vietnam" was a claim that Canada sent American-allied troops to take part in the Vietnam war, in the manner of Australia." Show us a citation or two, Lonewolf.</p>
<p>LouSander offers a golden example of a demonstration of relevance to Coulter's notability --- boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Everybody agrees it's a valid demo. Kizzle, who can compile reams of old links about what she thinks is incivility but doesn't seem like it to me, can't do the same about an incident she thinks is important. Neither can Kizzle find a citation to the CSPAN interview. SixthEstate can't do either, and is stuck on being offended by anything that says the CBC isn't ABC, CBS, and NBC all rolled into one.</p>
<p>Here's the incident in question: Two years ago (!) Coulter says, in passing, "troops to Vietnam." The CBC guy jumps all over it. They discuss it, with the CBC guy continually insisting "no troops." Each time, Coulter says she thinks he's wrong. She doesn't even say "yes they did." She's politely doubting the CBC guy. The CBC guy is wrong, by the way, and he's extremely snotty in his wrongness. People on the internet, but almost nowhere else, rejoice in another Coulter error. Much later, somewhere that Kizzle can't find or is keeping from us, Coulter explains herself and points out the CBC guy's superagressive nastiness about a point that she's unsure of and he is. (We, on the other hand, know for sure that the CBC guy was wrong, but some of us won't admit it.) Then people who edit an encyclopedia excitedly jump up and down over Coulter's admission that she was "wrong" about a minor aspect of Canadian history. (Kizzle is excluded from this because she has never edited a single article, or something very close to that. SixthSense specializes in minor Canadian political figures. I don't know about Anynobody.)</p>
<p>The truth is that the CBC guy was wrong and won't admit it, Coulter has an imprecise knowledge of Canadian history and shows it by saying in the uncited interview that she had been wrong (when the Wikipedia-suppressed truth is that she was right). Not only won't the CBC guy admit that he was wrong, neither will Kizzel or SixthEstate or (with a few reservations) Anynobody. There's an obvious reason they won't admit that the CBC guy was wrong. It's the same reason they won't come up with a clear demonstration. Everybody knows what it is, so I won't say it. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Cop_4c9d.html" title="User:Good Cop">Good Cop</a> 13:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, I got mentioned 6 times! Somebody's a fan&#160;:) Two minor corrections, I'm a "he", and I <i>have</i> edited more than a single article, I actually took one from scratch to featured status on the front page. Hope that helps&#160;:) I'll reproduce my previous post dealing with your substantive points:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Rant</b> (optional read): I have heard the mantra that Lou and other pro-Coulter people have constantly re-asserted: Bob McKeown was wrong. Why was he wrong? Because you say that Coulter didn't necessarily mean "military" troops when she said: "Canada sent troops to Vietnam". The word "troops" could mean <i>non-combat</i> "troops" as well as <i>combat</i> "troops". Thus, there are two issues to consider: First, whether Ann Coulter was right:
<ol>
<li>That Coulter was referring to the non-combat definition and referring to the 240 non-combat peacekeeping troops in order to "contain" the "threat" that Vietnam posed, and thus, while her mea culpa subsequent to the interview never mentioned these non-combat troops, she was absolutely right.</li>
<li>That Coulter was referring to the combat definition, and, like she explicitly said on CSPAN, she was wrong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The second issue is whether or not McKeown was right:
<ol>
<li>That McKeown was referring to the non-combat definition of "troops", and thus was absolutely wrong, as at least 240 non-combat peacekeeping troops were sent to Vietnam.</li>
<li>That McKeown was referring to the combat definition of "troops", and thus was absolutely right, as Canada <i>never</i> sent any combat troops.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>My question to you then: If we're going to give Coulter the benefit of the doubt, and assume that she meant non-combat, then why can't we give McKeown the benefit of the doubt and assume that he meant combat troops?</li>

<dd><a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Cop_4c9d.html" title="User:Good Cop">Good Cop</a> and LouSander perhaps I haven't made myself clear. Because I've allowed myself to digress and ask questions about how some editors on this page arrive at their conclusions when compared to the reality of history. The point is this, it doesn't matter who is right or wrong, the article should not imply that either was right or wrong. <b>It is notable because it was widely discussed in media like Time Magazine, FAIR, and the CBC editorial link I provided earlier. The article should say something like: "Ann Coulter was accused of citing incorrect information on The Fifth Estate by the host, Mckeown. Supporters of Ms. Coulter cite an article in Time magazine, where John Cloud asserts that she was correct. Critics, like FAIR, argue that she was incorrect. For more on this see: Canada and the Vietnam War."</b> The wording doesn't have to be the same, but it should neutrally mention both sides and cite the Time, FAIR references. At the end, a link should be provided to the actual history. As I understand it, that is as NPOV as it gets in a situation like this involving opinions (a pro reference a con reference and lastly a factual reference). <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 23:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think using the "most popular" langauge of the TIME piece is problematic. The writer seems to only use Google hits as the basis for his assertion. But "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a>" and "<a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">popularity</a>" are two different things. Google hits alone do not determine notability. I've had this debate before on the Ewing Theory, which although popular was deemed to be a non-notable topic on its own. Just to clear up one mistake above. I do not think the topic is notable, but I am not 100% certain about my position. With that being the case, I am not going to keep arguing the same points over and over, nor will I edit war on this. But I must point out that there is original research in the section, which I removed. Ann says she is both right and wrong. To say she admitted anything would be synthesis. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 05:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter a fascist?</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps somewhere in the article we should mention that Coulter is essentially a fascist. Would this be appropriate? She is a textbook example of one, if there ever was one. I don't think this would be pov so much as a fact. I'm not experienced with wikipedia, so I don't really know how this works.

<dd>As I understand it, to qualify two things would need to happen. First someone notable would have to put that opinion forward in some kind of recognized media so that the idea of her being a fascist isn't an original idea put forth here. Second another notable would need to publish an opposing view in the same manner, to provide balance from a POV standpoint. Whether she really is a fascist appears to be irrelevant as truth is less a concern than NPOV.</dd>
<dd>Personally I don't think she is anyway, she is too religious. It could be argued that she has many traits in common with fascists, but their ideology puts nationalism above all else. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you look at the characteristics for Fascism; nationalism, authoritarianism, militarism, corporatism, totalitarianism, anti-liberalism, and anti-communism. Nationalism, "the claim that the nation is the only fully legitimate basis for a state," I've never really ever heard her say anything to that effect... Authoritarianism, again not much past what many people often say (note: "even very democratic and liberal states will show authoritarianism to some extent"). You might have a bit more evidence in the militarism department, though... Whatever; For Corporatism, which, apparently doesn't really have much to do with modern corporations. Being religious (church) she's definately not totalitarian (which doesn't like churches), even if you do think that she uses 'secret police, propaganda, restriction of criticism, and widespread use of terror tactics'. Anti-Liberalism. Ok, you've got one on her there. If there ever was a single person in the world who was anti-liberal, it's her. Anti-Communist, second strongest arguement for "Coulter the Fascist". So, as far as I can tell, there's really no arguement to it. Ok, now that I'm past my own "POV rant", I would concur with others in this regard, in that you can't say it in the article unless you have a credible source saying it, AND a credible source disputing it, to balance the viewpoint.</dd>

Hypothetically we could end up with an all against two situation or be right back at the current situation with RfC.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's bury this C-SPAN thing, eh?</span></h2>
<p>So I decided to try to find an actual verifiable source on this C-SPAN interview, somthing no one has apparently tried to do. <a href="http://www.cbcwatch.ca/?q=node/view/936" class="external text" title="http://www.cbcwatch.ca/?q=node/view/936" rel="nofollow">Here's a transcript</a>—still not a reliable source—but it's not edited to make Coulter look like she's confessing. Notice that she does seem to be a bit sarcastic about being wrong on "Americans born in Canada" because she <i>later claims that she was right</i>.

During a conversation with the host, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_McKeown_5c53.html" title="Bob McKeown">Bob McKeown</a>, Coulter asserted that "Canada used to be...one of our most...most loyal friends, and vice versa. I mean, Canada sent troops to Vietnam. Was Vietnam less containable and more of a threat than Saddam Hussein?" McKeown disputed her assertion by saying "No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam," to which Coulter eventually said "I'll have to get back to you on that". In a subsequent C-SPAN interview, Coulter justified her statement by referring to the 10,000 Canadians who voluntarily signed up with the American troops, though admitting she was wrong that the Canadian government had sent troops <b>but claiming that she was right that Canadian soldiers participated in the Vietnam War</b>, as well as taking a shot at McKeown:<sup id="_ref-fifth_estate_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fifth_estate" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<dd><i>Yes, 10,000 Canadian troops, at least. There is a War Memorial to them, at least for most of that. The Canadian Government didn't send troops [...] but [...] they came and fought with the Americans. So I was wrong. It turns out there were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada... I didn't believe him because I had read about Canadian troops in Vietnam, I was right.

<dd>"but right that Canadian soldiers had joined the US effort in the Vietnam War" is misleading. Canadians who join the US military are US soldiers, not Canadian soliders and, in any case, they never discussed whether or not individual Canadians signed up with the US military but whether or not Canada sent soldiers. That Coulter claims after the fact that this is what she meant is fine (if not very convincing) but it's not for us to say she was right or wrong. We just put out the information and let readers decide. We certainly shouldn't be agreeing in the article that what she meant was Canadians signing up with the US military and fighting as US soldiers, particularly when that assessment is POV and contestable. <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimitroff_df4d.html" title="User:Dimitroff">Dimitroff</a> 22:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section is about factual inaccuracy, not her taking pot shots at reporters. It's certainly not worth such a long quote, if it deserves any mention at all. The quote is also edited beyond recognition, encompassing the answers to more than one question; that's original research at best and possibly deceit. Unless you have a secondary commenting on it, it's not worthwhile to reproduce text from an unknown, unreliable, and unverifiable source as an enormous blockquote. It's against our policies. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 00:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, interpretting Coulter's comments, as you propose, is original research, even according to definitions of OR that you acknowledge. It's not clear that Coulter admitted anything wrong; she's known to be enormously sarcastic. In this case she said "I was wrong" followed by an absurd and untrue statement (Americans born in Canada served in Vietnam?—no, she seems to be sarcastically drawing attention to her supposed claim that Canadians participated even if they did so in the US armed forces), later followed by her insisting she was right. Her admission may or may not have been sarcasm as I suggest, but calling it either way moves us outside of the realm of verifiability. Well-informed verifiability is essentual for including primary sources.</dd>
<dd>Imagine if we sumarized Coulter's Dale Earnhardt error by saying that she congratulated liberals for their fine fact checking.

<p>The C-SPAN bit is now adequately sourced. The video itself is available from the C-SPAN archives. The transcript at CBCwatch would be unacceptably shaky on its own, but it agrees with the video on CBC, thus proving it records a real occurrence and confirming the veracity of its contents. Further, the material there includes a link to the C-SPAN video. The link no longer works, but it is unreasonable to suppose someone included a link to a video that would show the transcript was wrong. While a more authoritative transcript, or the video itself, would be much preferable, there is no reasonable cause to think the transcript is incorrect except perhaps in trivial detail. -- Lonewolf BC 02:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problems with the CBC transcript. It's relevant, non-trivial, and verifiable. However, the C-SPAN video is not available, and the source itself is to a blog, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">which is not reliable</a>. While it might normally be acceptable to lean on the transcript unless someone shows it to be wrong, WP:BLP demands a higher standard.</dd>
<dd>That said, if someone can meet this burden, I still believe editorial concerns would keep us from including such a long and frankly toothless block. We'd have to give the quoted excerpt some semblance of context, which demands it be even longer. As it is, selectively quoting Coulter's response from several different questions is misleading, possibly drawing readers to conclusions not in the source. Policy in either case forbids us from drawing conclusions <i>for</i> the reader as kizzle's proposal does. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 03:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given the choice between calling my passage original research and intentional deceit, I hope you're <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming</a> it's OR. We have a long quote here that is <i>highly</i> salient to a topic which has already been determined to be notable. Excluding this passage would greatly disservice the reader, but it needs to be done in a fair way that doesn't take up too much space, thus the presentation on how to include this quote is up for debate. I think that how it currently stands, with Coulter both saying she was wrong about Canada's government sending the troops but claiming she was right that Canadians participated in Vietnam is fair to her. Now, how we chop up the salient points in this long quote is tough, so maybe you'd like to help contribute a version of the quote that you think accurately portrays both her admission of being wrong about Canada sending troops and her affirmation that she was right that Canadians participated in Vietnam. It doesn't necessarily have to include the Ted Baxter remark that some editors on this page just absolutely love, it could be trimmed a bit more, but those two points should remain. This isn't about <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> anymore, as we know the words were spoken on national television and that no original analysis or point is being advanced: this is about <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and fairly characterizing and condensing her quote so that if Coulter visited this page, she would be happy as well. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could someone please at least cite the blog transcript?</dd>
<dd>I don't imagine it's deceit on your part, but it quite possibly is on the part of whoever wrote the original excerpt. I assume you did not write the edited block; its orgins remain mysterious. But yes, the author of edited block carefully removed context to make it seem like a confession although the overall tone is ambiguous. In particular, "Coulter justified her statement...though admitting she was wrong...but claiming that she was right", is OR. The transcript is not crystal clear on any of these points.</dd>
<dd>But again, this is still moot because we have no reliable source for this transcripts because blogs and personal websites are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">not acceptable sources</a>, most especially not for the biography of a living person.</dd>

<dd>She said she was right about something else.

<dd>Yes, without secondary analysis, the article should not reach any conclusion. I personally doubt Coulter would ever humbly admit an error (see: CONGRATULATIONS LIBERALS!). I do think she's being sarcastic, because she immediately talks about the Americans born in Canada, then claims she knew what she was talking about from her reading while McKowen did not. But none of this analysis has a place in the article either, I just mention it to emphasize "admission of error" is not the only likely interpretation.</dd>
<dd>I'm happy to call this a consensus then. Just add a comment on the transcript footnote that we would appreciate a better source for the C-SPAN transcript.

<p>This does not reflect what the authors of the cited source wrote. 'CJR checked out a sample of forty alleged errors — some backed by footnotes and others not — and found that nineteen were either accurate or could generously be considered fair comment and criticism.

<dd>I re-wrote the passage in question to take out any hint of "original research" or opinion. Whereas those were the issues upon which was based the previous agreement that it was better to have nought (at least so it seems from reading the talk-page), that agreement does not exactly apply. In other words, in re-introducing the material in the differing form which I have, I am not attempting to go against consensus, but to seek a new and (in my view and hope) better consensus. If most people <i>also</i> judge that nought is better than what I wrote, then so be it. There is also the potential of further refining the bit at issue. But perhaps the general thought is that it is simply better not to have <i>anything</i> more than the quote. If so then, again, so be it (though of course I disagree).<br />

<dd>No, sir, I took care <i>not</i> to say she admitted she was wrong. I make no synthesis or analysis, nor advance any position. I give a simple and accurate description of what she said. Your remarks about sourcing needs are therefore irrelevant, as being based on false assumptions. There is no original research involved here. For your remarks about consensus, see the end of my last post. -- Lonewolf BC 20:15, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>C'mon, man, I just told you. Given the fact that she said she was both right and wrong, and that certain elements in her quote were sarcastic (i.e. "It turns out 10,000 Americans were born in Canada"), your descriptor is not the only way of accurately describing it. There are editors here who believe that her "admission" was made sarcastically, which is a valid possibility, thus rendering your characterization incongruent with her meaning. Given the choice between editors deciding what she said and letting her speak for herself, especially in a quote that may contain sarcasm, we should always choose the latter. The passage you keep re-inserting is superfluous at best, as the reader can decide for themselves what Coulter said without us telling them what she said. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Edit Conflict)This is pointless. You have no support, and you're purposely working against consensus (Anynobody, Kizzle, Cool Hand Luke, Kyaa, myself and now Sixth Estate) for no stated reason. Does the consensus version violate any policy? You certainly haven't made that argument. You just want it they way you want it. That is not how WP works. Also you need to re-read what you wrote. You took care "not" to say she admitted anything? Well what's this? <i>While <b>admitting</b> that the Canadian government had not sent troops, Coulter insisted, on the basis of those volunteers, that she was right that Canadian troops had joined the American effort in the Vietnam War, and she criticised and insulted McKeown</i>. So you don't use the word "wrong" but your position is clear. Which is fine, as long as their is some source supporting your position. Please see WP:Concensus. Please show that a) concensus has changed, or b) file an RFC claiming the edit violates some policy. But in the meantime please revert to the consensus version.

You may be sensing my admitting frustration with your tactis re: the edit. You have made an edit, which is apparently against consensus. I am asking you to show why the consensus is wrong (what policy is being violated) since the consensus is that your proposal does violate policy (original research). I then characterized it as "you just want it the way you want it". I could be wrong in my characterization and am apparantly so. That's fine!

<p>I'm going to take off for a while. As it stands, 6 editors on both sides of the fence have agreed to Ramsquire's version which was proposed to specifically exclude any sort of editorializing about the CSPAN quote. Lonewolf, your version is re-inserting text which is entirely superfluous, does not serve the reader, and given the sarcastic nature of some of her comments, is disputable on whether Coulter "admitted" anything or not (especially since she also said she was right). Your proposal <i>has</i> been assessed. It has no concensus. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is not an altogether accurate description of how matters stand. In truth, only four editors have said that they prefer having nought to having the re-written version: Ramsquire, Cool Hand Luke, Kizzle (yourself, that is) and Sixth Estate. I suppose you would raise that to six with Anynobody and Kyaa, but their opinions on this particular matter are really unknown:<br />
Anynobody agreed to having nought over having the earlier version, but it is unclear whether "Works for me" was a statement of preference or merely one of acceptance and gladness at seeing agreement. Further, Anynobody has not commented at all on having nought versus having the re-written version. Kyaa merely made a jocular comment about something else entirely, within the former discussion, and has not actually taken a position on having <i>either</i> version as against having nought.<br />
Of the four, Sixth Estate has said, "I support Ramsquire's version," but has not said why -- which is fair enough, although as a mere vote it carries less weight than does an explained position.<br />
The other three of you prefer having nought over having the re-write (and over having any such summary, unless I have misunderstood any of you) foremostly because, you claim, the re-write is (and any such summary would be(?)) "original research". I think that you three are wrong about that. The question then becomes: is the re-write truly "original research"? I suggest that we concentrate on examining and resolving that.<br />
I hope there shall be no more of this personal stuff about how I'm a bad, bad wolf for raising this again, seeking a new consensus, and for trying to reason, alone, against a few people who presently disagree, and about how I am hopelessly outnumbered and should just bog off, and so forth, and worse. That sort of stuff is neither reasonable nor collegial.<br />

<p><br />
Sorry for the tardiness of my post, in a nutshell: I think you are both right and wrong, let me explain: <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> I agree that there shouldn't be any commentary about her comments in her article to avoid a biased POV. (Lonewolf BC I personally agree with info you are trying to include, but including it just plays into the "Liberal Media" label people like Coulter use. The interview speaks for itself without our help.) I do have a question though <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a>, why is interpreting a primary source <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? If others have interpreted the source the same way it doesn't seem original, biased maybe, but not original. To quote <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>:</p>
<p>An edit counts as original research if it does any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces a theory or method of solution; Lonewolf BC isn't the first person to make the assertions he/she has been trying to add in the cases I've seen.</li>
<li>It introduces original ideas; Lonewolf BC hasn't introduced anything new (some say she admitted, some say she didn't).</li>
<li>It defines new terms; I didn't see any new terms introduced by Lonewolf BC.</li>
<li>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms; I didn't see any terms redefined by Lonewolf BC.</li>
<li>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; I may be wrong, but I thought FAIR pointed to her "admission" on CSPAN.</li>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;Lonewolf BC hasn't synthesized new opinions or facts.</li>
<li>It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source. This obviously doesn't apply, unless I missed the new neologism. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:00, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>You are wrong about FAIR. They say nothing of the sort. That's one of the reasons I originally didn't want the C-SPAN quote in the article, but Kizzle convinced me that we could present her words without analysis, which avoids original research. If a secondary source had previously interpretted her statements, we could use that without it being original research, yes. But appears no reliable source has ever commented on her C-SPAN interview, so we are forbidden from doing it ourselves. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 15:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Anynobody, note that my response to Lonewolf contained no mention of "original research". The problem is, why is it so imperative that we have to spoon-feed the reader as to what Coulter said in her C-SPAN quote? They can figure it out for themselves. Lonewolf's passage is superfluous at best and serves no purpose for the reader. Let them read her words without any filter of editorializing or summarizing what she meant. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a>, my last post on OR was actually intended toward <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> and his point regarding it, which could be valid. I had thought I saw something in the FAIR article mentioning the CSPAN interview admission. Turns out the most important word in my last sentence was "thought" because having reread it there is no mention of CSPAN in it. No disrespect meant to you <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a>, but given the wrong impression I was using I couldn't understand why <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> kept arguing OR. Now it makes sense. Though I should point out that I did make the same point as you to Lonewolf BC, the CSPAN interview itself needs no commentary. Though I agree with his perspective personally, I was trying to explain that by adding commentary against Coulter it gives them an excuse to point to the "biased liberal media" once again. Even if I was right and FAIR had mentioned the CSPAN interview in an article, I didn't think it worked for NPOV. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comments from Good Cop</span></h3>
<p>I've been away. I don't know if this is the place for me to post this, but it looks like it might be. Sorry if it isn't. Also sorry if it's a great wall of text. This stuff isn't simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Coulter is constantly accused of lying, plagiarizing, etc. This fact is notable.</li>
<li>2. In quite a few cases, maybe/probably most, responsible people look into the accusations and find them to be untrue, unimportant, etc. This fact is notable.</li>
<li>3. There is a tendency for editors to include all the details of all the accusations in the main article, and NOT to include the other side, or to diminish its importance, etc. This fact is regrettable, but understandable due to the inflammatory nature of much of what she says.</li>
<li>4. The amount of article space devoted to these accusations &amp; responses is pretty large. I think undue weight is given to them.</li>
<li>5. The Canada business is mainly notable because Internet people seem to have picked up on it as some sort of argument Coulter lost, or some sort of egregious error she made, etc.</li>
<li>6. When you look at the facts of it, there is much less than meets the eye. Coulter said, almost in passing, "Canada sent troops to Vietnam." The host picked up on it as though someone had demeaned his country. The discussion was mostly/exclusively the host saying that Canada sent NO troops and Coulter politely saying she thought he wasn't right. (That is a little bit different than if she had insisted that Canada HAD sent troops.)The "outspoken comments" that the narrator identified were NOT from Coulter. They were from the host.</li>
<li>7. The facts of Canada in Vietnam are: a) she was officially neutral, b) there is lots of citable evidence, scholarly research, etc. that she actually helped the U.S. c) The Canadian government, including perhaps some of its <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_corporation.html" title="Crown corporation">crown corporations</a>, has an extremely strong interest in upholding the claim of Canadian neutrality in Vietnam, no matter who may challenge it. d) Neutral or not, Canada actually did send troops to the ICS and ICCS or whatever they are called. They went to Vietnam and Indochina, which is a collective term that includes Vietnam.</li>
<li>8. For whatever reason, some editors will not accept 7d. No amount of denial, or claims about the troops' mission, or opinions about what Coulter "really meant," or demand to see the troops referred to as "troops" can change the facts of 7d. No amount of insistence can make the fact that Canada sent troops irrelevant to a discussion most of which involved the host's strong insistence that she didn't.</li>

</ul>
<p>I have heard the mantra that Lou and other pro-Coulter people have constantly re-asserted: Bob McKeown was wrong. Why was he wrong? Because you say that Coulter didn't necessarily mean "military" troops when she said: "Canada sent troops to Vietnam". The word "troops" could mean <i>non-combat</i> "troops" as well as <i>combat</i> "troops". Thus, there are two issues to consider: First, whether Ann Coulter was right:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Coulter was referring to the non-combat definition and referring to the 240 non-combat peacekeeping troops in order to "contain" the "threat" that Vietnam posed, and thus, while her mea culpa subsequent to the interview never mentioned these non-combat troops, she was absolutely right.</li>
<li>That Coulter was referring to the combat definition, and, like she explicitly said on CSPAN, she was wrong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The second issue is whether or not McKeown was right:
<ol>
<li>That McKeown was referring to the non-combat definition of "troops", and thus was absolutely wrong, as at least 240 non-combat peacekeeping troops were sent to Vietnam.</li>
<li>That McKeown was referring to the combat definition of "troops", and thus was absolutely right, as Canada <i>never</i> sent any combat troops.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>My question to you then: If we're going to give Coulter the benefit of the doubt, and assume that she meant non-combat, then why can't we give McKeown the benefit of the doubt and assume that he meant combat troops? Is it also our place as editors to determine who was "right" in this case? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, it doesn't matter who was right or wrong. We should focus on what was said, not attempt to editorialize upon the statements made. Overall, this does not seem like a big deal nor warrent inclusion in the article, but I do not seek to argue against inclusion in this case, simply to keep the editorializing to a minimum. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 12:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rotten Editing</span></h2>
<p>Why would anyone archive a talk page and include the current discussions? Maybe there's an agenda there. Maybe they just don't know any better.</p>
<p>Why would anyone include Keith Olberman's hateful remarks in an article about Ann Coulter, especially when the incident being reported on is under extreme discussion? There is absolutely an agenda there. The agenda is to say nothing good about Ann Coulter, but to include as many criticisms of her as possible. Who can tell which editors have the agenda? By their fruits ye shall know them. There is absolutely no comprehension of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. The same editors have a big problem with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Look at some of their edit summaries. Reject the hate. It's time to just pull this whole episode from the article. It is an embarrassment to all ideas of fairness, "NPOV," and all the other smoke. DCLawyer 21:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The incident may be embarrassing to Ms. Coulter but it is well documented and just as Ms Coulter's criticisms of others are worth mentioning so are the criticisms of others (such as Olbermann) of Coulter. Balance, NPOV and BLP does not mean bios of controversial figures should be white-washed puff pieces.

<p>As a Canadian my agenda is to ensure that our history is not distorted or misrepresented by overenthusiastic editors who want to "prove" that Coulter didn't make a mistake. My second agenda is to represent the view that the Coulter gaffe is worthy of inclusion and isn't just dismissed in an attempt to hide something that might be embarrass the subject - part of this means countering the tendency to dismiss the incident through misrepresentation or degradation of the status of the well-respected and venerable flagship documentary program of Canada's principal broadcaster. A few editors, in an attempt to advance their views, have either dismissed the incident because it occurred on the CBC which they seem to represent as a minor news source of no importance or because it occurred on Canadian media instead of American media. As to Ms. Coulter herself, her personality or her political orientation I have no particular opinion or agenda. <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixth_Estate_40d8.html" title="User:Sixth Estate">Sixth Estate</a> 03:47, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Couldn't agree more Kyaa, especially given the "Limit the number" passage:
<dl>
<dd><i>Limit the number: Try to limit the number of categories. For example, a film actor that holds a law degree should be categorized as a film actor, but not as a lawyer unless his or her legal career was notable in its own right. However it is also important to ensure that categories contain all of the most relevant articles. This means that some prominent people, such as senior politicians who have held many different offices, will be in a considerable number of categories. Apart from these factual categories, for those categories that require an assessment of personal characteristics (e.g. art movement style...), <b>try to limit the number of categories to what is most essential about this person, something in the vein of: "give me 4 or 5 words that best characterize this person."</b></i></dd>

<p>I know that both Kyaa and Kizzle where editing this article during past wrangles over ID/Creationism and anti-Islamic categories. I suspect deletion of some of the other categories would be un-contested.

<dl>
<dd>Well, the main problem with the "anti-Islamic" one is that "Anti-Islamic Sentiment" keeps getting added when it should be "Critics of Islam" if anything. One of the two ID/Creationism cats may be ok, as long as it is supported by the article. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 05:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'll give on the Critics of Islam category, since this is shown through the article, but some of these cats are simply wrongly applied. Case in point "Anti-Communists", the category is primarily applied to politicians, Presidents and american Generals. Coulter may be a capitalist, but she doesn't seem to fit in the same category as Patton, Eisenhower and JFK. Its like one of those questions ona standardized test, which one of these does not belong. Coulter doesn't. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 05:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Re: Category Creationists. This category seems to be filled with preachers and Christian musicians, not political columnists like Coulter. Again, this seems like an odd choice of category for her, especially in light that there is no evidence cited of creationist belief or that she write on creationist topics or for creationist publications.

<dd>And definitely not one of the top 4 or 5 descriptors for Coulter. Should be removed per policy. Also, the answer here is not to start with a million categories and consider dropping each one. We should start with the most basic ones, like she's a lawyer, author, american conservative, pundit, maybe cornell grad, and then discuss the controversial ones for inclusion next. With the explicit wording in policy stating that our category list here contains too much fat, let's start with the basics and carefully move out. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Her being a lawyer is different though; it's apparently not linked to her notability. It's only briefly mentioned in the article, as her "background". The quoted passage explicitly refers to an almost identical situation, in which an actor holds a law degree; such a person <i>should be categorized as a film actor, but not as a lawyer unless his or her legal career was notable in its own right</i>. I don't really know, but either include relevant information regarding Coulter's legal career (what's there now would not be notable in its own right), or remove that category.</dd>

<dd>As you say, it's more of a metaphor. Also, I think we need to keep things in perspective. Political writers and best-selling authors are more of factual categories then "categories that require an assessment of personal characteristics". And it's important to remember that especially with controversial, outspoken people like Ann Coulter, there is likely to be greater need for categories then more 'ordinary' people. Given her extensive support of ID, clearly she belongs in that category. "Critics of Islam". Global warming skeptic doesn't appear to be reported on much in the article so at the current time, I think it could be removed <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Ann Coulter's racism is always a part of her political ideas. Wikiquote is full of examples of her racism. The beginning of the article is too vague about her ideas, making her sound like a regular conservative. Hitler's Wikipedia article, for instance, mentions his anti-semitism right in the beginning. Why did you allow that, if you're not suposed to make conclusions for the reader? If we followed that rule literaly, Wikipedia would be just a collection of quotes. Ann hates muslims. Ann's racism is as much of a fact as Hitler's. You're right, I shouldn't use the word 'often'. I suggest changing the paragraph to this, so as to remove the word:</p>
<p>"Known for her controversial style and unabashedly conservative views, she has been described by The Observer as "the Republican Michael Moore", and "Rush Limbaugh in a miniskirt". Coulter has described herself as a "polemicist" who likes to "stir up the pot" and makes no pretense at being "impartial or balanced". Among her controversial opinions are her blatant racism towards muslims, at one time calling them ragheads, and her self-confessed hatred of democrats."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anti-Islam Sentiment</span></h2>
<p>Coulter should be on the anti-islam sentiment category. One thing is to criticize the way some muslims handle their life and their political views, another is to say they are ragheads and that we should invade their countries and convert them to christianity. If that's not an anti-islam sentiment, just a mere criticism, then there is no reason for that category to exist. I'll put her on that category until a moderator tell me otherwise.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This has been discussed as above. This continued use of categories as an attack on the subject of the article is against BLP and the consensus built on this talk page/archives of the same. Please self-revert. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 03:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not an attack, my friend, it's a fact and you know it. She's not ashamed of hating islam, so you shouldn't think it's an attack. If putting a person on that category is an attack then Jesse Lee Peterson shouldn't be there either. I will wait for a moderator to tell me to change it.

<dd>There aren't moderators on Wikipedia. You have been asked multiple times to avoid making changes which could be taken as against consensus or as vandalism on this article. We keep asking you nicely to stop acting unilaterally against the consensus built by active editors of this article.

<dd>Look, you are so polite I think you won't mind waiting until the editors come here and give their opinions, okay? Tell me, why doesn't she fit that category? Give me just one good reason. Do you think she doesn't hate muslims? If so, why? The "ragheads" and "convert them to christianity" comments are not enough for you? Would you be convinced only if she murdered a muslim on live TV?

<dd>You're using the category improperly. If you look at the articles listed under anti-islam sentiment, you will see they are organizations not individuals.

<dd>Well, there was Jesse Lee Peterson there, but conveniently and strangely after I mentioned him someone removed him from that article. And I'm not basing it on her feelings, I'm basing it on her spoken opinions. Why don't you erase the information that Hitler is an anti-semite in his article? Both him and Ann Coulter admit to hate a specific group. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBP_c58b.html" title="User:GeorgeBP">GeorgeBP</a> 04:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The thing is, you keep repeating yourself, saying "that's just your opinion" and all that crap, but you KNOW what I'm saying is true. Ann Coulter ISN'T ASHAMED OF HATING MUSLIMS. She ADMITS IT HERSELF. Why should we think putting HER OPINION on her article would harm the NPOV? I'm not making conclusions out of her actions, I'm simply putting her opinion on the article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBP_c58b.html" title="User:GeorgeBP">GeorgeBP</a> 04:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Well, I will sum up my points: 1) Ann Coulter hates muslims. That's a fact, she admits it, and even you has to admit it. 2) The Anti-Islam Sentiment category is not exclusive to institutions. There are other types of articles in there. The description says it's for articles which are RELATED to Anti-Islam Sentiment. This article is related, whether you want it or not. Now, if you think ANY of these points are not true, tell me why.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBP_c58b.html" title="User:GeorgeBP">GeorgeBP</a> I believe you have a valid point, but please do not violate the 3RR as doing so can cause much distraction from the actual point you are trying to make. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> why is including Ms. Coulter in a category of Anti-Islam Sentiment an attack? I can't accept your argument that the category is for groups and not people because it also includes: <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Klein%E2%80%99s_2006_Islamophobia_Radio_Experiment_ecd3.html" title="Jerry Klein’s 2006 Islamophobia Radio Experiment">Jerry Klein’s 2006 Islamophobia Radio Experiment</a>. She does use the term <a href="../../../r/a/g/Raghead.html" title="Raghead">raghead</a> more frequently than any other mainstream media figure I can think of (I don't even think <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> say that). When a person continues using racial/cultural pejoratives without apologizing, it seems to be at the very least an anti sentiment. To work it another way, can you cite pro-Islamic comments she has made? Certainly if she were saying nothing but nice things about Islam it would be an attack for somebody to say she had an anti-Islam sentiment. I don't remember her going out of her way to rave about Muslims before 9/11 either. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jerry Klein's experiment, and even CAIR agrees that it was an experiment, was an attempt at getting people to show that there are problems with Americans expressing an anti-muslim sentiment on his medium. It was an experiment to show the anti-islam sentiment, not that Klein is anti-islamic himself. And, as Coelecan points out in an edit summary of the anti-islam sentiment cat, it is not to be used with biographies of living people. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 07:48, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> not to sound sarcastic (really), but assuming I accept that someone has sole ownership of the category; How does an experiment conducted by an individual skirt by the group requirement. To be clear, I was not implying Klein is anti-Islamic. I'm not sure how I gave you that impression, but I thought it was understood that said category was about the issue of anti-Islam sentiment. This would include people working to eliminate anti-Islam sentiment as well as it does those who spread it. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 07:57, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In common usage, Cat:AIS is not used on BLP articles, Cat:Critics of Islam is. We should continue this trend, using AIS for institutions not individuals. This doesn't seem to be an issue to anyone but edit-warriors. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 08:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Respectfully, not wanting to change a trend doesn't make logical sense <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a>. A person or group can be critical of the actions of a religion without being against it, such people/groups would belong under the critics category. A person or group who advocates elimination of Islam would be espousing anti-Islamic sentiment. The trend you are citing has any person with any negative view of Islam as a critic of Islam, yet if the same views are expressed by a group they should be included in Anti-Islam sentiment because that is where groups belong? If the categories we were talking about were <b>Groups critical of Islam</b> and <b>People critical of Islam</b>, you would have a valid point. The issue I am concerned with is the logical fallacy of segregating people from groups based on that criteria alone. I don't mean to give the you the impression that I am an edit warrior. Frankly if I believed in such tactics I would just jump in and start reverting information I disagree with and refuse to discuss my opinions like edit warriors often do. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I'm not including you as an edit warrior. Tonight's blocked user was just another in a long line of them though and it is tiresome, you try to reason with them, get flamed and eventually they get blocked. My problem isn't that they want to get it included in another category, but that they want to force it into another category and leap to attack rather than coolly discuss the issue on the talk page. Inclusion in AIS has been discussed previously, if there is a change in consensus, I'd be willing to live with it, but there doesn't seem to be one (since there was an previous discussion on categories open and noone was suggesting readding AIS to the list.) <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 08:31, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, if you look at the discussion for Cat:AIS, consensus there is that it is not to be used on persons, rather to use the more neutral Critics of Islam cat. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 08:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The reason not to put Coulter in the "Anti-Islamic sentiment" category is only that she is a person, not a sentiment. It has nought to do with keeping a neutral point-of-view or with the guidelines for biographies of the living. -- Lonewolf BC 21:14, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are no "sentiments" in that article. There's Jerry Klein’s 2006 Islamophobia Radio Experiment, Vatican Islam Conspiracy, ACLU of N.C. &amp; Syidah Matteen v. State of North Carolina and Jesse Lee Peterson, neither of which are "sentiments". Don't be silly.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Indeed, this is why we have a Critics of Islam category, which she certainly belongs in. There might be reason to create a new category for "Anti-Islamic people" (cf Category:Anti-Semitic people), but if Coulter is your only candidate, forget about it.

<dd>Well, one category doesn't excludes the other. There is Critics of Islam, which is self-explanatory, and there is Anti-Islam Sentiment, a category that, according to its own description, is for articles RELATED to anti-islam sentiment. This article is DEFINITELY related to anti-islam sentiment, something everyone here seems to agree (except for the Pokemon guy).
<dl>
<dd>As the Pokemon guy, I'd like to point out that I, Luke, and pretty much everyone else have come to the agreement that this article does NOT belong in the category you demand it to be placed in. Representatives of both sides of Coulter's love-hate spectrum have agreed to this....

<dd>I haven't seen this "pretty much everyone", in fact, I've seen people wanting the category Anti-Islam People to be created, just like Anti-Semitic People. As long as we don't have that category, and knowing that the Anti-Islam Sentiment category is not unfair to Coulter (only to people who don't believe what she says is what she thinks) Coulter stays where she belongs, with her "intelectual exagerations". I want only one person to refute these two arguments: 1) Ann Coulter hates muslims. That's a fact, she admits it.</dd>

<p>2) The Anti-Islam Sentiment category is not exclusive to institutions or "sentimens". There are other types of articles in there, including people.

<dd>You're missing the point, man. Her quotes are just "intelectual exagerations", we can't use what she says to confirm what she thinks. I think the only way to write an encyclopedia is to somehow have acess to her own thoughs and feelings by supernatural ways. If her own quotes and writings don't represent what she thinks (and I will repeat them, just for the sake of it: "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity", "They're never very high in anyone's caste system, are they? Poor little Pakis", "Bumper sticker idea for liberals: News magazines don't kill people, Muslims do", "I think our motto should be, post-9-11, 'raghead talks tough, raghead faces consequences'"), well, then WHAT does?</dd>

<dd>If you wanted to put in the article that she is an Islamaphobe in the opinion of CAIR, I would have no problem with that.

<dd>I haven't written anywhere in the article that she is, in fact, an islamophobic (even if everyone knows she is). What I did was put the Islamophobia article in her See Also list, because she is mentioned in that article and by many sources as a islamophobic, so the article is pertinent to her. I also put her in the Anti-Islam Sentiment cat because that category was created for articles related to anti-islam sentiment, something this article definitely is. That category wasn't created for "sentiments" or groups, otherwise it would have been said in its description. Not a singe person has refuted these arguments.</dd>

<dd>I support this; you are correct. Including such a statement is entirely factual and verifiable (with a smattering of secondary coverage on CAIR's label backing it up).

<dd>I also support including her in the category. Seriously, she is Islamophobic by her statements alone. When she calls Muslim ragheads, and doesn't apologize it's obvious she has something against them.

<dd>1. If you want to link Ann Coulter to the Islamaphobia article, then please do so under the section of the article that discusses her controversial comments (see the Canada/Vietnam section as an example of what I am talking about). To do so at the bottom of the article is misleading (as it suggests that her notability is related to hatred, which it isn't, and therefore may violate BLP) and implies that she is a known Islamaphobe which violates WP:BLP. 2. The "Anti-Islam Sentiment" category simply is NOT appropriate here as it is not supported by high quality sources. Her listing as a Critic of Islam is sufficient and well sourced. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 19:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Since she's a living person it's prudent to have a very high quality source (preferably several) confirming her Islamophobia. Mainstream sources simply don't call her that, and it should give us pause. Either it's because they're afraid of libel, or they suspect she's joking (which notable coverage like the <i>Time</i> article hints at). Either way, we should include relevent coverage on her like CAIR's label, but placing in her this category seems to be against WP:BLP. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 23:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The category <b>does not say that she is an Islamophobe</b>. I fail to see how it's a BLP violation. It simply does not say what you keep implying it does. It doesn't. Does not. That is not said anywhere. The "Critics of Islam" category, by the way, was just deleted <i>because</i> it was being used as a catch-all for bigots and other opponents, rather than scholarly critics for which it was created in the first place. The result of the first CfD discussion was that "Critics" would be for reasonable scholarly criticism, and "Sentiment" would be for other cases. Lumping legitimate criticism in with bigotry got the category deleted. I see no reason to exclude her from the category, especially now that it's the only one of its kind. ~<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SwitChar_62fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/SwitChar"><font color="#005500">c</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_Gallery_ccb3.html" title="User:SwitChar/Gallery"><font color="#005500">g</font></a></sup></span> 01:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Women's right to vote</span></h2>
<p>There are people here who seen fanatically intended in removing any new information that could harm the already harmed reputation of Ann Coulter. I've just written a paragraph that is properly sourced, including her own quotes. She said women shouldn't have the right to vote. I've put this information there. How is it POV?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first one is a quote from a web page dedicated to finding Coulter's embarassing quotes. It's a partisan source, is by no means notable, and you can't rely on it quoting her in context. The second one is at least from a real source, but it's still partisan, and seems to be an editorial, not a news story. The idea that a single rhetorical flourish means that she is genuinely opposed to the idea of women voting is a POV. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 20:52, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sources are there to show that she did say that, not to judge what she said. The two quotes are also in her Wikiquote page. Google this: "It would be a much better country if women did not vote" "Ann Coulter". You will see that she DID say that, which is what the paragraph is implying. It does not judge what she said, only informs it. Oh, and I'm so sick of people referring to her quotes as "intelectual exagerations" and "rhetorical flourishs". Every time she says something stupid, people come with these arguments.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Islam and Judaism</span></h2>
<p>Within both groups you will find Ethnic Muslims and Ethnic Jews, you will find both are religions. Submitting to Allah is Islam, but it is also a classification of a group of people. Somali are Ethnic Muslims. Cleary the bigger issue is what do you call this statement "Islam is Evil", or "Jews are Evil", "Muslims are Evil". Critic isnt the correct cat for these kind of people. That is the bottom line. hatred against a religious group is a form of racism. dont mangle lingusitics to mask reality. and the term antisemitic rarely refers to hatred of Arabs and Ethiopians. If ann is so uneducated she doesnt know the difference between Arab and Muslim, we must then judge only what she says, Arabs are Christian as well so she must be talking about Muslims in general. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 15:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Computers dont edit here humans do, everything on this site is a opinion. a pov. Is it fair to say she is a bigot--yes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editwarring</span></h2>
<p>One of the involved editors has been blocked for violation of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> rule. I can see that other involved editors believe that reverting each other to death is a useful device. It is not. Editwarring accomplishes absolutely nothing. I am placing this article on my watchlist from now on. Any further editwarring will surely result in the article being protected, at best, or at worst other editors getting dinged for 3RR violations. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 00:49, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although none of the editors involved in removing the misused category for BLP/ATT/V/OR/NPOV rationales have broken 3RR, I'd like to remind the admin of the following phrase from <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>: "Where the information is derogatory and unsourced or poorly sourced, the three-revert rule does not apply." I'd also point out that a 3RR report was placed nearly 30 hours prior to the blocking of GeorgeBP and untouched by admins. A checkuser has shown that GeorgeBP was using sockpuppets to hide his breaking of 3RR, but he was not blocked at that time either. A report was placed on the BLP noticeboard nearly 12 hours ago in relation to the misuse of this category. We have tried to discuss this to death on this talk page and on the category talk page. It is all swell and happy and sweetness and light to come here and give us a nice warning, but damnit, please take care of problems before they escalate like this! Thank you, I'm just a bit frustrated right now. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 01:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Kyaa if you are frustrated it is best you lie down and rest for a little. because your frustration clouds your reason, then your poor reason clouds GeorgeBP and the cycle goes around.

<dd>And I refer you to WP:NOT a soapbox. I'm frustrated with the lack of handling of this case by the admins of wikipedia, there were numerous attempts made to have intervention taken to avoid this, thousands of kb of attempts at discussion on this page and that of the category. Lecturing us for handling the situation as best we could due to a seeming lack of interest in the problem resolution process by the admins of wikipedia is questionable. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 16:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that categorization of living people should be handled <i>very</i> carefully. What I was referring to is the ease about which some editors use the revert option as the means to assert their viewpoints. If there are users that are in your view violating <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, place a notice at the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard</a> or at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, rather than editwar about it. The categorization of Coulter, an indisputably controversial figure, is by the look of it a dispute between editors of this article and not a clear case of BLP violation. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 16:58, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was posted at the BLP noticeboard. A check user was requested and fulfilled which returned confirmed and likely results for all referred socks. No blocks were done on the checked sock puppeteer or his socks. No admins stepped in on the BLP request. The lack admin actions resulted editors punting as best they could and, in my case at least, a loss of faith in admins as a whole. And your responses are only verifying my feelings. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 17:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd also refer you to the CfD discussion which shows that there is a likely consensus that the use of this category IS a BLP infraction in cases like this. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 17:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>There's been a fairly solid consensus on the categories issue. There are parts of this article that seem to be more and more solidified due to previous edit warring, discussion (arguing), and then consensus. Oftentimes it's automatic to revert what's already been decided should not be included in the article. So calling what Kyaa did as participating in edit warring seems a bit absurd at this point.</p>
<p>And Kyaa, I've got all the symapthy in the world for you on the admin intervention issue. I had an IP user harassing me for quite a while (stemming from my involvement in this article), and I got minimal /poor/no help from a couple admins. It took a case of the user threatening my life for an admin to ban him for six months. Sad that vandals/disruptors can be given so much leeway. Just hang in there and try not to let it get you down. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 19:54, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
