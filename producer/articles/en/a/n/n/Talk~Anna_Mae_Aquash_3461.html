<p>Good luck Badagnanai. I've followed the AIM sagas for years and there is no end to the shenanigans. I agree with the wikipedia entry and that the Looking Cloud / Graham cases are highly questionable. It's hard to understand why people are still out to get AIM. The organization has been defunct for at least 20 years and there is no threat to anyone posed by the people involved back then. Looking Cloud was a defenseless alcoholic person living on the streets, manipulated by some very sick people with agendas having nothing to do with solving the murder. I am amazed that this wikipedia site has been left untouched by the viscious and largely unsupported accusations surrounding this murder.</p>
<p>Paul Wolf</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the input. I guess the best solution would be for those involved (in any way) with the murder to truthfully admit what they did. Not sure that will happen, though. There are wrongs done within and among the members of any group, no matter how altruistic the motive. I think one question is that some members believe they should not be subject to U.S. laws in light of that nation's history vis a vis Native peoples, and that whatever wrongs were done should be righted "in house." The irony is that some might argue that the paranoia that probably helped to incite the murder was contributed to by government itself. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 04:27, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the controversy over the letter, a photo of the letter itself should be placed on the site, allowing others to see that it is in Aquash's handwriting.

<p>Claypoole is not credible. She is trying to make a name on this case. She is not a recognized authority by Native People. She has removed reference to material by Native Writers. Claypoole is not Native. It is unfortunate that she is demeaning this case with her greed.</p>

<p>I have read the section on <i>Who Killed Anna Mae?</i> several times now and I have to confess that I find it to be, frankly, poorly written. There is almost no coherent flow to the section and it is unbalanced several places. There are POV sentences in here that clearly do not reflect Wikipedia’s NPOV policy. For example, “One of Aquash's two daughters, Debbie Pictou Maloney, is a Constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which engaged in surveillance against AIM members in the 1970s, provided intelligence regarding AIM to U.S. security forces, and arrested Leonard Peltier in Alberta, leading to his extradition to the United States and ongoing imprisonment." and "If Looking Cloud's confession is not true, this would render some comments made by certain Native journalists and some of the Pictou/Maloney family questionable." After looking over the history of edits I feel that this is probably a case of so many edits having been made over time that grammar and flow were lost. Rather than embarking on a significant rewrite of the section and making arbitrary edits, I do want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to express themselves first. I would like to emphasis that my concern here is that the article is grammatically correct and encyclopedic in nature. Sláinte! --Cafe Irlandais 23:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just edit it so it makes grammatical sense, preserving content. That's normal. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 23:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please forgive me, but judging from the tone of your comment, are you telling me that I am not allowed to make any change to the content of the section? I am fairly new to Wikipedia but everything else I have seen says that I should be bold in my edits, but you appear to be telling me the opposite. Is there someone whose permission I am supposed to ask in order to make a change? I'm not trying to pick a fight, just trying to understand how things work.

<dd>Of course you may edit as you see fit. However, just be aware that many skilled editors have spent months (or years) building the information here. I personally try to be as judicious as possible and use the "discussion" page before making large content edits (unless something is clearly and blatantly inaccurate), in order to respect the previous contributions of others. It's a community of editors and everything works best if all the editors can agree upon the new versions. This system usually works really well. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 12:25, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnna_Mae_Aquash_3461.html" title="Edit section: Items for deletion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Items for deletion</span></h3>
<p>There are two items in this section which, after attempting to reword them, I really feel should probably be deleted from the article altogether. The first is the rather lengthy quote from Leonard Peltier. While at one time it may have been notable that Peltier “has made five statements on the U.S. government's case against Looking Cloud and Graham”, I think that this notability has been overcome by events. The fact that Peltier, through his own Leonard Peltier Defense Committee, has issued a statement distancing himself and the LDPC from John Graham and the John Graham Defense Committee invalidates the quote in the manner in which it is currently presented in the article. The comment that this statement "has never been verified as coming from Leonard Peltier himself” is, well, ridiculous. If not by the LPDC of which his own lawyers, friends, and family are members, then by whom is the statement's authenticity supposed to verified?</p>
<p>At this point, based on the case’s development, it appears Peltier’s relevance to this article may come from whether or not he or his actions played a role, directly or indirectly, in Aquash’s death. This not to say in any way that Peltier was anywhere near the scene of the crime. Every reputable source agrees that he wasn't. Rather that he or his actions may have been a motivating factor for others. However, this is highly speculative and represents only the stated opinions of some, and certainly not all, of the principals. As such, if it is mentioned in the article at all, it should be clearly identified and treated as speculation and opinions, and no more that.</p>
<p>The second item that I feel should be deleted deals with Graham’s refusal to take a polygraph. As the paragraph states, no authoritative entity has requested that he take this test, therefore mentioning his refusal has an unfair and pejorative connotation to it. I understand the Indigenous Woman for Justice may feel that they have a vested interest in having a polygraph administered, but I feel that their lack of any type of official status precludes its request from being included in this article.</p>
<p>Unless there is a reasonable objection, I will move to delete these two items. Cheers, Cafe Irlandais 15:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your first proposal and have no strong opinion on the second.

<p>What is thought about Hendricks' book? I am curious about what others think about this publication regarding more recent information about Anna Mae Aquash's murder. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnishinaabe-bimaadizi_3c10.html" title="User:Anishinaabe-bimaadizi">Anishinaabe-bimaadizi</a> 02:48, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have read most of it (bits and pieces here and there), and am not exactly sure what to think. I picked it up for a paper I'm writing about the political contexts in which the documentaries <i>Trudell</i> and <i>Incident at Oglala: The Leonard Peltier Story</i> were made, and also because it pertains to things I am passionate about. Hendricks definitely went to great lengths to get as close to the bottom of Anna Mae Aquash's murder (and the events leading up to, and surrounding it) as he could get. I like the fact that Hendricks was so unbiased. As someone who looks up to many of the AIM noteables, as well as the movement itself, it was extremely hard to read some very specific things <i>said</i> during Arlo Looking Cloud's trial. Sometimes the truth hurts though, eh? (What of it was actually true anyhow...Kamook Nichols' words hurt the most) However, I must say that I respect Hendricks for fighting the FBI as hard as he did to force the release of documents relative to his investigation (he sued them multiple times for violating the Freedom of Information Act). And while Hendricks made some disparaging remarks about some people that I greatly respect, I think Hendricks' heart is in the right place...all in all, I would recommend reading it. I hope it gets a great deal of mainstream attention, to be honest. A lot of what has been pointed out in this book is information that the greater public needs to know. Luckily, Hendricks didn't get tied up in court for speaking the ugly truth like Peter Matthiessen did with <i>In the Spirit of Crazy Horse.</i> Everything that happened with all of this has always, and will always, make me sick to my stomach.

<dd>I’ve just had the opportunity to read Steve Hendrick’s book and I would like to join <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnishinaabe-bimaadizi_3c10.html" title="User:Anishinaabe-bimaadizi">Anishinaabe-bimaadizi</a> in recommending it to anyone who is interested in the story of Anna Mae, AIM, and the events that occurred on Pine Ridge. It is well researched, entertainingly written, and presents quite a bit of new information as well as expanding, clarifying, and tying together facts that were already public knowledge.</dd>

<dd>All too often investigative books such as this will gloss over the misdeeds of one side while those of the other are hyped. That’s not the case here. He gives AIM, on the whole, an evenhanded, warts and all portrayal, and for this he should be commended. Steve does not pretend that AIM was simply a peaceful, well-intentioned organization working to improve the dire conditions of Native Americans but who was victimized by an overzealous FBI for their efforts. Where “AIMers” have committed egregious acts he pulls no punches (save on one or two notable occasions). Nor does he let WKLDOC, and in particular Ken Tilsen and Bruce Ellison, get a free pass, and nor should he. Both of these “gentlemen attorneys” are, it would appear, deliberately withholding key information.</dd>

<dd>I don’t believe that I would call the book entirely unbiased, particularly with respect to the FBI. Indeed, anytime an author asks the likes of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Matthiessen_2d2f.html" title="Peter Matthiessen">Peter Matthiessen</a> to vet their work it’s a pretty good indication of which way the wind is going to blow on the subject, and on that score Steve’s book doesn’t disappoint. His portrayal of the FBI is decidedly uncomplimentary. That the FBI engaged in actions that, I believe, any reasonable person would find reprehensible is beyond doubt, and for that they should be “stomped”. But I seriously doubt that <i>everything</i> they did was evil, corrupt or incompetent. For reasons like this I am always a little bit leery when I read a book of investigative journalism where little or no good is said about one of the principals, regardless of which side of the argument they’re on. It makes me feel as though I am being lead to a certain conclusion under the guise of being asked to look at the facts and then decide for myself. But then Steve is under no obligation to follow Wikipedia’s <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy, and I am glad that he doesn’t. I firmly believe that the FBI should be held to a higher standard, and that they should also be held accountable for their transgressions.</dd>

<dd>I don’t agree with all of Steve’s conclusions, and on occasion I felt his interpretation of the facts was “interesting”. There were three things in the book that I took outright exception to. But having said all that, I thought the book was simply excellent and I highly recommend it. It was an enjoyable read and I look forward to reading it again. If you are thinking about getting it, do so. You won’t be disappointed. Cheers! Cafe Irlandais 20:54, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
