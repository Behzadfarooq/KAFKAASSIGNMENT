<p>You will be missed, Anna. At least you're with your son now.</p>
<p>I feel really sorry for that baby. She don't got a momma no more.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">**CLARIFICATION**</span></h2>
<p>J. Howard Marshall is a huge billionaire. In 4/86, Forbes estimated his net worth at around $550 million. Therefore, when Nicole was going to receive approximately $-486 million, one could understand why his children were so upset. With Marshall a billionaire, $486 million was no big deal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Valuations on private companies are highly speculative but that is mostly a minor issue. What the elder Marshall considered "no big deal" cannot be considered anything but speculation. Considering what I have seen reported, I think most would say everyone involved in the case thought $486 million was a big deal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think clarification is warranted on the $830,000 judgment against Anna Nicole Smith for the sexual harassment case. It was a <i>default</i> judgment. The only reason judgment was ruled against her was failure to appear/participate in her trial. (And what's unfortunate, which I don't have the source right now.. is that Maria was a girlfriend - Anna is bisexual - and she filed this civil suit against her. Again, probably for the money.)</p>
<p><a name="Citation_Needed" id="Citation_Needed"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citation Needed</span></h2>
<p>I think we should rename this article "Citation's Needed". I mean c'mon people, there is 17 of them on her profile! There is 1 for "The case has gone on for more than a decade, producing a highly publicized court battle in Texas and several judicial decisions that have gone both for and against Smith in that time". This info can be found all over the Internet!. It is talked about on the news every other day. Why is a Cit needed? There is 1 for the "Supreme Court's decision on May 1, 2006". There is is even 1 asking for a Cit on her becoming a spokesperson for Trimspa after she lost weight. You can find those commercials on every single channel and she went on every major talk show to tell the world how she lost the weight by using Trimspa!!! I don't follow her work, but there should be someone on this site that does. Why do you need a Cit for every bit of info? No other profile on this Wiki site asks for sources on common everyday facts. I'm not going to add or delete from this profile, because I don't follow her work. But I think it is stupid and unprofessional for someone to place "Citation Needed" all over a profile, on topics that are common knowledge, even from someone like myself who doesn't even know any of the movie Anna has been in. But she has now passed on, so the contributers here should remove the unnecessary Citation from her profile. And next time, RESEARCH IT YOURSELF! I do it all of the time for other profiles. Let's make this place look like a professional Wiki of knowledge. I'm just sick of people places Cit's where ever they pleae, when they could easily find the sources needed.....</p>

<dd>It might help if you would follow normal practice and post your comments to the bottom. This is a long discussion and there is a good chance people are going to ignore comments here. Also, you might want to read wikipedia policy, especially on the need for sources. Bear in mind a editor is fully entitled to remove unsourced information. Definitely it's better to tag or delete then leave unsourced information as is <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a place for info. If you can't find the info yourself, why post a cit for it? Why bother altering anything under that profile? I am sick of seeing cit's everywhere. I have found info for many of them that took my five minutes to find. If people are that lazy, then don't post anything. You are just trying to defend and/or justify the lazy paths of people on here. Try finding the info yourself, if you can't, then place a cit. But this place looks more like a bunch of kids are playing around on it, instead of adults who should know how to use the Internet.</p>

<dd>It would be irrelevant since vandalism to anyone's page generally ensues when their names appears in the news. When that tidbit about <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Garland_f81b.html" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a>'s lost childhood records came up, her page experienced a surge of vandalism. Activity on wikipedia, unless monumental, is not something that would be worth noting. Personal reactions to Anna's death, from family, friends, colleagues, et. al would suitable for this section. --<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 03:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Obituary</span></h2>
<p>Virgie Arthur, Anna Nicole's mother, shocked America last weekend (October 14, 2006) when she appeared on CNN newswoman NANCY GRACE's show and warned her daughter to look out for Stern. Holding back tears, her mother advised, "Be very careful about who you hang around with - because you may be next." Arthur went so far as to suggest that Stern is trying to get his hands on the millions her daughter looks set to inherit from her ex-husband, oil tycoon J HOWARD MARSHALL. She added, "If Howard Stern marries her and she ends up dead, then who does the money go to? "I just know that Danny didn't kill himself. He did not overdose himself.". Mark Furhman of the OJ Simpson trial also believes it was a double murder and Howard Stern is the prime murder suspect.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Father of her Child</span></h2>
<p>In light of these unfortunate circumstances. Prayers go out to the family. I wonder how this will affect the outcome of the court case with her daughter and Birkhead. It might make it easier to do the paternity test instead of blocking it. However, there has been another gentleman that has come forward to claim he is possibly the father. A gentleman by the name of Chris Haupt. I think it could more of a way to get attention even though he was spotted a few time with her last summer in LA. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out. Again, a tragic turn of events and I wish the family all the best. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.215.128.103 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.215.128.103.html" title="User talk:69.215.128.103">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.215.128.103_b171.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.215.128.103">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Possibly if she has a will and it designates who the child goes to than that will have greater prescedence. Also the child is a citizen of the Bahamas.

<dd>It's dangerous because Wikipedia has to get information on living people correct. You can't go make accusations about someone.

<dd>And to add to the above, the rules apply to talk pages too. I don't like editing other people's comments and usually don't, but the wording that I removed from the anon's posting basically suggests a certain individual is responsible for her death. There is no way to know something like this until a criminal investigation is completed, if one is even warranted, so to even speculate this in a talk page opens Wikipedia to libel concerns. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dispute the neutrality as well as the necessity of the "Reaction" section (under the "Death" section). It is true that Perez did deface some pictures of Anna Nicole Smith on his site, but the "mocked sadness" sounds like someone's opinion and not an objective fact. I also do not think this section is needed on Smith's final biography because several other articles on Wikipedia do not have quotes from other people concerning another person's death, whether the death was recent or occurred well before the start of Wikipedia.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_evil_fluffyface_e043.html" title="User:THE evil fluffyface">THE evil fluffyface</a> 02:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The section is necessary because reactions to her death are relevant to how she was viewed in life.

When the temp edit is removed the mock sadness should be removed and just left to the defacing he has done of her pics.

<dd>It is inacurrate to say that he was "with her" when she died. CNN has reported that he was at the hospital, but that his whereabouts at the time her body was discovered is unknown.

<dd>I object to Stern being referred to as her boyfriend. There is much speculation that the "marriage" which was not legally binding was purely a legal manuever.

<p>The autopsy has not yet been confirmed. Sources say that there were persription Drugs in her hotel room but they did not find any inside of her. Smith's case is an unusual one. It wil take about 3-4 weeks until anything will be confirmed. My Thought? Trimspa. From all of the pills and other Trimspa products she had been taking, her weight had been changing rapidly. This is very unhealthy for someone who has been taking many drugs. I may be wrong, but this may just be the thing that lead to Smith's Death. Drums0212</p>

<dd>The title of the article should not be changed. It should reflect the name by which she was known to the public, and the name she herself used professionally as an adult. Should we change the Marilyn Monroe article to that of her birth name Norma Jeane Mortenson? A large number of entertainers do not use their birth names throughout their career. There should be a redirect, though, from her birth name to this article, if there isn't already. Also please note that her birth name is featured prominently at the beginning of this article; it's just not the title of the article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 18:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would say it's a bit ambiguous perhaps. Typically an article is named by their most known name so "Anne Nicole Smith". Then within the article the person would be called perhaps by their second most well known name *even if* it's not their birth name, so I'm going to have to side with Marshall. Marshall, since she has been involved in lawsuits revolving around and about that name. It's doubtful she ever *went by* Hogan at any rate. Can we not call this conflict "vandalism" however? Content-war is not vandalism. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 02:15, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The actual situation is that the Judge said the body can't be given over until the related issues concerning the paternity test are resolved. We don't know that she is going to be buried. The concern on the other side would be over a quick cremation. Once the body is released to someone, the court has no further say in whats done with the body. I really wonder who the body will be released to anyway. The judge denied a request for an emergency DNA test because its assumed that samples will be taken during the autopsy. The concern over her DNA has to do with fears that a different child will be produced for the DNA test. As far as being sad, be sad for the daughter. I think she is headed for the most horrible kind of life imaginable. 12.96.162.45 20:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How the media reacted to her is relevant because their reactions to her during her life did have an impact on her and the changes they made aftewards shows the retrospection they observed - i.e. her public image while she was alive and her public image after she died.--<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 03:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not notable here, though. It's completely POV is you compare a article from two years ago and now. Of course it's going to be different. The media are made of of humans, and they do care when someone dies this young, especially a celebrity. Your point of view that the media is evil is fine, but it has no place here. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a></dd>

<p>The point being, dposse, is to record the change in the media's view of Anna Nicole after her death compared to when she is alive. That is my point as to why the section <i>is</i> relevant.--<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 16:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> but it would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> until there is a source saying what amounts to the obvious (the same thing). The media reaction to her and how it changes over time is certainly notible here but initial analysis can't be here. I dont know that there is anything unique about what happened though. Media coverage about the recently dead always tends to be more positive. Most reporters don't like bashing the dead. Her reputation is also getting better as a side-effect of everyone in the world going after Howard K. Stern. She was a stupid drunken junkie whore. There is nothing redeeming about any part of her life. But as bad as she was, the animals around her are all worse. <a href="../../../6/3/2E/User%7E63.3.5.2.html" title="User:63.3.5.2">63.3.5.2</a> 19:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Lets face facts. Despite what you may have thought of this woman, she was highly controversial, and generated massive publicity for herself through her actions in life. So maybe there should be a section simply titled Controversies. Some of the other stuff could be incorporated into that. The fact that three men are claiming paternity of her child, and alluding to the possibility that there may be many others, gives us yet another insight into her somewhat troubled life.<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattona_b34e.html" title="User:Cattona">Cattona</a> 08:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the article needs a bit of cleaning up, with her death mentioned nearer the top of the article. In the section about the birth of her daughter it suddenly mentions her "corpse".

<dd>This is not a theory. Its a paranoid guess. There is not a single fact to confirm what amounts to a wild accusation about the parentage of a living person (Dannielynn).
