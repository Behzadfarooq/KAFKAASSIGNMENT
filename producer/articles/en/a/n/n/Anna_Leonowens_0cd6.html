<p>Leonowens claimed in her memoirs to have been born Anna Harriette Crawford in <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caernarfon.html" title="Caernarfon">Caernarfon</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">5 November</a> <a href="../../../1/8/3/1834.html" title="1834">1834</a>, daughter of Thomas Crawford, a British Army captain, who died in action after her birth. However, contemporary research by <a href="../../../w/2E/s/W.S._Bristowe_6462.html" title="W.S. Bristowe">W.S. Bristowe</a> has discovered no record of her birth in Wales, nor can her alleged father be found in the Army records. The same research has suggested that she was born in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> in November 1831, of an English father, Thomas Edwards, a cabinetmaker turned <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a> who died soon after her birth, and a partly <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_India_3c0b.html" title="East India">East Indian</a> mother, Mary Anne Glasscott, and that her maiden name was Ann Harriet Edwards. If true, this would not be consistent with Leonowens' claim that she moved to India at the age of fifteen to live with her mother, after growing up with relatives and in boarding school.</p>
<p>Leonowens' widowed mother married Patrick Donohoe (an <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal.html" title="Corporal">corporal</a> awarded the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a> circa 1857 for bravery) in <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>, India. In 1845, her elder sister, Eliza Julia, married Edward John Pratt, a British civil servant who had served in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Navy_d1a4.html" title="Indian Navy">Indian Navy</a>. Eliza and Edward had a son, Edward John Pratt, Jr., who in 1887, along with his wife, Eliza Sarah Millard, produced a son named William Henry Pratt, better known as film star <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Karloff_4d96.html" title="Boris Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Leonowens_0cd6.html" title="Edit section: Marriage and widowhood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage and widowhood</span></h2>
<p>It was in India that she met and married in 1849, Thomas Leon Owens, a civilian clerk (and not an Army officer as she wrote in her books). After the death of their first child they reportedly set out for <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, eventually settling in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> where they brought up two healthy children, Avis and Louis. <a href="../../../w/2E/s/W.S._Bristowe_6462.html" title="W.S. Bristowe">W.S. Bristowe</a>'s research has suggested, however, that the young Owens family moved frequently throughout <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>.</p>
<p>Avis would go on to marry Thomas Fyshe, a Canadian banker. Louis T. Leonowens moved to <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Siam</a> with his mother during her stay at the Siamese court and became an officer in the Siamese royal <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a>. He married Caroline Knox, a daughter of Sir Thomas George Knox, the British consul-general in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> (1824–1887), and a Siamese wife, Prang Somkok, who died in 1888. Louis went on to found the trading company that bears his name to this day.</p>
<p>Thomas Leon Owens found work as a hotel keeper in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> but died of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoplexy.html" title="Apoplexy">apoplexy</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penang.html" title="Penang">Penang</a> in 1859, at age 33, leaving Anna an impoverished widow. She had never before needed, or planned, to work outside the home. The only way she now had of supporting herself, however, was to become a teacher, and so she opened a school for the children of officers in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. She also changed her surname to Leonowens, which was how her husband's surname was written on his death certificate.</p>
<p><a name="Royal_governess" id="Royal_governess"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Leonowens_0cd6.html" title="Edit section: Royal governess">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Royal governess</span></h2>
<p>Though successful, the school could not support the family financially, and thus she came to the momentous decision to accept an offer made by the Siamese consul in Singapore and become a teacher of the children of the King <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongkut.html" title="Mongkut">Mongkut</a>. She succeeded <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Beach_Bradley_bae6.html" title="Dan Beach Bradley">Dan Beach Bradley</a> as teacher of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons for her decision to send her daughter to school in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, while her son travelled with her to Bangkok, are not clear; though no doubt the position of women in the royal palace where she was going would not have been such as to allow her children to be treated equally. At around the time of her arrival, the King's eldest son, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chulalongkorn.html" title="Chulalongkorn">Chulalongkorn</a>, was to be elevated to a position equivalent to Crown Prince, whilst his eldest daughter was enduring quite a different ceremony, that of the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonsure.html" title="Tonsure">tonsure</a>. It is no wonder that she made such a fuss about the delay by the King in fulfilling his promise to provide her with a house of her own. With 82 children and 39 wives, it was hardly likely that the King and his ministers would take much notice of a woman, albeit a European woman who was responsible for the education of the King's children. King Mongkut, however, was a learned and cultured man, who was breaking new ground for Siam simply by deciding to educate his wives and children.</p>
<p><a name="Relations_with_King_Mongkut" id="Relations_with_King_Mongkut"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Leonowens_0cd6.html" title="Edit section: Relations with King Mongkut">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relations with King Mongkut</span></h3>
<p>The King himself was a complex character. Educated and intelligent, he was nevertheless constrained by his own upbringing and traditions. He may have felt a degree of respect for the European woman — indeed, must have, otherwise he would not have employed her as one of the teachers to whom he trusted the education of his much-loved children.</p>
<p>Leonowens wrote of his torture and execution of a girl, Tuptim, in her second book, <i>Romance of the Harem</i>. The book is a collection of unlikely fairytales about the courage of oppressed Siamese women, constructed by Anna from bits of harem gossip. The story illustrates how different Siamese ideas of justice and religion were to those prevalent in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, let alone those in vogue in the 20th century. Historians argue, however, that this incident was not recorded by any other Bangkok expatriates, which makes it unlikely, and it is now generally believed to have been a simple tale embroidered upon heavily by Anna, who had become involved in the <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragette.html" title="Suffragette">suffragette</a> movement.</p>
<p>Anna's departure from Siam did not have, as popularly thought, anything to do with the King's death, and he did not plead with her to remain<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. However, she was in the process of negotiating a return to his court when he was taken ill and died. Fifteen-year-old <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chulalongkorn.html" title="Chulalongkorn">Chulalongkorn</a> wrote her a warm letter of thanks for her services, but did not invite her to return to Siam.</p>
<p>That the King held Anna in some regard is indicated by the fact that she and her son were both mentioned in his will, though they never received the legacy.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Leonowens_0cd6.html" title="Edit section: Relations with King Chulalongkorn">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relations with King Chulalongkorn</span></h3>
<p>The young King Chulalongkorn, elected according to Siamese tradition to succeed his father, made many reforms including the abolition of the practice of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostration.html" title="Prostration">prostration</a> before the royal person. Anna's teaching of him cannot be given complete credit for this<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, but it would be surprising if she had not had some influence on him. By this time she was already contributing articles based on her experiences to the <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Monthly_0d2f.html" title="Atlantic Monthly">Atlantic Monthly</a></i>, which were later expanded into two volumes of memoirs which earned her immediate notoriety<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, despite the stilted manner in which she wrote.</p>
<p>She became personally acquainted with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe_ba13.html" title="Harriet Beecher Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, author of <i><a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin_0b4e.html" title="Uncle Tom's Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></i>, a book whose anti-slavery message had not been lost on some of Anna's pupils in Siam. She visited the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> and other <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> countries, and eventually met King Chulalongkorn again when he visited London in 1897, thirty years after she had left Siam. He himself expressed his debt to her on that occasion.</p>

<p>In 1867, Anna went to live in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, where she became involved in women's education, and was a <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragette.html" title="Suffragette">suffragette</a> and one of the founders of the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_College_of_Art_and_Design_18b3.html" title="Nova Scotia College of Art and Design">Nova Scotia College of Art and Design</a>. After 19 years, she moved to Montreal.</p>

<p>Leonowens presented her own account as factual, and for most of the 20th century it was accepted by most in the West<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> as such, despite being strongly disputed in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. The regular appearance of the story in various dramatic productions, plus Anna Leonowens' own ability to obscure the truth during her own lifetime, meant that the fictional and true accounts of Anna Leonowens' life became very confused.</p>
<p>It was, in the end, a chance discovery by a scientist which brought inconsistencies in her accounts and the historical record to more general attention. In the 1970s, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Syer_Bristowe_fa7c.html" title="William Syer Bristowe">Dr. W.S. Bristowe</a>, a regular visitor to the Far East in search of spiders, was researching a biography of Leonowens' son, the successful businessman Louis T. Leonowens. After meticulous research Bristowe came to believe that significant parts of the famous tale were fictional. He located her actual birth certificate, marriage record and other pertinent legal documents and published a book about his findings called <i>Louis and the King of Siam</i> in 1976. Nevertheless, Bristowe's work is not universally accepted, and accounts of Leonowens' life still vary. The true story of Anna Leonowens' life may never wholly be clear.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Leonowens_0cd6.html" title="Edit section: Anna Leonowens in fiction and film">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anna Leonowens in fiction and film</span></h2>
<p>It was only after <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Landon_99a0.html" title="Margaret Landon">Margaret Landon</a>'s novelisation of the original Leonowens memoirs in 1944 that the story of Anna and her stay in Siam became popular. It was quickly made into a film, <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_and_the_King_of_Siam_2d82.html" title="Anna and the King of Siam">Anna and the King of Siam</a></i>, which took artistic liberties with the plot; and the musical by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Rodgers_780c.html" title="Richard Rodgers">Rodgers</a> &amp; <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Hammerstein_II_2749.html" title="Oscar Hammerstein II">Hammerstein</a> followed not long afterwards, making even more drastic changes. In 1972 an American TV series with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samantha_Eggar_5fde.html" title="Samantha Eggar">Samantha Eggar</a> playing Leonowens was produced. In 1999, <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodie_Foster_9072.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> starred in <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_and_the_King_1f8a.html" title="Anna and the King">Anna and the King</a></i>, and a cartoon version of <i>The King and I</i> was released. Revived many times on stage, the musical has remained a favourite of the theatre-going public. However, the Rodgers and Hammerstein film is still banned in Thailand.</p>
