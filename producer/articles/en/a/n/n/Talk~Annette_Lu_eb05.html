<p>Why was there a name change, without consulting the community at all, on this article? If the person who did this changing were to look at Annette Lu's personal website, he would discover that she does not use an umlaut when spelling her own name. Why is it necessary to add an umlaut then? Are we going to start with all Chinese who have names in different tones? Are we going start on Lucy Liü next?</p>
<p>(I mean, she's cool enough to have an umlaut, like Motörhead or something, but come on.)</p>

<p>Ok, sorry for this move. But there's a reason for this.</p>
<p>As a surname, LU is pronounced differently from Lü. LU rhymes with "shoe", "do", "who" etc, but this is not explicitly how this surname is pronounced. Her surname is pronounced as Lü, this is how it is reflected in pinyin (see her pinyin transliteration). There is no equivalent in English, hence the umlaut. (Know French? Pronounce as a French 'u' <a href="http://french.about.com/cs/pronunciation/ht/u.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://french.about.com/cs/pronunciation/ht/u.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or as German ü)</p>
<p>With Lucy Liu, there is no difficulty, it's always pronounced as a Liu. But there IS a LU (as in <a href="../../../l/u/_/Lu_Xun_e382.html" title="Lu Xun">Lu Xun</a>) and a Lü difference in (this is not a tonal difference) Chinese, and in English, the surname Lu and Lü are not just different surnames but pronounced differently. Writing her name as LU could easily mean a mispronounciation.</p>
<p>I'm not kidding you. Go check this out.</p>
<p>I didn't bother to consult because I didn't thought it was <i>this</i> controversial. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 09:00, Jul 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe Stargoat is aware of the pronunciation matter. But that's not the issue here. Anette Lu has chosen to spell her surname in a non-WG, non-Pinyin manner -- and that's her <i>official</i> choice. You can't get any more official and public than this -- vice-president for ages. --<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenchi_e72d.html" title="User:Menchi">Menchi</a> 10:46, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. But he seems to think the umlaut a tone; so I don't think he knows about it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 09:34, Jul 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the English language encyclopedia, not the Romanized Chinese one. So are you going to move <a href="../../../k/u/o/Kuomintang.html" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> too because Wade-Giles bastardizes the real Mandarin pronounciation? --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 22:58, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how Wade-Giles has bastardized the real Mandarin pronounciation?? You completely misunderstood me. If one were to replace Annette Lu with the <i>correct</i> Wade-Giles transliteration, it would still be Annette Lü; see Wade-Giles for "Lu Xun" (ie. "Lu Hsün"). Furthermore all Chinese --&gt; English are Romanization.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would take Menchi's point, that Ms Annette chose to spell her name as Annette Lu instead of Lü, neither WG or pinyin way. And please, no more of the Mainland-vs-Taiwan (pinyin-vs-Wade-Giles) political argument. I'm sick and tired of petty politics on Wikipedia and if you are going into it I'm raising my hands in defeat. But in <i>both</i> transliteration, pinyin and Wade-Giles, the correct form would be Lü.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My reason for changing it is not because I advocate for pinyin of some red Communist (yah, yah, blah, blah), but simply out of respect for her real surname. Lü is not just the correct pinyin and Wade-Giles form, but also distinguishes it from Lu. I always feel that she spells it without the umlaut out of convenience. It's the same that most spell Lu-Hsün as Lu Hsun out of convenience.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe someone can email her to tell her the more correct form and suggest the change.&#160;:p.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>

<dd>And some courtesy please. I don't think there is room for coercion here. Must we run a courtesy compaign here every time we disagree on matters? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 09:34, Jul 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pinyin seems to compose the letters leading to the closer Mandarin pronounciation for cases such as Kuomintang v Guomindang. As a Mandarin speaker, I don't see how this is not the case. I also don't see how politics jumped into this. No one is accusing anyone else of being a communist or communist sympathizer/propagandist. My mention of Kuomintang/Guomindang is to show that article titles are not meant to represent the actual prnounciation in the best possible way. In wikipedia, we list articles in their most common names in English. Oftentimes, the bastardized romanization (no tones or ulumats) is more common over the pure romanization ( so no, the English form isnt automatically romanization; it could also be translation, or in this case English name with bastard romanized surname). Adhereing to certain notations is not part of our criteria for naming articles - it has to do with whether everyone else does too. --Jiang</p>

<p>To the anon:</p>
<p>I apologize if I sounded as if I were doubting <i>you</i>. Howeve, the reason why I think this section does not belong is not because Li Ao didn't make the allegation (he clearly did); it's that in an encyclopedia article, I don't think we can/should incorporate every single wacky theory that is not backed up by evidence. Li claimed to have documents from the CIA showing his allegations, but those documents were later discredited (some shown as forgeries, and some shown to have been misread by Li). If we include every single theory that Li Ao puts forth in Wikipedia articles, the articles would be unreadable. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 21:52, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is not about including EVERY SINGLE THEORY.... but just this one by Li Ao. And &lt;i do dnot want to see all of Li Aos comments in all articles. (This is you speculation).</p>
<p>In the article we find: "The Pan-Blue Coalition suggested that the shooting was not an assassination attempt but that it was staged to gain sympathy votes (see March 19, 2004 assassination attempt in Taiwan). " Why leaving this sepculation while erasing Li Aos?</p>
<p>And - if you follow the media - you will find that the Li Aos theory gets more suport in these days. Even Mme Lü Xiulian herself wanted the 319- case newly investigated - which is against the opinion of most of the DPP-followers. BTW, I am NOT anonymous, but I am accustum,ed to the fact that contributers without a NAME are treated like second class people. So, please put my comments back. (Erasing is easier than writing, I know.) 80.218.242.250 21:59, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. However, I have filed a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_P_447a.html" title="WP:RFC/P">request for comment</a> to see what others might think about this. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 22:19, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pls follow up the actal media reports. Even Mme Lü herself backs now the demand of re-investigatiing the case in the light of the new findings of the CIA. 80.218.240.81 11:56, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
