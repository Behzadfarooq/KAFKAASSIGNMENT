<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article lists some of the extreme statementsof a woman who often makes them</span></h2>
<p>Ann Coulter frequently makes extreme statements in her writings and talk-show appearances.</p>
<p>This article appropriately reflects that by quoting some of her extreme statements.</p>
<p>It's not like she rarely makes extreme statements, and this article is un-reflective. Someone could easily add ten more extreme statements she's made in the past few years.</p>
<p>If someone wishes to add sentences to the article about the good things Ann Coulter has said or done, that is fine. It is better than just posting that the neutrality is disputed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, so I've removed the <i>neutrality disputed</i> note at the beginning, not because this is the perfect article, but I don't think it goes too far in characterizing her for what she is. After all, she calls <i>herself</i> a polemicist. But I'm willing to hear/see other additions to make this more <i>"neutral".</i> <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 13:03, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not nessisarily a fan of Coulter's, but I have read a lot of her stuff. As mentioned, her whole "sthick" is being outlandish, controversial, and sensationalistic. She rarely discusses uncontroversial topics, and she's not exactly the type who has written lots of dry articles on why the free market system is superior to socialism or anything like that. Though a self-proclaimed conservative, her writings lack the didactic or historographical material that is often common with other conservative pundits and editorialists. In other words, I'm not sure what kinda stuff to add to make this more "neutral". <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J._f353.html" title="User:J.J.">user:J.J.</a></p>

<dd>I put the NPOV disclaimer on... I'm definitely not a fan of Coulter, in fact, I think she's completely brain-dead, but the second half of this article, starting with Franken, is just attack after attack on her positions. Hardly serves to create a positive picture of the woman. Maybe nothing good can be said about her, but she -is- a best-selling author, and surely has some adulators? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraft_fc33.html" title="User:Graft">Graft</a> 20:39, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Liberal</i>? Wikipedia is an establishment mouthpiece. Look how fast the "we need to execute people like lindh" quote got vanished, as a for instance.

Lookit the knots it gets into trying to make something important of the patent boogeyman Osama bin Laden. Look at how every bit of George Soros' hypocrisy is (validly) on the George Soros page, whereas all uncomfortable facts about Jarge Shrubya and Poppy are relegated to Bush family conspiracy theory, lumped in with less reputable claims (old technique, that) and irrelevancies like Perle's nickname is "Prince of Darkness". =p -- <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwantus_5aca.html" title="User:Kwantus">Kwantus</a> 02:22, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)~</dd>

<p>Changing literate sentences into oversimplified bullet points is not an improvement.

<p>Ann Coulter may be a polemecist, but that doesn't mean the wikipedia page should be devoted to criticism of her. Al Franken is a polemecist too, but his page does not look like this. Someone did come out of the woodwork to fix the page (me) but my changes were reverted within by others within minutes.</p>
<p>Let's get rid of the silly "Criticism of Ann Coulter" stuff and have a plain old encyclopedia entry about her. Why is that so scary/difficult?</p>
<p>--141.156.238.162 14:47, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Deleting valid material is not "fixing the page". The correct policy for a person like this is to add an additional section of "Support for Ann Coulter" or some such, just as we have for politicians and the like. If you're the person who knows about the supporting material for her arguments, then please add the section; I watch this page and will defend against anybody who tries to delete material that supports her claims (but see <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> for how to write this). My assumption is that readers that come here to find out "who is this Ann Coulter person we keep hearing about", and it does them a disservice to say only "Ann Coulter is a controversial writer" - they want to know what the controversies are, what other have to say, and finally, we want them to link from here into the rest of the encyclopedia - we have huge amounts of uncontested background material explaining why there are controversies to begin with. So prove <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> wrong and add material showing the support for Coulter's POV! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 16:18, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Deleting some material can indeed be "fixing the page". There is no reason that a _majority_ of text on a page should be devoted to criticisms. Note that there are two entire sections devoted to criticism in the Ann Coulter page: "controversy", and "criticism". Readers who come here want plain facts, which in the case of the Ann Coulter article are drowning in a soup of agenda. I will certainly _not_ go make the matter worse by adding yet more agendizing from a different point of view.</p>
<p>To state it another way, the amount of criticism here might be proportionate to a 20-page document about Ann Coulter's life and career. The page is patently biased because it delves so deeply into arguable "criticism" and "controversies" while being light on facts.</p>
<p>The Neutral Point of View document says</p>
<pre>
  A lot of articles end up as partisan commentary even while presenting
  both points of view; this is wrong. Even when a topic is presented in 
  terms of facts rather than opinion, an article can still radiate an 
  implied stance through either selection of which facts to present, or 
  more subtly their organization ...
</pre>
<p>This page is a great example of that.</p>
<p>I again commend the Al Franken article for comparison. Al Franken is a polemicist and provacateur on the left, exactly comparable to Ann Coulter on the right. His wikipedia page is good!</p>
<p>Maybe people should consider moving all such "criticism of x" to a separate wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Nice talking with you, friend. I appreciated your answer above.</p>

<dl>
<dd>You make a good point about redundancy. The Criticisms section does contain some balancing statements, but it's kind of a mixed bag. What I would do is to rearrange both Controversy and Criticism sections, move a bit into more of a career chronology (because some of the statements have a different import depending on when they were made), and have another section listing specific areas ("views on liberals", "views on religion", etc). She doesn't entirely fit the traditional conservative POV, so a per-topic section is a handy way to identify points of distinction. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 20:49, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ann Coulter is a flawed Conservative fanatic that deserves to have a criticism section that is longer than the other sections. She throws around charges without evidence, blames everyone by association, and slanders people. Perhaps she should think about her actions before commenting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also shows that she is a person that lacks in substance, as empty vases makes the most noises.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is my first article look up on Wikipedia. I think there is some useful information here. But, the tone is so opinion driven and there are strange lapses about what is valid information. This cuts against treating Wikipedia as a serious source of information.</p>
<p>Who in the world thinks it a valid to say that she is successful only because of her looks? Have you not read any of her books? Have you not watched her appearances on cable? She's extremely bright, witty, excellent at communication and argument. The "pretty face" argument is sexist and really unworthy of serious discussion.</p>
<p>Second, she does not seem to be a Pat Robertson fan. Read her book "Slander" where she takes him to the cleaners on a number of issues.</p>
<p>Third, why is her religious belief only treated in terms of whether she is or is not a "fundamentalist Christian"? Especially when the response given sheds so little light on the issue. If you want to bring up her religious position, at least do so with something that really sounds like information.</p>

<p>There is no reason for this text, as phrased, to be included:</p>
<p>"Coulter has been identified as a fundamentalist Christian, but told interviewer David Bowman, "I don't think I've described myself that way, but only because I'm from Connecticut. We just won't call ourselves that." She does not usually argue from a religious point of view, but she says she admires Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson"...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter 'rape the earth' quote</span></h2>
<p>'Rape' quote should stay out. The Internet sources which I found are all 2nd hand (hearsay) and do not cite a 1st hand source such as a bona-fide transcript which can be read on line.</p>
<p>Also, that particular quote is gratuitously inflammatory. There is no need to intentionally quote something that serves only to the fan flames of religious and sexual indentitiy politics the way including that quote does.</p>
<p>Additonally, the overall tone of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann_Coulter</a> is already so harsh against her that including this is mere piling on and adds a stink of too much POV tone overall.</p>
<p>For example, there are some who suggest (and claim to be able to document) that Hitler was among other things, an astrological reading, vegetarian, self-loathing bi-sexual. And yet, regardless of those points, there is enoguh in the public record about him to paint an accurate and rightly adverse picture with out talking up those points.</p>
<p>The Colter 'rape' "quote" I want stricken is along those same lines, It's inclusion serves no purpose other than to stir up gratuitious acrimony.</p>

<dd>Rex, are you suggesting we censor Ms. Coulter? She has every right to her point of view that God wishes us to rape the earth. Just because you are uncomfortable with her views does not mean that the Wiki should suppress them. The Wiki's job is to report on what is, not what you would prefer to be. I also fail to see why you feel that her advocacy of earth-rape would provoke animosity anyway. 67.180.24.204 00:07, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that some context for selected quotes is desirable. However, it is not obvious to me that all of the quotes Rex has listed under satire are best described as "satirical" (not suggesting they are all meant literally either). Rather than articially categorizing quotes as "satire" and not, why not have sort of a "warning label" above the quotes section. This sentence or two warns that various quotes may be intended for rhetorical purposes such as satire, to rattle or bait debating opponents, shock-value etc. As such, they may be examples of her flamboyant rhetorical style (which is why she's famous) rather than her literal beliefs. I believe the quotes are all sourced now, so interested readers, thus warned, can judge the intent of any particular quote for themselves.67.180.24.204 14:31, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Franken's deleted criticism</span></h2>
<p>Rex deleted the following paragraph (arguing this is not a Franken vs Coulter article):</p>
<p>"Al Franken also claims that while a newspaper's editorials are its official position, Ann Coulter takes sentences anywhere in the New York Times to represent its official opinion. If a New York Times book-review asks people on both sides of an issue to give their opinion, Ann Coulter will represent any quote she finds offensive as the official position of the newspaper."</p>
<p>If the point is simply that Franken personally is critical of Coulter, I agree with Rex that this should be deleted. However, the overall section title is "Criticism of Coulter". Certainly, if it is true that Coulter intentionally misrepresents the views of others, that is a fundamentally important and valid criticism. The point that Franken is the messenger is then secondary. I think the paragraph should be restored. Thoughts?67.180.24.204 15:17, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sam: I fear your right wing politics are clouding your view on this one. You are implying that Franken is left wing internationally? That would put him in the same class as anyone from Social Democrats to Parliamentary Socialists to Direct Action Anarchists. Which isn't the case. Franken is actually a Democrat. Democrats are not "left-wing international" (regardless of what the Republicans call the Democrats). Here's an example. In his latest book never does Franken come out against the Iraq war. He just attacks what he thinks is the mismanagement of the war. This puts him closer to John Macain than say <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>. I think that you are taking a very monlithic view of the left, and not only that but confusing the international left with just the American left. Democrats, the closest thing we have to a leftist group in power would be considered moderate or conservative in Europe. I personally find Franken to be a bit conservative on some issues. But then again most people don't have political sensibilities that are as finely tuned as mine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">3,000 killed</span></h2>
<p>StoptheBus18, on an edit summary, seems to think we should presume that everyone knows how many died on 9/11. I disagree. The Barbara Olsen quote should have the context of "3,000 killed" included. Most High Scool Sophomores today, were only 11 years old back on 9/11. Most of them certainly don't know the #'s. Time passes quickly and context is important. Also, withholding the truth from people is a form of intolerance.

<dd>It has nothing to do with truth. It has to do with relevance. To quote the numbers killed on 9/11 is irrelevant. This is about what Ann Coulter said not 9/11. This site isn't for high school sophmores. Learning is pro-active, we are not here to baby people if someone doesn't know how many people we're killed on 9/11 they should read the 9/11 article.

<p>The article should be reasonably self-contained. While 9/11 is well-known, providing context for Coulter's reaction is important, obviously relevant.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too many quotes</span></h2>
<p>There are too many quotes on this page. Wikiquote was especially designed for the purpose of collecting a person's quotes and should be used instead of people larding up the article with excessive quotes. The greatest number of quotes on this page should be enough to rehearse quotes that have been especially controversial and to give the readers a flavor for the kinds of things that Coulter says.</p>
<p>Many people seem to think of this article as an opportunity to try to embarrass Coulter by being careless about providing the context in which the quotes were written. Or they are so biased by their antipathy towards Coulter that they are unable to provide a fair context. I think we should watch to see if this is another faulty rationale for adding a quote, as opposed to writing a well-planned article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point of the quotes should not be too embarrass Coulter. Lord knows, she would have keeled over dead long ago if she were capable of that emotion. The point should be to illustrate her rhetorical style. After all, basically she's famous for being outrageous. For example, the quote about the NY Times editor just pulled was an example of <i>ad hominem</i>. That's why it should be included, not because it's about the NY Times. Maybe there are too many quotes. But they should be evaluated by how they contribute to the understanding of her fame, rather than by the subject matter alone. Maybe it would be productive to itemize each quote by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> technique. But for now, I'm going to put back in the 'editor' quote, on the grounds it illustrates a rhetorical technique.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 03:00, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV notice</span></h2>
<p>I have added an "NPOV" notice as this article is simply too harsh and biased against Ann. More specifically, for example, the "quotes" section is too large and gives the impression that virtually everything Ann says is controversial.

<li>Let me get this straight: It is Point of View to quote the woman who also said "I believe everything I say"?</li>
<li>Her controversial style is <b>precisely</b> the reason she is famous.</li>
<li>Balance is not supplied by omission of (what you view as) negative material. Why not add something how about how much she loves puppies and all other living things?

Primarily, it is the sheer volume of selected qoutes, all of which tend to reflect poorly on her, which makes this article POV. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 06:20, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, but there is already a Wikiquote page for that and a link to it. I think 3-6 quotes max is enough. Reduce to that many on this page and I will agree that NPOV can come down. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 03:53, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I strongly oppose reducing the number of quotes just so that she doesn't "look as bad". That's just CRAP. Look, we need to portray her as accurately as possible and her quotes are providing this function. She makes outrageous and outlandish comments, many of which are not even correct, ALL THE TIME, so it is accurate to show this by having many direct quotes from her to demonstrate this. Otherwise, it will seem that she only makes the "occasional" outlandish remark which would be totally inaccurate. It is not necessary that a NPOV means a positive portrayal if the facts don't support that.</p>

<dd>That's all well and good Mr/Ms "unsigned" comment. However, I am firm - I will not yield on the NPOV notice unless and until we make this article more encyclopedic and less like a scandal sheet. As currently comprised, it smells of anti-Coulter POV. Reduce the total nuber of quotes in the quote section to about 3-6 and then I will agree to drop my NPOV assertion. Until then, I am perfectly correct to insist it stay there. My basis for this is: a) My edtis and comments here have been in good faith and b) I have raised a reasonable objection. Now it is incumbent upon the other editors to agree that the total number of quotes needs to be reduced.

No. Since you object, you must present a case that convinces the rest of the editors that the NPOV is valid, and a list of changes to the article.

<p>This is my first edit but a long-time reader of wikipedia, so please forgive me if i do something improper, but I have read far too many of Rex's posts for me to just sit back and shut up. Rex, you are obviously a smart person, I think you have your opinions very well thought out, but you simply have no room for compromise. This section has people pleading with you to come to some agreement yet you remain stalwart against labeling this page anything but POV simply because they do not want to <b>censor</b> Coulter's polemical invective (and both of those words are from her mouth describing herself, not mine). If we had an article about a serial killer with multiple victims, would it be ok to just put 3-6 victims if they went on a 20-person killing spree? Look at the Jack the Ripper page. According to you, we should shorten the list of his victims to 3-6... as it stands now i can't see how you could be furiously working to remove the POV "taint" from the page.</p>
<p>Instead, if you are honestly trying to add balance to this article, then find quotes of her that are perfectly normal conservative viewpoints. I'm sure there are a lot out there, god knows there thousands and thousands of quotables from her website, I'm sure you can find 6 sentences somewhere in those that make her look good.</p>
<p>Instead of censoring an alternative viewpoint because you do not have a defending argument, try offering your own. and as per your last quote, are we really concerned with someone's username rather than their point of view? i can't think of anything more trivial to worry about. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:30, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">She's not Jack the Ripper</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a>, are you kidding or serious? If you are serious, you make my argument for me in that Ann Coulter is no Jack the Ripper and the fact that you cite him as an exemplar to measure Ann against betrays what you think of Ann.</p>
<p>Even so, since some here don't seem to understand why I am being so firm on this, let me explain. 1st, please understand that the objective here is to make a better encyclopedia. That said, here again is my thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find the tone too anti-Coulter-ish and generally snotty. I have a large circle of acquaintences and they all view politics, etc the same way I do. This means that people such as myself, would not and do not like the tone of this article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This Wiki is not a "radical" agenda driven information store. Rather, it is on the cuting edge of a new type of knowledge - egalitarian, equal access, joint venture. If this article so offends my perspective that I resent it, how is this Wiki going to attract and retain readers and editors who think like I do?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And don't be so quick to brush that aside - any society-wide idea (as the concept of Wiki is) will nessecarily need to draw from all aspects of society - and make room for them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have no interest in sexuality or biology, so you don't see me camped out at say the "clitoris" page, jumping in with both feet to the fight over photo/graphic, do you?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's axiomatic that conservative thinking persons who follow politics are going to take an interest in Ann Coulter's page. But if you insist on a page that offends my sensibilites and succeeds in driving me away, how then does this Wiki benefit from my "cross-polination"?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't be so quick to compare conservatives to Jack the Ripper. Neither in jest nor for real. It's offensive and it sets a premise which precludes real dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, here is why the quotes must be reduced and why those who say no, are wrong:</p>
<p>The stated reason the pro-quotes crew wants all those quotes is to clearly, forcefully and on a dose-of-her-own-medicine basis, hang those harsh words on Ann's neck like an Albatross.</p>
<p>Well guess what? That's exactly what makes Ann obnoxious - she rubs peoples faces in things in a harsh manner.</p>
<p>So now, the anti-Ann editors think that the just consequence of that is to rub my face (the reader) in endless streams of harsh commentary? How does that make sense?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like that is a defacto concession of POV. And if it's not, why stop with what we have now? Let's put in 500 nasty Ann quotes - after all, since we have cast aside the goal of making the article open and accesable to all, who cares how many people our article offends...</p>

<p>Rex, perhaps your reaction to kizzle's flamboyant rhetorical style will help you understand how others feel about Coulters similar style. That's why the quotes are important; they are illustrative of her quite intentional polemical style, which is why she is famous. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a></p>
<p>Wolfman: You have conceded to my point - that the "many quotes" editors here are in fact intending to cause a sense of "upset" to the readers, along the lines of how they feel Coulter "upsets" people. If you don't see how wrong and how POV that is, I can do nothing to persuade you. I will only say that so long as we have so many quotes here, I will monitor this paage and be certain that the NPOV notice stays on it. Also, I may ask for an RfC. Would you support asking for one?

<dd>No, I have not. It's not wikipedia's job to avoid offending your tender sensibilities. The job is to report on why this woman is important. She's darn sure not noted for her intellectual conributions to conservative thought. She's noted &amp; rich &amp; famous for being obnoxious &amp; outrageous &amp; unapologetic. Anyway, why do her comments upset <i>you</i> of all people; she intended them to upset <i>me</i>. I'll bet she'd be lobbying for more quotes if she were on here; that's the whole purpose of them, to attract attention. As to an RFC, that would be fine with me (that's nothing formal like mediation is it?) <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 06:17, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>The bottom-line is this. Does the article presently written with all these quotes portray Coulter accurately or not? It does NOT MATTTER if it portray her too negatively if that is what the facts demonstrate. Is she someone who uses harsh, oftentimes untruthful, polemics in her work on a regular basis? Is that central to her identity and fame? If the answer is YES (and it clearly is YES), then all these quotes are trying to establish that. No we don't need 100 quotes to do this but I feel that the current number is a good/reasonable one to ESTABLISH the FACT that she is someone who uses harsh, controversial, sometimes untruthful polemics on a regular basis. Of course no one is saying that Coulter's behavior is anywhere close to murder or rape but the point about "Jack the Ripper" is a good one. If someone came and said, listing all his victims is bad we should limit it so he doesn't look as bad, then clearly people would say that this CRAP and would be inaccurately mitigating his crime. Same-same with Coulter (not that her polemics are "crimes" in any way) but the point is analogous. Stop this Coulter sanitizing, white-washing business! (unsigned comment by "144.189.40.223")</p>
<p>Hehe, i agree... i did not mean to compare the conservative to jack the ripper... bad example, still getting used to this. all i meant by that is very similar to what the unsigned person said above, that they are who they are, and I think that the collection of quotes presented is highly accurate of Coulter's style... i meant to draw the comparison in that we should not take off supporting evidence simply because it is unflattering if it is indeed accurately reflecting its subject. not to say that coulter is a murderer, and i know i did something wrong when i got compared to coulter by wolfman&#160;:) ... I still hold what I said before, in that in the thousands of quotables, there should be some sentences which can accurately and respectively represent her conservative views, and we should incorporate these rather than taking down what is up if you what balance. But from what I see, the collection of quotes presented is completely accurate and consistent with the general tone of her columns, and I don't think Coulter herself would want any of these quotes taken down. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 06:42, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Implying POV seems to me injecting opinion or slant into the article. I don't think that the collection of quotes is either unreflective of the subject or that the pro-Coulter camp would think that these quotes are unfairly portraying her. Thus, I do not see how the quantity or quality of the <b>collection</b> of quotes if accurate constitutes POV. Also, I appreciate that Rex has continued the dialogue rather than reverting to abandoning discussion and simply monitoring that the NPOV notice stays. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 01:36, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look at it this way, in an article about George Bush, if we put in a few quotes where he mangles his words and ends up sounding dumb or tongue-tied, that's one thing.

In those seven days, only Rex has objected to this article, and he has not specified any problems with it beyond "it smells" and "too many quotes". While he has found plenty of time to argue here, he has not made a single edit to the article to correct this supposed POV tone, or any edit to the article at all. He has not identified a single quote for deletion from the list of quotes he claims is far too long. He has simply demanded others make corrections for him without specifiying what corrections need to be made. This seems to be bad faith, and unless Rex is willing to be a collaborative editor and work with others to eliminate any supposed problems he sees, I don't see any reason to keep the tag beyond the stubborness of a single, non-participating editor.

<p>Perhaps, but your logic is based on a surmise, whereas mine is based on an actual fact: <i>"there is no information in the Bible which is anti-sweater"</i>. Naturallly it follows, that Ann is either very poorly versed what the Bible actually says or she is being satirical. And, in conjunction with the fact that her reputation is for harshness not stupidity, we must intepret this particular quote as being satirical. On the other hand, some who don't like her do call her "stupid" and in the interpersonal sense she may be - but in the sense of actually having considerable book-smarts, she is not stupid.

<dd>Rex, you are making several logical fallacies here, and still basing stuff on your beliefs. Just because the bible does not have an anti-sweater quote, does not mean that either a, she's poorly versed, or b, being satirical. Nor is it our job, or ability to decide. Perhaps she has found a quote in Genesis that she interprets that way, or perhaps she believes the gospel of mary magdalene has a quote like that. Maybe she IS very stupid, (not my belief), and doesn't understand the bible. Irregardless of whatever option is the case, it's not JUST those two you present that could be options, and you, nor I, cannot make a judgement of what she meant. As such, it is entirely inappropiate to put a judgement in there. Let the reader decide. You seem to chirp that line enough, let's use it. <a href="../../../l/y/e/User%7ELyellin_3af6.html" title="User:Lyellin">Lyellin</a> 01:01, Sep 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well other than being misinformed or satirical, she could actually be intentionally lying about what the Bible teaches (or not) in regards to "sweaters". Is that what you are saying she is doing? As I see it, there are only three possible logical premises for the origin of that statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>She's lying - she knows the Bible doesn't teach that, but she is trying to intenionally mislead.</li>
<li>She's misinformed herself - she's just blabbing and doesn't really know the Bible's view on enriroment/sweaters, etc.</li>
<li>She's taking a stab at humor - as in "satire".</li>
</ol>
<p>Lyellin; Other than these possible logical premises, what others can you think of?

<dd>Uh, it is satire, because it ridicules the "evironmentalists" point of view in mocking manner. You know that it's mocking by the silly "sweater" quote. Frankly, I remain convinced that the only reason certain editors can't see that here, is because they are personally convinced that Christians do indeed think the way Ann Coulter's clearly <i>satirical</i> take on the enviromental dispute suggests that they do. And that's the reason those editors want this particular quote in the article - they want to make both And Coulter and Christians in gernal, look dumb. It;s the same tact that was taken by the same group on an "Axis of Medieval" issue elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That said, I see tremendous opportinity for confusion and misunderstanding on the part of the readers with this "sweaters" issue, given that this particular quote is very nuanced.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, isn't that John Kerry's strength - nuance? If I recall, this same group of editors has gone out of their way to carefully details much information on Kerry's behalf so as not to leave the readers with a pejorative misunderstanding. Oh, but when it comes to a concervative saying something that can easily be highlighted to as to look problematic - that's ok? Suffice it to say, I remain unpersuaded. This group has (3) choices so far as I am concerned: 1) Add "satire" word, 2) NPOV tag on article, 3) or bring it to Arbcom, etc. I am not backing off on this one.

<dd>Rex, I personally don't think she meant it literally; I just don't think "satire" is right word. But's thats really a side-issue. Why do you think editors want to mae Christians look dumb? At the least you are <i>assuming</i> the editors are not Christian. You have twice made that mistake before with self-described Christians.

<dd>There was a previous debate on the quotes. This was resolved with a good-faith compromise in which the quotes Rex objected to were removed from this page. Those quotes are on Wikiquote and this article links there. Rex added a quote today that is just a flippant remark. Unlike the other quotes that were left on the page after the compromise, it does not add anything to our picture of Coulter. In addition, it's about current events and will mean nothing to anyone in a few month's time. The quote was added to Ann Coulter's entry on Wikiquote and removed from this page, in line with the previous instance. Rex reverted. I therefore restored the quotes deleted as a result of his objections in the past. Rex then declared a revert war. 172.190.78.239 01:58, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

As far as anonymity goes, to some degree everyone on wikipedia has it so disqualifying someone based on it seems frivilous (though getting a user page is not a bad idea).

<dd>The original discussion between myself and known (not anonymous) editors a few weeks ago, was that there was too many Coulter quotes in the article, all of which tended to illustrate the "negative" aspect of Ann's invective - ie; they all made her look like a bigot. Back then, I NPOV tagged the article and would not agree to un-NPOV unless the number of quotes in the article was reduced (see dialog). At that time, the subject of putting "positive" quotes in for Ann was raised.

<dd>What does the Rather quote tell us about Coulter? The quotes that were there add to our knowledge about Coulter and therefore belong in an encyclopedia article. Some of the ones that were removed the first time round did this too but they were removed to placate your hissy fit, and in the interests of harmony everyone settled for that. Now you add a quote that tells us nothing about Coulter, is wrong and will be completely meaningless within a very short space of time. Maybe the article could use some "positive" quotes. Why don't you try to find some? There's no agenda here. It's nobody else's fault but Coulter's if the things she says make her look bad. 172.190.17.15 23:16, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

After all, that was the version all parties had previously agreed to. The Rather quote is subject to a poll about whether or not it should be included and we agree to abide by its outcome as well as agreeing not to add or subtract further quotes as a result of the pollâ€™s outcome.

<p>--I don't believe that Coulter is a Christian. At least she is not a Christian in any sort of denomination that I would recognize and I am a Protestant who was converted from Catholicism when I was a teenager. Coulter's statements reflect beliefs that are very extreme and reflect a heart that is heavy with anger, sadness and hatred. Seeing her speak is remarkable, as her body often trembles with anger. If she is a Christian, then someone please, as Jesus taught us, point the "fruits" which she appears not to bear. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.13.165.210_b7d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.13.165.210">24.13.165.210</a> 2 Jan 2005</p>

<p>Except for scientific articles, we don't usually use the citation form "(Memmot, 2004)". I think the previous form, with a hyperlinked citation at the appropriate point in the text, is better.

<p>Actually James, we don't usually cite references at all. That doesn't mean we shouldn't follow policy. I think numerical hyperlinks clutter up the readability of the text. It's also more difficult to follow on a printed version. This seems like a policy that the change of which deserves a discussion by a lot of people.

<dd>I've done a lot of editing of articles related to politics. There's perhaps more of a tendency to cite sources in such articles. In this article, for example, if someone inserts something favorable to Coulter, those hostile to her will want to be sure that it's true before they (oh, all right, we) grudgingly allow it to stay. The same goes for her supporters when something unfavorable is added. As to the style, I think that a hyperlinked number is much less distracting than a parenthetical phrase containing a name that hasn't appeared until now -- wait a minute, who's this guy Memmot and why is his name suddenly being mentioned?

Many regard New York times to be Controversial and extremly liberal...does the article New York times say that....what about Michael moore? thats the problem with wikipedia being hijacked by liberals...liberal magazines and personalities worshiped and conservative called "extreme" and "controversial" in an introductory paragraph... Its not NPOV.. Every line has to be edited and made neutral... Criticsims should be restricted to a seperate topic..</p>
<p>"Ann Coulter(born 8 December 1961 in New Canaan, Connecticut) is a conservative , American author and political commentator." would be more NPOV Untill each line is edited POV warning needs to stay...</p>
<p>Wikipedia decided that she was a controversial figure? Change the tittle..</p>
<p>Dedicate 2/3 of the space to description of her works and 1/3 to criticisms...</p>
<p>"she leaked the lurid details of Jones's testimony " does not sound very objective? uh...</p>
<dl>
<dd>well, as far as Jones' testimony, I think you could say from any point of view that a story about some man dropping pants in your hotel room and so on is pretty much lurid. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 05:48, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Too much Quotes to highlight inconsistency is unnecessary ...takes away objectivity... Thanks <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.133.224.246_631a.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.133.224.246">172.133.224.246</a></p>
<p>I was rather shocked at some of the rather absurd statements this article makes. Having a whole section on criticism that offers the criticisms and arguments made by people who who admittedly loath her is not fair. Especially when you consider that these examples and allegations do not include equal time from proponents of Ms. Coulter. The quotes section seems to be loaded with out of context shock quotes. Anyone who has read her works will understand those quotes and not the instruments of hate they are implied to be in this article. They aren't untrue by virtue of being incorrect, they are untrue by virtue of not telling the whole story. For these reasons, I dispute the neutrality of this article. - clifgriffin, unregistered reader, January 7th, 2005 <i>comment from 24.31.106.207</i></p>

<dd>The antidote for 'bad speech' is not censored speech, but better speech. If those who 'read her works' understand those quotes as being something other than as portrayed, they are free to append 'But in fact what Ann meant was....' to the passage in question. Or, even, simply 'Anyone who read her works know, however, that these quotes are out of context and do not mean what they seem to mean' as presented here, and leave it to the intelligent reader to make up his or her own mind. No? <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 20:04, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would disagree here. Why present the quotes if you're going to right away claim that they may be irrelevant or whatever term you wish to use? Especially in such volume! What you end up doing is presenting facts on one POV and virtually saying, 'trust us on this one' for the other POV. I think it would be better to just not quote out of context in the first place, if thta's what the perceived problem is.--<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 04:26, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Possibly... I must agree, to have every quote currently there followed by a specific disclaimer would be a bit much. In any event, the first step would be for the alternative POV to actually demonstrate how any quote is taken out of context and how it could be interpreted as other than face value, rather than just the bland assertion that that's the case, then maybe we can see whether the consensus is post both povs or yank them as cancelling each other out for that quote.

<dd>Altogether agreed. With the discussion here; we certainly don't need to have editing wars, argunig the merits of each and every quote in the actual article&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 06:45, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
