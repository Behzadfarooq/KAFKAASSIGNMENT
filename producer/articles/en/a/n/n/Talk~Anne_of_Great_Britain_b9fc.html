<p>Anne is not generally referred to as 'Anne I', given that there has yet to be an 'Anne II'. Wiki policy and general usage as a result requires that she simply be called 'Anne' not 'Anne I', as we don't use the 'I' for other monarchs worldwide who were there was never, or has yet to be, a 'II'. And as I mentioned, she is only ever referred to generally as 'Queen Anne' . <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 21:02 Jan 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>After drafting several attempts to make the "Early life" section clear, I conclude that it is very difficult to make the "succession problem" clear to the reader if elements of the "succession problem" are scattered throughout the recital of Anne's life.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the following suggestion, I have pulled some essential elements of the "succession problem" into one paragraph. In framing the following suggestion, I did not intend to change any of the substantive details, though I may have inadvertently. I see that my editor dropped many of the links, which I did not intend.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem of succession pervaded throughout Anne's reign. Consequently, it cannot be, I believe, put into a single section. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 02:13, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Anne was the second daughter of James, Duke of York (afterwards James II) and his first wife, the Lady Anne Hyde (daughter of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, an important politician). As an infant, Anne suffered from an eye infection; for treatment, she was sent to France. She lived with her grandmother, Queen Henrietta Maria, and afterwards with her aunt, Henrietta Anne, Duchesse d'Orléans. When Anne was eight in about 1673, Anne made the acquaintance of Sarah Jennings, who would become her close friend and one of her most influential advisors. Jennings later married John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough), who would later become one of Anne's most important generals.</p>
<p>In 1683, Anne married the Protestant Prince George of Denmark, brother of the Danish King Christian V. And her older sister Mary married one of the foremost Protestant Princes in Europe, William of Orange.</p>
<p>Anne took an unusual route to the throne of England. When Anne was born, her uncle <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> was king. When Anne was three, her father converted from Protestantism to Catholicism. In response, her uncle the king ordered that she and her older sister Mary would not be brought up under her father's religion but would be brought up to worship as Protestants; nevertheless, her uncle converted to Catholicism on his death bed. Furthermore, her uncle died without an heir, so her Catholic father <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James II</a> became king.</p>
<p>James, desirous of a Roman Catholic successor, suggested to the Princess Anne that he would try to make her his heir if she converted to Catholicism. The Princess Anne, however, declared her firm adherence to Anglicanism; James II continued to send her Catholic books and essays, but made no serious attempt to effect a conversion.</p>
<p>James's attempt to grant religious toleration to Roman Catholics was not well-received by the English people. Public alarm increased when James's second wife, Mary of Modena, gave birth to a son (James Francis Edward) in 1688, for a Roman Catholic dynasty became apparent. The Princess Anne's sister and brother-in-law, Mary and William, subsequently invaded England to dethrone the unpopular and despotic James II. The Princess Anne did not endeavour to support her father; instead, she quickly defected to the invader's side. James attempted to flee the realm on 11 December 1688, succeeding twelve days later. In 1689, a Convention Parliament assembled and declared that James had abdicated the realm when he attempted to flee, and that the Throne was therefore vacant. The Crown was offered to, and accepted by, William and Mary, who ruled as joint monarchs. The Bill of Rights 1689 settled succession to the Throne; the Princess Anne and her descendants were to be in the line of succession after William and Mary. They were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For some reason some of the dates had been messed about with, with James converting in 1773, the Convention deposing him being in 1089 and the Bill or Rights moving to 2089. Silly. All fixed now. Darkmind1970 15:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't the use of the phrase "the Princess Anne" (as well as "the Prince George") archaically stilted in modern English? I was under the impression that such address was used more for formal introductions, like announcing "The Princess Anne and her consort, the Prince George", at a ball, not for encyclopedic prose. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:30, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would add that such styles were very likely not known in Queen Anne's own time.

<dd>I've removed all the "the"s from "the Princess Anne" and "the Prince George". The text could still use some trimming; as long as "Anne" by itself is unambiguous and acceptable in an encyclopedic article, it should probably be used more often, especially when the phrase "Princess Anne" occurs more than once in a sentence. But at least it's a little less stilted now. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 00:49, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Straw-grasping perhaps, but nothing unpleasant about it. From QUEERS IN HISTORY, copyright 1992 by Keith Stern: "Anne's confidante, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, presumably stood by to hold the Queen's hand during her times of tragedy. Correspondence between the Duchess and the Queen reveal the two women enjoyed a royally passionate romance. They called each other pet names, Sarah being "Mrs Freeman" and Anne "Mrs Morley." When Anne came to the throne in 1702, she named Sarah "lady of the bedchamber." Anne and Sarah were virtually inseparable: no king's mistress had ever wielded the power granted to the duchess, but Sarah became too confident in her position. She developed an arrogant attitude toward Anne, and insulted the Queen in public. A cousin of Sarah's, Abigail Hill, had caught the Queen's eye during Sarah's frequent absences from Court, and Sarah was never again to be the Queen's closest confidant." Used with permission.

<p>Have we any evidence for the suggestion that the Scottish Parliament's seeking of a union with England were "opposed by an overwhelming majority of the Scottish People"? Now, I'm not trying to suggest that we don't leave this in if it's true, but if there is no evidence to corroborate, it would be biased to do so. If it is true the use of "overwhelming" is certainly somewhat loaded. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwilke_d205.html" title="User:Dwilke">Dan</a> 22:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>. . .soon, due to Marlborough's influence, almost all the Tories were removed from the ministry. Lord Godolphin, although a Tory, allied himself with Marlborough to ensure his continuance in office. Although Lord Godolphin was the nominal head of the ministry, actual power was held by the Duke of Marlborough and by the two Secretaries of State (Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and Robert Harley). One may observe that Lord Godolphin's son married the Duke of Marlborough's daughter, and that Lord Sunderland was the Duke of Marlborough's son-in-law. Several others benefited from Marlborough's nepotism.</i></p>
<p>Why does it say <i>Lord Godolphin, although a Tory, allied himself with Marlborough</i>? Marlborough was a Tory! Godolphin wasn't just the 'nominal' (ie: existing in name only), head of the ministry - he was the Lord Treasurer and the Queen's chief minister. The appointment of Sunderland was nothing to do with Marlborough - it was a demand by the Whig Junto which Godolphin and Marlborough were forced to support in order to keep the Whigs 'on-side' with regards to the war effort.

<p><i>Pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701, it is alleged, but never proven that about fifty Roman Catholics with genealogically senior claims were disregarded.</i><br />
During a fierce bout of insomnia, I managed to get Wikipedic confirmation of 46 people with superior claims in addition to the Old Pretender. Nine were descended from <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrietta_Anne_Stuart_e3e1.html" title="Henrietta Anne Stuart">Henrietta Anne</a> (Charles I's youngest daughter), nine from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_Louis%2C_Elector_Palatine_d40c.html" title="Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine">Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine</a> and 28 from <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward%2C_Count_Palatine_of_Simmern_68fe.html" title="Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern">Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern</a> (these two were sons of the Winter Queen).

<dd>Ah, sorry, I reworded that sentence before I saw this. The number of possible claimants is speculation since the various decisions of English and Scottish Parliaments after the Glorious Revolution make it impossible to say who would be a "rightful" claimant, so I think just mentioning that any Catholic claimants were ignored is enough here. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise though. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think the Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Act of Settlement delineated the succession quite clearly, so thereafter those Catholics were not really "rightful" claimants. But any time that the succession is perceived as having been subverted, it becomes susceptible to force of arms. I enjoyed reading that there were so many skipped over, but perhaps that factlet belongs in the "Act of Settlement" article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamgarrigus_b83c.html" title="User:Adamgarrigus">Adamgarrigus</a> 20:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
