<p>I'd like to see us add a religion section to the Ann Arbor article. The city was the birthplace of The Word of God community in the late 70's/early 80's which is WIDELY considered to be the progenitors of the charismatic Catholic movement worldwide. Plus, there's this whole hostility towards Domino's Tom Monaghan drama which ultimately resulted in him choosing to move much of his operations to Naples Florida. The underlying subtext was the local government's antipathy for Monaghan's conservative politics and in-your-face Catholicism. Big Daddy 14:58, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It depends on what you are focusing on (because this would determine where a religion section will end up). If you are talking about the religious make-up of the city, it should go under demographics. Otherwise, I see it as something that will go under history. The one area I am unsure about is Tom Monaghan (I am aware of the fact that he had once proposed building a giant cross near Domino's Farms). But before such information is inserted, can you give me some reliable references that I can work with? Also, can anyone else help with this? Thanks. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 21:59, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying that most Ann Arborites love Monaghan or Ava Maria School of Law, but we should ask whether it was truly antipathy toward Monaghan's conservative politics that spurred the specific impasse with the zoning authorities, or whether it was genuine disagreement on purely zoning-related issues. (After all, Ann Arbor is known for being extremely exacting and strict with proposed changes to zoning codes; and Monaghan has a track record of unorthodox architectural projects.) <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 02:25, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with Big Daddy that that's an interesting aspect of Ann Arbor's history, but also with Pentawing that it belongs in the history section (or culture) rather than a separate religion section. I don't think there's anything encyclopedia-worthy about Ann Arbor religion in general, aside from such historical footnotes. But I DO think the WoG/Monaghan/Ave Maria story deserves mention somewhere. Hard to make it NPOV though. I don't think we have articles for Word of God, but there are various Monaghan/Ave Maria-related entries. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 15:56, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only published work I could quickly find dealing with any Monaghan-related subjects is: <i>Gordon Pritchard Bugbee, _Domino's mansion: Thomas Monaghan, Gunnar Birkerts and the spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright_, with foreword by Vincent Scully (Troy, Mich.: Planning Research Organization for a Better Environment Press; distributed by Southern Illinois University Press, 1988)</i>. (Looks, obviously, to be a piece of architectural criticism.) Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything on the Word of God movement. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 20:09, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I found one mention of the Word of God movement on the Ann Arbor District Library's website concerning the city's history. However, it only mentions the movement without describing it in detail. The only other mention of the Word of God movement is through websites associated with Word of God organizations, but I am unsure if they can be used (e.g. their reliability). <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 21:32, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, I don't have any published sources on WoG either, though if I remember right the Observer had a lengthy article on it a few years back. It is a really interesting byway of Ann Arbor history.

<dd>Wow! Lots of great comments. Ralph Martin is the go-to guy for information about the Word of God community as he (along with a guy named Clark I believe) are widely regarded as the founders. I understand Martin is currently working as a professor at a Catholic University in Steubenville, Ohio. I've learned quite a bit more about sourcing for Wik articles since originally making this suggestion and I don't know if I can find anything yet on my accusation that it was indeed antipathy towards Monaghan's religion that forced him out of town. But it should be easily documented, especially since Ann Arbor's bending over backwards to hold onto Pfizer amongst other companies belies the 'exacting and strict zoning codes' argument. Finally, I disagree that WOG website info is by default unsuitable. So long as it merely provides a history it would be useful. Those challenging their version of things ought to be able to contribute as well with their own supported arguments. But to leave it out completely would be a serious omission in my view.

<li>Thanks for these notes, BigDaddy777. I did write a short bit under "Education" on Ava Maria School of Law, although the school itself should probably get its own page eventually. (There is already a decent amount on it under the Tom Monaghan page.) Regarding the motivations behind the zoning dispute: all this stuff gets tricky to research quickly since there's no electronic archive for either the Ann Arbor News or the Observer. My take on the Word of God issue is that we might put a little bit about religion in Ann Arbor under the "Culture" section (including religious/denominational demographics), with a very quick mention of Word of God, and then give Word of God its own article for more extended discussion. However, to put <i>too</i> much about Word of God in the main Ann Arbor article might imply that it is disproportionately significant to local culture, when actually its importance stems more from it starting in Ann Arbor than from it now playing a major role in local cultural life. (At least that's my understanding, thought I very well could be wrong here.) If someone wanted to write a Word of God article, there very well might be a short article in some sort of encyclopedia of Catholic thought, or Catholic history. Not sure. By the way, I <i>think</i> Word of God jumped into a couple local mainline Protestant congregations, and the denominations acted to remove it because its charismatic strain wasn't in accord with mainline Protestant theology. But I'm pretty hazy on this, and I'm sure it would be near-to-impossible to source this. Pentawing, what do you think about all this? <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 22:58, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Rop, you've pretty much got it right. I'm not an expert, but I have a pretty good working knowledge of what went down. I think the AA Observer article is a relatively useful reference piece but may be slightly POV. But where you're really right is the place WOG deserves in Ann Arbor history. It's notable not because it affected Ann Arbor culture one whit (it certainly didn't appear to even at it's height of popularity) but because somehow this very significant religious movement that would ultimately influence Catholocism all the way to the Vatican (and not a few other denominations either as you point out) could actually have been birthed in <i>Ann Arbor.</i> (It's the sort of the modern day version of 'How can anything good come out of Nazareth?'&#160;:) As to what happened to the Lutheran and Presbyterian denominations that went 'charismatic' as a result of WOG, I think it's a mixed bag. There still remains one quasi-charismatic Presbyterian church in Ann Arbor that has it's roots with WOG. They're called Covenant and I believe are located on Jackson. There's also the Ann Arbor Vineyard (an independent charismatic franchise)pastored by former WOG affiliated minister Ken Wilson. I do recall hearing of a 'purge' of Charismatics from Lutheran churches, but am under the impression that there was still one left standing - The cross and the Sword or something like that. I'm starting to get hazy now, too&#160;:) Big Daddy 05:47, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hi BigDaddy. Why don't we hash out a one-or-two sentence statement on religion here on the Talk Page, and then insert it once everyone's been able to comment, modify, etc? Then if you'd like to start a WOG article, that would be terrific. My suggestion for the short statement (for the main Ann Arbor article) would be to give a demographic breakdown of religions and denominations, and then say that Ann Arbor was also the birthplace of the Word of God Movement, and is the headquarters for the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Assembly_of_North_America_063b.html" title="Islamic Assembly of North America">Islamic Assembly of North America</a> and the Jewel Heart Tibetan Buddhist organization. Now, I wonder where we can find demographic stuff on religious affiliation in Ann Arbor... <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 20:36, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wow you guys, great discussion... I think we should be careful when we say things about Monahan being "driven out of town." As far as I know, he is still around, somewhere out in Northfield Township (or Barton Hills?)--as much as any mega-rich person can be said to live in any one place. I'm under the impression he still has his "shack" (a little house he uses to get away) out in Northfield too. Ave Maria moved to Florida, or is moving, but Monhan didn't and I don't think Ave Maria was "driven out" either. The story is convoluted and I'm not sure anyone knows the whole truth--the Observer article seemed pretty meticulous to me, and I was still confused when I was done with it. And there are at least three places involved as well--Ann Arbor, which may have been antipathetic to Monahan's endeavors but didn't really play any official role (so I don't think the Pfizer argument really holds up); Superior Township, which was his main adversary in the zoning wars (and there I think the issue really <i>was</i> growth vs. "rural character"); and Northfield Township, which is where a lot of his activities currently operate with a fairly low profile (but go for a drive around Northfield on a nice day and count the nuns out for a run!), I guess what I'm saying is that there's a lot of complexity in this story, and unless someone has really assembled the facts to offer a definitive account, I would tread lightly. (I would love to see a WOG article, by the way, and BD and Ropcat's memories match mine, which are equally hazy. I agree that WOG doesn't merit more than a brief mention in the Ann Arbor article.) <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 22:28, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I like the idea of at least mentioning Ann Arbor as the birthplace of WOG. A sentence or two seems fine to me as well. I was unaware of those other religious institutions roots in the city, but I guess I felt that it was a little ironic, thus more noteworthy, that a group like WOG was founded here. That a Buddhist organization has an affiliation with Ann Arbor shouldn't surprise anyone who <i>gets</i> Ann Arbor. As far as Monahan goes, the best place to go is to the source. I'll see if I can find out his take from friends I know. I understand the <i>ostensible</i> reasons stated for driving Monahan's Catholic operations out of Ann Arbor. I personally find them a little suspect, that's all. No proof yet. I do think it will, in the end, be something very noteworthy. Kind of like that boneheaded decision to create a North Campus back in the day. So much for preserving 'rural character' huh? Big Daddy 09:40, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can understand why you would be skeptical of the "ostensible" reasons for the anti-Mongahan feelings, BD--god knows I have heard lots of knee-jerk Monaghan-hating around Ann Arbor. But I think the facts don't really back up the idea that that played a role in "driving Monaghan out" in this case. Domino's Farms was conceived in 1983 and the zoning battles (and I was wrong, it was Ann Arbor Township, not Superior Township) started right about then; Monaghan bought the Tigers around then too, and he was <i>very</i> well-liked in Ann Arbor in those days. It was like we had our very own Frank Lloyd Wright-loving pet billionaire. What led to the clash with township was that his original plan for the skyscraper at Domino's Farms was completely out of scale for the site, but the revised plan (the Domino's Farms of today) was a huge hit. Monaghan's widely publicized return to traditional Catholicism and the right didn't start until after 1989, when the zoning wars with the township were over. So although there was a clash between Monaghan and the local government, it really wasn't over Monaghan's religion--the sequence of events is just wrong... and I'm not aware of any more recent fights. The city was happy to have Ave Maria move in, for instance. I would beware of revisionist history on this issue. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 17:35, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nope, I'm wrong, there have been several more recent battles between Monaghan and the township, e.g., over the "25-story crucifix" and the proposed move of Ave Maria to Domino's Farms. So Big Daddy, you have a point, though one that would be hard to present in an NPOV way. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a></dd>

<li>2 sources on religion in Washtenaw County (same US Census dataset, I think): [<a href="http://www.thearda.com/FR_Index.html?/RCMS/2000/County/26161.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thearda.com/FR_Index.html?/RCMS/2000/County/26161.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>] [<a href="http://www.ersys.com/usa/26/2603000/religion.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ersys.com/usa/26/2603000/religion.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a>]
<ul>
<li>Sounds good, everyone. BigDaddy, I fully appreciate your point about WOG being more surprising in the Ann Arbor context than, say, the Jewel Heart connection. I do think, though, that if we're going to have a couple sentences on religion in the main article, it's worth including the other two organizations, since they're of national scope and are headquartered in AA. Regarding the issues of disagreement between Ava Maria and local authorities: thanks for pointing out, Rodii, that these other municipalities were involved; I didn't know that it involved Superior Township and Northfield as well. (In fact, did Ann Arbor zoning authorities play any role in the dispute?) I just think, in researching this, that we need to adhere to the "No Original Research" guidelines of wikipedia -- which means nailing down our assertions in reputable, checkable sources. The Observer article would be a great starting point. In summation, I guess we're talking about three projects here: <b>1.)</b> a couple sentences on religion for the main Ann Arbor article (demographics; groups that started or are headquartered in AA); <b>2.)</b> a more thorough overview of the Ava Maria School of Law zoning dispute (building on information already in the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Monaghan_eb38.html" title="Tom Monaghan">Tom Monaghan</a> article) for placement either in the Monaghan article or in a new Ava Maria article; <b>3.)</b> a fresh article on Word of God. (Did I get that right?)

<p>I read through the discussions and found that many of the ideas are viable. Nevertheless, I don't believe a lot of materials on religion can be placed in <b>culture</b>, given that in my experience unless one were involved with a religious group, religion doesn't play a major role in Ann Arbor cultural life (to me, Ann Arbor resembles <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a>, where religion isn't the primary focus in life, if at all). Nevertheless, major religious movements and figures can be mentioned in <b>history</b> while the religious makeup of the city can be mentioned in <b>demographics</b>. I agree with the idea of separate articles for Word of God and Ave Maria (law school and foundation). Concerning resources for Word of God, websites for associated groups could be used for a basic overview but the details have to be scrutinized before they are added (I saw a lot of conflict over <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> over details about that group). Currently, I am in the middle of other things outside Wikipedia, so my ability to research and add new material over the long-haul is, at the moment, limited. However, I will still monitor this article and copyedit any new additions so that those passages will meld well with the rest of the article. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 05:26, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

However, I didn't read of Ave Maria Law School's making a definite decision to move to Florida as well (though there were talks about that). Anyways, I found a lot of news sources talking about the conflict between Monaghan and Ann Arbor over Ave Maria University (even from the Detroit Free Press). Hence it should definitely be noted (under history). <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 05:54, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's good to know. I really feel this 'Monaghan Exodus' will some day be a big issue for Ann Arbor. In a negative way. I also like the inclusion of the WOG in the history section. I'd like to propose that the sentence be embellished slightly since the point is that the normally-thought-of-as-very-liberal Ann Arbor birthed both an international movement amongst Christians <i>worldwide</i> as well as a leading contender for heir to the title of 'the conservative ACLU' which is currently thought to be Jay Sekulow's group out of Washington<a href="http://www.aclj.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aclj.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Not that this is a big deal, but I will take issue with this statement about Ann Arbor "religion isn't the primary focus in life, if at all." Having lived in both Cambridge and Ann Arbor (as well as New York and other alleged anti-religious towns&#160;:) I'd say Ann Arbor was by far the most religious. But again, it's sort of underground. When you say 'Ann Arbor in the '70s' to people, their first thought isn't usually 'Oh yeah, intense Charismatic Christianity!' But it was a major force throughout that decade. I also think the University community draws in a huge religious element. From Hillel to the campus preachers, it's actually <i>disproportionately</i> religious. My two cents...

<li>The mainline Protestant denominations are somewhat stronger than in many other places; the charismatic strains, megachurch trends, and religious right are right now less strong than in many other places. So Ann Arbor, in my view, is not particularly unreligious; I agree with BigDaddy on that. But, as far as the statement that "religion isn't the primary focus in life": I do agree that explicitly <i>religiously-framed</i> engagements with the broader civic life (and, particularly, politics) might be less common, but that is probably because the city's dominant religions/denominations are ones that traditionally opt for a slightly quieter or more circumspect relationship with the wider civic sphere. Probably similar to most other affluent, moderately liberal Midwestern communities. In any case, I certainly wouldn't describe Ann Arbor as hostile to religion. By the way, I tweaked Pentawing's edit to "History"; let me know if it needs more adjustment. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 15:42, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is an interesting discussion in that it becomes obvious how hard it is to "capture" the truth about a community--there's a real blind man and the elephant thing going on here. Nevertheless, my two cents: this is a reasonably religious community, though it's easy to miss it unless you're in the right social networks. And just as a counterbalance to the conservative emphasis above, there's also a significant left-wing/social justice brand of religion being practiced. There's a large and flourishing UU community, smaller congregations like the Evangelical Church of the Incarnation (ECI), the Interfaith Council for Peace and Justice, Religious Action for Affordable Housing, the American Friends Service Committee, Temple Beth Emeth, the "Social Justice Ministry" at St, Mary's Student Parish, and many others. None of this is "surprising" from the standpoint of the stereotype of leftie Ann Arbor, but maybe it's a corrective to the stereotype of secular Ann Arbor (and the idea that religion = conservative). And Ropcat, we've got megachurches too--check out around Scio Church and Wagner sometime. (This is an interesting discussion, but I'm not sure how it should translate into a Wikpedia article.) <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 18:09, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looks good to me. The only tiny tweak I would make would be to call WOG a 'Catholic' rather than Christian organization. While acknowledging their influence outside the scope of Catholicism, I'm confident that this characterization would be the prevailing sentiment, both from within and without WOG. I also agree with your overall assessment of religious sensibilities in Ann Arbor. Not as 'quiet' as in New England, but probably more subdued than in say Warren. Well written article and comments.

<dd>One learns something new everyday&#160;:) Until this discussion, I wasn't really aware that the religious community in AA is stronger (my assessment was based on comparisons with areas such as the Deep South and Denver). Of course, the connotation of "People's Republic of Ann Arbor" (similiar to Cambridge and Berkeley) is, to me, pretty telling of social leanings, but at least AA isn't as far-left as I was made to believe. By the way, is there anything more that can be added for religion? <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 18:22, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry Rodii, I didn't mean at all to ignore the left/liberal religious sensibilities also at play in Ann Arbor. Pentawing, on your question of anything else to add: perhaps just demographics on religious/denominational breakdowns; and <i>possibly</i> mention of the national religious organizations headquartered in Ann Arbor (Islamic Assembly of North America and the Jewel Heart Tibetan Buddhist organization). BigDaddy, I'll make the change from "Christian" to "Catholic" as you suggest. Thanks! <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 18:51, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Concerning demographics, I just found out that by law the US Census does not gather information concerning religious affiliations. The sources we have focus on Washtenaw County as a whole rather than Ann Arbor alone. I am still looking for some dataset to work with, but if you could suggest a source that focus only on Ann Arbor, all the better. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 20:14, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No worries, Ropcat, I didn't think you were ignoring anything, I just started thinking about some of the points being made. My main point is that this discussion may be getting into areas that this article just shouldn't try to handle, unless someone can dig up an authoritative source. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 18:00, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My name is Ellen Karagoulis and I happen to know where you can get lots of accurate information on the Word of God community, and also the Sword of the Spirit organization which is an international network of charismatic, ecumenical, Christian communities. By the way, it would be more accurate to call Word of God Christian rather than Catholic because of their emphasis on ecumenism (all the major Christian denominations working together). If you have any questions e-mail me at emkles03@yahoo.com.

<p>The international organization that is closely connected with the Word of God is at the following link: <a href="http://www.swordofthespirit.net/website/aboutus.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.swordofthespirit.net/website/aboutus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swordofthespirit.net/website/aboutus.htm</a> You can find their statement of purpose, as well links to other communities similar to the Word of God. The actual Word of God is no longer part of the Sword of the Spirit, but most of the communities are similar to the original Word of God community so you can see what their original purpose was. But if you e-mail Steve B. Clark, he was one of the founders and he can give you lots of accurate information if he isn't too busy. I'm not sure what his e-mail is, but he is part of a large lay organization of Christian celibate men called the Servants of the Word, and if you e-mail Don Schwager, he can probably put you in touch with Steve Clark. His e-mail is dschwager@rc.net The Sword of the Spirit website has tons of information on Christian communities around the world, so hopefully this will help. Don't bother mentioning my name to Don Schwager because he probably doesn't know who I am, but Steve Clark should. God bless.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was a part of the Word of God community in the 1970s. The Detroit Free Press Magazine dated Sept. 20, 1992 has a significant article entitled "The Rise and Fall of a Heavenly Empire". The writer of this article clearly had access to records and documents that contributed to a very accurate portrayal, I believe. This Community was very good in so many ways, but it took a couple wrong turns that were terribly damaging to many people, although it's teachings were always doctrinally pure (so far as I know, it was never challenged in this respect by Catholic or Protestant authorities). A book should be written on the Word of God community's origins, history, and eventual near-collapse. Others deserve to learn from this painful experience. I am paxman.</li>

<p>I notice that anonymous user 65.7.205.127 has just made some additions to the last paragraph of the history section, dealing with the Greenbelt. However, I find these a bit confusing and maybe misleading. The user notes that the city is only permitted to buy development rights, but I was under the impression that the city could buy either development rights, or buy the land outright, as it saw fit. Also, the addition of the last two sentences to the paragraph is a bit misleading. Here are the sentences: <i>The Greenbelt has been particularly divisive, because the purchase of merely the development rights does not allow city residents actually to use the undeveloped land in any fashion. Furthermore, some have complained this is merely a thinly veiled attempt by residents to increase their housing values and to limit the access of the poor to Ann Arbor area property ownership.</i> The first sentence is misleading because, as I understand it, the ferocity of the debate has had little to do with whether or not residents can use the Greenbelt land for, say, recreation purposes. The second sentence just seems kind of POV unless opposing viewpoints are incorporated. Overall, given that this is supposed to be a very quick trawl through the city's history, I think that the paragraph worked better before the new material was added. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 23:10, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I moved it over to the history sub-article. But now that you mentioned the POV issue, I think it should be reworded or removed outright. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 23:13, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thing is, I more or less agree with what the anon wrote. The greenbelt, if I understand it, does mean that only the city can decide to use the land for anything but recreation. So just adding that clarification fixes that part of the anon's wording. The next part is fairly standard greenbelt economics. It is fairly accepted that the greenbelt will drive prices up for people that already have houses built. A development econonomics textbook could probably confirm that. Now the way it is phrased is POV, but it seems largely correct. That said, only a little more detail should go in about the greenbelt, and maybe move it to the economics and development type info instead of history. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:31, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>On your first point: Why couldn't the city use the land it buys outright for recreation? Obviously, the land for which it buys only development rights it can't use for recreation; presumably that would remain farmland or whatever it currently is, according to the preferences of the land's owner. Regarding your second point, on rising prices: that's true, <i>unless</i> the city increases density in already-developed areas. There are actually three parties to the debate: 1.) pro-greenbelt, pro-increased density people (who want to ameliorate the rise in housing costs caused by a greenbelt by raising the supply of housing through taller buildings and in-fill development); 2.) pro-greenbelt, anti-growth people (who don't seem to have a plan to prevent spiraling housing costs; these are mostly from either environmental organizations or are people who don't want to lose the traditional "human scale" of downtown through taller buildings); 3.) anti-greenbelt folks (which includes parties that normally aren't in alliance: namely advocates for the poor and for low-cost housing, and big developers who construct new housing in the outskirts). The greenbelt plan pitted groups 1 and 2 against group 3; the proposed green<i>way</i> plan (distinct from the greenbelt issue) is pitting groups 1 and 2 against each other. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 20:58, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first part is basically what I was saying. I agreed land it buys outright <i>can</i> be used for recreation, but I used enough complicated sentence structure that it wan't immediately obvious. Using it for recreational areas certainly wont curb the rising prices issue, it will probably tend to make property in the city more valuable of course. Don't forget in your group 2 are people that <i>want</i> to have the property values increase, including most current property owners. I'm not familiar with the greenway plan. But in any case, our hashing out the issue here only helps so much. What we really need are reputable sources to draw the material from to add to the article if needed. Do you know of the best places to document this besides the Ann Arbor News? If I'm not misunderstanding, the city is referring to this as the PROS plan right? <a href="http://www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us/CommunityServices/Parks/Draft%20Pros%20Plan/draft_pros.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us/CommunityServices/Parks/Draft%20Pros%20Plan/draft_pros.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> would be a good start if so. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:23, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. I think the Ann Arbor greenbelt should probably get its own article, rather than delving into pretty complex land-use issues in lengthy fashion on the main Ann Arbor article. Regarding sources: I think the <i>Ann Arbor Observer</i> has run pieces on this, too. (There was one particular piece that presented the mayor as being basically a puppet for the president of the local Sierra Club.) As far as motivations: I'm not sure there's any way to tell for sure whether most homeowners voted for the plan out of a desire to raise their own property values, or out of ecological concern, or out of a sense that sprawl was sucking vitality out of the city center. The votes of renters <i>might</i> be some sort of barometer: if renters mostly voted in favor of the plan, it would necessarily have been out of some motivation other than buoying their real-estate investments. Even for those opposed to the plan, though, there were a lot of motivations in addition to the house-price issue: for instance, some people charged that the plan was poorly thought out and was rushed onto the ballot before important technical questions were answered; others were sprawl opponents who thought the plan would feed leap-frog development; and still others liked the greenbelt concept but thought it shouldn't be adopted without some formal commitment to high density, in order to prevent the greenbelt from becoming a tool of no-growth advocates. Interesting debate, and it would probably make a good Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 22:45, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, now that I think of it, the article doesn't need anything more than at most one sentence more about the greenbelt. Have at it for a larger article on it. I think we have one or two stub articles on the general concept. In general, should we have a little more coverage of the environmental activism and involvement of the city in environmental efforts? We have a bit, but not as much as perhaps we should given the relative importance of that in the city. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:29, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks, I'll probably start an article on this, but not for the next couple weeks yet. I agree with you that we might want a sentence or so on environmentalism in Ann Arbor. I wonder if there's some "factoid" that might illustrate this, so it's not just a vague assertion. Were there any early environmentalist measures in the city (out ahead of the national curve)? Or are there measures now that seem to have more teeth than in most places? Not sure quite how to illustrate the city's environmentalist sympathies, but it would be good to do... <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 18:19, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Consider a section about how environmentally concious we are. The a2ecycle.org link keeps getting removed from the external links section and Ann Arbor has a HUGE recycling following and this is just one of the many ways A2 recycles. There are over 4,000 people "freecycling" in this community via the a2ecycle.org link and even more recycling on a daily basis through the enormous amount of other recycling organizations in Ann Arbor.
<ul>
<li>Last I checked, most of the people in the Ann Arbor freecycle group aren't from ann arbor. Ann Arbor has more internet access (and had access earlier) than most of S.E. michigan, so its online communities tend to attract disproportionate numbers of outsiders. Normally Detroit would fulfil this function, but it doesn't have very high internet penetration (or didn't till recently). I'd add that more development downtown would do 100 times more for the environment (by reducing sprawl, pollution, etc.) than the recycling program. <a href="../../../t/l/o/User%7ETlogmer_ea3e.html" title="User:Tlogmer">Tlogmer</a> 20:43, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please check again because this is an inaccurate fact- MOST of the people freecycling in a2ecycle.org are from Ann Arbor. Yes, others are allowed in as this helps annarborites to re-home their unneeded items when a local doesn't need/want it. 8 May 2006</li>
