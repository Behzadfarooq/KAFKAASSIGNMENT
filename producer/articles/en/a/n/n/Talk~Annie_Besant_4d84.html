<p>It should also be addressed that the section on her Early Life needs to be cleaned up. What is her background, when was she married, give birth, give birth to whom, where was she educated... This part is very off-the-cuff and not appropriate as an encyclopedic entry... These questions need to be addressed and answered and a more comprehensive and narrative account of her earlier years should be given...</p>
<p>As far as an encyclopedic contribution is concerned, this section is non-contributing. And yes, I too, thought her contributions to the Home Rule movement were substantial.</p>

I am not including the information now as I do not want to tamper with the structure of the article as it stands.

<p>My reaction precisely echoed yours, and the contribution above it. I've tried to expand the earlier sections a good deal, being fairly clear about Besant's explicitly republican, secularist, Fabian and Marxist phases. I've also brought to the fore her concrete political contribution in her later years, particularly her Home Rule campaign, which was so important in steering Congress towards a more militant stance. I think the stuff about Theosophy could do with improvement through the addition of more detail, but it's not bad. The political stuff seemed almost a whitewash of someone who was very red. sjwells53@blueyonder.co.uk 19 May 2006</p>

<dd>I just think that we haven't yet had an editor who was competent to address these issues, so please step forward. I myself am most interested in her work in Theosophy and also her genealogy, so I've been editing those sections.

<p>I have heard of Justin Besant. I wouldn't go so far as to call him popular, but he's definately around. I've tried getting some of his stuff of of limewire but I couldn't find any. Going by Annie Besant's age, Justin Besant would have to be at least 90 years old. i find it difficult to believe a 90 year old would be producing new albums with his high school buddies right now</p>

<p>- "canadian jazzfunk pianist justin besant' does not exist in any way, shape or form. He is just some kid who attempts to promulgate his name on the internet. Check out his user page- its also all fake, the albums names are obviously false. Who would name an album Nubbis? - if you google the name, the only hits are websites that are self-editable.

<p>Can anyone help clarify what is meant by the term "masters" in this sentence: "After a dispute, where William Quan Judge, leader of the American section was accused of falsifying letters from the Masters, the American section split away."</p>
<p>Is "Master" meant as a form of address or honorific within the Theosophist Society?

<p>I've done some reading on Annie Besant and I believe that she is more controversial than she is made out to be on this page. Her conception of race is quite problematic, being a theosophist this is not surprising, and she certainly did not support all the races in South Africa. She addressed the Letchworth Garden City Summer School in 1921:</p>
<p>"In considering the problem of South Africa, let us realise that we have in our coloured races there people of entirely different types. We have the whole of those whom we can really call savages, some of them gentle, some warlike and turbulent, but none of them fitted for any form of citizenship…then there are the people who come over from India, who are Aryans…who belong to a highly civilised race and have the instincts of the civilised man and not those of the savage." Source: Besant, "Coloured races in the Empire" (Lecture), cited in Speeces and Writings of Annie Besant, 3rd edn, G A NAtesan &amp; Co, Madras 1921, p. 131.</p>

<dd>While I see your point about her being racist, I feel it is important to remember the historical context. The attitude she reveals in her abovementioned speech is definitely a racist attitude, <i>by today's standards.</i> Calling someone a 'savage' would not have been out of place in her society. Try to see beyond the values of our politically correct days and look at what she was saying. It seems to me that she is saying that South Africa was (and is) a mix of races who have different attitudes and aptitudes, and that these differences have an important effect on their society. I think she is trying to make a point about the difference between tribal societies and 'civilised' societies i.e. democracies. She is absolutely correct that the blacks in South Africa were not ready for the kind of society that the British and the Dutch tried to impose on them. Any race is seldom 'ready' to have another society's values imposed on them. The point she makes about the differences between the Indians and the Africans is a valid one. The Indians had had a lot more contact with other societies than the Africans had. India had been run by the Mongols and the Persians (among others) before the British turned up, so they were at least accustomed to encountering other races and other political systems. The Africans had no such experience. Consequentially the society that was imposed on them was extremely foreign to them. For these reasons I don't think that this is especially noteworthy in the overall scheme of her work.</dd>

<p>I dunno. Sounds to me like she's saying black people are savages who can't be civilised. Furthermore, while she might not have been considered racist by her peers at the time, it's still something that seems worth a mention.</p>

<p>J Krishnamurti went to become a celebrated spiritualist. His writings and recorded speeches show wisdom beyond his and human years. However, he was never perceived or acknowledged as a God-Man or emancipator. How his upbringing, thinking or maturing was impacted by Annie Besant and the reasons why they separated in thought or action needs to be elaborated.</p>
<p>Without shifting focus from Annie Besant and her contributions, can there be a bigger reference to J Krishnamurti and their curious relationship? {{unsigned}59.144.185.104|08:11, 27 August 2006 (UTC)}}</p>
