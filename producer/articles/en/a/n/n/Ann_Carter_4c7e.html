	    <p><b>Ann Carter</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>) is a former <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_actress.html" title="Child actress">child actress</a>.</p>
<p>Child actress Ann Carter was born in Syracuse, New York in 1936 , but at an early age her family moved to Los Angeles because of her mother's health. Her father became an executive with Dodge. Later her parents would become the managers for Lawrence Welk, whose television show Dodge sponsored.</p>
<p>Her mother later told Ann she was discovered by a 20th Century Fox executive while they were riding a bus. She was invited to an interview at the studio which led to several small parts by the time she was 5 years old. Most notably, she played Veronica Lake's young daughter in "I Married a Witch". She bore a remarkable resemblance to Ms. Lake.</p>
<p>In one amusing incident she beat out her contemporary Margaret O'Brien for a part because her mother had dressed her in white gloves. During the interview with the movie's makers, Margaret became so distracted by Ann's gloves that she muffed the interview.</p>
<p>Her first significant role came at age 6 when she played a young Norwegian girl "Solveig", whose father-played by Paul Muni-led the resistance to the occupation of their fishing village by the German army. Although it was clearly a wartime propaganda film, it was based on a story by the noted British writer C.S. Forester and the screenplay was by Irwin Lewis the noted American writer. The excellent cast included Sir Credric Hardwicke, and Lilian Gish. The soldiers were played by real British Commandos who were training nearby. The movie was filmed on Vancouver Island in British Columbia because of its presumed similarity to Norway with its forests, mountains and an abundance of water. Ann and the other cast and crew members stayed at the famous Empress Hotel in Victoria.</p>
<p>Her most notable film came in 1944 when she played the part of Amy Reed in the classic fantasy "Curse of the Cat People" , produced by the legendary Val Lewton. She was only age 7 when the movie was filmed. Amy was a lonely and imaginative child who is unable to relate to the prosaic activities of her schoolmates.</p>
<p>In early 2007 Ann travelled to New York City to be interviewed about her memories of the movie for a television special to be aired on Turner Broadcasting around Halloween 2007.</p>
<p>Ann appeared in a number of other movies, perhaps most notably at age 10 as Humphrey Bogart's daughter in the murder thriller "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" which earned her the award for best juvenile performer in 1947. She remembers Bogart and co-star Barbara Stanwyck as very nice to her. Bogie nicknamed her"Tonsils" after she yawned in his face during a rehearsal.</p>
<p>She also did a lot of Lux radio dramas, including as Cary Grant's daughter in the radio adaptation of "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House".</p>
<p>One film historian called Ann "the serious faced little blonde". Although she was a beautiful child, she did not play in films aimed at children or in light topics. In her best roles, she is a vulnerable child trapped in a hostile adult world.</p>
<p>Ann left acting at the beginning of her teens after she contacted polio, a scourge among children of that time. She did however largely recover and attended Occidental College, outside Los Angeles. Her earnings from her acting paid for her medical care and college education.She decided she wanted to teach rather than return to acting.</p>
<p>She left teaching in Southern California in 1982 when sh and her husband decided to relocate to the Pacific Northwest. They settled in the eastern suburbs of Seattle. Ann became a travel agent, arranging vacation cruises . She has now retired, in part to help care for her grandchildren.</p>
<p>Ann Carter belongs to a generation of child actors that one film historian has called "the lost children of Hollywood". For many such children their films were almost lost for many years and even decades, and they were largely forgotten. But with the advent of the VHS and even more the DVD with its Special Features, many of these movies are being re-discovered.</p>
<p>"Commandos Strike at Dawn" and " Curse of the Cat People" have recently been issued on DVD, and "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" is available on VHS.</p>
<p>Much of the information here is based on telephone interviews with Ann Carter in February 2007.</p>
