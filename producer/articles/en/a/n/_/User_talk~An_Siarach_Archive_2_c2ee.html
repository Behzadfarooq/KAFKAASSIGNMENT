<dd>Heh, il admit i was quite amused to click on it ( in the hope that id found an interesting article which was new to me ) only to find a pretty short, rather poor, article on the principle kingdom in Feist's Midkemia - when i was younger i was actually a fan of his stuff so i might even try and improve that article. As soon as im free of pressing academic commitments i intend to have a shot at expanding/adding to the existing stuff we have on the Lordship.I like the idea of eventually splitting the article to deal with the different eras. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Safavid dynasty</span></h2>
<p>Hi. Please see what I found in Iranica with regard to Safavids:</p>
<p><i>Shah Abbas II (r. 1052 – 77/ 1642 – 66 q.v.) was himself a poet, writing Turkic verse with the pen name of Tani.</i> <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v3_articles/azerbaijan/azeri_literature_iran&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v3_articles/azerbaijan/azeri_literature_iran&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>This is a proof that late Safavids were also Turkic-speakers. I think that the Columbia encyclopedia was absolutely correct when refereed to Safavids as a Turkic-speaking dynasty. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:08, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Safavids were beyond doubt Turkic. This is stated explicitly by the likes of Bernard Lewis, Ira Lapidus and David Morgan in the leading books on Persia and the Islamic world. I have not seen a single bit of evidence from those who wish to pretend that the Safavids were ethnically Persian/Kurdish - their argument rests on a misleading perception regarding the ethnicity of Safi al-Din who was Persian himself but who was the <i>founder</i> of the religious sect which initially influenced the Safavids and claiming that the entire dynasty is Persian because of this is like claiming that every Christian King is/was Jewish because the founder of their faith ( Jesus ) was himself a Jew. Im ashamed to say that i simply dont have the stamina to counter the nonsense spouted on the talk pages regarding this issue as ive already put forward ( months ago ) explicit, irrefutable, evidence that the Safavids were Turkic from the worlds leading authorities which has been unashamedly ignored. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></dd>

<dd>Do you think there’s a way to resolve this issue within the Wiki rules? I know that RfC is not that effective, but it is the first step of dispute resolution. Maybe it’s worth to start one to attract attention of the community to the dispute? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 13:01, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should surely be possible. If we were to call in a third party and put forward all the evidence , which tbh is as explicit as one could hope for in stating the Safavids were Turkic, then we might get this ridiculous edit war ended and stop those pushing the pro-persian POV/propaganda stopped from removing historical fact from the pages. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></dd>

<dd>I think that’s what we should do. It’s time to draw the attention of the Wiki community to this topic, we definitely need to take it outside of this narrow circle. This kind of biased approach plagues many of the articles related to Iran and its history and people, the most glaring example being voting on <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> talk page on inclusion of Azeri people in the list of Iranian people, while Azeris don’t even speak an Iranian language! These people think that they can decide on such matters by simple voting and ignoring major academic sources. They don’t even care about the opinion of neutral users, who try to explain to them that it is simply wrong. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tajik, you are amongst the most blatant POV users ive come across on Wikipedia. "are you just jealous or once again pissed off, because major sources were presented to disprove your POV opinion that Safavids were ethnic turks" No major sources have been provided to prove that the Safavids were anything other than ethnic Turks. The likes of Bernard Lewis, Ira Lapidus etc have been quoted from the leading books on the Middle East/Islam stating explicitly that the Safavids were Turkic. Users such as yourself, who doggedly push their own agenda regardless of the weight of prominent evidence which contradicts them, are the ones who bring the encyclopedia into disrepute. Ive read that article and it is ( if by "Persian origin" it is referring to ethnicity ) simply wrong or ( as is more likely as i cannot imagine it contradicting so completely the accepted orthodoxy by the leading scholars of the field that the Safavids were Turkic - something which is backed up by explicit, irrefutable evidence) by "of Persian origin" it means originating within Persia and nothing more. You have a vested interest in this issue which obviously leads you to being POV. I have none whatsoever and am simply supporting the legitimate views put forward by the leading scholars and academic works dealing with the history of the Middle East/Islam/Persia. If you can give me sound reasoning for the assumption that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, The History of Islamic Society by Ira Lapidus, Medieval Persia 1040-1797 by David Morgan and the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Oriental_and_African_Studies_e2d9.html" title="School of Oriental and African Studies">School of Oriental and African Studies</a> are wrong in stating/teaching that the Safavids were a Turkic dynasty then do so.<a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></dd>

<dd>Youve obviously forgotten to answer my challenge so il put it forward again <i>"If you can give me sound reasoning for the assumption that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, The History of Islamic Society by Ira Lapidus, Medieval Persia 1040-1797 by David Morgan and the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Oriental_and_African_Studies_e2d9.html" title="School of Oriental and African Studies">School of Oriental and African Studies</a> are wrong in stating/teaching that the Safavids were a Turkic dynasty then do so."</i>. I would love for you to provide one single rational reason for why i would be a "turcophile" or "turkish nationalist" considering i am white and british with absolutely no links to either Persia or Turkey beyond the fact that i happen to study the history of both. Listing the qualifications of the people who write whatever articles you reference to support your POV is meaningless as the fault is not(i think its safe to assume) with them, but with the ridiculously agenda driven way in which you choose to interpret their writings. You cannot provide any article which states explicitly that the Safavids were ethnically and linguistically Persian while it is awesomely easy for anyone wishing to prove that they were Turkic to find emphatic statements and work from world leaders stating so.<i>"This is really getting TOO stupid "</i> Its been ridiculous from the start. Everything points quite explicitly to a dynasty of Turkic origins, nothing has yet been provided stating otherwise . <i>"And you haven't even explained why you removed that award from my page"</i> Edit history showed that it was stuck up by you and the user named as having given it to you has 1 edit in their history, which is not that one.<i>"Next time, I'll report you to an admin because of vandalism"</i> Boo and indeed hoo - it never ceases to amuse me how quickly those who undermine the integrity of Wikipedia - be it through outright vandalism or POV pushing - resort to threats based on Wiki etiquette etc. The Safavids were not of Persian origin. No ruling dynasty of Iran was of ethnic Persian origin between the 11th and 18th centuries - from the coming of the Seljuks every dynasty was of non-Persian stock until the Zands who emerged following the murder of Nadir Shah. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></dd>

<dd>The point is not proving them "Persian", but proving that they were NOT Turks. I have provided you with authoritive sources which consider the Safavids as "native Iranians", and clearly distinguish between the Safavids and Buayids on one side, and "Arabs, Mongols, and Turks" on the other side. Here, once again for you: <i>"... In the first place, the Safavids <b>restored Persian sovereignty</b> over the whole of the area traditionally regarded as the heartlands of Persia <b>for the first time since the Arab conquest</b> ... During the whole of that time, <b>only once ... did a dynasty of Persian origin prevail over much of Iran</b>..."</i> <a href="http://www.magix-photos.com/mediapool02/22/DD/4B/10/D2/8D/11/D9/BE/75/69/B3/50/AB/06/3B/oma/10/0E667400DB4611DA96C922AF52538008.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.magix-photos.com/mediapool02/22/DD/4B/10/D2/8D/11/D9/BE/75/69/B3/50/AB/06/3B/oma/10/0E667400DB4611DA96C922AF52538008.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The Safavids are CLEARLY distinguished from Turks, Arabs, or Mongols. It's not my fault that you consider people like E.C. Bosworth or R.M. Savory "POV-writers" and "incompetent" ... I have quoted from one of the most authoritive (if not THE most authoritive) source of Oriental studies. It has deffinitly <i>more weight</i> than what you have quoted, because the Encyclopaesia of Islam is a balanced work ... a summary of many credible and scholarly sources. And for your information: in the article "Turks", the Safavids are not mentioned either (unlike Ottomans, Karakhanids, or Seljuqs). The problem with you turcophiles is that you purposely reject and ignore credible sources which do not support your turcophile propaganda or POVs. The Encyclopaedia of Islam AND the Encyclopaedia Iranica say that Safavids were NOT Turks ... that's totally enough to call them Non-Turks here in Wikipedia, no matter if you turcophiles like it or not.

</dl>
<p>Another phrase which carries ambiguity is this "restoration of Persian sovereignty" - The Persians did indeed enjoy sovereignty during this reign and the Safavids were eventually Persianized but this changes nothing about their Turkic backround, early Turkic nature and the only reason they decided to 'go native' ( i. e. Persian ) rather than pursue their Turkic heritage - support due to which they had come to power - was because of the decisive defeat at Chaldiran which robbed them of their Turkic recruiting grounds.</p>
<dl>
<dd>" ... During the whole of that time, <b>only once ... did a dynasty of Persian origin prevail over much of Iran</b>..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again ambiguous. "Persian origin" has no explicit ethnic reference and must ( if it is to be valid) mean of origin within the geographical confines of Persia.</p>

The Safavids are CLEARLY distinguished from Turks, Arabs, or Mongols. "</dd>
</dl>
<p>An explanation here is again quite easy as Turks usually means Ottomans, Mongols are distinct and Arabs need no explanation. The Safavid regime was indeed dinstinct from the "Turks, Mongols and Arabs" but this doesnt change the fact that it was Turkic and not Persian in ethnicity.</p>

<p>As you well know i have not faulted your sources, only your agenda driven interpretation of them.

<p>Oh it is THE most authoritive simply because it suits your bias.</p>
<dl>
<dd>" It has deffinitly <i>more weight</i> than what you have quoted, because the Encyclopaesia of Islam is a balanced work "</dd>
</dl>
<p>LOL. A balanced work - yes of course, anyone who disagrees with you and agrees with the ORTHODOXY that the Safavids were Turkic is obviously an anti-Persian bigot, regardless of how prominent and respected they or their institution may be.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The problem with you turcophiles"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Il invite you again to provide a rational reason for why i would be in any way biased- you obviously have a vested interest here, i do not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>" is that you purposely reject and ignore credible sources which do not support your turcophile propaganda or POVs."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This statement would be perfectly correct if were an admisison of guilt on your part.</p>
<dl>
<dd>" The Encyclopaedia of Islam AND the Encyclopaedia Iranica say that Safavids were NOT Turks ... that's totally enough to call them Non-Turks here in Wikipedia, no matter if you turcophiles like it or not."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ive yet to see an explicit statement along the lines of "The Safavids were an ethnic-Persian dynasty, the first ethnic Persian dynasty to gain power in centuries following eras of Arab,Mongol and Turkic rule" which would emphatically support your claims. I have provided statements just as explicit which contradict your claims.</p>

<p>Thanks very much. But the award really belongs to <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">you know who</a>. I just do what he tells me&#160;:-) Well, apart from work on Scotland in the Early Middle Ages. I was thinking, so as to avoid that for another week or two, that I might bodge up some articles on the individual Kings and Lords of the Isles. I don't have any books that would pass muster as reliable sources, but I suppose it is better to have something than nothing. I suppose the exam season is in full flow in the real world.

<p>Thank you An Siarach! Appreciated! Hope you enjoyed the football. Anyways, I'm afraid we've got a long way to go if we wanna match those Poles. Their output is extraordinary. @ Angus, if there was a barnstar for modesty, I'd award you it. If it weren't for you, the Pictish articles would still be the crudities they were before you started contributing. Glad to hear you're thinking of giving those Lord of the Isles articles a whammy; if you're talking about the pre-<a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence_7020.html" title="Wars of Scottish Independence">SWoI</a> rulers, it'll be tough. You might want MacDonald's <i>Kingdom of the Isles</i> and <i>The Argyll Book</i> just for starters. Oram's <i>Lordship of Galloway</i> won't harm either, and <i>Viking Empires</i> will do you some good too. The great thing about those lists - thanks for Orkney BTW&#160;:) - is that, if they're done well (as yours always are) they make it easier for the wikipedian community in general to contribute. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 21:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, it's one of those things. Letting the cultural tensions of a later age interfere with historical understanding. You might consider that most evil "Highlander" of all, Alasdair Mòr mac-an-Righ, the "Wolf of Badenoch", who got into a dispute with the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Moray_ca4b.html" title="Bishop of Moray">bishop of Moray</a> and burned down <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Cathedral_c8e5.html" title="Elgin Cathedral">Elgin Cathedral</a>.

And who was this guy's son? Well, it was the Alasdair/Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, who led the "Lowland" army at Harlaw. Funny thing isn't it?! Perhaps these modern amateur historians should sort this out, and work out who's Lowland and who's Highland, so their cliche can at least be consistent. Maybe they could look at the Earldom of Mar too, then they'd see most of its territory consists of land still Gaelic speaking in the 19th century! As for books ... I'm in the same position, all my books are in Ross now, and I'm not, so I too am unable to write anything. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 01:21, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Somerled</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your note. I have, I must confess, a very direct way of expressing myself, and dismissing what I consider to be intellectual nonsense. Were you yourself inclined to take the DNA argument seriously? If so I apologise if my curt dismissal of this caused any offence.</p>
<p>I have now read the article you highlighted; thanks. For me it confirms a truism: believe absolutely nothing you read in the press! I have to say again it's simple nonsense in a garb of scientific authority. Any reputable historian could have told Professor Sykes that Somerled was of mixed Gaelic and Norse ancestry: his very name, as I am sure you know yourself, means Viking. The world he inhabited-the world of the <i>Gall-Gaedhil</i>-was both Celtic and Norse.</p>
<p>As for the contention that 500,000 people are descendend from Somerled, what more can I say? The statement is on the same intellectual plain as that which says the whole human race is descended from Adam. Somerled died in 1164. No matter how fertile and productive his descendents were, it defies logic, good sense and simple mathematics to argue that within the space of 900 years-some thirty generations later-he has half a million people walking around today who could claim to be his grand xtimes children. I doubt even rabbits are that fecund!</p>
<p>There is, of course, a deeper intellectual confusion at work here, tied up in the origin myths that surround clanship. There may very well be 500,000 people (or more) alive today with the name MacDonald; but they most assuredly do not have a common ancestor. As I have said elsewhere surnames were virtually unknown in the Scottish Highlands until the eighteenth century, when many people adopted the name of their local chief or landlord, implying a kinship in blood that never existed. Before this the practice was simply to be known as 'the son of.' The greatest of the war chiefs of Clan Donald was only ever known to his fellow Gaels as Alasdair MacColla, after his father, Coll. You could conceivably have a Campbell MacDonald who was the son of Donald Campbell! Do all the Smiths and Browns come from one original Smith or Brown? I think not! DNA evidence is not nonsense; but some of the arguments extrapolated from it clearly are.

<p>Hello again. I noticed from visiting your page that you have done some (or all?) work on the above. There are two points you might wish to note. The commonly accepted date-and place-of John's death is wrong:he died in 1503, not 1498. The more serious point is, as I think you probably noticed from reading the work I did on the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Isles_a3d8.html" title="Lord of the Isles">Lord of the Isles</a> page, that the forfieture of 1493 had nothing at all to do with the Treaty of Westminster, the details of which were known to the Scottish government as early as 1476. I have not made any changes now that I have identified you as a named author. I prefer to tread on toes anonymously! <a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 00:01, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>'Please bear in mind that it is no more correct to refer to Britain/the UK as 'England' than it would be to refer ot the USA as 'California' or 'Texas'.

<p>A Shiarach, a chara, Well, I don't have any reference that's up to Wikipedia's standard as to whether or not the Gaelic-speaking communities in Ireland or Scotland do or don't follow these practices. To be honest, I wouldn't be wholly surprised if they did follow them, the Gaeltachts in Ireland are very traditional places and old folk-stories have real meaning there still, especially amongst the older people. Belief in fairies, gods/goddesses and various things that date back to pre-Christian Ireland are still held by a large amount of people, though this would be true of areas outside the Gaeltacht also. This is based purely on experience of these areas, not any objective outside source.

<p>Hello.I have a request for your Gaelic skills. I have been editing the article <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slughorn.html" title="Slughorn">slughorn</a>. This word is an archaic form of slogan and is derived from the Scots Gaelic <i>sluagh-ghairm</i>. As you may know slughorn was used by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Chatterton_1bee.html" title="Thomas Chatterton">Thomas Chatterton</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Browning_8d53.html" title="Robert Browning">Robert Browning</a> in quite a different sense to mean trumpet (or possibly some kind of oboe). According to <a href="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/SIV_SOU/SLOGAN.html" class="external text" title="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/SIV_SOU/SLOGAN.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from the 1911 edition of <i>Encylopedia Brittanica</i> it has been shown that Chatterton got the word out of Gavin Douglas' translation of the Aeneid and simply misunderstood. The article quotes the relevant passage (without book or line reference): "The deaucht trumpet blawis the brag of were; the slughorne, enseule or the wache cry went for the battall all suld be reddy". Please tell me, what does this passage mean?

<p>Hi. Thought you might be able to help me out. In the <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill_d4c5.html" title="Fionn mac Cumhaill">Fionn mac Cumhaill</a>, I've included the pronunciation of the name by native Irish speakers in Ulster, Connacht, West Munster and East Munster, respectively using IPA symbols. I notice that you speak Scottish Gaelic and was wondering how <i>Fionn</i> is pronounced in Scotland. Might be a good idea to include the Scottish and Manx pronunciations as well if they differ from the Irish. Go raibh maith agat. Tapadh leat. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Muimhneach_Machnamhach_62bf.html" title="User:An Muimhneach Machnamhach">An Muimhneach Machnamhach</a> 17:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. In my own dialect of West Muskerry, we pronounce <i>Fionn</i> as "Fyoon" with a long "oo" like in "moon" although as you point out, the Scottish pronunciation is probably similar to that of Donegal: something like "Fin" with a velarised "n". I see you're from the Western Isles. I cycled from Barra to the Butt of Lewis back in 2004. Loved the place and the people and may go back some time next year. I need to brush up on my Scottish Gaelic before I go, though! I presume An Siarach means "The Westerner"? <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Muimhneach_Machnamhach_62bf.html" title="User:An Muimhneach Machnamhach">An Muimhneach Machnamhach</a> 09:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mmm. What you say is very interesting; that you pronounce <i>Fionn</i> as <i>fyoon</i>. I'm always surprised at the way Munster Irish shares certain traits with Scottish Gaelic which Connacht and Ulster Irish lack. Like you pronounce <i>ceann</i>, <i>peann</i>, <i>mall</i> etc. the exact same way as someone from West Munster would and you say <i>tha</i> as people in West Kerry say <i>thá</i> instead of <i>tá</i>. I remember staying in a B&amp;B in Barvas, just up from the road from the turn off for Stornoway. I think the name of the place is Borve or Borgh? Can't think of the name of the family. Lovely people. I used to know a guy here in Dublin from the west side of Lewis. Peter MacKay or Pàdruig Mac Aoidh I think was his name. He's doing a degree in English in Trinity College. He used to give Scottish Gaelic classes in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conradh_na_Gaeilge_26a6.html" title="Conradh na Gaeilge">Conradh na Gaeilge</a>. You probably know him or know of him.

<dd>Intellectually challenged and/or naive because i put forward references from major newspapers for the assertion that Somerled is the second most common ancestor after Genghis Khan - a development you, as an apparent expert in the relevant field, seemed utterly unaware of?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Enzedbrit's talk page Scotland/Alba</span></h2>
<p>I agree with your analysis. I think I expressed myself badly. I was more concerned with the apparent racism of the original poser than anything else. I kept refering to Scotland, when what I probably meant was Caledonia (if this this the correct term?) Anyway thanks for setting me straight. I am mainly concerned with trying to keep finger pointing, petty nationalism and racism out of the articles relating to Wales and England (I rarely venture into anything to do with Scotland on Wikipedia). I can come accross as agressive at times, but I don't mean to. If I have in the past then I appologise. All the best. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
