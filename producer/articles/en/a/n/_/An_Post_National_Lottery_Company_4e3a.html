<p>In 2005, the National Lottery raised €203.2 million (<a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">euro</a>) for distribution by the government to good causes, bringing the total raised since the inception of the Lottery to €2.4 billion.

<p>Lotto is the National Lottery's flagship game. Its matrix, which began as 6/36 in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, has been changed three times in its history. As of November 2006, Lotto is a 6/45 game. The minumum play has always been two lines of six numbers.</p>
<p><a name="Lotto_6.2F36:_1988-1992" id="Lotto_6.2F36:_1988-1992"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Post_National_Lottery_Company_4e3a.html" title="Edit section: Lotto 6/36: 1988-1992">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lotto 6/36: 1988-1992</span></h4>
<p>The first Lotto draw was held on Saturday, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. At 20:00 on live <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Telef%C3%ADs_%C3%89ireann_1c03.html" title="Radio Telefís Éireann">Radio Telefís Éireann</a> television, six numbered balls were drawn randomly from a drum containing thirty-six balls. Players could win by matching four, five, or six of the drawn numbers. If more than one ticket bore the winning combination, the jackpot would be shared equally among the winning tickets. If no winning ticket was sold, the jackpot would roll over for the next draw. Drawings continued weekly until Wednesday, May 30, 1990, when the National Lottery held its first midweek Lotto draw. Since then, Lotto draws have been held twice weekly, on Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>In a 6/36 lottery, the odds of matching all six numbers and winning the jackpot are 1 in 1,947,792. At Lotto's initial cost of £0.50 <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_pound.html" title="Irish pound">Irish punt</a> (€0.63 <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">euro</a>) for each six-number combination, one could cover all possible combinations for £973,896 (€1,236,848). When the jackpot reached £1.7 million (€2.1 million) for the May <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_holiday.html" title="Bank holiday">bank holiday</a> drawing in 1992, a 28-member <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>-based syndicate, organized by 43-year-old half-Polish businessman Stefan Klincewicz, tried to buy up all possible combinations and thus guarantee a jackpot win. Klincewicz's team had spent six months marking paper playslips, preparing for the "sting."</p>
<p>The National Lottery tried to foil the plan by limiting the number of tickets any machine could sell, and by turning off terminals Klincewicz's team of ticket purchasers were using heavily. Despite the company's efforts, the syndicate did have the winning numbers on the night -- but two other winning tickets were sold, too, so the syndicate could claim only one-third of the jackpot, or £568,682 (€722,226). Many smaller match-5 and match-4 prizes brought its total winnings to approximately £1,166,000 (€1,480,000), representing only a modest profit after expenses. Klincewicz appeared on the television talk show <i><a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Live_d5ba.html" title="Kenny Live">Kenny Live</a></i> and capitalized on his short-lived notoriety with a self-published lottery-system book entitled <i>Win the Lotto.</i></p>

<p>To prevent a scheme such as Klincewicz's from happening again, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/39 game later in 1992, raising the jackpot odds to 1 in 3,262,623. The first Lotto 6/39 drawing was held on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.To compensate for the longer jackpot odds, the company added a "bonus number" to the drawings. Whereas players previously needed either a match-4, match-5, or match-6 to win, prizes were now also awarded for match-5+bonus, match-4+bonus, and match-3+bonus.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">September 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Lotto became a 6/42 game, which made the jackpot odds 1 in 5,245,786. The National Lottery made this change to generate bigger rollover jackpots, partly so that people living near the border with <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> would not forsake Lotto for the bigger jackpots on offer in the 6/49 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lottery_179b.html" title="National Lottery">British National Lottery</a>, which started in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1994.html" title="November 1994">November 1994</a>. At the same time, the National Lottery introduced computer-generated "quick picks" as an alternative to marking numbers on paper playslips. Some smaller retailers now only offer the quick-pick option.</p>
<p>In 1998, the National Lottery increased the cost of a line of Lotto from £0.50 to £0.75. With the introduction of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">euro</a> currency on January 1, 2002, the cost became €0.95, and was shortly thereafter rounded to €1.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2006.html" title="November 2006">November 2006</a>, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/45 game, raising the jackpot odds to 1 in 8,145,060. It also made the starting jackpot a guaranteed €2 million (up from €1.35 million), increased the match 5+bonus prize to €25,000 (up from €12,000), introduced a €5 match-3 prize, and increased the price of a line of Lotto from €1 to €1.50, keeping the minimum play at two lines. The company said that the structural changes should produce about twenty Lotto jackpots of €5 million and over each year, and at least one jackpot over €10 million.</p>
<p>The National Lottery also changed the presenter of its televised Lotto draw, replacing Ronan Collins -- who had presented more than two thousand draws since 1988 -- with Laura Woods.</p>
<p>The first 6/45 draw was held on Saturday, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>The Consumers’ Association of Ireland criticized the 50% increase in the price of Lotto, noting that game's minimum play of €3 per ticket now makes it one of the world's most expensive lotteries.</p>

<p>In 2000, the National Lottery introduced Lotto Plus. For an extra £0.25 per combination, players could enter their Lotto numbers in an additional 6/42 "Lotto Plus" drawing for a fixed jackpot of £250,000 (€317,500). The first Lotto Plus drawing took place on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. In 2002, a second Lotto Plus drawing was added (the two extra drawings were now named <b>Lotto Plus 1</b> and <b>Lotto Plus 2</b>), the cost of Lotto Plus was raised to €0.50 per combination, and the jackpots were fixed at €300,000 and €200,000 respectively. Lotto Plus jackpots do not roll over.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2006.html" title="November 2006">November 2006</a>, when Lotto and Lotto Plus adopted a 6/45 matrix, the Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 jackpots were raised to €350,000 and €250,000 respectively. The cost of Lotto Plus remained at €0.50 per line. The minimim play is two lines, so the minimum wager to play Lotto with Lotto Plus is now €4.</p>
<p>As with the main Lotto game, Lotto Plus players can win smaller prizes for match-5+bonus, match-5, match-4+bonus, match-4, match-3+bonus. For a match-3 in Lotto Plus 1, the winner receives a €3 <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scratchcard.html" title="Scratchcard">scratchcard</a>; a match-3 in Lotto Plus 2 wins a €1 scratchcard.</p>
<p>Sales of Lotto Plus were €103.6 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of Lotto players now choose the additional Lotto Plus option. Lotto and Lotto Plus tickets may be purchased in advance for up to eight draws.</p>

<p>Based around the main Lotto draw, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 was introduced in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1997.html" title="February 1997">February 1997</a>. It allows players to win prizes by correctly matching one, two, three, four, or five of the drawn numbers. The more numbers players try to match, the greater the prize. Players may base their choices either on a six-number game (excluding the bonus number) or on a seven-number game (including the bonus number). Somewhat of a niche game, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 accounted for €11 million in sales in 2005.</p>
