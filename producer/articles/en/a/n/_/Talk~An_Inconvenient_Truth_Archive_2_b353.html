<p>Under "Promotion" I added this note, which was later removed by user Crust: "In the film, Al Gore, who sits on the board of directors of Apple Computer, is often shown with his Apple notebook computer. Apple Computer carries the trailer for the film on its Web site." This is factual, and I think that this is materially important as it may indicate a potential conflict of interests. Any thoughts/comments? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlogic_ffd9.html" title="User:Johnlogic">Johnlogic</a> 21:53, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Or it may just indicate that:
<ol>
<li>Gore has better things to do with his time than dink around with Windows, or</li>
<li>Apple gives all of its Board members PowerBooks. <a href="../../../a/t/l/User%7EAtlant_5157.html" title="User:Atlant">Atlant</a> 22:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Gore owns a Powerbook, and didn't bother to spend money to edit it out of the film. 75.153.221.227 08:22, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and Apple carries many upcoming movies on their website(in fact, a lot of people I know go there just to get movie trailers). The idea that that would be part of some conflict of interest is a bit odd. Also, it would in any event need <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that make the accusation. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, JoshuaZ, perhaps my use of the term "conflict of interest" goes a bit too far, but it is certainly a vested interest in Apple and, as such, his display of Apple product is notable. I'm not trying to make an accusation, just stating the facts: Al Gore sits on Apple's board of directors (source is right here on the Apple Computer and Al Gore pages, neither by my doing) and the trailer was on Apple's site. In any case, I think to leave out this disclosure could be deemed "lying by omission." (BTW, I try to waste as little time as possible dinking around with Windows, too.) --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlogic_ffd9.html" title="User:Johnlogic">Johnlogic</a> 06:23, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As Johnlogic noted, I deleted this subsection. Here was my edit summary at the time: <i>delete "Cross-promotion" subsection which insinuates the movie is an ad for Apple or something; if someone wants to put this back in sourced to some critic that's OK with me</i>. To my mind, Johnlogic's comments don't address this. I think the heading "Cross-promotion" is indicative of endorsing the POV that Gore was advertising for Apple. I think the opposite case goes something like this: Sure he is shown working on his computer and giving a Keynote presentation, but that's what the documentary is about. The fact that his presentation is often incorrectly described as a Powerpoint presentation (a Windows program) suggests that if this was an advertising campaign, it was a particularly unsuccessful one. I'm deleting again. Like I said, if you want to find a third party making an accusation based on this and put it in a controversy section or something like that, that's OK with me.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 13:37, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was definitely cross-promotion: one promotes the other and vice-versa. But, I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so will accept the delete and move on. Thank you all for your comments. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlogic_ffd9.html" title="User:Johnlogic">Johnlogic</a> 14:18, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The revision of this article I read was erroneously promoting Microsoft describing it as a Powerpoint presentation. I removed the reference to Powerpoint as innappropriate advertising. The review by Brightlights linked also referred to it as a Powerpoint Presentation. The Times online review also referred to it as a Powerpoint presentation. <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8210-2353378,00.html" class="external free" title="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8210-2353378,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8210-2353378,00.html</a> I have read and I'm sure I can find other reviews which have made the same mistake, I suspect lazy journalists have been referencing older revisions of this article. Although it would be my preference not to mention either brand name it is an unfortunate necessity to clear up this disinformation. At the very least making it clear that Apple Keynote was used will help avoid the incorrect reference being added back in or the error spreading any further. If I recall correctly Apple claim not to pay (at least not directly) for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_Placement_d653.html" title="Product Placement">Product Placement</a> and wouldn't you know it is mentioned in the Wikipedia article. Apple shows trailers for all kinds of films on their website, this case is no different. Horkana</p>
<dl>
<dd>As one of those who reverted your edits, all I can say to you is "chill"; as it stands now, the article correctly identifies Gore's presentation as using Keynote. The only references to PowerPoint are in external linked articles, which are obviously not subject to our control. So those religious warriors who are trying to promote either one of the great religions (Mac or not-Mac) can relax. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 22:32, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Regarding the comment by Horkana that the disputed review contains a "glaring error" about PowerPoint vs. Keynote: if you read the review, you'll see that the only error is that the reviewer mistakenly says that Keynote is the Apple version of PowerPoint. To which all I can say is: BFD. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 23:15, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a crappy poorly written review with nothing particular to recommend. If as you say the Powerpoint/keynote discussion isn't relevant then there is no point linking to that review. You cant have it both ways. Horkana</dd>

<p>In other articles, it has been noted that citations to webpages should be expanded as footnotes that include the author/group, title, and date of a reference, so in case the webpage expires in a few months, the reference can still be hunted by title or author, perhaps found on other webpages or in print journals. The problem caused by expanding most citations to have author/title/date is that the citations can become huge within a sentence and clutter the text of the article, unless formatted to avoid the "mass-of-text" appearance. I have found that ref-tag footnotes can be indented (with restrictions), similar to a block-structured <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a>, to improve readability of all the added details, without totally obscuring the original sentence with a "mass of text" about the cited author/webpage/publication. The following is an example of an indented ref-tag (where "ref-tag" will be "ref" in the actual citation):</p>
<p>&lt;ref-tag&gt;</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The main restriction is to never split a bracketed link "[xx yy]" across 2 lines using a carriage-return newline (or the link could appear as unlinked text); however, each separate text line (after carriage-return) can be indented (such as by 5 spaces), similar to a computer <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a> where each line has a carriage-return. Also, the lead ref-tag cannot be separated by a blank line from the prior sentence phrase, or the Wiki-formatted line will split. There is no reason to impose a standard indentation: it could vary, throughout an article, such as indenting the author name by 5 spaces, or 7, with no strict limit. Indented ref-tags can make it bearable to have a dozen footnotes in a paragraph without appearing, internally, as a complex mass of text. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 05:38, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here are my current concerns (though this list will probably grow)</p>
<ul>
<li>I object to the characterization of Gore's original presentation as an "educational campaign" as Gore doesn't seem to have any professional qualification for educating anyone on the subject of climate science - or any science for that matter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The discussion of Naomi Oreskes' un-refereed editorial in Science without any discussion of the mistakes she made in it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The discussion of the statement by the US Senate on Gore's film limited to the inclusion of Inhofe's outlandish remarks and excluding any discussion of the factual errors made in the film as well as the AP article which is mentioned just above it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The inclusion of an unqualified criticism of Richard Lindzen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The censoring of material from the CFP article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The censoring of movie reviews critical of both the film and the contents of it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The removal of physicist W. R. Johnston's critique of the claims made by Gore in the film</li>

<dd>The disc I rented was region-1, though it plays fine on a region-0 player. I think DVD movies may be required to have them. The only DVD I've ever seen not have one was a collection of images (not a movie at all; not even any dialogue) by an independent filmmaker.75.153.221.227 08:29, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. By the official DVD consortium rules, Movies can be region 0 (i.e. not region-locked), and all players should play them. I've got few independent and European movies released this way. DVD drives are required to be region locked, but since the market really hates locked players, nearly all can be unlocked rather easily.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 23:18, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I understand it, controversial works always have a "Criticism" section. I have no idea why everyone is arguing about whether the SCIENCE is controversial, since we should be arguing whether or not the FILM is controversial. Even if what you people say is true and there is a consensus in the scientific community regarding global warming, there is certainly not a consensus among the viewers of the film, the public, politicians, etc. Therefore, since there have been numerous and well-documented attacks on the FILM (please don't turn this into an argument about the science) by many people in the public sphere, not just scientists, this page still deserves a "Criticism" section. Honestly, it's shocking to me that anyone would be arguing over whether it belongs in this article.128.253.190.173 19:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, so a scientific criticism section is out of the question as sources for it would be hard to find and would violate the Undue weight section of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy. However, in popular terms there has been a wide degree of discussion about the film. Maybe it would be appropriate to develop a suitable paragraph here so that other editors can comment on it before it going live, as it is very likely to generate discussion either way. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:11, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, first of all, there is no rule (at least there <b>should be</b> no rule) that any article needs a "Criticism" section. Such a section should be included if it's warranted. The question is, is it?</dd>
<dd>If anyone can demonstrate (and provide citations for, natch) that there is significant controversy over this film—and the usual right-wing axe-grinding, talk-show-hosting, global warming-doubting, oil-company shill characters don't count—then by all means create such a section. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 04:56, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why do you say "the usual right-wing axe-grinding, talk-show-hosting, global warming-doubting, oil-company shill characters don't count"? Certainly, they are pretty important, mainstream people criticizing this film, and are partially the ones influencing, by the film's admission, 53% of the American population, which, in America at least, would mean the majority of the public believes that global warming as a science is controversial, which would mean that the many people who did not see this film would nevertheless have criticisms of it, much like GW Bush (who, whatever your opinions of him may be, still carries weight as a mainstream figure due to his office) and others. Additionally, the aforementioned people you described have large audiences and followers, so yes, their criticisms definitely should be taken into account and added to this article.128.253.190.173 19:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ILike2BeAnonymous: Lovely language, gentle sir. And a good day to you as well. What, you think no one's ever though to ask that question in a public opinion poll? They do have an <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion_poll.html#Polling_organizations" title="Opinion poll">entire industry</a> devoted to those, you know.

Exact figures vary by poll, but there's not a whole lot of skepticism that global warming exists, is a problem, and is at least partially attributable to human activity.I recalled the figure from a poll I saw not too long ago, for which I don't recall the source. I obviously would have felt a need to carefully cite things in an article, but this is just a discussion.

<dd>To explain my proposed exclusion of the opinions of those from certain quarters, upon which I was (probably rightly) called above: what I should have said is that we can discount the "controversy" emanating from the usual suspects whose job it is to manufacture the illusion of such controversy; I think everyone knows of whom I speak. If it can be shown that the public at large has real doubts about this <b>film</b> (not global warming), <b>and</b> that there is a corresponding lively ongoing discussion of this topic, then we can safely say that there's controversy surrounding this film. Otherwise, no. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 21:53, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>128.253.190.173</i>: it is an interesting philosophical thought to believe that controversy at a public level means anything at a scientific level. If we believed everything the media told us we would possibly still think smoking was healthy and beneficial, as the media tried to tell us for many years after scientists first decided it was harmful. In the same vein, what is the difference with us not putting down opinions which do not actually rebutt the film, simply voicing the same things that these people have always said. If they made relevant comments about the content of the film then there comments may fit. It is not to me so much a question of not having what is possibly an influential mainstream media section, "represented," more being a question of whether their commentaries show they relate enough to the subject of this article to deserve representation. Merely naming the film in this sense does not to me give relevance. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:35, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The film actually does have some factual inaccuracies/misrepresentations. In the film I remember it was implied that the Aral Sea is shrinking due to global warming. This isn't actually the case, it is shrinking due to massive water diversion for irrigation. I have been hearing criticisms of the movie, mostly certained around the fact that although much of what Gore says is true it remains a propogandized and politicized film. I know theres is criticism along these lines out there and it is worth including in the article.

<dd>It probably also should be pointed out that more then the 19% mentioned above find themselves at odds with the movie. There is certainly evedence that global warming works in cycles, and that we will eventually see global cooling, that said, even us "right-wing axe-grinding, talk-show-hosting, global warming-doubting, oil-company shill characters" recognize that human contribution is a real factor. It's just in light of the fact of self-rapairing ozone layers and enviromental cycles, it is viewed as a highly <i>overstated</i> issue, which some feel is being played up to help legitimize a hardline enviromentalitst platform. <a href="../../../p/i/u/User%7EPiuro_2542.html" title="User:Piuro">Piuro</a> 21:08, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ozone, the environment, and the world in general have NOTHING to do with whether or not there should be a criticism section for the MOVIE. Denying the fact that there is criticism from mainstream figures as well as the commmon public is simply denying the truth. A piece was done by the Canadian Free Press citing a (non-governmental, non-industry, non-lobbying) professor at the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University, in Australia, who calls the arguments made by Gore as absolutely ridiculous. The article cites numerous climate experts who say that what Gore is claiming is misleading. The article can be found <a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you must have a citation. The idea that this movie is somehow noncontroversial, or worse, above criticism, is ridiculous.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But that very argument is flawed. How can the movie be contraversial without the science behind it being flawed? What's left to be contraversial? The whole movie is based on educated people about the possible effects of this global warming phenomenom. That is the movie. If you argue that the movie is contraversial, you argue that the science is wrong, which is just incorrect. The only arguments made against the movie are right-wing extremists who believe that by adding in some completely unscientific section to make it seem that as opposed to scientific fact, which global warming is, is just an idea by a minority which is wrong. Any how can you claim that the ozone, the environment and the world in general have nothing to do with whether or not the movie is contraversial. The movie is about environment, so this article has everything to do about environment. The only way the movie could be contraversial is if the science were somehow flawed, which just isn't true. Claims that a criticism is needed are attempts to further a political ideology. Leave political criticism for political articles. This article is about a documentary done into science, NOT politics. He states that Washington itself has not done enough. Keep attempts to further your flawed political ideology away from science. You should also avoid openly admitting that the political right wing is willing argue against a scientific consensus, because the Wikipedia deals with fact, not opinion. I could find an article against basic mathematics and say that I disagree that 1+1=2 or that blood carries oxygen to the heart, but because I disagree does that mean that suddenly that article needs to have a criticism section? No, because opinion aren't opinions when they directly contradict fact, and that fact is that the average temperature has risen with the average amount of Carbon Dioxide in the air! Oh yeah, and the Canandian Free Press is a biased organization. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStopmenow100_b5bb.html" title="User:Stopmenow100">Stop Me Now!</a> 18:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I liked the film except when he makes all of these snide little political remarks, and then says 'its not a political issue, its a moral issue'.

Also, <a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympa_7448.html" title="User:Sympa">Sympa's</a> criticisms are a mix of well-founded, adequately sourced criticism, along with some questionably <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, some <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and some unsourced patent nonsense (for example, it's actually not "paradoxical" that GW could cause droughts in one area and floods in another). In any case, this is not the place for a blow-by-blow of the GW controversy, and major additions/changes need to be discussed here first given the controversial nature of the article. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 20:13, 30 October 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Not to dispute your comment, but the "unsourced patent nonsense" you refer to is actually Gore's own words; he says "Global warming paradoxically causes not only more flooding, but also more drought." 24.60.196.65 04:30, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's absolutely true. It's the use of that "paradox" (floods and droughts in different areas) to argue against the existence of global warming that I had in mind when I used the phrase "unsourced patent nonsense". I should have been more clear; thanks for pointing that out. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 20:54, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Answering MastCell's constructive criticism, I have eliminated my small section on inconsistencies that he did not like. I have also cut down to size my proposed section on scientific rebuttals. To seek your collective editorial approval before I include this section in the article, I am passing it by you all. I think this section would provide a more balanced NPOV as to the overall scientific basis behind "An Inconvenient Truth" including both the pros and cons.</p>
<p>So here it is:</p>
<p>Section DRAFT:</p>
<p>Al Gore relied extensively in supporting his arguments on the summary statement from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, the science within the body of the IPCC Report chronically contradicts the Report’s own summary. This theme is thoroughly described in the book: Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming edited by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_J._Michaels_533f.html" title="Patrick J. Michaels">Patrick J. Michaels</a>.</p>
<p>Many scientists, based on their independent research, have not observed a correlation between CO2 concentration and rising temperatures. Professor Tim Patterson, paleonclimatologist at Carleton University in Canada discovered that the Earth was a lot colder than now 450 million years ago with CO2 levels 10 times our current levels as quoted in the Canada Free Press: <a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Here are just a few more specific statements included within the An Inconvenient Truth book that scientists have rebutted. This list is not exhaustive. Many other scientists have rebutted many other pages of this book.</p>
<ul>
<li>On page 25, CO2 is stated as the most important greenhouse gas. It is not. Per the climatologists at [RealClimate.Org] "water vapor is the single most important absorber (between 36% and 66%) of the greenhouse effect, and together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85%. CO2 alone makes up between 9 and 26%."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On page 63, he shows 1,000 years of "precise" temperature history. But, global temperature data is really poor beyond 30 years ago. Records of questionable quality do exist back to 1867. Prior, it is all computer models guesswork. See Robert Balling on the subject: <a href="http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/170.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/170.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Increase in Global Temperature: What it Does and Does not Tell Us</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On page 75, he mentions the heat wave of Europe in 2003 who killed 35,000. But, this heat wave was not due to global warming but unusual low barometric pressure that eliminated seasonal cooling winds. This conclusion was reached by the scientists staffing the United Nations Environment Program and Rasool (2003). The death toll in Europe was terrible, but part of the blame falls on Europeans lack of use of air conditioning. In the United States, heat-related mortality has fallen as urban temperatures have risen. See Robert Davis study that documents the decrease in heat related mortality for major cities in the U.S. in chapter 8 of <i>[Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming]</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On page 80, he makes a causal link between rising ocean temperatures due to global warming and increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes. Roger Pielke from the University of Colorado found that once hurricane damage is normalized for changes in population, infrastructure, and inflation, there is no long term change in hurricane damage. See also Randall Cerveny study that indicates there has been no increased frequency in hurricanes in chapter 5 of <i>Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On page 190, Al Gore describes the prospect of 40 feet rise in sea level (20 feet each due to the melting of ice cap in Antarctica and Greenland) within this century. This prospect contradicts even the United Nations' IPCC, source of the "consensus" analysis which still overestimates future warming, only predicts sea level rise of 0.1 to 0.8 meters (4 to 30 inches) in the next 100 years. Additionally, per Patrick Michaels, as described in his book Meltdown, the Antarctic is gaining ice mass, not loosing. And, Greenland's ice formation is nearly balanced. Additionally, Greenland’s ice is almost entirely contained within a bowl of seashore mountain range. Thus, little melted ice would reach the ocean. So, the prospect of experiencing sea level rises of 40 feet within this century is not realistic.<a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympa_7448.html" title="User:Sympa">Sympa</a> 20:50, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, here are the problems I have with the section as proposed:
<ul>
<li>"Shattered Consensus" is questionable as a scientific <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for the purposes of this article; it's non-peer-reviewed and seems to be made up of articles that didn't make it through the peer-review process and so were published in book form. These articles did not emerge spontaneously from a scientific process; they were collected to make a point after, apparently, failing to make it into the peer-reviewed literature. Correct me if I'm wrong; I'm basing this partially on the WP page on Shattered Consensus, most of which you authored. Certainly, presenting it as equal to, or "debunking", the IPCC report is inappropriate. There's a pronounced over-reliance on this one somewhat dubious source in the proposed section.</li>
<li>The Canada Free Press is a partisan media outlet; it's a double-no from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (popular media covering science, and partisan agenda). You could cite it as <i>political</i> criticism of Gore or the book, but not as scientific criticism.</li>
</ul>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The tone implies that a vast "silent majority" of scientists disagree with the film's conclusions and makes significant use of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWeasel_words_17d9.html" title="WP:Weasel words">"weasel words"</a>. Stick to what's citable/sourceable, and avoid "many other scientists think..." etc. Further, characterizations such as "it's all computer guesswork" are POV and misleading; computer modeling is a central scientific tool. If specific criticisms of its use in this context exist, cite those.</li>
<li>Again, there is a problem with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> throughout. RealClimate.org is a non-peer-reviewed blog; citing it as the last word on scientific matters is at odds with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The overarching problem is that you're presenting a bunch of non-peer-reviewed books, popular media coverage, websites, blogs etc as categorically debunking peer-reviewed research, the IPCC, etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not against a section summarizing scientific criticism, but the proposed addition has problems with POV, weasel words, and reliable sourcing (certainly the sourcing does not back up the tone, which suggests that Gore's arguments have been decisively debunked). Thoughts from the more regular contributors to this page? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 22:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it's really not OK. This should state that there is some scientific debate. It should then point to the relevant articles on that debate. Let's not re-invent the wheel here. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 22:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is with much disappointment that I am leaving this article. I can tell that despite the best of goodwill, my coeditors irascibly will censor any mentioned valid scientific criticism.</p>
<ul>
<li>A statement from an established paleonclimatologist, Professor Tim Patterson, is immediately dismissed because he was quoted from a media source not to the liking of editors.</li>
<li>Book sources are deemed unacceptable. That's even though the book itself is written by scientists for scientists with tens of pages of references.</li>
<li>Additionally, even statements within An Inconvenient Truth such as a prospective rise in sea levels of 40 feet within a century is going to remain unquestionned when it is in stark contradiction with the IPCC itself.</li>
<li>What Al Gore, a benevolent politician, states with (most of the time) the support of the IPCC summary (that contradicts its own science) is unquestionable. What scientists state is barraged by immaterial technicalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you ever wonder why only 19 scientists out of a 100 answered the request to comment on Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. Along the same line, peer-reviewed articles are considered the gold standard of scientific discovery. However, in numerous domains the current scientific process is bankrupt. This is because anyone who challenges the current global warming groupthink does not stand much chance to get published. You can investigate the topic yourselves.<a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympa_7448.html" title="User:Sympa">Sympa</a> 01:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look, this is Wikipedia. I'm sorry that we didn't immediately all agree with you, but working together to come to a consensus is how articles get better here. Leaving in a huff because your suggestions were challenged is your prerogative, but I'd encourage you to stay and work with us. I know it seems like people are being arbitrary and repressing you, but please read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (again). Specifically, the section entitled "In science, avoid citing the popular press." It has nothing to do with my likings, and everything to do with Wikipedia policy. The book source is not completely unacceptable; I objected to the way it was counterposed to peer-reviewed literature and the IPCC as if it had equal validity, when <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> holds that it does not. The number of references a work contains has no bearing on its quality or correctness (if anything, they can be inversely proportional). Your comment about sea level rise may be correct, but consitutes original research; again, please review the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">relevant policy</a> to understand why I objected. Next, the 19 scientists who responded agreed with Gore's interpretation. We can speculate endlessly about what the other 81 think, but <i>not on the article pages of Wikipedia</i>. Finally, please understand that every proponent of a discredited, minority, or pseudoscientific concept claims that the "mainstream" is conspiring against them and hence the lack of published peer-reviewed literature. That's not an argument that will cause us to lower the bar for what we accept as source material. Again, I'm not dismissing the validity of the criticisms; I'm talking about how these things can be framed in a manner that meets <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and all the other policies that guide us on these controversial articles. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 01:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MastCell, your points are well made and well received. I just think this article has a POV within the Scientific basis section that is unbalanced. Just a single rebutting scientist is mentioned. But, he is immediately dismissed by a link to a biogeographer that disagrees with him. The last nail is hammered into his coffin by mentioning that he works for an organization that is in part supported by energy corporations.</dd>

<dd>An Inconvenient Truth offers ample opportunities for an objective pros and cons informative sharing of the current state of global warming studies as conducted by credible scientists.

<dd>I agree with you in general about the movie offering an opportunity for scientific discussion; but there is a general feeling that re-fighting the global warming debate is an inappropriate use of this page, since the controversy is covered in much more detail <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">elsewhere</a> on Wikipedia. In general, the best "criticism" sections are developed by a genuine critic who is familiar with the arguments in question. The section is then passed through regular contributors, people of other viewpoints, etc to get it into appropriate shape for a WP article. I know I sound like an ass quoting a bunch of policies, but they are the only thing that keeps these controversial articles from degenerating into free-form tit-for-tat pedantry (of course, sometimes that happens anyway). <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 22:54, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your points are well made. The internal link you refer to is most interesting and relevant. I just find it POV-like that there is plenty of room to support the opinion of the author/director in this case; but, there is no room allowed for any dissention. Regarding many other movies (period pieces, historical and nonfiction types), I found Wikipedia very forthcoming in disclosing where such movies had diverged from the facts or had glossed over the complexity of certain issues. Why is it different in this particular case? Would we treat a movie about the Holocaust or the Viet Nam war with similar lack of NPOV due diligence just because the issue is treated elsewhere? I hope I have reasonably convinced you or others that a short rebutting section would significantly enrich and rebalance this article.<a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympa_7448.html" title="User:Sympa">Sympa</a> 23:44, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone added a relevant list of scientists that dispute some of the mentioned scientific claims made in the movie. Someone else removed it for unexplained reason. As is, the article reflects the dissenting view of a single scientist (that is again quickly dismissed by a rebuttal). I think this smacks of POV.<a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympa_7448.html" title="User:Sympa">Sympa</a> 18:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wasn't a list of scientists, it was a std.skeptics recital, almost without doubt copied in from elsewhere. We shouldn't be re-running all the pro- and anti- GW arguments and lists on this page. But if there is a pro-science section there should probably be an anti-. But that list was rubbish <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 19:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reviewing the list you question, it seemed appropriate. The list disclosed specific names of scientists, their discipline, degree, and universities they came from. I am not sure what else you would expect from such a list. You just make an egregious assumption to censor that list on a wholesale basis. I invite you and other editors to reconsider this list or come up with your own. Right now, the article suggests that 19 scientists wholeheartedly support every aspect of the movie and only one does not. The 19 receive ample additional support for their views through text, links, etc... The single one that does not gets a single link that rebuts what he stated. Even though many of us may think this reflects objectively the current state of knowledge on the issue (it can reflect what the Media conveys to the public); it does not reflect objectively the consensus level within scientific circles (95% most probably not). A movie/book article should reflect the complexity of the issue and not be a thinly disguised endorsement/advertisement for the movie. OK, someone comes up with a list we can agree with. I think the original list just mentioned had some good names that do not need to be automatically excluded. <a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympa_7448.html" title="User:Sympa">Sympa</a> 21:24, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Poisoning the well is a logical fallacy where adverse information about someone is pre-emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that person is about to say..."</p>

<dd>I've reverted your delisting. For one, the article hasn't had much time to be totally different from the reviewed article assessed as GA by JamesKidd. Second, the citation requests aren't requests per se, the request is for the existing references to be listed under one format (ref instead of sup and external jumps). Third, I don't see any sections needing to be turned into prose. And POV disputes will always exist because Global Warming at present is controversial, with people either believing it or skeptical about it. This is not a Featured Article that demands the strictest standards, GA status is still apt for the article's current form. And really, there isn't much edit wars for POV disputes in the article, it is only here in the talk page that there are POV disputes, and that's because the purpose of a talk page is to talk about how the article should be written. Some of the comments here aren't even about the improvement of the article but just comments on the article's topic which is Global Warming. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 08:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was reading through the article and got to the <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Inconvenient_Truth_6767.html#Political_response" title="An Inconvenient Truth">An Inconvenient Truth#Political response</a> section and read through Bush's comment which says: 'He later stated that "we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases have been caused by mankind or because of natural effects."' My first impressions were, what a moron and what should we be focusing on then? Interested in what else he said I followed the reference and found sure enough that the quote was shortened to give this exact POV. What he actually said was: "And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases have been caused by mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives and at the same time protect the environment." That second quote doesn't really make him look stupid because he's talking about trying to solve the problem by developing new technologies, which is just another take on how to minimize human contribution to Global Warming. I've added the rest of the comment to minimize the POV. --Codingmonkey 18:55, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, we do not need to "set this aside", as the source of greenhouse gases is not under any reaonable debate.

<dd>Well as I stated before, when you read the original abridged quote, you get the impression that Bush is a moron because he doesn't seem to care about Global Warming as he says that you need to set it aside, but doesn't say anything about tackling it. The full quote shows that he does actually have a plan. --Codingmonkey 18:58, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah you are right, we all know that main source of greenhouse gases is naturally produced (i.e. not anthropogenic) <sup><a href="http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup>.

<p>You're probably right. There's no doubt that it's an important movie, but it doesn't rank up there with the likes of Casablanca and Citizen Kane. It's a good documentary and all, but there's nothing much groundbreaking about it. All of the information in it has been established and all the film does is show Al Gore giving a slideshow presentation.</p>
