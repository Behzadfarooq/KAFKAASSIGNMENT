	    <p>First-time user, don't know how to enter equations, but I'd like to make a point verbally: this "example" fails. Bear with me, I'll address both the trig version and the quotient rule inspiration. I'll show only the dydx case.</p>
<p>On the trig version, if you express x and y in polar coordinates, differentiate, and manipulate away r keeping all other terms, you get dy=x*sec^2(theta)*dtheta+tan(theta)*dx. You have 3 variables constrained in how they co-vary: x, y, and theta. You can add a constraint to hold x constant, and that will zero out the tan(theta)*dx term everywhere except on the y-axis, where you cannot assume that infinity*0=0. So, the integral over y is 1/(1+x^2) everywhere except at x=0, for which the integral is undefined (but diverging to neg infinity). Thus, the integral over x is also undefined (but less than or equal to pi/4).</p>
<p>On the quotient rule inspiration, take d/dy y/(x^2+y^2), get (x^2-y^2)/(x^2+y^2)^2, infer that the indefinite integral w/r y is y/(x^2+y^2) + c. So far so good. But now the move to the definite integral is again only warranted when x is not 0. Where it is warranted, substitute 1 and 0 for y, subtract, get 1/(1+x^2), as before. But for x=0, the substitution produces division by zero, and thus an undefined definite integral over y, and therefore also an undefined integral over x.</p>

<p>Is this really the best way to integrate <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/8/d/88d156149bf31eb1958fd159df612542.png" alt="\int \int \frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2} dxdy" />&#160;? Another way is to see that it is what is obtained from the quotient rule when evaluating <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/b/8/db8c476b48b4a1150dc18b134ebe4c9c.png" alt="\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{-x}{x^2+y^2} \right) = \frac{-(x^2+y^2)-(-x)(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} = \frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}" />. The squared term in the denominator is the give-away. This is a lot cleaner than the messy trig substitution used on this page. Mark.howison 06:51, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some say there should be no subpages on Wikipedia, and my gut reaction is to agree. But "examples of Fubini's theorem" is not a good name for this article that gives only one example which, while clearly relevant to Fubini's theorem, is not really an example of Fubini's theorem (except the part where the fact that the two values of the iterated integral differ is used to infer that the integral of the absolute value is infinite). It's certainly not the kind of thing one thinks of when one hears the phrase "examples of Fubini's theorem". I'd suggest "examples relevant to Fubini's theorem", but two objections arise: (1) it's too much like the title that this page had originally ("an elegant rearrangement of a conditionally convergent integral) and would succumb to similar objections, and (2) one might not think of that title when searching. "Fubini's theorem/examples" seems immune to both objections. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:12, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>(1) Because we're taking an absolute value. The absolute value of <i>a</i>&#160;−&#160;<i>b</i> is <i>b</i>&#160;−&#160;<i>a</i> if <i>a</i>&#160;&lt;&#160;<i>b</i>. In the first integral <i>y</i> is bigger than <i>x</i>, and <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> is bigger than <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, so the absolute value is <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>&#160;−&#160;<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, and in the second integral, the order is reversed.</dd>

<dd>(2) Not necessarily--it may depend on integrability. But that has no relevance here, since it is clearly stated that <i>y</i> is between 0 and 1.</dd>

<p>I disagree that examples deserve their own Wikipedia pages. Short examples should go in the originating articles. More complicated demonstrations should go in Wikibooks.

<p>I have changed the title back to what it was originally, "an elegant rearrangement of a conditionally convergent iterated integral", because I think the misleading nature of any title that explicitly mentions Fubini's theorem is in large part the cause of Stlemur's misunderstanding. He actually thought that "Fubini's theorem" was this page's "originating page" and that because of that, the article should get merged into that one.</p>
<p>One could with equal plausibility say that <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_convergence.html" title="Absolute convergence">absolute convergence</a> is the "originating page", but the title mentioning Fubini's theorem obscured that.</p>
<p>Stlemur said that all of the pages that link here could just as well link to <a href="../../../f/u/b/Fubini%27s_theorem.html" title="Fubini's theorem">Fubini's theorem</a>. That is wrong: the article titled <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_convergence.html" title="Absolute convergence">absolute convergence</a> could <i>not</i> "just as well link to <a href="../../../f/u/b/Fubini%27s_theorem.html" title="Fubini's theorem">Fubini's theorem</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect Stlemur may have thought I was proposing that <b>ALL</b> examples in math articles should be in separate articles by themselves. I was not. Routine examples, e.g., illustrating how to use partial fractions to find a particular integral, should not normally be articles by themselves. But anyone who looks at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematical_examples.html" title="List of mathematical examples">list of mathematical examples</a> will find mathematical objects that may be relevant to multiple different articles, not just one, that link to it, some of which are unusually elegant or enlightening, some of which are substantial discoveries in their own right. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:58, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, what I'm saying is, this article should be part of <a href="../../../f/u/b/Fubini%27s_theorem.html" title="Fubini's theorem">Fubini's theorem</a>. I'm away this weekend but will get back to it later. In summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is nothing that this article can do that could not be better-served, that is, have more information more readily accessible, in an extended Fubini's theorem article incorporating this one;</li>
<li>"An elegant rearrangement..." is simply a bad article title: Unwieldy, unencyclopedic, and let's throw in POV too.</li>

<p>My instinct is to say this belongs in a wikibook, with a link from the Fubini's theorem wp article. It's not as though this is a notorious example with a history. Or is it? Then I would like to see that in the article. 128.135.60.26 19:02, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's in some of the standard <i>counterexamples</i> books, such as (and, I suspect, including) <i>Counterexamples in Analysis</i>. Definitely I think a reasonably simple example such as this one should appear in Wikipedia, since we should be clear about when Fubini's theorem applies and when it doesn't. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:36, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
