<dd>Not bad. I might also suggest that you mention that google scholar mentiones 12 papers that cite the FAQ as a reference, though probably someone should check what those papers are.

<dd>I have also seen FAQ's bibliography and links referenced even from sites of ideologies that were criticised (like the abovementioned mutualist.org quote, 'Monumental compendium on anarchist history, theory and practice. Many hundreds of pages. The bibliography alone is incredible' (think it could be shown that mutualist.org is the largest mutualist site online) or, ironically, even here <a href="http://www.polyarchy.org/references/anarchy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.polyarchy.org/references/anarchy.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and here <a href="http://www.panarchy.org/selection.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.panarchy.org/selection.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</dd>

Also included in the guide are an anarchist news kiosk, a comprehensive anarchist FAQ, and a search engine for anarchy on the Web.'

<dd>"to put our cards on the table, the writers of this FAQ place themselves firmly in the "social" strand of anarchism." Now, stop disputing this unless you have a source that says otherwise. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:56, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah, the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burden_of_proof.html" title="Burden of proof">burden of proof</a>.

"All the writers are social anarchists" is a more complex claim the "most of the writers are social anarchists".

<p>The main writers of the FAQ call themselves social anarchists. But you have no evidence to show that all the contributors are social anarchists.

<li>Actually, the FAQ does not say "This FAQ was written by social anarchists". If you study your quote carefully, it is clear that it is the main writers (probably Iain McKay) who are talking about themselves.</li>
<li>In the intro, the authors explicitly invite suggestions from all anarchists, which to them includes individualist anarchists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you think the FAQ is biased (against/towards what?) because the writers are social anarchists, here is the quote from the authors:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The anarchist movement is marked by wide-spread disagreement and argument about various aspects of anarchist ideas and how to apply them (but also, we must add, a wide-spread tolerance of differing viewpoints and a willingness to work together in spite of minor disagreements).

<p>But, RJII, you have no evidence for your claim that ALL the writers were social anarchists either. You quote that sentence every reply; my explanation is that those are the words of the main writers. But they have been open to suggestion from more anarchists. I think the available evidence fits my picture of things better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main writers are social anarchists (<i>"the writers of this FAQ place themselves firmly in the "social" strand of anarchism."</i>)</li>
<li>Anarchists from all schools (except a-c) have contributed to the FAQ ("<i>We are sure that there are many issues that the FAQ does not address.

Also, saying that the writers "reject some ideas of individualist anarchism" is not good enough. They reject the philosophy itself. "social anarchists reject the individualists conception of anarchy, simply because it can, unfortunately, allow hierarchy (i.e. government) back into a free society in the name of "liberty" and "free contracts....However, while social anarchists disagree with the proposals of individualist anarchists, <b>WE</b> do still consider them to be a form of anarchism -- one with many flaws" <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" rel="nofollow">Why Social Anarchists Reject Individualist Anarchism</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:04, 3 April 2006 (UTC) Also, this sentence in the article is misleading: "the FAQ cites references from, and attempts to represent, most schools of anarchism, including mutualism, individualist anarchism" The FAQ does not try to "represent" individualist anarchism --rather, it tries to <i>explain</i> it (to a degree).

I'm not asking for this article to SAY that the FAQ is "biased," but simply to note what that bias is. It was written by "social anarchists" rather than "anarchists" in general.

<dd>No, it doesn't. That something different. The FAQ differentiates between individualist anarchists and anarcho-capitalists (libertarian capitalists). Not all individualist anarchists are anarcho-capitalists (the FAQ writers allege that anarcho-capitalism is not individualist anarchism at all). They reject anarcho-capitalism AND claim it's not real anarchism, AND they reject individualist anarchism (excluding anarcho-capitalism) BUT concede that it's a form of anarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:00, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article has made clear that the authors are from the social anarchist branch of anarchism since March 11th, to my eye. Secondly, RJII's quote seems to back up the point that they reject only some of the ideas of individualist anarchism, given they note that they <i>consider them to be a form of anarchism</i> they accept that they share some common ideals. The issue seems to complex to be defined by a simple blanket statement that they reject the philosophy outright.

Given there are shared ideals, I see no issue with <i>reject only some of the ideas of individualist anarchism</i>.

<dd>The Steve Block version is ok, in the above link except the intro says the FAQ was written by "anarchists." That's true, but why not be more precise and tell the whole truth? It was written by "social anarchists." There is no legitimate reason to obscure this fact from the readers. And, the fact that a couple others here are pressing to prevent that fact from appear there is appalling. I'm sure if a FAQ was written by, say, anarcho-capitalists, you would be pressing for it to say that the FAQ was written by anarcho-capitalists if the intro merely referred to them as "anarchists." There is no reason to be vague, when all it takes is the addition of one word "social anarchists" instead of "anarchists." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:01, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>only cuz its allready stated; there is no vagueness, all thats required is reading on. Should we simply write all other information in the intorduction to? Maybe to note how this was written by social anrchist who reject individualist anarchist and dont consider anarcho-capitalists to be a form of anarchism? If we dont want to 'cover up' any characteristic of the convictions of the authors even in the intoduction, why not be even more precise? Since you admit that whats written is true (while in your example, calling an anarcho-capitalist an anarchist is not necessarly true; it can possibly be considered such, by some, but is at least contraversial), and the fact that they are social anarchist is written, further down, i dont understand whats your objection. I however object to the idea that every anarchist must be labeled as anarcho-this or anarho-that; and it seems you object to the idea that a simple 'anarchist' label can be used to correctly and perfectly describe (gasp) social anarchist anywhere; no - they are anarchists, this can legitimatly be stated, this is not covering anything up, but is a simple fact, and probably expressing precisely how anarchists percieve themselves. --aryah 83.131.144.155 01:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that all this fighting by a couple people trying to prevent me from stating in the intro that the FAQ was written by "social anarchists" rather than "anarchists" tells me I'm on to something, and that I should pursue this. Obviously it's conflicting with the POV someone wants to put across. It's the addition of ONE word that accurately describes the writers by their own account. Sure, they can find out if they read it in the body, but why not allow that one word in the intro to make the sentence more precise? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:08, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>RJII, even if it were the case that you were "on to something," it doesn't change the fact that the particular position of the <i>FAQ</i> authors is obvious to anyone who reads the text. But I'm not going to assume that everytime anyone—say you, for example—clings doggedly to a point, that they're up to no good. The <i>FAQ</i> meets scholarly standards. The intro avoids <i>undue weight</i>. The <i>bias</i> is clearly indicated in the body of an entry so short that nobody reading the thing can miss it. And, ultimately, this is a fairly unimportant entry, on which we've expended a lot of energy. It would be lovely to put this one to bed, and get on with more substantive debates elsewhere. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 03:41, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even if I were to accept the intro as "anarchist" instead of "social anarchist," the body of the article is misleading as well in that respect. It says "The main authors of the FAQ call themselves social anarchists." The "main authors"?? This leads the reader to believe that there are other authors who are not social anarchists. But, no one has presented any evidence to corroborate that. The FAQ says the FAQ was written by "social anarchists" --not "mostly" and not "mainly." This article is clearly misleading the reader. At this point, it's very difficult to conclude that this misleading is not intentional. It's a very simple matter to fix the problem --just say straight out what the authors of that FAQ openly say. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:48, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I don't agree with that version because of sentence “The FAQ authors also criticise some of individualist anarchism's ideas [2]; but they acknowledge the importance of individualist anarchism within the anarchist movement.” My impression is that writers don’t reject some IA’s ideas, but all ideas by which IA differs from SA. Word “some” doesn’t reflect that. My suggestions are: “The FAQ authors also reject individualist anarchism's ideas…” or “The FAQ authors also reject main individualist anarchism's ideas…” <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 07:42, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair play. I've amended the text to:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The FAQ authors also explain why social anarchism rejects ideas expressed within individualist anarchism <a href="http://infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, whilst acknowledging the importance of individualist anarchism within the anarchist movement.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This removes the use of the word some, clarifying that ideas of individualist anarchism are criticised, which appears to be the consensual agreement on this page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 08:22, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><small>Please note there was an edit conflict and some comments above may have been missed.</small></p>
<p>The FAQ is open to contributions via e-mail, therefore it seems germane to state that the main authors of the FAQ are from the social anarchist school of anarchism. However, to address your concerns I've amended the text to read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Although the FAQ has been released under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, and can thus be altered and amended by anyone, the original compilers of the FAQ identified themselves as from the social anarchist branch of anarchism</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>My understanding is that contributions are e-mailed and the FAQ is updated, per "If you think of anything we could add or feel you have a question and answer which should be included, get in contact with us. The FAQ is not our "property" but belongs to the whole anarchist movement and so aims to be an organic, living creation.", although, given the FAQ is released under the same license as Wikipedia, there could exist many versions of the FAQ authored by many different people, and it would be extremely hard to quantify them as anything. I therefore feel RJII's concerns have been addressed and thus I have removed the tag. I would ask that, rather than a blanket reinsertion of the tag, editors address their concerns to this talk page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 08:03, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>My understanding is that although contributions are e-mailed and the FAQ is updated, not all contributions are added. Contributions probably go through screening/editorial process by main authors of the FAQ. Because of that, probably all suggestions from anarcho-capitalists, and most from indivudualist anarchists, are not added. So proclaimed openness of the FAQ is just propaganda. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 09:55, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, given the FAQ is released under the GFDL, there's nowt stopping the anarcho-capitalists and the individual anarchists from amending the FAQ as they will. It's as open as wikipedia. So I'm not sure the point about it being propaganda is wholly germane. However, if you can source the particular criticism you're making, that would be useful. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 10:08, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vision Thing, I might be misreading you, so can you restate your problem. Are you stating that the line <i>"An Anarchist FAQ" is a FAQ written by anarchists from all over the internet in an attempt to present anarchist ideas and theory to those interested in it.</i> is misleading? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 15:31, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On webpages of the FAQ it's noted that: "It is produced by a small collective of people who work on the FAQ when we can (mostly in our free time, after work). This means that any e-mail sent may take a while to be replied to." As I understand it, that means that all contributions are not automatically accepted. They must be first approved by this "small collective". In the introduction of this article, it sounds more like the infoshop's FAQ is some kind of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 16:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's my concerns as well. Sure, they allow people to offer opinions but they won't enter them in if it conflicts with their POV. The information is not going to see the light of day unless that "small collective" authorizes it as conforming to their "social anarchists" POV. This information needs to be known as well. Unfotunately "infinity" is the main stumbling block to putting important information like this in this article. It looks like he's fighting tooth and nail to maintain the impression that it's a document with objective information which represents the view of all anarchists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:24, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is not a main aspect of the FAQ. In the intro, they state:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We are sure that there are many issues that the FAQ does not address. If you think of anything we could add or feel you have a question and answer which should be included, get in contact with us. The FAQ is not our "property" but belongs to the whole anarchist movement and so aims to be an organic, living creation. We desire to see it grow and expand with new ideas and inputs from as many people as possible. If you want to get involved with the FAQ then contact us. Similarly, if others (particularly anarchists) want to distribute all or part of it then feel free. It is a resource for the movement. For this reason we have "copylefted" the FAQ (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html</a> for details). By so doing we ensure that the FAQ remains a free product, available for use by all.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>They have accepted contributions from anarchists all around the world, including individual anarchists. Individual anarchists such as <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_A._Carson_0d19.html" title="Kevin A. Carson">Kevin A. Carson</a> look upon the FAQ very highly. The authors work WITH people who submit in contributions, they don't dictate them. RJII chooses to try to make the authors out to be biased, whilst ignoring the fact that the FAQ is widely acclaimed and distributed. In short, he is doing original research on the bias of the FAQ. Our job is to present the FAQ as it is widely recognised, and that the main editors are social anarchists simply is not a main point of contention. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 16:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>LOL. There is NO QUESTION that they are biased. That's not even disputable. They say flat out that they are social anarchists, they reject individualist anarchism (they say it has "many flaws"), and even allege that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism at all. Don't make us laugh. An NPOV FAQ doesn't say one of the philosophies it's discussing is "flawed."

<p>Again, you choose focus on a few sections of the FAQ. You ignore all the other aspects. Also, this view that the FAQ is extremely biased is compromising your ability to write about it neutrally.

<p>My God, do you really think that?

<p>Direct quotes without explanation can be misleading; I have said that before. So, you want the authors' anti-anarcho-capitalism views noted in the intro? Fair enough. No need for current wording. "Value judgements" makes the authors seem arrogant. How about:</p>

<dd>It doesn't clear up anything. There is no disputing that the FAQ is not merely information, but polemical as well.

<dd>All that means is that some people presented them with some information and feedback. Ultimately, the "small collective" has to authorize it before it goes in the FAQ.

<p>Re the openness, FAQ is exactly as open as any free/open source software project; they also have a team of builders, are open to contributions that are not exepted automatically, and ppl are unsatisfied with the team, they can freely fork it. Therefore, its correct to say that its open, and in 'ownership' of all anarchists of the world, and that it grows as having a life of itsown, not just as a work by a few authors.

<p>RJII, you keep saying that a major theme of the FAQ is to criticise anarcho-capitalism. This is untrue. The criticism takes up about 1/5 of the whole FAQ. The criticism of ind-anarchism takes up much less than this. You should not make it out like it is a major theme in the intro - it simply isn't.</p>
<p>Futhermore, the main writers are social anarchists - that's all you can say in the intro. We've been through this before - anarchists of all sorts wrote the FAQ. All the details are already mentioned in the rest of the article.</p>
<p>The FAQ is a document of anarchism. That is its main theme. Your edits make it seem like the document is written from a social anarchist perspective to explain social anarchism and criticise the rest. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 18:13, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's certianly a very significant theme. It needs is a one sentence mention in the intro that the FAQ is not NPOV informational.

<dd>The point is that they're rejecting individualist anarchism in favor of social anarchism because they think it is flawed. Just saying they "reject ideas within" it is not good enough. They're rejecting the philosophy as a whole, while of course not disagreeing with all of the individualsts' ideas. And, of course they've rejected it.

<p>RJII, your attitude towards criticism is not encouraging. I criticse your edits for POV and undue weight, and you respond by denying it thoroughly and then turning it back on me. You keep ignoring the things I say, repeating the same things which have already been answered. Please comment on my above criticisms. Why do you not acknowledge the points I make?</p>
<p>The previous version was fine, and said "flawed". They reject its ideas, not the philosopher as whole, which they say they respect.

<dd>Of course they reject the philosophy as a whole. This does not mean that they reject every idea of individualist anarchists. They reject the philosophy as a whole when they choose to become social anarchists instead of individualist anarchists.

<dd><b>NO.</b> They have not rejected it "as a whole." The <i>FAQ</i> is explicit, and I think correct, in saying that there are only a few significant differences between individualist and social anarchists. They reject its emphasis on the market, and they reject its tendency to rely on "evolutionary" means. It is likely that the pre-publication revision process that is currently going on will further clarify the similarities and differences. You can say that the <i>FAQ</i> is a product of a time when individualist anarchists were much less visible in mainstream anarchists circles, and that it reflects a greater concern with historical individualism than it does with present developments. But that cuts both ways, since ten years ago, a sympathetic treatment of individualist anarchism in a social anarchist publication was a striking advance. It is likely that the <i>FAQ</i> will retain <i>something</i> of the flavor of that time, rather than today, when, for example, the <i>Journal of Libertarian</i> studies has taken a full issue to review Kevin Carson's work. But that's not a terribly damning criticism. The authors of the <i>FAQ</i> have expressed an interest in being fair to individualists in their criticisms. My suggestion for the Introduction is to mention <b>both</b> that it is critical of individualist anarchism <b>and</b> that it remains one of the best, and only, recent explorations of the individualist tradition from within anarchist circles. (In my scholarly opinion, despite the fact that I have plenty of nits to pick with the <i>FAQ</i>, it also makes fewer glaring errors and misrepresentations of that tradition than some of the more recent book publications.) <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:33, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By saying they "reject it as a whole" I mean they "reject individualist anarchism" in favor of "social anarchism." This is not to say that they don't find some individualists' idea attractive. For example, you might break up with your gilfriend even though you might like somet things about her. You are rejecting her "as a whole." They say that individualist anarchism has "many flaws." Obviously those flaws outweight any good points enough for them to "reject the individualists' conception of anarchy" and choose anarcho-communism, etc. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:39, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's likely that individualist anarchism does have many flaws, though I still prefer it to anarcho-communism or syndicalism. Any individualist who won't admit that has greater POV problems than the FAQ. Some of the criticisms in the FAQ are quite interesting. and the entire work is scholarly in its apparatus. The most serious elements of "bias" are almost all artifacts of the history of the writing of the FAQ, at a time when individualist anarchist looked a lot like a historical curiosity. I've offered an option for reflecting some of that history in the Intro, and would be glad to help write it. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's good. But, I don't expect them to drop their antagonism toward individualism. I mean that's essential to what makes them social anarchists --they're right and the other guy is wrong.

<dd>You're attributing personal characteristics to folks you don't know. That's certainly not what we're supposed to be incoporating into the Wikipedia entries. It's also kind of weird. I've been reading and rereading the FAQ sections on individualist anarchism, and I just don't see any of that. The "debates" with Caplan and Co., <i>back in the day</i>, were definitely not friendly affairs, and plenty of that heat remains. I <i>do</i> know a number of the FAQ authors and contributors, and suspect the differences come down to little more than differing senses of what is worth the risk in terms of post-capitalist economic systems. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Im my life I have never seen an orthodox-anything anarchist. Its great ppl know the 'party lines', and know how to present them, but to consider it a binding truth is simply not in the spirit of anarchism. So, if someone that feels close to social anarchisms ideas 'gets their identinty', as RJII puts is, from intra-anarchist differenences and quarrels, I wonder how much of an anarchist they are at all. Instead, i think acknowleging both the criticisms of all particular 'versions' of anarchism, and their respective worth regardless of personal closeness to a specific school, is much more commonplace - and why anarchist are mostly simply 'anarchists', not anarcho-whatever. --<a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EAryah_6c7f.html" title="User:Aryah">Aryah</a> 20:52, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, the document was began in 1995 as a refutation of anarcho-capitalism.

<p>That's not bad if you want to be really minimalist about it. But I still think it's important to be a more precise about what kind of anarchists they are: "social anarchists." That explains a lot. It's called "An Anarchist FAQ" but in reality it's "An Anarchist FAQ from a Social Anarchist Point of View." It's the addition of one word which infinity here has been fighting. The FAQ itself goes out of it's way to talk about themselves as social anarchists, and to "lay [their] cards on the table,"etc. I don't think we should obscure that fact either. Lay their cards on the table. Right up front. Just like they do. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The FAQ includes criticism of social anarchism by individualists, btw. I suppose that is irrelevant? As it stands, there is one section on different schools of anarchism and why they disagree (A3). There is one section on individualist anarchism (G), in which *one* sub-section explains why social anarchists (historically and currently the majority of anarchists) reject individualist anarchism (surely a relevant issue). In the section of an anarchist society and what anarchists do, they discuss all schools of thought. Basically, as far as I can see the "crime" of the FAQ is to present the majority anarchist position, while highlighting minority trends. Surely that is the point of an FAQ? As such, it reflects such classic histories of anarchism as Woodcock's book "Anarchism" and Marshall's "Demanding the Impossible." <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 09:20, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<b>"An Anarchist FAQ"</b> is a FAQ written by a (virtual) working group of anarchists in an attempt to present different anarchist ideas and theories to those interested in it. The FAQ is mainly written from a social anarchist viewpoint. It started off as a criticism of anarcho-capitalism (and continues to be one), but it was expanded to include general information on anarchist theories and history. It presents arguments on why one should be an anarchist, as well as countering common arguments against anarchism. "An Anarchist FAQ" is published under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (copyleft) and it is dedicated "to the millions of anarchists, living and dead, who tried and are trying to create a better world." It was officially released on July 19, 1996 "to celebrate the Spanish Revolution of 1936 and the heroism of the Spanish anarchist movement.".</p>

And if the author's were "against" individualist anarchism they would not have explained their ideas in a whole section, showed their similarities with social anarchism and quoted them repeatedly throughout the work. You are confusing criticism of other anarchists with being "against" them. The FAQ includes individualist criticism of social anarchism, communist criticism of syndicalism, criticism of Platformism and vice versa.

<p>infinity, you attempted to put sources for the claim that social anarchists are in the majority. One of the sources you put was the FAQ itself. You can't do that. It can't be self-referential. (Not to mention they don't give any kind of source for that --they just say it). And, the other sources you gave was written around 1920. That's that's not good either. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:11, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not self-referential, though. The FAQ saying social anarchists are in the majority has nothing to do with the FAQ itself. The 1920s quote is for "historically".

Besides, the FAQ cannot be used as a secondary sources --it's not credible enough. It's not even published. On your other claim, of course at a time in history, communist anarchists were the majority. First individualist anarchists where the majority, then "social anarchists," and now it's not so clear. You need a credible source saying that "social anarchists" are the majority today. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:22, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I got curious about just how controversial the claim for a social anarchist majority could be. My experience in "offline" anarchist communities over the last 10-12 years has been that, even in a town with a reputation as a stronghold for market anarchists, anarchist communists and anarcho-syndicalists were very much in the majority. Online, being an individualist anarchist or mutualist has been a very lonely business indeed. Currently, a survey of the 200 most-recently published books (keyword: anarchism) shows a handful of individualist anarchist titles (one of which was written by an anarcho-capitalist). Of the 130 Yahoogroups (keyword: anarchism), another handful are individualist in emphasis, and those are extremely small in terms of subscribers, and running heavily to penis-enlargement ads in content. There are about as many "national-anarchist" groups active. All the general histories of anarchism I have seen emphasize the social strands. Historically, "anarchist" was not a common title in the early mutualist period, and then, almost immediately, tensions in the First International (followed by Haymarket, the propaganda by the deed period, the early red scares, etc) made it much less likely that individualists would associate themselves with anarchism, particularly in the US. And so on... Does this add up to the source that RJII wants? Nope. But it ought to be possible, in a case like this, to come to some consensus about the controversiality of the claim. From where I'm sitting, the claim doesn't seem controversial at all. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:58, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an interesting situation. I'm inclined to say that the FAQ does not back up the argument about the majority, but, as I've explained above, I also think it is a pretty uncontroversial claim. What's interesting is that the FAQ is pretty obviously a legitimate secondary source by scholarly standards: it's argement is clear; its assumptions are laid out, and it is brimming with checkable source material. Wikipedia's sourcing policy, however, seems to be a little narrower, so that legitimate scholarly sources can be attacked, based on the conservative standards of this project. This is one of those things that is sometimes a bug and sometimes a feature. Consider the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Batchelder_Greene_060a.html" title="William Batchelder Greene">William Batchelder Greene</a> page, which was riddled with errors before I cleaned it up recently. Every single one of those errors was "properly sourced," while still being clearly in error. The correct information was available on my website (not sourceable by Wikipedia standards, apparently) and on Ronald Creagh's website (which probably is, since it is a continuation of his published research of 30+ years ago, even though several of the corrections came straight from my work.) I mention all of this only to <b>plead for a little common sense here</b>.

<p>Look at any history of anarchism and you will see that "social anarchism" is the main subject, with individualist anarchism very much mentioned in passing (if at all). That is because, historically, the majority of anarchists have been social anarchists. As can be seen from the size of the organisations. For example, the Italian Anarchist Federation in the early 1920s had 20,000 members. Subscribers to Liberty numbered the hundreds ("It probably never had more than 600 to 1000 subscribers", according to Charles H. Hamilton). I could give more examples, but the point is made. I would also suggest that this is the case currently as well, as the number of individualist anarchists is small (I know of two). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 10:18, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And it has not changed. "Anarcho"-capitalists are not anarchists and even if they were, they are *not* individualist anarchists (as Rothbard admitted). In my 20 odd years in the anarchist movement I've come across *three* individualist anarchists (two of them on mailing lists and I consider them good comrades). The rest have all been social anarchists of some kind or another. As for "anarcho"-capitalists, I've come across a few on-line and they have been Americans (almost always). If we listed the anarchist groups and papers across the world, there would be few individualist ones amongst them. BlackFlag 08:40, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your personal experience doesn't count. That's "original research" --flawed methodology at that. And, of course anarcho-capitalists are individualist anarchists. There's not a shortage of sources that indicate that they are. 1) "<i>Pro-capitalist anarchism is, as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the US where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been a part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be.</i>" (<i>Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's Guide</i>, Simon Tormey) 2) "<i>Anarcho-capitalism is a type of individualist anarchism...</i>" (<i>Anarcho-Capitalism vs. Individualist Anarchism</i>, Daniel Burton) 3) "<i>"the capitalist anarchists, like Wendy McElroy, Sam Konkin, Murray Rothbard, David Friedman, and the Voluntaryists, are individualists</i>" (<a href="http://world.std.com/~bbrigade/badpp3.htm" class="external text" title="http://world.std.com/~bbrigade/badpp3.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Individualism Reconsidered</i></a>, Joe Peacott) 4) "<i>Another branch of individualism was found in the United States and was far less radical. The American Benjamin Tucker (1854-1939) believed that maximum individual liberty would be assured where the free market was not hindered or controlled by the State and monopolies. The affairs of society would be governed by myriad voluntary societies and cooperatives, by, as he aptly put it, “un-terrified” Jeffersonian democrats, who believed in the least government possible. Since World War II this tradition has been reborn and modified in the United States as anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism.</i>" (<i>Anarchism</i>, Carl Levy) 6) "<i>[What these liberal philosophers] had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism.</i>" (Ralph Raico, <i>Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century</i>) 7) "<i>Workers are propertyless and forced to wage labor because they cannot finance their self-employment: the state monopoly over money is the problem. Let the people issue their own private, fiduciary moneys and the choice between working for an employer or for oneself will become entirely voluntary. This is the individual anarchism (or anarco-capitalism) championed by Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker in America and Gustave de Molinari in France.</i>" (<i>A Rational Theory of Socialist Public Ownership</i>, Mario Ferrero) And, of course there are anarcho-capitalists who simply refer to themselves as individualist anarchists, such as McElroy. Notice I put a mix of political pursuasions in there, from capitalists to anti-capitalists and socialists to labor-value individualists. I'd like to see a source for your claim that Rothbard says anarcho-capitalists are not individualist anarchists. I don't believe it. He certainly doesn't think anarcho-capitalists are collectivist anarchists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:50, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At present, you're using your personal experiences to counter a claim that pretty much nobody else—individualist or social anarchist—seems to find very controversial. Even if anarcho-capitalism was somehow numerically a majority in the US—which doesn't seem to be the case, based on the distribution of websites, discussion groups, citations in major databases, etc—I can't find anything to support the notion that it is particularly popular anywhere else. When you see references to "anarcho-capitalism" in non-US contexts, it's generally in reference to organized crime in the former USSR or the like. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:02, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've come across one source talking about anarchism in America splitting into left and right in the 1960's and saying anarcho-capitalism became more popular: "<i>Despite this diversity, we can categorize all anarchists as essentially left-wing libertarians who champion growth of the individual within a community (anarcho-communists, christian anarchists, and most anarcho-pacifists) and right-wing libertarians (anarcho-capitalists, and ultraindividualists) who are more egoistical and stress the individualism of the unregulated marketplace. Since the social ethic of America is not communal but is based on a private world of personal fulfillment and satisfaction (the self-made man, not social man), <b>it is not surprising that what I call right-wing libertarianism was the predominant element of the new, explicit anarchism</b></i>." (<i>The American As Anarchist</i>, DeLeon) This gives some weight to my suspicion that anarcho-capitalism is more popular than anarcho-communism, at least in America. I think it's more popular in other countries as well --at least in philosophical anarchism. I know it's popular in Italy, for example. So, I'm still very dubious about claiming in any of the anarchism articles that communist or "social anarchism" is more popular than the individualist anarchisms. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:11, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That book is, what, 30 years old? And it is *not* a case "anarcho"-capitalism against anarcho-communism, it is a case of *anarchism* vrs "anarcho"-capitalism. And are we *really* discussing this becaused on RJII's "suspicion that anarcho-capitalism is more popular than anarcho-communism"? Is that really it? A "suspicion"? BlackFlag 10:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it's a case of left anarchism versus right anarchism. And, yes, this is because of my "suspicion" that right anarchism is more popular. I will not allow the article to say left anarchism is more popular without a credible source saying so. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 23:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If RJII says it, it must be true! As for "credible" sources, I would suggest looking at Peter Marshall's recent (very long) history of anarchism. One chapter is on "anarcho-capitalism" while the rest is about anarchism (Marshall notes that few anarchists consider them anarchists, btw). It is a very big book and brings anarchism's history into the 1990s. It is considered the standard account on anarchism, replacing Woodcock's book (which did not mention "anarcho-capitalism" at all). I wonder why he would do that, if "anarcho-capitalism" is so much bigger than anarchism? And, of course, the US anarchist movement has increased massively over the last ten years. Looking at the organisations, webpages, papers, etc., then it is clear that anarchism is much bigger than "anarcho-capitalism", as reflected in Marshall's book.

<dd>Here is what a respected scholar on anarchism had to say on the De Leon book: "The results, on the whole, are disappointing . . . There is to much facile generalisation, too little depth of analysis, and too little attention to detail. What DeLeon has written is not a solid scholarly monography but a loosely reasons interpretive essay that is marred by oversimplication and distortion . . . The weaknesses of DeLeon's analysis are compounded by the errors of fact into which he frequently lapses." (Paul Avrich, American Historical Review, vol. 84, No. 5, p. 1467-8) A good credible source to justify a "suspicion" on? BlackFlag, 14:27, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the writing of the FAQ, the main editors accepted input and contributions from everyone who bothered to contact them.

<dd>As far as all indications are, the only writers of the FAQ are "social anarchists."

<p>RJII, you are repeating the same thing. You're saying nothing new. It is the <i>main editors</i> who say they are social anarchists. You are inferring your own views of the FAQ. "The writers place themselves firmly in the social strand of anarchism" are written by the main editors, not everyone who participated in the writing of the FAQ. One contributor may have written a few paragraphs, but had nothing to do with that part of the FAQ. You have no evidence to show that ALL the writers are social anarchists. Since this is the more complex proof, burden is on you. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 16:52, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>RJII, this is starting to look more and more like a vendetta. The news of the FAQ's pending publication has been out there for quite some time. (I'm guessing you can find discussion of it in various mailing list archives.) It's a logical publication for AK Press. There is no reason to disbelieve the claim, though you can perhaps block its inclusion via sourcing rules.

<dd>RJII thinks the article has POV problems, and is trying to "correct them". Unfortunately this is only due to his extremely distorted personal view of the FAQ. He has called the writers "communist anarchists" in many cases, and tries to add unnecessary focus onto the authors' bias, which is minor compared to the whole FAQ. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 10:27, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If RJII *really* thinks that the authors of the FAQ are lying about it being published by AK Press then he should contact AK Press (in the UK, as they are responsible for proof reading it -- I know as I've talked to them about it). Ask them to provide an email saying that they are *not* publishing it and the case will be closed. Of course, if he did do that he would soon discover that AK Press *is* planning to publish the FAQ as a book. So case closed. BlackFlag 08:55, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just one quote of many: "This second difference is the most important. The individualist fears being forced to join a community and thus losing his or her freedom (including the freedom to exchange freely with others) . . . In effect, they argue that communism (or social ownership in general) would be similar to capitalism, with the exploitation and authority of the boss replaced with that of "society."

<p><i>An Anarchist FAQ</i> includes an explicit "rejection" of individualist anarchism (along with explicit discussions about what elements are rejected) as well as the grounds on which individualist anarchists reject (critical elements of) social anarchism. This much seems clear and entirely uncontroversial. The claim that individualists "fear" elements of social anarchism is a bit of hyperbole that probably doesn't need to be repeated. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>RJII's view that (because the main editors are social anarchists) all the content of the FAQ originates from social anarchists has no evidence to back this up. It is a very paranoid view, and assumes bad faith on part of the writers of the FAQ.

<dd>To say that the FAQ explains "anarcho-capitalism" along with other schools of anarchism is to imply that the FAQ thinks that it is a form of anarchism. It does not. It is RJII's POV which claims that it is a school of anarchism, a POV the FAQ (like most anarchists) dispute. "Anarcho"-capitalism, as far as the FAQ goes, is *not* considered anarchism and should not be listed with the rest. Given that "anarcho"-capitalism has a whole paragraph to itself later on, we can drop the reference here. BlackFlag 09:00, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You <b>do</b> realize that "anarcho-capitalism" is also a term used in the media to describe the "mafia economies" of the post-soviet world. Right? Not that raw Google numbers are particularly useful by themselves anyway. If you Google on "mutualism," you'll probably get a huge number of hits, but very few of them, proportionately, will be about market anarchism (as opposed to biology). As for the the inclusion of anarcho-capitalism among the schools of anarchism that the <i>FAQ</i> attempts to explain, it seems entirely uncontroversial that the authors do not consider it among those schools. To write an entry that implies either that they <i>do</i> include it, or that the inclusion is otherwise uncontroversial, seems inappropriate. The body of the entry already explains the conflict. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 14:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a response I received from an administrator on the BlackFlag sourcing matter: "They don't look like credible sources to me. The first one (the geocities site) definitely isn't. The anarcho directory in anarchism.ws looks like a personal directory. Anything that looks like a personal website is disallowed, in part for the very reason you've given above, viz. that anyone could add whatever they want to a personal website then use it as a source for Wikipedia.SlimVirgin (talk) 20:24, 24 April 2006 (UTC)" <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't consider it the opinion of a "larger like-minded group." It's the opinion of a small clique. Also, it says it "should not be relied upon as a sole source." That means if it was actually the opinion of a "larger like-minded" group, that it would have to be buttressed by an additional source that is more credible. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:24, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, a site which is linked to by most anarchist webpages, mirrored extensively and is going to be printed by a leading anarchist publisher is *not* the opinion of a large group. ROFL! So, just to check, a source written by anarchists is not "credible" when it talks about anarchism? ROFL! The FAQ is a primary source and should be quoted as such.

<p>This makes clear why "An Anarchist FAQ" should never be cited on Wikipedia. Apparently anyone in their clique that happens to edit Wikipedia, who lacks a source for their claims, go write their own original research into the FAQ then come back here and cite it.

<dd>Sure, and that is why we should never quote anything but the first editions of books, as the authors go away and make changes to their work based on new information. What a scam! As the "new" page indicates, the current lot of revisions is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for publication. When it is published, what will RJII's reason for not wanting to cite it become then? BlackFlag 16:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, of course it's a primary source. What that means is that it can only be used as a source about itself and only in this article.

<dd>I see you've been editing the medieval Iceland section of the FAQ as a result of the Criticism section in this article. But, the FAQ still says that "The "anarcho"-capitalist argument that Iceland was an example of their ideology working in practice can be found in the work of David Friedman." Why don't you fix that? You could say their argument was "<i>built on</i> the work of Friedman that says that medievial Iceland had some of the characteristics of anarcho-capitalism." I think it would still be untrue though --no anarcho-capitalist that I'm aware of claim it was a working example of anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:25, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stop quoting out of context. The section says: "The "anarcho"-capitalist argument that Iceland was an example of their ideology working in practice can be found in the work of David Friedman. Friedman is less gun-ho than many of his followers, arguing in The Machinery of Freedom, that Iceland only had some features of an "anarcho"-capitalist society and these provide some evidence in support of his ideology." Are you saying that "anarcho"-capitalists do not become aware of Iceland via Friedman's work? And, if no "anarcho"-capitalist points to it as "anarcho"-capitalism you better change the Wikipedia entry on "anarcho-capitalism" as it lists it as the first example of "anarcho-capitalism in the real world." If its *not* an example, why mention it? And Caplan's FAQ calls Iceland their "favourite example." BlackFlag 09:34, 27 April 2006 (UTC</dd>
