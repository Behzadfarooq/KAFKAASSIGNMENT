<p>I will charge this page with biased POV, the AGW politicos have destroyed any semblance of nuetrality or balance here, it is just a political add for Gore and AGW, disgusting.</p>
<p>Agreed: POV is still non-neutral in tone if not in content. Example: "So much for Gore's assertion that climate change is "irrevocable."" (Section on Scientific Inaccuracies in Film). We need a some clean-up here. Gunnk 18:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Global climate change" vs. "Global warming"</span></h2>
<p>Should we change the term to "Global climate change" throughout? That is the more accurate term, since we are talking about more than just temperature, e.g. precipitation patterns. Also while the global mean temperature is expected to continue to rise, there will be likely be locations that actually get colder as weather patterns shift. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 18:02, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since the 2 terms are interchangeable, particularly outside the U.S., I have added a single refereence that Global Warming is also referred to as "Climate Change". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattwilkins_2037.html" title="User:Mattwilkins">Mattwilkins</a> 19:04, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorny_O%27Near_aa91.html" title="User:Korny O'Near">Korny O'Near</a> made reference to a resolution that passed the Senate 95-0 that had the effect of stopping US ratification of Kyoto. Apparently, that unanimity may overstate the degree of opposition to Kyoto in the Senate at that time. I switched to a shorter, vaguer formulation in the article rather than getting into the weeds. Here is Gore on the subject in the second 2000 presidential debate:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A lot of supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because of the way it was worded.

<p>Sorry, I don't mean to fan any flames here (and I'm actually in the midst of reading this book as we speak, so hopefully I don't come across as anything I'm not trying to be), but I have an issue with the passage regarding the 95-0 resolution against Kyoto. I feel that the words "Republican run" are getting us into trouble. Yes, the Senate was run by a Republican majority, but the bill was introduced by Democrat <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Byrd_2e6a.html" title="Robert Byrd">Robert Byrd</a> and, at 95-0, it's hard to make a case for party-affiliation being the determining factor. I know this paragraph isn't trying to imply more than that, but at the same time, in the quest for NPOV, "Republican run" seems to me to be a jab that doesn't need to be thrown. Opinions? Lanford 04:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As it is, it sticks out awkwardly...the Senate opposition is already noted appropriately enough. On a side note, the vote was merely a comment on the direction of the Kyoto proceedings which were happening at the same time. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_lorax_5a35.html" title="User:The lorax">The lorax</a> 05:14, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I like the wording as it is currently (simply saying "but it was not ratified due to opposition in the United States Senate"). I agree saying "Republican run Senate" is potentially misleading, because it suggests that views broke down on party lines. On the other hand I think simply quoting the 95-0 vote could also be misleading because as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_lorax_5a35.html" title="User:The lorax">The lorax</a> says that vote was not a direct vote on ratification and it overstates opposition (see my previous comment in this thread). <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 18:58, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism / Endorsements / Factchecking</span></h2>
<p>I saw the movie yesterday, and am very curious to see whether there has been any serious and unbiased factchecking done by a third party about the movie. I could not find anything of the sort on the net; just people taken in by its message, but not having checked anything on their own, or conservatives out of hand rejecting it, usually without even seeing the movie. I know such a section might invite controversy and/or vandalism, but if someone is aware of some kind of serious factchecking effort, could you add it? Thanks.

<dd>Please ensure you sign your comments. Anyhow, Patterson's claim that there is no correlation between CO2 levels and global temperatures is interesting, since it directly contradicts the claim made by the film. I'm not sure how relevant the lack of correlation over 450 million years is, and I'd much rather see someone directly refute the data presented by Gore, which shows a clear correlation between CO2 levels and global temps. The Patterson quote is convenient for Tom Harris, but I'm not convinced it's relevant. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisLawson_5786.html" title="User:ChrisLawson">ChrisLawson</a> 14:37, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisLawson_5786.html" title="User:ChrisLawson">ChrisLawson</a>, as you suspect the 450 million year point is pretty much a red herring. A lot was different then, in particular the arrangement of the continents. I say "pretty much", because in a way there is an underlying valid point, namely that CO2 is far from the only determinant of global temperature, especially over longer time scales. The graph that Al Gore shows is correct. It is over a time frame of approximately 650,000 years (which is how far back our direct ice core measurements of CO2 go). So there's no direct contradiction here, just a difference of time scales; Gore's is obviously the more relevant one. Astrophysicists think that Earth will be engulfed by the Sun as it expands in a couple of billion years, but that is about as relevant as Patterson's point. One of the crazier arguments in that article is that without CO2 the earth would be a "frozen ice ball". So obviously Harris accepts the basic physics of the greenhouse effect in one direction: less CO2 then (everything else equal) the earth would be colder. It's very hard to fathom why he thinks this is an argument <i>against</i> the existence of the greenhouse effect in the opposite direction, i.e. more CO2 makes the earth hotter. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 15:20, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that The Register review was actually generally positive (the rating was 4 out of 5 "duck bunnies"); it was only the quote selected that made it appear otherwise. Perhaps we should add something to the article about the reviews being heavily slanted towards the positive (and often highly positive, e.g. Ebert review, A.O.

<dd>per screen average is not a valid meansure of a film's success. The lesser the number of theaters in which the film opens in a given neighbourhood, the higher the per screen average becomes. It's elementary logic which you should be able to figure out on your own. For example, if only 1 theater in all of New York plays this movie, then the per screen average of this film would go through the roof, but it's total box office gross would be low. Theaters care about per-screen average because higher per screen average means more profit for the theater. In regards to Roger Ebert's review, wikipedia's consensus means consensus of Wikipedia editors, not consensus of the media. 67.70.57.26 23:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The movie's high per-screen total is relevant. But, right now, the article says it's the third highest-grossing "independent film". The other two listed movies are documentaries (not "independent films"). It's unlikely that it's the third highest grossing documentary, since it's only been out a few weeks. What about Roger &amp; Me, Bowling for Columbine, Hoop Dreams, Spellbound, and other simliar succesful documentaries? It may eventually beat them, but there needs to be sourcing for the claim. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucky_Adrastus_af33.html" title="User:Lucky Adrastus">Lucky Adrastus</a> 07:15, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explaining reverting Anarchopedia and other edits</span></h2>
<p>It looks like <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarchopedia_109a.html" title="User:Anarchopedia">User:Anarchopedia</a> has been making a lot of the edits previously made by anons. I went and changed most of those back and also made some other edits. Here are some of the things I changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I put back the per-screen record. Such records are surely always notable. I think it is important to put in the caveat that it was only playing on 4 screens at the time, which is why I added text to that effect some time ago. If we are going to continue going back and forth on this, please at least note that the sentence "On Memorial Day weekend" doesn't have a verb.</li>
<li>I deleted the link to Climate Audit's front page. That blog is specifically concerned with criticizing research on "hockey stick" graphs of historic temperature, which is one aspect of the debate. Gore does briefly show such a graph, but it represents perhaps one minute of a feature length film.</li>
<li>I think the phrase "greenhouse gases" is better than "atmospheric carbon" for three reasons: it is more familiar to most people, it is more accurate (nitrous oxide, one of the three major greenhouse gases, does not contain carbon) and it avoids a potential confusion (methane and carbon dioxide have very different activity levels)</li>
<li>I think "rededicates himself to combatting global warming" is more informative that "dedicates..." because this is not a new initiative for him.</li>
<li>I believe Kristin Gore was no longer with Futurama and anyway she was not one of the writers for "Crimes of the Hot" as the previous version might suggest</li>
<li>I put back in the book cover image. Since the book doesn't have its own separate page, I think the cover image should be here.</li>
<li>I think one cartoon image suffices; I left the "Manbearpig" one. Also, I think the caption on the Futurama image was potentially misleading.</li>
<li>The Roger Ebert quote:</li>

<p>is definitely notable. Ebert is the most prominent American film critic writing today. This is a very strong statement to make. Please note that saying Ebert is prominent is not the same thing as saying he is right. One may have the POV that Ebert is a bad film critic or that this statement is the least accurate statement he ever made or whatever; it's still notable. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 15:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And overall gross figures are invalid because of inflation. Total viewers would be invalid because of population growth. Every statistical measure of a movie's success has problems. Besides, are you suggesting they might have played it on less screens hoping to manipulate its per-screen average? That would be laughable. They want to make as much money as possible, not win the per-screen all time record. Gore would want the most people to see it. These goals conflict with that idea. Last, it's clearly a statistic used in the documentary world and not the invention of some fan of this movie. --<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactusnonverbus_68c7.html" title="User:Factusnonverbus">FNV</a> 20:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Modified sentence about AP poll</span></h2>
<p>I modified the sentence about the June 2006 AP poll of scientists who had seen the movie because it left out a fairly important quote from the article; namely that most of the 100 scientists contacted either hadn't seen the movie or read the book or hadn't responded to the poll. Only 19 of the 100 contacted responded that they had seen it. This is an important clarification, because it's very possible that some or all of the scientists who disagree with Al Gore's stance might not have bothered seeing the movie, for example. Likewise, scientists who actively support Gore are going to be much more likely to see the movie. Thus the poll results are likely inherently biased in the movie's favor.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not commenting on or disputing the accuracy of the movie or other parts of the article. I'm simply saying that the AP poll isn't scientific, and in fact the way it's presented with the headline <i>Scientists OK Gore's movie for accuracy</i> is very misleading. Most scientists didn't even see the movie, let alone comment on its accuracy. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 15:24, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias</span></h2>
<p>I fail to see how pointing out that kilimanjaro has been losing snow for 150 yrs, a senate subcommittee on the environment taking exception to an ap report on the movie, the incorrectness of gore's hockey stick, or a un subcomittee report are nontopical or biased.</p>
<p>There has been some controversy in regards due to the accuracy of the science in the film. · In the beginning of the film, Gore mentions his mentor at Harvard and inspiration, Dr. Roger Reville. Dr. Reville wrote an article in the 1993 claiming that science is "too uncertain to justify drastic action" with regards to global warming. [S.F. Singer, C. Starr, and R. Revelle, "What to do about Greenhouse Warming: Look Before You Leap. Cosmos 1 (1993) 28-33] · The snowcaps at Mount Kilimanjaro have been retreading since 1850, due to a decline in precipitation. There is no direct correllation to global warming. [5] · Gore's illustrated hockey stick fails to account for the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age. · Accoding to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is impossible to attribute hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, etc. to Global Warming, as Mr. Gore attempts to do with Hurricane Katrina. [6] · Sea levels have been rising 1.8 mm per year for the last 8,000 years. The IPCC states that "No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th century has been detected." [7] · Even the AP's report about the 19 top climate scientists praising the science behind the film has been called into question by the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. [8]</p>
<p>Someone tell me what is wrong with any of these points.</p>

<li>A Senate subcommittee may not the best place to be looking for scientific opinion.</li>
<li>On the hockey stick: It is not "[G]ore's hockey stick". As with all this stuff, there are people, including some scientists, who dispute the scientific studies. The appropriate question for this article is whether or not Gore is reflecting the scientific consensus, not whether the scientific consensus is correct.

<li><a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Revelle_2eba.html" title="Roger Revelle">Roger Revelle</a> died in 1991. His statement obviously reflected the science at that time. A lot has changed since then.</li>

<dd>The bottom line is Gore is explaining scientific consensus, not making stuff up as your edits might suggest. This article is not the right place for a debate about whether that consensus is correct. That said, I do think we should reflect that there is a debate and I've added a sentence to that effect as you can see. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 18:55, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that by including the opinion of Roger Ebert, a known liberal, see review of Life and Times of David Gael, and not including the report that has on it a committee of senators, this report is taking a political slant. You said that a scientific opinion should not be searched for at the senate subcommitte. Is not Al Gore an ex-senator, and would it be more appropriate to include the opinion of an esteemed MIT professor, such as Richard S. Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT, wrote:</p>
<p>“A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse.” - Lindzen wrote in an op-ed in the June 26, 2006 Wall Street Journal</p>
<dl>
<dd>We're not quoting Ebert in the science section. Lindzen is a well-known skeptic; he is among a small minority of scientists on this stuff. It should surprise noone that he doesn't like the film. Gore is an expositor not a scientist. My contention is we should try to ascertain whether Gore is reflecting the scientific consensus and not get into the debate about whether the consensus is correct or not (in this article), other than pointing out that the debate exists. Do you disagree?</dd>
<dd>By the way, I notice you're new to Wikipedia. It's good practice to sign your posts on talk pages with by appending 4 tildes. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 19:13, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe this article pushes that Gore is correct, and any other opinion is incorrect. Also, as far as the article linked on Kilimanjaro, this is an excerpt:</p>
<p>"In short, Kilimanjaro may be a photogenic spokesmountain "no matter what the climatic agenda" but it is far from ideal as a laboratory for detecting human-driven warming. "</p>
<p>Since this is from the oft-cited realclimate.org, should it be cited?</p>
<p>Also, by refusing to point out the 95-0 vote, it gives an image of a substantial republican block, not one by the whole senate because of the double standard of the treaty.</p>
<p>nbulling</p>
<dl>
<dd>On Gore being "correct" or not, you didn't answer my question. I think we should make this about whether he gets the scientific consensus correct and not about whether that consensus itself is correct (other than to note there is a debate and link to the appropriate article). Do you agree or disagree? On Kilimanjaro, the next sentence after your quote is "The debate over it obscures the nearly universal agreement among glacier and climate experts that glaciers are retreating all over the world, probably as a result of the greenhouse-gas buildup." Kilimanjaro is one of perhaps a dozen glaciers Gore discusses. On Kyoto, see previous discussion above; it's probably best to continue any debate there.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 19:40, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a discussion of An Inconvenient Truth, not Scientists consensus. I believe we should be allowed to present the case for the backers of the movie and the skeptics, as opposed to any text pointing out a skeptic's view being deleted. We know some scientists agree. We cannot read about the scientists who disagree and their exact quotes however. All you've pointed out with Kilimanjaro is scientists do not know for sure if global warming is a cause. As Al depicts that it is in the movie, I believe it is noteworthy to show there is debate. The Kyoto debate goes along with my contention that this article has a liberal POV. It feels like Fahrenheit 451, except for the firefighters are only burning the text with a certain POV.nbulling</p>

<p>I doubt anything much can be written on this (at least here, if not anywhere) that isn't going to be biased. Take a look at this for example. <a href="http://www.junkscience.com/Greenhouse/NCDCabs1880.png" class="external text" title="http://www.junkscience.com/Greenhouse/NCDCabs1880.png" rel="nofollow">Various from 1880</a> Now, what does that prove or not?

It all seems biased, isn't that how humans operate? You could always just go get the dictionary definitions: "Main Entry: global warm·ing Pronunciation: -'wor-mi[ng] Function: noun&#160;: an increase in the earth's atmospheric and oceanic temperatures widely predicted to occur due to an increase in the greenhouse effect resulting especially from pollution" or "global warming NOUN: An increase in the average temperature of the earth's atmosphere, especially a sustained increase sufficient to cause climatic change." Now those don't seem too biased.</p>

<p>I took out this link again after reviewing the site. I went there with some curiousity about the "personal audit" referred to in the link description, as this could be a good way to bring the impact of the film and the campaign against global climate change down to a personal level. But I was disappointed when I found that the site seemed suspect in several ways. The first bad sign was when the voice-over started automatically upon loading; to me, this indicates something surreptitious about a web site. There was no link to this personal audit that I could find; apparently you had to sign up first, whereupon you would receive something via email which would either contain or lead you to the audit. So it does seem suspiciously like someone's attempt to cash in on the ongoing Internet Gold Rush, albeit with a "green" façade. ==<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 17:02, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a general matter, I don't have a strong opinion as to whether this link should be included. However, I am unconvinced that it is likely a front for something else. I don't get what's surreptious about the automatic voiceover; the offical website automatically loads a soundtrack too, as do many websites these days. Asking for email does prick my antennas, but e.g. the blog (<a href="http://an-inconvenient-truth.com/blog/" class="external autonumber" title="http://an-inconvenient-truth.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>) has a lot of content and seems to be updated regularly, but doesn't require an email. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 17:20, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias in review section</span></h2>
<p>The review section states that the reaction has been positive from "the largely left leaning media outlets", citing Rotten Tomatoes's aggregate score and Ebert and Roeper, then goes on to include Newsmax and Reason.com as dissenting reviewers without any mention of their politics or even their names. This makes it sound, without checking the links, like "the liberal media" loves it while more neutral parties were less enthused. --4.254.118.162 00:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and I should add that two of the three dissenting reviews are written by people who describe themselves as converts to the global warming concept, which I think is worth mentioning since you can believe in global warming and still not like the film, while the Newsmax review mostly portrays the film as a religious effort (while calling Exxon-Mobil's environmental record "allegedly" poor). --4.254.118.162 00:11, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has nothing to do with YouTube, beyond someone posted it there...when they could have posted it to any other site the does the same as YouTube...like Google video. I have removed that section from the YouTube article as there is no scandal on YouTube's part. A scandal, by definition, is: <i>Damage to reputation or character caused by public disclosure of immoral or grossly improper behavior; disgrace.</i> Where is YouTube's immoral or grossly improper behavior in this? How is it that they are being disgraceful? They are not. The system worked as intended where anyone can post a video and it will be hosted on their servers...so how is this a scandal on their end? They didn't post the video to their own servers nor did they 'feature' the clip. Yes it hit the 'most discussed' and 'most viewed' list for one day but how is that YouTube's fault? That is completely the "users of YouTube"'s fault. On Another note: How does anyone know that some guy in a cube just made this video out of spite in his own time? So he works for DCI, but used his work computer to do personal web surfing. We just don't know. In anycase, this exxon/youtube scandal article a NPOV addition, Soapboxing, and is not acceptable for Wikipedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Blatant Bias in this article</span></h2>
<p>Let's be clear: this film doesn't present "facts", it presents Gore's opinion. Whether one agrees with him or not, his opinions shouldn't be presented as fact. What is fact is that Gore has no educational or professional background that makes him an expert on this subject. His opinion is no more valid that Jim Inhofe's. Also, criticism of Gore's position by actual scientists who are in a position to know what they're talking about shouldn't be removed from this article. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 00:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if you've even seen the film; perhaps like other pinheaded critics you haven't, but if you had, you'd know that it's not Gore's opinions that count in it. The ones that do count are those of practically every scientist in the field in the world. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 04:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I do know is that men who are infinitely more qualified to discuss this subject are embarrassed by Gore and his uninformed view of complex matters like global climate change. The fact of the matter is that this so-called "consensus" that people like Gore like to trumpet doesn't include anything close to "practically every scientist in the field". The really sad thing is that several of the editors here feel the need to censor legitimate critism of Gore's puerile views. I guess you're afraid that objective discussion of the issue will undermine Gore's points. Let me ask you: if Gore's views can't stand up to scrutiny, how much value can they have? --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 05:21, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Curious. The two scientists you appear to be hanging your hat on are obviously hacks, funded in large part by the energy industry and their friends. I'm sorry, but the <b>vast majority</b> of scientists have no doubt that we are a cause of global warming; the only remaining debate is how much warming will occur and what should be done about it. That you claim there is still debate simply gives us data with which to categorize your opinions.</dd>

<dd>In fact the film does present the consensus of *professional scientific opinion*, for the most part. Political consensus and scientific consensus are two different things. It is blindingly obvious from your edits that you are pushing a POV. The use of a term like "puerile" to describe Al Gore, and your other ad hominem attacks, say it all. Al Gore may have many massive personal faults, but he is an intellectual and ethical giant compared to the pygmies currently in office. The creation of a 'controversy' myth is a political tool and has little to do with any of the science. But *all* of that is beside the point. <b>The point of this article is to describe the film itself.</b> Your issues with the political and/or scientific issues surrounding global warming might better be debated over at the global warming controversy article. This is an article about a <b>movie</b>, and wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It is not our job as editors to insert our OR or POV into articles. Sometimes that's hard to avoid but that's the role of an editor. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 12:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, you don't get to change my header. You want to edit your own words, fine. You will NOT edit mine. As for your comments on scientific consensus, you can dress it up any way you like, but the fact that people with a POV to push (e.g. Al Gore) have to rely on consensus science to get their point across is proof that they don't have any real science behind their claims. Computer models and similar idle speculation to the side, where is the science? And the idea that Gore is an intellectual giant compared to ANYONE is proof that you need to take a closer look at the man. Just because he's a little smarter than the current PotUS doesn't mean a lot. It is like being taller than Danny DeVito. As for understanding the role of an editor... I worked as a print and broadcast journalist for years so I have experience in that area as well. The article as it stands is grossly biased against reality and the shabby attempts of POV-pushers here to revert attempts to bring balance to it - like the fact that there is no correlation between atmospheric CO2 content and global temperatures - will be resisted. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 17:11, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Documentary?</span></h2>

<dd>Well, I'm not an American Republican and I see don't see any scientific evidence of anthropogenic global warming and neither does anyone else with an ounce of intellectual honesty. You can argue that certain current observations suggest a link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas and temperature change, but there is no conclusive evidence of a causual link. Anyone who says different is a liar. Of course, the tendency is to assume that someone who opposes the use of junk science to create a public panic about global warming is in favor of unrestrained pollution of the environment. I should point out that I am a staunch environmentalist. I think SUVs are disgusting and wasteful. I walk and take public transport when I can. I recycle. I am very much in favor of increased fuel-economy standards in cars and very, very much in favor of switching to renewable, carbon-neutral fuels like bio-diesel. However, unlike people like Gore, Laurie David and the rest of their ilk (as well as their stooges here) I don't believe in lying, exaggerating or propagandizing to make the point. Plenty of good can be done with the plain truth. There's no reason to lie. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 17:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure if you went to your climatologist friends (just make sure they're real climatologists and not computer modellers posing as experts on climate) they would be the first to admit that the facts aren't all in and that when stuffed-shirts like Gore say "the debate is over", they're talking out of their asses. I apologise if I come off as a bit, well, "spiny", bit I call 'em like I see 'em. And it bothers me when one side of an important debate wants to shut up the other side for asking difficult questions or pointing out facts that conflict with idealogy. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 09:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spinynorman presents a tautological and deceptive argument. First you create a phoney 'controvery', then cite that controversy as evidence that the issue is in doubt. Consensus is certainly not an other word for 'opinion' and it is deceptive (one might even call it puerile) to make that claim. Consensus is agreement. In some contexts it may mean agreement on some silly opinion, e.g., "the consensus amongst filmgoers is that Tom Cruise is an idiot" . But the only meaning that matters here is the fact that the general direction of professional scientific findings support the AGW theory. We all know the public, politicians, and the science community hear three diffent things when the word 'theory' is used.

<dd>You're half right. Consensus is agreement on an opinion. There is no consensus required with facts. I prefer to deal with facts rather than opinion and the fact is that there is no actual correlation between atmospheric CO2 and global temperature. Climate is changing because that's what climate does. Does this mean that people should continue polluting the environment? Of course not. But the first thing people have to do is start telling the truth about the science. Nothing good comes of lies and misinformation. It doesn't matter if a person's intentions are good, if their facts are bad, then nothing good is likely come of it. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 17:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I don't think Gore is claiming to be anything more than an interested layman on the topic; he doesn't claim any special educational or professional qualifications. He's portrayed as a concerned public figure presenting the arguments of experts on global warming. If Gore is misrepesenting the scientific findings, that deserves comment.

<dd>Anyone who thinks F911 was a documentary needs to go back to school and learn what a documentary is. It wasn't a documentary any more than the editorial page is news. There's nothing wrong with editorials, they're an important part of any newspaper and there's nothing wrong with their TV/film counterparts... except that some people seem to not be able to see them for what they are. I was glad MM made F911. I think it would have been better and more effective if he hadn't been quite so clearly partisan, but it was something that needed to be done. And if Gore wants to indulge his ego and clamber up on his little global warming soap-box, that's fine too. There's nothing wrong with starting a discussion on the subject - unlike so many of the people I see here (on both sides of the issue), I think asking difficult questions and holding people's claims up to scrutiny is a good thing. But Gore's film isn't a documentary, it is barely factual. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 10:36, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you haven't given any specifics for anyone to respond to. Let me pick one of your contentious edits. In the excerpt "data from Antarctic <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_cores.html" title="Ice cores">ice cores</a> showing carbon dioxide concentrations higher than at any time during the past 650,000 years" you want to switch "showing" to "suggesting". Presumably, your issue is that there are people who try to deny that CO2 is increasing. The reality is that there is overwhelming consensus -- including most prominent global warming skeptics -- that this statement is correct, indeed that CO2 is increasing dramatically due to human action. The record is <i>not</i> based on proxy data (like historical temperature records); it is based on direct measurement of CO2 in bubbles trapped in ice cores. Furthermore, the trend is very dramatic,</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../c/a/r/Image%7ECarbon_Dioxide_400kyr-2.png_6cc9.html" class="image" title="Image:Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr-2.png"><img src="../../../upload/e/e9/Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr-2.png" alt="Image:Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr-2.png" width="600" height="436" longdesc="../../../c/a/r/Image%7ECarbon_Dioxide_400kyr-2.png_6cc9.html" /></a>)</dd>
<dd>so it can't plausibly be due to subtle measurement error. So really there is very little to argue. Of course, some people do try. But, by that token we should also put in some caveat to "past 650,000 years" since some people argue the world isn't that old (see <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_Creationism_a76b.html" title="Young Earth Creationism">Young Earth Creationism</a>).</dd>

<dd>The basic situation is this: Gore's statements are accurate from the consensus scientific point of view (with some minor caveats, see the Real Climate link).

But these views are a distinct minority and should not be a major focus of this article; the proper place for a lengthy treatment of these issues is at <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 21:20, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and Sen. Inhofe's critical comments</li>
<li>Mention of Richard Lindzen's WSJ editorial</li>
<li>Reference to the Canada Free Press criticism</li>
<li>Ronald Bailey's critical comments</li>

<dd>Actually, you're wrong about my use of the word "suggesting". I didn't use it because of those people who you claim are denying that atmospheric CO2 is increasing. Actually, I'm not aware of any such people and even if such people did exist, a quick reference to the actual data from the Mauna Loa observatory would be enough to shut them up. There is no "consensus" that atmospheric CO2 is increasing, it is a fact - backed up with objective evidence. What isn't a "fact" is the claim that CO2 levels are higher than they've been over the last 650,000 years. That is opinion. Why? Because we have no direct measurements over the last 650,000 years - all we have is proxy data, which may or may not be accurate. So saying that evidence shows "carbon dioxide concentrations higher than at any time during the past 650,000 years", is simply incorrect. There are no data that "show" this, there are only data that "suggest it". And your suggestion that "there is overwhelming consensus... that CO2 is increasing dramatically due to human action" is both incorrect and irrelevant. First of all, consensus is simply opinion. Saying there is consensus is another way of saying that a majority of poeple all have faith in the same thing. That isn't science, it is politics or religion (take your choice).</dd>

<dd>The claim that AGW is the cause of the Kilimanjaro glacier's retreat is hotly contested. There is excellent evidence that AGW has nothing to do with it and the actual cause is deforestation. Also caused by humans and also something that might want to be looked at with an eye towards trying to reverse it. But since people like Gore insist on pretending that AGW is the case, I don't hold out much hope for the glacier's survival. Oh the irony of the glacier being killed by environmentalists...

<p>"Global warming plays a part [among] a variety of factors..." "[Global warming] increases humidity, and as the air gets more moist, it hinders evaporation. The energy saved from evaporation is instead spent on melting. That might seem like a good thing—to stop evaporation of the glaciers—but it's certainly not. Melting is eight times more energy-efficient than evaporation, so now, with global warming, the glaciers are disappearing eight times faster than before."</p>

<p>Lindzen relies on a severely flawed study by Benny Peiser: "1. Peizer misunderstands the point of Oreskes study. The point was not that every article about climate change explicitly endorsed the IPCC conclusions. The point is that if there was real uncertainty there would be “substantive disagreement in the scientific community” that would be reflected in peer reviewed literature. There wasn’t.</p>
<p>2. <i>Peiser didn’t find any peer reviewed studies that oppose the scientific consensus.</i> Peiser claimed that 34 papers “reject or doubt” the consensus view. Tim Lambert got Peiser to send him the abstracts of those 34 papers. The vast majority of these papers express no doubt whatsoever about the consensus view. Only one paper, by the Association of Petroleum Geologists, cited by Peiser actually rejects the consensus view and it “does not appear to have been peer reviewed outside that Association.”"</p>

You can't just demand that all criticism of the film be shipped over to another page because you think it sullies this puff-piece about Gore's exercise in self-indulgence. The really sad thing about you censorious folk is that all you're doing is demonstrating your lack of faith in the thing you admire by whinging about valid criticism of it.

<dd>Yes, the link does support my original statement: Al Gore made the ludicrous claim that he had "taken the initiative in creating the Internet". In reality, development of the Internet started long before Gore was elected to public office. Even staunch Gore supporters Cerf and Kahn admit that while Gore's political support was both welcome and more enthusiastic than that of his congressional colleagues, the claim that Gore had actually "taken the initiative in creating the Internet", was ridiculous and while those who had attempted to twist it into the claim that Gore had said he'd "invented" the Internet, all Gore really did was to act as a political cheerleader. Finally, I do agree with you on your use of the word "nutjob" to describe a person who believes anything that Karl Rove says. Rove has about as much credibility as Gore - maybe even a fraction less - though I'm not sure that's really posssible, but if anyone could manage it, it would have to be Rove. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 08:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How then is it strange that the politician who most strongly supported a government funded project takes credit for taking the "initiative" in it? If no money, no internet. If that's the worst you can say against a politician, then you haven't said much. As an aside, one of my favorite moments ever was watching some guy lose a million bucks on "who wants to be a millionaire" over the question "according to the author, who was the inspiration for 'love story'"? Guy made a wisecrack about Gore, bzzzzt. Gore probably took more ridicule over that true claim than over his true internet claim.

<dd>True enough, but I was just trying to illustrate the impracticality of trying to make a point by going off on an irrelevant tangent. You're absolutely right, just because Gore made a ridiculously self-serving statement about his role in the development of the internet doesn't mean he's wrong about global warming. But my larger point is why shouldn't statements by scientists that contradict the claims made by Gore in the film be included in the article about the film? Atlant's position is illustrative of the irrational arguments made by supporters of Gore's film - that people who question the absolute truth of it are equivalent to "flat-earthers". --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 07:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Somehow, <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> seems to feel that vigorous and repeated assertion is a convincing argument. For example, above I stated (referring to CO2 record for the last 650,000 years) that "The [historic CO2] record is <i>not</i> based on proxy data" (emphasis in the original). SpinyNorman's response is to assert without any justification "all we have is proxy data". Of course, as anyone tolerably familiar with the global warming debate knows, in reality the record comes from direct measurements of CO2 in trapped air bubbles from East Antarctic ice cores.

<dd>Actually, the measurements are of CO2 and either <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterium.html" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a> or <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen-18.html" title="Oxygen-18">oxygen-18</a>. The relationship of the isotopes measured is not, in fact, direct. Are you still going to argue that it isn't proxy data? Or are you going to argue that researchers have found a way to send equipment back in time to take direct measurements? And the fact remains that there is no correlation, even in the proxy-derived record, of a link between atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperature. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 01:19, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spiny, I hope your post above was intended to be humorous. Your argument now seems to be that CO2 is a proxy for itself. Do you know what the word "proxy" means? To quote from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proxy_%28climate%29.html" title="Proxy (climate)">proxy (climate)</a> article, a "proxy variable is something that is probably not in itself of any great interest, but from which a variable of interest can be obtained." Or I suppose you're going to tell me that article was written by "kooks", "well-known POV-pusher"s and "censors" from "extremist organizations" (to give but a small sampling of your delightful rhetoric). Note that hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios are proxies for temperature not CO2. (I suppose I should mention that deuterium is a hydrogen isotope in case you didn't realize.) <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 13:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True or false: do we have direct measurements of actual atmospheric CO2 levels from 650,000 years ago? If not, then we must be relying on proxy data that attempt to reconstruct conditions that existed in the past. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 00:59, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spiny, you really are impossible. True, there were no scientists around 650,000 years to measure the atmosphere at that time. However, as I've tried to explain to you a couple of times, scientists today have measured the CO2 in air bubbles that were trapped in glaciers at that time. Really, it's very hard to deny the evidence that CO2 levels are much higher now than any time in the last 650,000 years (or the last 800,000 years based on the most recent evidence). Even the more serious AGW skeptics (say Lindzen or Veizer) won't try to deny this. Of course, if you spend your time reading redstate diaries or some equally reliable scientific source you may get a different story... <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 14:03, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not the place to re-hash the minutiae about global warming science. There are other articles devoted to that.

<dd>I agree that this isn't the place to rehash the debate over AGW as a whole, but it is certainly the place to question claims made by Al Gore in his movie, wouldn't you agree? --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 07:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think what is appropriate to evaluate in this article is whether Gore's statements are accurate from the consensus scientific point of view (and the answer seems to be largely yes as per e.g. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hansen_79bd.html" title="James Hansen">James Hansen</a> book review, <a href="../../../r/e/a/RealClimate_de5a.html" title="RealClimate">RealClimate</a> review, etc.). We should also note that there are dissenting scientific points of view that disagree with the consensus (e.g. Lindzen). I think we should mention that there is a debate about the reality and extent of AGW, but this is not the article to go into the weeds of that debate.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 13:56, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consensus isn't proof of anything. Consensus is opinion. What wikipedia policy says is that facts are to be reported. Some people say Gore is right, other people say he's full of shit. Both facts should be reported and let the reader decide for themselves. The problem is that too many POV-pushers here seem to think that people are too stupid to be allowed to see both sides of the issue. So they insist on removing valid criticism of Gore's claims in the film. Clearly, this page isn't the place to fully service the debate on AGW, but that's what links to other pages are for. However, this page IS the place to talk about what various scientists think of Gore's claims in the film... wouldn't you agree? --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 07:05, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consensus isn't proof, yes. But that's a straw man. If I thought it was proof, I wouldn't advocate mentioning skeptics at all. As I said, I think it is helpful to state that the film is apparently accurate from the consensus point of view (with some minor caveats). Naturally, skeptics like Lindzen disagree with AIT (and this should be mentioned), but I don't think Lindzen has any disagreements with AIT that he wouldn't also have with e.g. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hansen_79bd.html" title="James Hansen">James Hansen</a> to pick the arguably most prominent climate scientist working today.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 13:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In other words, Lindzen et al's material objections to AIT are really objections to the consensus scientific view not specifically to AIT.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 15:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A scientific consensus may not be proof, but it lends extraordinarily more credibility to the notion that somethings is true rather than it is false. It would be POV to attempt to balance the consensus view with the minority view in this article or make it seem that a minority view should be accepted over the consensus view; the views should be represented in the article as they actually are in reality.

<dd>And once new research uncovers further knowledge, a consensus view may be changed. That does not mean that what exists right now should be discarded. As of right now, a consensus view on this issue exists, and that is what this article should portray - not serve as a sounding post to refute it. Furthermore, to compare the hundreds upon hundreds of legitmate scientists who agree on this matter to non-scientific evangelists is an incredible stretch; this matter is a <i>scientific</i> consensus, not a religious consensus seeking to portray itself as truth. You cannot legitametly compare the Global Warming debate to a religious debate--as much as you may disagree with it, there's a <i>reason</i> why <b>scientists</b> around the world agree on this matter, and it's not because God told them to. The skeptics are fine in the article, for as you have said science is based on healthy skepticism; but to portray Global Warming as a mythical consensus equal in validity to a historical evangelist consensus would be misrepresentative and is unfounded. –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 17:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an absurd example. First of all, there is no "consensus" that the earth is spheroid. It is an established fact - a fact that can be verified by anyone who wants to conduct any one of a number of conclusive experiments. AGW is not a fact. It is a theory that cannot be proved or verified with our current level of technology and understanding of global climate. Therefore, there is no valid comparison between the two debates. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 00:57, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
