<h2><span class="mw-headline">An Unearthly Child vs 100,000 BC</span></h2>
<p>on the bbc video release this serial is called the unearthly child so shouldn't this article be moved to <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="An Unearthly Child">An Unearthly Child</a> as it is official.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There really isn't a definitive answer for this. As noted, "100,000 B.C." was the production team's term for the story. "An Unearthly Child" is simply BBC Enterprises' name to market it with, which was not applied until long after the serial was broadcast. That doesn't make it "official", though. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 17:45, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of whether "An Unearthly Child" is the "official" or "correct" name of the complete story, it was given as such often enough that this should at least be noted in the opening section (probably in bold, as an alternate title). In addition, that title redirects here, and redirects are supposed to be clarified as near the beginning of the article as possible. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 19:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has anyone actually called it "100,000 BC" in the past 15 years? It has been released on video (twice), and will be released in DVD shortly, under the name "An Unearthly Child". And let's face it: "An Unearthly Child" is a <i><b>far more exciting</b></i> name than "100,000 BC"!!! - <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> (<a href="../../../n/p/_/User_talk%7ENP_Chilla_bfd8.html" title="User talk:NP Chilla">talk</a>) 18:08, 8 January 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<dd>The most prominent use of <i>100,000 BC</i> over <i>An Unearthly Child</i> is <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_Magazine_e936.html" title="Doctor Who Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></i>, which has referred to the first serial as 100,000 BC for years. I think that's due to Andrew Pixley's influence. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:32, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, as soon as I write that I receive DWM #365, which doesn't mention <i>100,000 BC</i> once in its three-page article on the <i>Doctor Who: The Beginning</i> DVD.

<dd>If we are going to call it <i>100,000 BC</i>, then we should rename <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daleks_796a.html" title="The Daleks">The Daleks</a></i> as <i>The Mutants (1963-1964)</i>; as that was the title used throughout its production.

<dd>Well, yes, we can — as in make an exception — basically because there's going to be confusion with the Pertwee serial.

<dd>I stand corrected. But you know what I mean - if someone less familiar with the show gets the soon-to-be-released <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> (or possibly an old video) and sees the title "An Unearthly Child", they would be rather confused by the "100,000 BC" moniker. <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> (<a href="../../../n/p/_/User_talk%7ENP_Chilla_bfd8.html" title="User talk:NP Chilla">talk</a>) 19:08, 9 January 2006</dd>

<dd>As long as <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="An Unearthly Child">An Unearthly Child</a> redirects here and the page explains the different names, there isn't a problem. I'm no fan of the title but the only titles for Hartnell stories everyone can agree on are the individual episode titles. 100,000 BC is quite common currency these days - in some ways it's useful, given the two different sections of the story, that <i>An Unearthly Child</i> can refer to just the first episode.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Split?</span></h2>
<p>Shouldn't this be listed as two serials? <i>An Unearthly Child</i> (1 episode) + <i>100,000 BC</i> (3 episodes)&#160;? The text of the article seems to suggest it should be so, and watching it, it seems to be so. 132.205.45.110 18:11, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, because the production was organised as one serial, not two, even though story-wise there is a bit of a thematic jump. The confusion also arises because "An Unearthly Child" was shot twice to remove certain story elements, so there exists an untransmitted (but available on video) pilot, much like "The Cage" was. But as far as the production code Serial A is concerned, it was 4 episodes of a single serial. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 18:52, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps there should be an article on An Unearthly Child (pilot) then. It could serve as a nice jumping off point for all the series articles as well. 132.205.15.43 04:22, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think splitting it would make more sense - put both the transmitted and pilot version of AUC on <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="An Unearthly Child">An Unearthly Child</a> and S1 eps 2-4 on <a href="../../../1/0/0/100%2C000_BC_%28Doctor_Who%29_fee7.html" title="100,000 BC (Doctor Who)">100,000 BC (Doctor Who)</a>, and note the serial thing in the notes section, linked with the {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}} templates from the serial code in the infobox. Whatever is done, it's a kludge, and this seems like the simplest and most sensible route to take. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoM_3601.html" title="User:SoM">SoM</a> 19:44, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The vast majority of Doctor Who reference works treat Serial A as one story. I don't think it would help to split it up.

In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>'s there were two depictions of man's evolution where a rectangular shape helped to keep them from extinction. The first one was here where the occupants of the <a href="../../../t/a/r/TARDIS_e48a.html" title="TARDIS">TARDIS</a> helped to give fire back to early man.

<li>As I and Timrollpickering have noted, using terms like "official" is dubious because the BBC isn't a monolithic organisation, and certainly doesn't have an "official" line on anything. The best you can say is that BBC Worldwide or Enterprises have been marketing it under the name of "An Unearthly Child". The historical record continues to favour <i>100,000 BC</i>. And yes, I would sooner support renaming <i>The Daleks</i> as <i>The Mutants (1964)</i> if that would satisfy everyone. The reason why I would prefer <i>The Daleks</i> is not because of popular usage, but because it can cause confusion between that and the Pertwee serial. There is no confusion in this case because the redirects can handle it with a minimum of fuss, unlike trying to distinguish the two <i>Mutants</i> serials, which would probably involve a disambiguation page. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 01:21, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I woudln't say dubious. It's not like any arm of the BBC is calling it 100,000 BC, is it? Besides, isn't the real test here, the general usage in the English language? This is the criteria that one comes to in spelling debates (presuming one isn't dealing with regional variances) and place names. Do two Google searches. One for the phrases "Doctor Who" and "Unearthly Child" and the other for the phrases "Doctor Who" and "100,000 BC" I'm seeing 23,800 results for the former and 538 for the latter. Sure, Google does some strange things in the counts, but still you always get many more results for "Unearthly Child" than "100,000 BC". <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 01:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, when BBC Books published the first edition of The Television Companion in the late 90s it had the first serial as <i>100,000 BC</i>, so you could say that at that point they were endorsing that name, even though at the same time the VHS release was still titled "An Unearthly Child". It simply isn't as clear cut as the up-down vote makes it out to be. "The Discontinuity Guide", published by Virgin under license from the BBC, for example, side steps the whole issue by considering Episode 1: "An Unearthly Child" on its own and 2,3 and 4 as entirely seperate, not giving an overall name to the serial. At the same time, Virgin also came up with Lance Parkin's "History of Universe", which plonked for <i>100,000 BC</i>. <i>Doctor Who Magazine</i>, pretty much the "official" licensed magazine for the programme, for the longest time also used 100,000 BC. Titan Books, also licensed published the script book under its working title of <i>The Tribe of Gum</i>. If the BBC had a consistent policy that would make it simpler, but the truth of the matter is, it didn't, and it doesn't. There is no <i>Doctor Who</i> office handing down edicts from high as to what this serial is to be called. That's why the divide in fandom is so marked as to what to call Serial A, and why we shouldn't just look at common usage for this particular serial (unlike <i>The Daleks</i>) but examine what is actually, historically correct and let redirects handle the rest. I am not suggesting we eradicate all reference to "An Unearthly Child". People can still call it that if they want to, but the accuracy of the article title is what's important here, since if they type in "An Unearthly Child" in the search box they can get here just as easily. General usage should not trump historical accuracy is what I'm saying. To continue to emphasise: there will be no confusion if the article remains named as it is. And yet, if we call the <i>serial</i> "An Unearthly Child" there might very well be confusion when we're talking about the episode or the serial, and have to rely on typographical cues to distinguish the two. I've really said all I have to say about this and am rapidly becoming a bore, so I'll leave it at that. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 02:10, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suspect I became a bore some time back, and it hasn't stopped me. :) You are, of course, correct that there is no monolithic BBC policy on the subject. However, Nfitz is also correct when he says that "An Unearthly Child" is in much wider use than "100,000 BC". I agree that usage within the article, and probably in links to the article, should be "100,000 BC", since that is the correct title.</dd>

<dd>You lose me, though, when you say "General usage should not trump historical accuracy." The problem is that Wikipedia has a guideline that says that in article naming, general usage <i>should</i> trump historical accuracy.

<p>I'll simply repeat what I said on the Wikiproject talk page. There is no confusion here, since if someone types in "An Unearthly Child" in the search box it redirects here. The same could be said for the situation the other way around, so all things being equal, we should not just look at popular usage, but accuracy should be a factor as well. Wikipedia is popular, in the sense that it is created by a community, but it should not be populist - just because a majority of people believe a thing does not make it any more accurate. The simple fact of the matter is that there is not a clear cut decision either way. The article sets out the historical chronology of the name changes and you'll note that "An Unearthly Child" comes a full 10 years after the serial is broadcast before it is used to refer to the serial as a whole. Before that, we have a variety of names, including the intitial working title "The Tribe of Gum" (which was also used on the script book). While any one of these titles have any one of these things going for them - first in time, use in publicity materials, "official" BBC listings, "100,000 BC" has the advantage of having all of these factors. It was the first name to be used in publicity materials; it continues to be used in reference works like "The Television Companion"; DWM uses (or used) it; no less a source than Andrew Pixley, possibly <i>the</i> <i>Doctor Who</i> historian prefers it. "An Unearthly Child"'s provenance, however, comes simply from a mistake made by the <i>Radio Times</i> and subsequently propagated. The biggest thing AUC has going for it, really, is that AUC is used for the marketing end of things, but I don't think that should trump the historical or factual arguments. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 01:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Casual fans don't enter into it. Ask a "casual fan" (whatever that means) and you might have him spell it as "Dalecks". How casual fans refer to the serial means very little. They can be wrong, Justin Richards can be wrong, and I say they are. Just because Richards writes that, you can't take it as gospel; you have to look at it and ask yourself: on what basis is he making that assertion?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As pointed out before, when you say the BBC, you have to specify which part of the BBC you are talking about. When you say the "official website", you are talking merely about the people who produce it; the same people, by the way, who claim that <i>Rose</i> takes place on March 26 in the UNIT website when the television series shows it takes place on March 6, so forgive me if I take their assertions with a pinch of salt. The information in the "official" website comes not from historical sources, but from <i>The Discontinuity Guide</i>, which is nowhere near as authoritative or even pretends to be as well-researched as <i>The Television Companion</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The BBC did not create <i>Doctor Who</i>. Sydney Newman conceived the series, and Coburn, et al. developed it. Anthony Coburn did not write the first serial as "An Unearthly Child". He wrote the first <b>episode</b> titled "An Unearthly Child". The working title was <i>The Tribe of Gum</i>; production documents referred to it as Serial A and only partway through the production was the title of the serial put forward in publicity material as <i>100,000 BC</i>. The use of "An Unearthly Child" to refer to the serial did not come about until <b>1973</b>. Where's the conclusiveness in that? "Is, was and for evermore" is just so way off it barely bears saying.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Gallifrey One, Rotten Tomatoes, Drwho-online - so what? All non-authoritative sources when it comes to this issue. I say look at the historical documentation: the single fact that you cannot get away from is that the earliest title used in publicity materials was <i>100,000 BC</i>. That is a historical fact that will not go away, and <i>that</i> is what "undeniable" means. As I have said, the strongest reason you can raise in support of <i>An Unearthly Child</i> as a title is merely that that's the title on the DVD. And I repeat: that isn't good enough to trump history. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 16:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But common useage is not ultimately relevant here because the redirects can handle it. It works both ways, and I've acknowledged that. This vote is also bad because it's not a clear-cut choice between <i>100,000 BC</i> and <i>An Unearthly Child</i>. So why not <i>The Tribe of Gum</i>? Or <i>The Cavemen</i>?

<dd>The way I read the guideline, it seems that common usage <i>is</i> relevant. Surely the guideline exists exactly for cases such as this? I'm not doubting that "100,000 BC" has the better documentary claim. But basing the argument on the documentary claim seems to me to be equivalent to what the guideline calls "recent scholarship". Pixley's work is as close as <i>Doctor Who</i> history gets to academic scholarship and research. He's made a convincing case that the proper name of the serial <i>is</i> "100,000 BC". However, neither fandom as a whole nor the merchandising wings of the BBC have changed their usage, which is still "An Unearthly Child". —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 01:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sure, I would support a move if the current name of the page is patently wrong (for example, if this argument was about whether to move it from "The Cave of Skulls" for example), but it isn't wrong. In fact, it's accurate. I don't think we need to move it, as the redirects are doing a more than adequate job. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 02:17, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html#Rationale" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)#Rationale</a>, which to me suggests that the convention applies to <i>what articles should be named</i>, not just <i>what articles should be named when they are created</i>. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 04:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, redirects are ugly, but then so is a redirect from <i>100,000 BC</i> to <i>An Unearthly Child</i> or whichever you might care to name. That has always worked both ways. That's why I keep saying, at the end of the day, when we tally up the reasons, all other things being equal, the factor that gives <i>100,000 BC</i> more validity is that it is simply more correct. I do not see why we cannot be factually correct about the title of the serial as long as it is signposted properly. It seems to me that the only reason people want this at "An Unearthly Child" is because it's a more exciting title. But that's marketing. If the BBC came up with marketing the DVD as "Doctor Who and the Secret of Fire" I doubt there would be as much division about it. That, to my mind, seems a poor reason, and I don't think we should promote the myth or impression that the title is the correct one. And we haven't even started on "Inside the Spaceship/The Edge of Destruction" or "Doctor Who and the Silurians" yet, which I can bet you is coming. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 06:25, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I don't think I was clear. I was citing the "redirects are ugly" passage in the context of Wikipedia's justification for going with the most commonly used title instead of the one most supported by scholarship (when the two are in conflict). At the end of the day, either someone searching for "An Unearthly Child" or someone searching for "100,000 BC" will get a redirect notice. Wikipedia has decided, in the guideline, that preferential treatment should be given to the most common usage, rather than the most accurate one. This is consistent with Wikipedia's egalitarian principles. The guideline says, "The articles themselves reflect recent scholarship but the titles should represent common usage," and "Names of articles should be the most commonly used name." That seem perfectly clear to me; our <i>article</i> can remain factually correct and use "100,000 BC" while the article <i>name</i> yields to the more common usage. Our case seems quite comparable to the examples given on the guideline page of using <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> instead of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Earl_Carter%2C_Jr._84cf.html" title="James Earl Carter, Jr.">James Earl Carter, Jr.</a>, or <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_de_Milo_d280.html" title="Venus de Milo">Venus de Milo</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphrodite_of_Melos_aedf.html" title="Aphrodite of Melos">Aphrodite of Melos</a>.

<dd>Neither side is right or wrong, of course. That's why it's so contentious. As I've said before, I called it AUC, but what I call it is pretty irrelevant. I wouldn't be surprised if Justin's choice of title may well have been based on his publisher (the BBC) preference at the time, just as someone freelancing in DWM would refer to the story as 100,000BC whatever their own view (once edited, at least).</dd>

<dd>I suspect that in Justin's case it may be personal preference or a change in editors. Back in 1997-c1999 the BBC published a number of reference books which all went for <i>100,000 BC</i> - indeed one of them (<i>The Television Companion</i>) was billed as the "official" guide to the series and "continuity of product" was cited at the time. When Virgin were publishing Doctor Who books the editor adopted a "choose whichever titles you like" approach which perhaps prevented the poor editor from having to be the one to take the decision but resulted in a very confused situation for fans, with some books even taking pot shots at the approach. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 10:49, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, <i>The Beginning</i> dubs the story <i>An Unearthly Child</i> and also uses the <i>Edge of Destruction</i> name for the <i>Inside the Spaceship</i> two-parter... <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway.

<dd>I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it <i>Enemy Within</i> came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season.

As for <i>100,000 BC</i> vs. <i>An Unearthly Child</i>, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the <i>An Unearthly Child</i> argument. However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:42, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the <b>serial</b> is <i>100,000 BC</i>. The title of the <b>first episode</b> is "An Unearthly Child". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as "An Unearthly Child" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called <i>An Unearthly Child</i> to begin with was because of a mistake by the <i>Radio Times</i>. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename <i>The Daleks</i> to <i>The Mutants</i> rather than change <i>100,000 BC</i> to that. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 16:39, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a long-standing bias towards articles being at whatever location they are most often referred to as. That the VHS and DVD releases were both at An Unearthly Child, that the novelization pointed towards Unearthly Child, and our article freely admits that the BBC now refers to the story as An Unearthly Child. These are all documentable, and as evidence are stronger than vague debates about what it "should" be. If you strongly believe that it should be 100,000 BC, go convince the BBC to refer to it as such, and then Wikipedia will change to follow.

<dd>I'm rather sceptical that within the context in this debate it's possible to talk about such a <i>single</i> thing as "the BBC". Often this actually means (whether realised or not) "this particular BBC department/output agrees with me" and the usage by departments is not always universal - I remember the fun in 1998 when "the official guide" published by the BBC listed the third story as <i>Inside the Spaceship</i> whilst at the same time others were trying to assert the BBC archive catalogue computer - which seems to have had the same titles since c 1981 yet contradicts some of the titles used in a 1990 study by the BBC Research department and both in turn contradict titles used in lists from the old production office. So just which was "the BBC"?! <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 22:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right.

Er, sorry about that. But I don't get quite what Josiah is saying. A vote was held to decide whether or not a story should be catalogued as "1" for "100,000", or "O" for "One hundred thousand..." Why should we not have one now? Have the rules changed? - <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> (<a href="../../../n/p/_/User_talk%7ENP_Chilla_bfd8.html" title="User talk:NP Chilla">talk</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't an active member when the "1" vs. "O" vote occurred, so I can't speak to that precedent. What I meant was that Wikipedia prefers consensus to majoritarian voting, when possible. In the past, this preference was strong enough that some Wikipedians used to say "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/voting_is_evil" class="extiw" title="m:voting_is_evil">voting is evil</a>". This was later toned down to "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/polls_are_evil" class="extiw" title="m:polls_are_evil">polls are evil</a>". But the point is that if it's possible to create a consensus, we should do so. There's no harm in holding a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">straw poll</a> to see which side has numerical support, and if y'all think it would be helpful to do so on this issue we can. But the problem with voting and polls is that they encourage people to take adversarial, binary positions instead of finding common ground. I suppose that since there are two clear alternatives here and not a lot of room for compromise options, a straw poll might be warranted. I'm just leery of jumping into one without ensuring that the arguments of both sides have been fully understood by all parties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know how formal we need to be on this issue, or whether we need to follow the suggestions at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Wikipedia:straw polls</a> to the letter. But that page does say, "Consensus <b>must</b> be reached about the nature of the survey before it starts. Allow about a week for this process." So before we jump into voting on <i>100,000 BC</i> vs. <i>An Unearthly Child</i>, do we all agree that these are the two options to consider? Is the wording, "Should the article currently at <a href="../../../1/0/0/100%2C000_BC_%28Doctor_Who%29_fee7.html" title="100,000 BC (Doctor Who)">100,000 BC (Doctor Who)</a> remain at that location or be moved to <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="An Unearthly Child">An Unearthly Child</a>?" OK for the straw poll, or is another wording better? I know it's tedious, but since the issue is one on which Who fans are far from unanimous, we should make sure we make the decision in the right way. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 23:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree that there are only two options.

Whilst I would not support it myself, it does have a case for it and is still often cited as a common alternative with the other two. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 00:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the debate wouldn't be so emotional (he says with a wink) if 100,000 B.C. weren't such a lame title. An Unearthly Child has a better ring to it, as does The Tribe of Gum even. The Daleks, similarly isn't that descriptive a title; The Dead Planet sound better. And Inside the Spaceship make Doctor Who sound like a kids program (wink) instead of the more action-packed Edge of Destruction which Target used for its novelization. We can only thank our lucky stars the BBC settled on overall serial titles fairly quickly after that.

<dd>I've asked Nightstallion to explain his reasoning further, either here or at the talk page.

<dd>It might be heading there, although the strong opposition of Khaosworks and Timrollpickering weigh against it. You're right that consensus is more difficult to achieve than a simple majority — in order to reach a consensus you need to listen to your opponents' arguments and respond to them thoughtfully, not just drown them out with arguments of your own. That's a skill that isn't developed much these days (especially in the political arena... but I digress). To reach a real consensus, all parties have to be willing to compromise and recognize that those who disagree with them have good reasons for holding the positions that they do. It can't be about winning and losing, but about reaching a solution that's acceptable to everybody. And that's not easy.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I agree that it's a purely binary choice — as Timrollpickering points out above, "The Tribe of Gum" is a third option for naming, and there might be room for compromise on ancillary issues connected with the naming. For example, in the discussion on the article talk page, I suggested that the article could be named and actually located at <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="An Unearthly Child">An Unearthly Child</a>, but referred to in the article and links as "100,000 BC". This was in accordance with the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">guideline</a>, which says, "articles themselves reflect recent scholarship but the titles should represent common usage." <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_a4bc.html" title="User:Whouk">Whouk</a> seemed to find this persuasive, and with time others might have as well.

<p>Oh, I never thought of that.

But, binary or not, there is a large <a href="../../../3F/_/_/__d145.html" title="?">question mark</a> hanging over our heads, as far as this is concerned: neither side of the argument shows signs of deferring, and compromise seems about as likely as Davros becoming Miss World 2006; what do we do under such situations?

<p>Having just received my <i>Beginning</i> box set (pre-ordered from BBc Shop - the quickest and cheapest shop for <i>Who</i> items out there!), I learned that according to the onscreen production notes for episode 2 (if I remember correctly), "Doctor Who and One Hundred Thousand BC" was a working title for this story.

<dd>Or to elaborate, what Pixley determines in his article is that the rehearsal scripts had "The Tribe of Gum" as a working title, then were switched to "Doctor Who and a 100,000 BC" (sic) in the midst of production. "100,000 BC" then remained on record as the closest thing to a title we have when the serial went out, and continued to be so until 1973 when the <i>Radio Times</i> erroneously decided that the first episode of each serial was the overall title for no apparent reason.</dd>
<dd>To grossly simplify the argument (which is why I suggest people read the article which does a much more detailed job in laying out the sequence of documentation), subsequent serials had titles like "Dr Who + the Aztecs", "Dr W + the Sensorites" and "Dr Who + the Reign of Terror" (all sic) written on production documents. That's why Pixley prefers to drop the "Dr Who +" suffixes and just go for, in this case, "100,000 BC". --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 22:49, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just read that very article (and thank you for recommending it to me - it was very interesting indeed). However, what I am trying to say is that the production notes for the DVD release (which were assuredly penned by someone who knew what they were talking about) say that "(Dr. Who and) 100,000BC" is indeed a working title, and Mr. Pixley (who, I readily admit, is an authority on <i>Doctor Who</i>) is writing an article with little or no official input. <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> 16:43, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it's a working title that was used up to the time of broadcast. There's no need to choose between the authority of the DVD production notes over Pixley's scholarship, since they're not in contradiction here. At this time in <i>Doctor Who'</i>s production there was little distinction made between working titles and "real" titles, since there <i>were</i> no real or official titles. Pixley and Howe have made the reasonable but slightly arbitrary decision to designate the title in use at the time of broadcast as the "real" title. The majority of fans and the BBC's marketing departments have not followed this designation, even though it is based on solid scholarship and reasoning. We're still at the same place: the <i>most commonly used</i> name is "An Unearthly Child", but the most <i>accurate</i> name is "100,000 BC". Wikipedia has a guideline which I think applies in this situation, favoring common names, but others disagree. And so forth. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 18:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>EXACTLY!!!!!!!</b></i> You've hit the nail exactly on the head: like you say, Wikipedia's guidelines say that the common name is preferable over the accurate name. And, as you also mention, there are NO official titles during this era at all: every episode has its own title; and "100,000BC" is, in this case, being used as it was the working title. If we use this logic, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gunfighters_2253.html" title="The Gunfighters">The Gunfighters</a></i> should be <i>The Gunslingers</i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daleks_796a.html" title="The Daleks">The Daleks</a></i> should be <i>The Mutants</i>, and <i>Inside the Spaceship</i> should be <i>Beyond the Sun</i> (or <i>The Edge of Desruction</i>; but that's another story...!). <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> 20:14, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term "working title" got applied to a lot of titles, including many that I presume you have no problem with. Also I don't agree with the earlier point that the <i>decision to designate the title in use at the time of broadcast as the "real" title</i> was a "slightly arbitary" decision by Pixley and Howe - the history of title use since the mid 1970s has shown a good number of the titles used in the early days of reference books and organised fandom being succeeded by what were found to be the titles used at the time (e.g. <i>The French Revolution</i> -&gt; <i>The Reign of Terror</i>), although sometimes there were diversions (e.g. <i>Beyond the Sun</i>). <i>100,000 BC</i> is as much the title from the time as <i>The Reign of Terror</i>. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 21:10, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course you're right, but what I'm saying is that Wikipedia's guidelines state that the most common name is used in such cases. As in your example of <i>The Reign of Terror</i> - it could well have been called <i>The French Revolution</i>, but fandom (and Auntie Beeb) always refer to it as <i>The Reign of Terror</i>. Whichever title is the more accurate I have no idea; but the most commonly used title is put first (as we see in <i>The Daleks</i> &gt; <i>The Mutants</i>). Until I saw this article for the first time, I didn't think that <i>100,000 BC</i> was even considered as a title for the serial any more (<i>and</i> I possess both video releases and the new DVD).

<dd>Oh, I agree. It's all very clear-cut to me. Common usage takes priority over historical or technical usage. It's an issue of clarity. The only people who would refer to the serial as anything other than "An Unearthly Child" are hardcore fans who are aware of the debate. To refer to it as anything else in a common context strikes me as pedantic, as the only context in which there is no consensus is in places like this.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, there only seem to be two strong objections, and the main argument against seems to be that the standard Wikipedia rules and (frankly) common sense don't necessarily apply in this instance. Although why that might be has yet to be clarified. --Aderack 12:24, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting <i>The Massacre</i> (of St. Bart's Eve or not) and other thorny titles aside, with Khaosworks yielding the only remaining supporter of <i>100,000 BC</i> is Timrollpickering. I've just left a note on Tim's talk page to see if he's willing to go along with moving the page, or has strong feelings in light of Pixley's comment. I think that with Terence willing to go along with the move we have a consensus, more or less, but if Tim were on board we'd have unanimity. Let's see how strong the consensus is before we go ahead and make the move. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd accept a move of the page's location but I think you suggestion above makes sense:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>...there might be room for compromise on ancillary issues connected with the naming. For example, in the discussion on the article talk page, I suggested that the article could be named and actually located at <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="An Unearthly Child">An Unearthly Child</a>, but referred to in the article and links as "100,000 BC". This was in accordance with the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">guideline</a>, which says, "articles themselves reflect recent scholarship but the titles should represent common usage."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In particular the box on the page itself should give both <i>100,000 BC</i> and <i>An Unearthly Child</i> (and perhaps also <i>The Tribe of Gum</i>) as the titles - see <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a> for an example of how this is handled elsewhere. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 22:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a difficulty with this, because then we'll have a knock-on issue with all the other early Hartnell ones (and what about <i>The Cavemen</i>?). Surely it's sufficient to detail it in the Titles section of the article? --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 22:59, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For most of the stories there isn't really much debate about the titles <b>now</b> - I don't think we'd need to list older titles like <i>The Saracen Hordes</i>, <i>The Crusaders</i>, <i>The Lion</i> and <i>The Lionheart</i> all with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crusade_%28Doctor_Who%29_2be4.html" title="The Crusade (Doctor Who)">The Crusade</a></i>. See <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a> for a case where there hass been a naming dispute in the past but the name for present day use isn't disputed so "Danzig" is not listed in the box, unlike Stroke City where the dispute is current and so "Derry", "Londonderry" and "Doire" are all listed on that page. Really it's only about four or five stories, each of which has about two different titles in contention between the reference books, the licenced magazine and so forth. I don't think this will crowd things out. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 12:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps for sanity's sake we should simply list the most commonly tussled over. In this case, <b>An Unearthly Child / 100,000 BC</b> and then <b>The Edge of Destruction / Inside the Spaceship</b> and <b>The Daleks / The Mutants</b> and leave it as that. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 12:31, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That works for me: place the articles at the most common names (<i>An Unearthly Child</i>, <i>The Daleks</i>, <i>The Edge of Destruction</i>), pipe in-text links or use redirects so that articles use the more accurate names (<i>100,000 BC</i>, <i>Inside the Spaceship</i> — I think we can continue to refer to serial B as <i>The Daleks</i>, though, for simplicity's sake), and (for these three stories only) list both titles in the infobox. We can worry about the other debated titles later.</dd>

<dd>The guideline talks about the article "reflecting recent scholarship", but it's not clear whether that means the "recent scholarship" name should be used within the article, or that the fact that there is recent scholarship should be noted (as it is already in this article). I'm concerned that it would confuse a reader to see a page called, say, <i><b>The Edge of Destruction</b></i> which then refers to its subject throughout as <i>Inside the Spaceship</i>. (Although I note that this article seems to studiously avoid repeating the title.) —<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_a4bc.html" title="User:Whouk">Wh</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_Esperanza_7be7.html" title="User:Whouk/Esperanza"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_a4bc.html" title="User:Whouk">uk</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWhouk_b2f7.html" title="User talk:Whouk">talk</a>)</small> 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may be ass-backwards (or even bass-ackwards), but it seems to be what <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> supports, at least as I read it:
<dl>
<dd>"Wikipedia is not a place to advocate a title change in order to reflect recent scholarship. The articles themselves reflect recent scholarship but the titles should represent common usage."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think that as long as we note the discrepancy in the introduction it should be fine. I like Khaosworks' latest phrasing in this article:
<dl>
<dd>"<i><b>An Unearthly Child</b></i> (also known as <i><b>100,000 BC</b></i>, among others, see <a href="#Titles" title="">below</a>) is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials_d22a.html" title="List of Doctor Who serials">serial</a>..."</dd>

<dd>Does anyone object to that wording?
