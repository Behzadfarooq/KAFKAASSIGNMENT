<hr />
<p>This book by John Sacks reads like a supermarket tabloid.</p>
<p>After having been told that there was a massacre at the Lamsdorf camp, conducted by revenge-minded Jews, the reader finds that he has been set up:</p>
<dl>
<dd>...in the notes, eighty pages away, at the end of an unnumbered paragraph that consists of a half-page list of meaningless names of witnesses with archival notations, ... the unusually diligent reader will discover the identity of the commander at Lamsdorf: he was a Polish Catholic. And it is only in the middle of the previous paragraph of the endnotes that Sack himself admits that "I don't know if any guards at Lamsdorf were Jews." <a href="http://ftp.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/s/sack.john/press/goldhagen-on-sack.19931223" class="external autonumber" title="http://ftp.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/s/sack.john/press/goldhagen-on-sack.19931223" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>On his retirement to a tiny Vancouver thrice-weekly, _North_Shore_News_, with a circulation of 60,000, [Doug Collins] dismissed the movie _Schindler's_List_ as "Swindler's List" and suggested that while the Holocaust indeed did happen, the "six million" dead was wildly exaggerated. The wildly outrageous Political Correctness NDP government of 1993 amended the B.C. Human Rights Act to begin disciplining journalists for publishing anything "likely to expose a person or a group or class of persons to hatred or contempt." The Canadian Jewish Congress complained about Collins and the tribunal dismissed the complaint. A Victoria businessman then furthered the issue, and the tribunal in February ordered Collins to pay the chap $2,000 and apologize. Collins has appealed to the B.C. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>If the New Republic review is to be trusted, this book is yet another in a long series of anti-Semitic slanders. Is there any reason to have an article, let alone one that airs the lies? <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a></p>
<hr />
<p>It's a published book that has been in the news, so of course there should be an article on it, just as there should be an article on <i>Mein Kampf</i> or the more popular white supremacist books. It's damn poor scholarship and sensationalist and possibly anti-semitic, but I don't think this article is too favorable at all to the author's contentions. If you think it needs to be pointed out more clearly that good scholars generally dismiss the work, then do so. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<hr />
<p>IIRC, John Sack is Jewish. If people are going to accuse him of anti-Semitism, that fact surely needs to be mentioned.... -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/SJK_88ad.html" title="SJK">SJK</a></p>

<dd>If you can verify that, go ahead. (I wouldn't edit based on my own "if I can recall correctly", I assume you won't either.) <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a></dd>

<p>Straight from the horse's mouth: "Goldhagen hinted that I, a Jew, was an anti-Semite" see <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/s/sack.john/press/sack-reply-goldhagen.19970313" class="external free" title="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/s/sack.john/press/sack-reply-goldhagen.19970313" rel="nofollow">http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/s/sack.john/press/sack-reply-goldhagen.19970313</a> Also, interestingly, a web search found that he spoke at an Institute for Historical Review (Holocaust-denier group) conference, and wrote a review of it for New York Esquire which the IHR described as "semi-complimentary". Also, although I don't believe he is antisemitic, he seems to be someone that antisemites (including some very extreme ones) like to quote from. --- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<p>I think the camps in question were set up by the red army, but they may be different ones. I hope this isn't based on the "communism is a jewish plot" type of conspiracy. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 16:50, Dec 9, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are quite interesting conversations. I wonder how many of you have read the book. These camps were set up by the red army, but many (though not all) of the people running them were Jews. John Sack believes the Russians wanted revenge and that they thought the Jewish survivors could be trusted to treat them badly, as they probably hated the Germans just as much as the Russians did. This sounds logical to me, if I would want a prisoner to be treated badly I would probably want his prison wardens to be someone who believes he has been done wrong by the person. Without a doubt many Jews, especially Polish ones despised all Germans at the end of the war. Just like many Russians did (and French, Scandinavians, Dutch, etc.) Of course not all of the wardens were bad all of the time, but some of them were bad some of the time. Some of these people had been in the German camps and treated the Germans like other Germans had treated them. I believe Sack is trying to get it in the open that there are German survivors of these camps, just as there are Jewish Holocaust survivors. Why should we disregard part of history? Denying what happened in these camps in Poland at the end of the war and in the months after the war, is just as wrong as denying the Holocaust. If we want to learn from history we have to try to be as objective as possible when dealing with facts. It is debateable whether Sack's writing style is the best style for being objective. He is a journalist and writes like one, and this is sentimentalist writing. But whether it is bad scholarship is a different matter. I haven't found any criticism on the book saying anything in it is a lie or fictitious. It seems to me to be a fine, well researched work of journalism, and I don't think the author claims it to be anything else.</p>
<p>I believe this is an important book. If not for its subject, then for it's criticism which must stand as a monument to the growing "political correctness" of the late 20th and early(?) 21st centuries. A good example of that in these discussions is the censorship Vicki Rosenzweig calls for above. --Steinst 21:02, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Poland is pursuing its charges against Morel. "A request for his extradition by Poland in 1998 was rejected by Israel on the grounds that the statute of limitations on the charges had run out. Prosecutors claim to have built up a stronger case, based on fresh testimony from survivors in Poland and Germany, and have upgraded the charges to crimes against humanity, on which there is no time limit."<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=HJVRSJNCAFNVVQFIQMGSM5WAVCBQWJVC?xml=/news/2005/01/02/wpole02.xml&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=72190" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=HJVRSJNCAFNVVQFIQMGSM5WAVCBQWJVC?xml=/news/2005/01/02/wpole02.xml&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=72190" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwantus_5aca.html" title="User:Kwantus">Kwantus</a> 21:46, 2005 Jan 3 (UTC)</p>

<p>My parents are Germans from the East. In the US, the tragedy that happened to innocent individuals of German ethnicity is little known. John smote a powerful blow for truth. I bought many copies of "An Eye" and distributed them among friends. May his soul rest in the peace well earned by the just.</p>
