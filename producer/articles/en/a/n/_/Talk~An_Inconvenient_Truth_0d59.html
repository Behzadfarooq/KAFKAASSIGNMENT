<p>The entire article, as written, is rank with the perspective of global warming "alarmists," for lack of a better term. In particular, the obvious slant of the "scientific basis" section of the article is plainly intended to give the impression that Gore's thesis (that man is a principle cause of observed global warming) is well demonstrated, scientifically. In point of fact, there are, to put it charitably, serious gaps in the scientific evidence. Hopefully, the article can at least acknowledge those gaps, even if it's too much to hope that it would openly acknowledge that Gore's movie has far more to do with the political ideology relating to global warming, rather than any serious interest in climalogy as a science. My edits attempt to reach a more NPOV slant by presenting both the evidence that Gore's supporters contend support his position and the reasons why serious skeptics do not believe that evidence is sufficient.

<dd>You also might want to read QBeam the news about how the White House pressured government scientists to excluse or downplay mentions of global warming or words to that effect, and how some reports were edited to include and highlight global warming skepticism. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 08:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with QBeam to a certain extent on this, though I might not choose to employ such agressive language. If I were to read this article, I would conclude that there is little or no controversy about the content of the film or the statements made in it. Yet this is clearly not the case. What about some links to the many mistakes Gore makes in the film? It seems to me that this article cries out for a "Criticism" section and not just what film critics have to say about it. --Lee Vonce 17:58, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't win, Qbeam, Lee. Wiki is constantly patrolled by a cabal of left-wing socialists who monitor every liberal talking point/article 24/7, in the hopes to quash any and all facts that scientifically refute King Gore's claims of pending global extinction. A dozen or so people continue to spew lies and half-truths, cover each other's edits with reverts, and then the global warming myth is perpetutated.</dd>

<dd>YOu see, for some reason they think a "consensus" = "fact", but only when it's a lefty issue. For example: The consensus of the people on earth is that there is a Higher Power, a God, since 90% of the people on this planet pray or worship a diety in some form or another, but when it's a right-wing point, it doesn't count.</dd>

<dd>That is a completely irrelevant example. The existence of a god has not been researched extensively using any scientific method, although if you read some of Richard Dawkins work you can find some interesting examples like the well-known prayer study. Likewise if I can find 90% of any group that thinks Al Gore made a terrific, or awful, movie, it's irrelevant. Since both of these examples concern issues that are not the result of any scientific research, they are simply opinion.

<p>It doesn't help playing a ping-pong game someone shouting "Gore is wrong", then others shouting "Gore is right" and so on. QBeam, if you have references of reputable scientists pointing out mistakes in the movie, go ahead. Note that just claiming something without reference is not sufficient for adding it to Wikipedia. Furthermore, scientific findings are something different than claims made in the mainstream media, which are very often based on lack of knowledge or motivated by politics. This confuses many people. Note that in the scientific community, there is an agreement on this issue, see for example the today's panel report of the world's leading climate scientists. QBeam, what do you suggest to add to the article? 87.163.92.11 09:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, in the scientific community, there not as much agreement on the issue as some (like Al Gore) would like the public to believe. The latest report by the IPCC is a perfect example. It is portrayed as somehow definitive and all-encompassing when, in reality, the IPCC is simply a group of scientists who are chosen because they agree with the views and goals of the IPCC and then eased out the door or allowed to resign if they disagree with the IPCC's views. I'm not saying that they're wrong about anything in particular, I'm just saying that I disagree with those who claim that the IPCC speaks for everyone. There are reputable scientists who disagree with the IPCC and the attempts by the IPCC and their members to discount or descredit this criticism is disgraceful. --Lee Vonce 18:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People will believe what they want to believe. Unless the truth smacks the hell out of their face, butt and soul to kingdom come. And as to any issue, there will be voices of dissent. It's just that the IPCC's voice is stronger than those dissenting, because they are authorized, collective, and credible. How can you say the scientists of IPCC are those who only conform to the views and goals of IPCC when they come from different nations, backgrounds and credentials? You should look at the White House which is the one proven to have coerced or influenced government scientists to downplay mentions of global warming in government reports and highlight or include skepticisms on the role of mankind in warming the world. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 17:21, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let us just move the conversation here. The dictionary definition of propaganda is anything which tries to convince some one else of their view on a political, social, or religous subject. Gore, as was his right, and probably his duty, made a film to alert people to what he feels strongly is an important issue, global warming. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but he is trying to convince of his opinion, rather than simply state a fact, as a documentary would. I would put it in the same cat if it was an anti-global warming movie. Triumph of the Will, which you consistently refer to, was created out of footage of the 1934 Nazi Party congress, as is ment to show the great re-birth of Germany under Hitler, an opinion which the Nazis no doubt sincerly beleived. So why fight me on this?--<a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudeman5685_bc71.html" title="User:Dudeman5685">Dudeman5685</a> 23:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because your dictionary is either bad or you are citing out of context. The term "propaganda" has strong negative connotations. Just check <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">our own article</a>: "Instead of impartially providing information, propaganda is often deliberately misleading, using logical fallacies, which, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.

<dd>In my opinion, by the true meaning of the word <i>An Inconvient Truth</i> is a propaganda film, but with these "negative connotations" that the word has taken on I personally wouldn't call it a propaganda film. BUT when dealing with Wikipedia, one <i>must</i> use the "true" meaning of the word. Otherwise you can't really label a film (or anything) as "propaganda" without being in danger of violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, right? If <i>An Inconvient Truth</i>, which fits a definition of "propaganda film", can't be labelled as propaganda, then nothing should be. In my opinion. If nothing else, there should at least be a mention of the opinion that <i>An Inconvient Truth</i> is a propaganda film. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 01:46, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, but then how can one differentiate from those that have been <i>called</i> propaganda and those that <i>are</i>? My point is that if this can't be categorized as a "propaganda film" then the entire category of "propaganda films" should probably be deleted, or at least further defined or something. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 02:38, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Defining propaganda is a lot like defining art. Artists are only "supposed" to think about the artistic value of their work, and ignore social or monetary considerations, but of couse they all do. The fact is, even though many people have a negative aversion to the word, many, like my self, attach no such stigma, and feel that propaganda is a valid, even necessary, part of political expression, and people propagandizing their view points helps rather than hinders democracy. Thus I would gladly put this An Inconvient Truth in the propaganda category, a label it should were with pride.--<a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudeman5685_bc71.html" title="User:Dudeman5685">Dudeman5685</a> 03:29, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Propaganda, as stated by Stephan and Wikipedia itself, has negative connotations. It's synonyms include advertising, agitprop, announcement, ballyhoo, brainwashing*, disinformation, doctrine, evangelism, handout, hogwash*, hype*, implantation, inculcation, indoctrination, newspeak, promotion, promulgation, proselytism, publication, and publicity. Some of these are neutral or positive but it is conspicuous that there are negative synonyms included. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 20:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/e/r/Merriam-Webster_4fd8.html" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a> defines propaganda as</p>

<li><b>: the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person</b></li>

<p>In my opinion, though there may be negative connotations given to "propaganda", these neutral definitions are the only definitions that can be used if anything is to be included on wikipedia labelled as "propaganda".</p>

<dd>It is more apt to call the film a documentary because it is based on facts, shows facts, and relies heavily on facts. I will agree that the film is a propaganda in the strictest sense but mind you, all serious films or editorial writings are also propagandas, because they all spread ideas for the purpose of advancing a cause. Michael Moore's documentaries advance causes as well but if you look at the Farenheit 9/11 article, the word propaganda only comes up once and it is referenced as a criticism.</dd>

<dd>I have no problems with anyone adding the word propaganda to this article if it is referenced and aptly stated by a credible third-party source, and not just one's own opinion. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 16:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst I understand your resoning, Berzerker, that some people might see the word propaganda, and and would give them reservations about the veracity of the film, isn't that, in fact, a good thing? Shouldn't people be critical of what information or media they receive and realize that, although the points this movie makes may be valid, they are not "gospel truth" and there may be other, equally valid, points of view on this, or any other subject? We want people to think critically, and giving them that "heads up" is healthy.

Why is everyone riding me about this?</p>
<p>I don't have an agenda, as all the right leaning films I've put in the propaganda cat will show. I merely want a full listing of the relevant topics, or else the category would consist of little more than WWII newsreels and 50s exploitation films. Why is it so controversial that latter day American propaganda films. which touch on contrmpory debates, be excluded? It isn't POV, either. The FTA tour, Outfoxed, F9/11 all were films which had a clear policitcal and/or social agenda, why is it so difficult to admit that they are propaganda? (No one has ever raised objection to Stolen Honor, FahrenHYPE 9/11, or Michael Moore Hates America, btw).</p>
<p>That isn't my only reason for putting them in that cat, they all use selective editing and presentation of the facts, fail to show the other side, and try to be "entertaining" enough to lure in an audience.

<dd>Normally, I would be bold when editing, although as this is a special case, I would like to discuss it first, I meant the format of the movie (a politician lecturing in science), his somewhat bitterness (I'm the former next President) and the blatant random segments on his life (only trying to invoke pathos). This is one of the major concerns by critics, even those who are fully aware of the implications of global warming. The cartoons also have one minor factual error that may needs to be address as well (the fact that H2O is the most common greenhouse gase, not stinking green ones). 81.228.195.119 06:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Gore's movie does not speak one bit about the solar variation theory, about the only substantiated skeptic theory. Well, I wouldn't even call it that. The theory holds a lot of water, and the debate isn't about whether solar variation plays a role, but to what extent. Some popular numbers put out by substantiated scientists is that around ~75% of the observed global heating until 1980 is caused by solar variations, and ~25% since then. Gore says he tried to diminish obstacles, but he fails to mention the single most debated issues <b>within</b> the scientific community. No one denies that the Earth is heating, that GHGs contribute to warming, or that humans can produce GHGs. The question is to what extent solar forcings affect this observed heating. This is something Gore does not address at all. Disappointing. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 05:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He refers to it obliquely when comparing the data from the ice core samples as he talks about critics rejecting human activity as the cause of Global Warming due to "cyclical effects". His emphasis is on how different the CO<sub>2</sub> levels are now even when compared over more than 1/2 million years of earth history. So yes I would say his emphasis is on the human component of GW as he addresses the idea that current levels are just part of normal change patterns. You have to remember his audience as he obviously does - you can kill people with scientific overload so you need to stick to your point but give enough info that others can check up what backs your conclusions and then make their own judgements on the validity of yours. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 07:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, well, the original user who promoted this article to GA status did it correctly as far as I can remember (to lazy to check the History, too many edits to look over and my eyes hurt currently). Then, somebody delisted it just days after citing lack of refs or inline citation (which was totally untrue) which I reverted. The discussion is still here in this page I believe, at <a href="../../../a/n/_/Talk%7EAn_Inconvenient_Truth_0d59.html#Shouldn.27t_this_be_class_A_already.3F" title="Talk:An Inconvenient Truth">Talk:An_Inconvenient_Truth#Shouldn.27t_this_be_class_A_already.3F</a>. Oh and it was <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kidd_2d2a.html" title="User:James Kidd">User:James Kidd</a> who reviewed this article to GA. Btw, how can an article be improperly or only partially listed as GA?

<p>This article seems very biased towards trying to prove that An Inconvenient Truth was actually the real truth itself. I have gone through all the references, and they are mostly only references to the following:</p>
<p>1) Newspaper and magazine articles (which are mostly sensationalist and prey on baseless fear) 2) Journals and magazines that have shown themselves to be of little credibility, such as <i>Science</i> 3) Global warming advocates, as well as sites and articles run or writen by them</p>
<p>I feel this is very unscientific and unethical, as it wrongly and baselessly informs the public on such a big and controversial issue. Let's be more scientific and correct this issue.</p>
<p>To start the ball rolling, let me point out that only the Antartic Peninsula, which is only 2% of the Antartic is warming, the rest of the Antartic (about 98%) is getting colder each year. Let's not just try to prove that An Inconvenient Truth was actually factual, and just prove what actually is. In other words, tell the truth about "An Inconvenient Truth".</p>

<dd>Well, if Science was a journal of the "greatest credibility in the world", then may I ask why it published articles without the original title of the paper, but rather a sensationalized version of the title with sensationalized information? Also, just because a topic is spoken positively of more often, does not mean that it is so. Please do read up on proper research methodology and ethics before commenting. All views must be shown thoroughly, whether or not they are minority views, as majority does not mean right. Also, please note that I mention this because this entry is writen such that it gives the impression that the movie "An Inconvenient Truth" has good and well-founded scientific basis, when the truth is that the whole issue still cannot be determined to be supporting either side. So please, be professional. If nobody will heed this, then please, go ahead and be biased, it'll just show how unprofessional the writing of this article is, when it is so weighted to one side.

<dd>Well, fact is that Science and Nature probably are the two most respected broad-topic scientific journals on earth, regardless of what you and I think about it ourselved. But, for personal interest, do you have any source for the event you alude to?

The movie, with very minor issues, describes the current <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change.html" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific opinion on climate change</a> faithfully.

<p>I would like to comment on one of the points made about this movie- specifically that it is based on scientific consensus. There is absolutey no scientific consensus regarding global warming. Research has shown that only about 10% of scientists believe in global warming like how Gore puts it.</p>
