<p>Schoolteachers <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Chesterton_c8fe.html" title="Ian Chesterton">Ian Chesterton</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Wright_%28Doctor_Who%29_9180.html" title="Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)">Barbara Wright</a> become concerned about one of their pupils, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Foreman_10d3.html" title="Susan Foreman">Susan Foreman</a>. She seems to have a very alien outlook on <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> England, and though her knowledge of some issues is very advanced, she has other curious gaps in her basic understanding, or extends concepts beyond their normal parameters. After following her home, Ian and Barbara discover that she appears to live in a junkyard with her grandfather. In fact, Susan and her grandfather, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Doctor_ce42.html" title="First Doctor">Doctor</a>, are <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">aliens</a>, who travel through time and space in the <a href="../../../t/a/r/TARDIS_e48a.html" title="TARDIS">TARDIS</a>, a time machine disguised as a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_box.html" title="Police box">police box</a> that is much larger on the inside than it is on the outside. When Ian and Barbara stumble into the TARDIS, the Doctor, who appears to be a wanderer and a fugitive, decides that it is too dangerous to remain in 1963 <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, and so dematerialises the TARDIS with himself, Susan and the two schoolteachers on board.</p>
<p>The four travel back to the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Age_b753.html" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> as very uneasy companions, Ian and Barbara blaming the Doctor for having kidnapped them from contemporary society. They also have difficulty believing they have actually travelled in time, but the remoteness of their situation and the vileness of the civilisation they encounter convinces them that they have indeed been taken far back into the past. The Doctor is concerned too because the exterior of the TARDIS does not seem to have changed when the ship rematerialised. Susan explains that the ship is supposed to change its appearance to blend in with its surroundings, but for some reason it has remained in the shape of a police box.</p>
<p>They soon become involved in the power struggles of a stone age tribe (known in an early working title of the serial as the Tribe of Gum), where leader Za is being mocked for not being able to produce fire, which his father, the previous leader, was able to do. Kal, an interloper from another tribe, only heightens the tension when he offers himself as an alternative leader who could make fire. His evidence is the Doctor, whom he saw trying to light his pipe, but the old man has dropped his matches and is unable to help. As a punishment, the four time travellers are incarcerated in the hideous Cave of Skulls, containing remnants of executed people and sacrifices, and promised a similar fate for refusing to co-operate. They are freed by Old Mother, the naïve widow of the last tribal leader, who believes that they could make fire but does not want them to do so, as she considers it a bad omen. The four travellers then flee into a Paleolithic forest, pursued by Za and his partner Hur.</p>
<p>When Za and Hur catch up with them, the tribal leader is attacked by a wild beast and seriously injured. The Doctor is so desperate to leave that he contemplates killing the caveman, but is stopped by Ian. They build a makeshift stretcher to help convey Za back to the tribal settlement, hoping by doing so to prove their good intentions. However, in their absence Kal has killed Old Mother and blamed it on Za. The four travellers are returned to the Cave of Skulls, this time with Old Mother’s body for company, but Za recovers and offers them safety. In return, Ian is eventually able to make fire for Za using <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friction.html" title="Friction">friction</a> for a spark. Za has further confirmed his leadership of the tribe by killing the usurper Kal and, with fire at his disposal, is undisputed leader. In this security he decrees that the travellers will merge with his tribe rather than leave, and orders them confined to the Cave indefinitely.</p>
<p>Susan eventually devises a plan to scare and distract the tribespeople enough to allow them to flee. Four skulls are placed on top of burning torches, and this ghoulish vision is enough to allow them to escape back into the forest. This time the four travellers make it back inside the TARDIS before the tribe can capture them and, once they are ensconced, the ship dematerialises once more.<br clear="all" /></p>

<li>The second episode mentions the malfunction of the ship's ability to change its appearance to blend in with the background. Later stories would identify this as the chameleon circuit.</li>
<li>When Ian calls the Doctor "Dr Foreman" in the second episode of this story, he gets the reply, "Eh, Doctor who? What's he talking about?" Although at this stage the question is primarily presented to make a plot point (the Doctor's name is not Foreman), it is the first usage of the series' title in dialogue. The question would later be asked for humorous effect, a joke which has been repeated several times in the series.</li>
<li>In the second part of this story, the Doctor is seen to smoke a pipe for the first, and last, time.</li>
<li>At one point, Ian stops the Doctor from killing a caveman with a rock. While the Doctor has killed since in self-defence or as a last resort, the incongruity of the character (which was still developing) attempting to commit cold-blooded murder may shock fans who were introduced to the series through later Doctors. This scene is revisited in the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Doctor_Adventures_b2ce.html" title="Eighth Doctor Adventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a> novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Eight_Doctors_9d02.html" title="The Eight Doctors">The Eight Doctors</a></i>, where the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Doctor_8330.html" title="Eighth Doctor">Eighth Doctor</a> is the one who persuades the First Doctor not to kill the caveman. Like all spin-off media, its <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html#Doctor_Who" title="Canon (fiction)">canonicity</a> in relation to the television series is unclear.</li>
<li>The Doctor would return to the Foreman scrapyard on two future occasions: <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Cybermen_d9b5.html" title="Attack of the Cybermen">Attack of the Cybermen</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/m/Remembrance_of_the_Daleks_1b12.html" title="Remembrance of the Daleks">Remembrance of the Daleks</a></i>. <i>Remembrance of the Daleks</i> takes place in November, when the Doctor first appeared, as a calendar is visible in one of it's episodes, but it is likely set soon after the events of <i>An Unearthly Child</i>.</li>

<p>In the first episode, Susan is scolded for not knowing how many <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shillings.html" title="Shillings">shillings</a> are in a <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">pound</a>; she replies that she had forgotten that <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimalisation.html" title="Decimalisation">decimalisation</a> of British currency "hasn't started yet." Discussions on decimalisation of British currency dated back to the 19th century. The Halsbury Committee on the Inquiry on Decimal Currency was set up in 1961 and presented its report in 1963, although adoption of its recommendations was not announced until 1966 and not implemented until 1971 on <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_Day_6980.html" title="Decimal Day">Decimal Day</a>. Decimalisation of British currency did not change the pound and so the number of shillings in a pound remained at 20, although the term eventually ceased to be in common usage, therefore by the writer's luck Susan's statement does in fact make perfect historical sense. (This also heavily implies that the Doctor and Susan have visited the era of the Decimal system before.)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Unearthly_Child_2eb3.html" title="Edit section: Production">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Production</span></h2>
<p>The serial that became <i>An Unearthly Child</i> was originally commissioned from writer Anthony Coburn in June 1963, when it was intended to run as the second <i>Doctor Who</i> serial. At this stage, it was planned that the series would open with a serial entitled <i>The Giants</i>, to be written by BBC staff scriptwriter <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._E._Webber_62da.html" title="C. E. Webber">C. E. Webber</a>.<sup id="_ref-handbook_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[1]</a></sup> Webber had been heavily involved in the brainstorming meetings which had led to the creation of <i>Doctor Who</i>, and — with BBC Head of Drama <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Newman_bcb4.html" title="Sydney Newman">Sydney Newman</a> and Head of Serials <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Wilson_%28writer_and_producer%29_7e6b.html" title="Donald Wilson (writer and producer)">Donald Wilson</a> — had co-written the initial <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_%28television%29.html" title="Bible (television)">format document</a> for the series.</p>
<p>By the middle of June, however, Wilson and <i>Doctor Who'</i>s initial "caretaker producer" <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex_Tucker_e348.html" title="Rex Tucker">Rex Tucker</a> decided to reject <i>The Giants</i>. This was partly because it was felt the serial lacked the necessary impact for an opener, and partly because it was felt that the technical requirements of the storyline — which involved the leading characters being drastically reduced in size — would be beyond the capacities of the young series at this point, given the facilities available.<sup id="_ref-handbook_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[1]</a></sup> Due to the lack of scripts ready for production, it was decided to move Coburn's serial up to first in the run.<sup id="_ref-handbook_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the end of June, responsibility for getting <i>Doctor Who</i> off the ground was handed over to producer <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verity_Lambert_bf5d.html" title="Verity Lambert">Verity Lambert</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_editor.html" title="Script editor">script editor</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Whitaker_d338.html" title="David Whitaker">David Whitaker</a>, neither of whom were impressed with Coburn's serial, upon which the writer was asked to carry out major rewrites.<sup id="_ref-handbook_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[1]</a></sup> There was even some consideration given to dropping the scripts altogether, with writer <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Dudley_cf9c.html" title="Terence Dudley">Terence Dudley</a> briefly sounded out about providing a replacement, but a lack of time necessitated Coburn's serial going ahead.<sup id="_ref-handbook_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Coburn's script for the very first episode is believed to have been heavily based on Webber's script for the opening episode of <i>The Giants</i> — Webber received a co-writer's credit for it on internal BBC documentation, although not on-screen.<sup id="_ref-handbook_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbook" title="">[1]</a></sup> Coburn did, however, make several notable additions of his own, chiefly the idea that Susan should be the Doctor's granddaughter rather than simply a travelling companion, and that the Doctor's time machine should externally resemble a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_box.html" title="Police box">police box</a> — this went on to become one of the main icons of the programme.

<p>The first episode, "An Unearthly Child", was originally recorded a month before full recording on the series began. However, the initial recording was bedevilled with technical problems and errors made during the performance. A particular problem occurred with the doors leading into the TARDIS control room which would not close properly, instead randomly opening and closing through the early part of the scene. Two versions of the scene set in the TARDIS were recorded, along with an aborted first attempt to start the second version.</p>
<p>Sydney Newman, after viewing the episode, met producer Verity Lambert and director Waris Hussein. He indicated the many faults he found with the pilot and ordered that it be mounted again; a consequence of this was the delay of the show's planned <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">16 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> premiere date. This initial episode is now known as the unaired "<a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_pilot.html" title="Television pilot">pilot episode</a>", although it was never intended as such, since the practice of producing pilot episodes did not exist in Britain in the 1960s.</p>
<p>During the weeks between the two tapings, changes were made to costuming, effects, performances, and the script (which had originally featured a more callous and threatening Doctor, and Susan doing strange things like flicking ink blots onto paper). Changes made before the final version was filmed include a thunderclap sound effect being deleted from the opening theme music; Susan's dress being changed to make her look more like a schoolgirl than the original costume which made her appear more alien and sensual; the Doctor's costume being changed from a normal suit and tie to his familiar, Edwardian clothing; a reference to the Doctor and Susan being from the 49th Century being replaced by them being from "another time, another world"; the TARDIS door being repaired so that it closed properly; and a refinement of the TARDIS sound effect.</p>
<p>The original episode was not broadcast until <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">26 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> when the BBC aired a version that edited together the first half of the taping with one of the two completed second halves. As it happened, the version chosen was the one in which the TARDIS doors would not close; other errors included actress Carole Ann Ford flubbing a line of dialogue, Jacqueline Hill getting caught in a doorway, a camera banging into a piece of scenery during one of the scrapyard sequences, and William Russell accidentially knocking over a mannequin in the scrapyard. This version was later released on the VHS compilation <i>The Hartnell Years</i>. In late 2005, the <i>Doctor Who: The Beginning</i> DVD set (released in North America in March 2006) contained two versions of the episode: an unedited studio recording including all takes of the second part of the show, and a newly created version of the pilot that uses the best footage from the original recording, with additional editing and digital adjustments to remove blown lines, technical problems, and reduce studio noise. Like the other episodes from this serial, both versions of the "pilot" were remastered for DVD release, using <a href="../../../v/i/d/VidFIRE_c535.html" title="VidFIRE">VidFIRE</a> technology that simulated the original video look of the 1963 production.</p>

<p>As was usual at the beginning of the series' history, no overall title appeared on-screen, and each episode has its own title. <i>100,000 BC</i> is the title that was used by the production team at the time of transmission. However, due to the absence of an overall onscreen title for the four episode storyline, reference works have used various different titles, some originating from the BBC production office and others seemingly invented by fans.</p>
<p>Titles used for the story include, in rough chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Tribe of Gum</i> - An early working title which was used up until the beginning of recording. It survived in a few documents derived from earlier paperwork, such as the payments for overseas sales, and started appearing again in reference works in the late 1970s and 1980s, including being used when the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleplay.html" title="Teleplay">teleplay</a> was published by <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_Books_118f.html" title="Titan Books">Titan Books</a>.</li>
<li><i>100,000 BC</i> - The first known use is a publicity release dating from when the story was being recorded and this title is used on subsequent lists and publicity releases.</li>
<li><i>The Paleolithic Age</i> - Used by producer <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verity_Lambert_bf5d.html" title="Verity Lambert">Verity Lambert</a> in a letter to a viewer in late 1964.</li>
<li><i>The Stone Age</i> - Used on the biography listing on a publicity release for a later story in late 1965.</li>
<li><i>An Unearthly Child</i> (or variants thereof) - The title of the first episode, used by the 1973 <i><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Times_2a4f.html" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a></i> Tenth Anniversary Special and subsequently by the 1976 edition of <i>The Making of Doctor Who</i>, with much subsequent commercial use including the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelization.html" title="Novelization">novelisation</a>, VHS and DVD releases of the story.</li>
<li><i>The Cavemen</i> - A quick description of the story material used in a 1974 fan listing due to the seeming lack of any other title.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many documents lack any title at all (whereas for later stories they are clearer), including the 1974 <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Enterprises_a390.html" title="BBC Enterprises">BBC Enterprises</a> listing <i>A Quick Guide to Doctor Who</i> which was the main source of titles for most early fan reference works.</p>
<p>Which title should be used is a subject that has generated deep controversy amongst fans of the series. Fan researchers such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_J._Howe_1b98.html" title="David J. Howe">David J. Howe</a> argue that since <i>100,000 BC</i> was used by the production team at the time of transmission, it is the most accurate title. However, the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> tends to market the story as <i>An Unearthly Child</i>. Consequently, this become the most common title used for the story in recent years (see also <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_story_title_controversy_2bb5.html" title="Doctor Who story title controversy">Doctor Who story title controversy</a>). The four episodes of the serial were, respectively, "An Unearthly Child", "The Cave of Skulls", "The Forest of Fear" and "The Firemaker".</p>
