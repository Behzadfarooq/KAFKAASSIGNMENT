<h2><span class="mw-headline">Grammar of "puirt a beul"</span></h2>
<p>Hi, can you clarify the grammar of <a href="../../../p/u/i/Puirt_a_beul.html" title="Puirt a beul">puirt a beul</a> for me? The spelling <b>puirt a beul</b> is by far the most common in Google, but if I've correctly transferred my knowledge of Irish grammar over to Scottish Gaelic, shouldn't "tunes of the mouth" actually be <b>puirt a' bhèil</b>? I've said so at <a href="../../../p/u/i/Puirt_a_beul.html" title="Puirt a beul">puirt a beul</a> but the utter lack of Google hits for <b>puirt a' bhèil</b> is making me nervous. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 11:56, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! But if this weren't a fixed phrase -- if you had never heard of a music genre called "puirt a beul", and were just speaking Gaelic and wanted for some weird reason to say "tunes of the mouth", what would you say (and how would you spell it)? —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 12:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But not <i>puirt a' bhèil</i>?

<p>I have reverted your recent edits in <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavids.html" title="Safavids">Safavids</a>. We had that discussion long before and - honestly - I do not understand why you reject the authoritative information of the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> (written by Prof. Roger M. Savory, THE expert on Safavid history).</p>
<p>I would also like to know how the "Turkic origin"-theory supporters explain the fact that Sheikh Safi al-Din Ardabeli wrote his poems in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian.html" title="Persian">Persian</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Azari_language_fb6c.html" title="Ancient Azari language">Old Tati</a>, although he is claimed a "Turk" (see <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a>, <i>"Azarbaidjani language"</i>)?!</p>
<p>If you do not have access to the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>, send me your e-mail address and I'll send you the entire "Safawids" article (PDF formate).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"British Isles"</span></h2>
<p>I have twice removed this term from the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Template%7EEnglish_dialects_71c3.html" title="Template:English dialects">Template:English dialects</a> box and will be doing so for a third time after posting this notice.</p>
<p>Ireland is not a "British Isle." It is an Irish Isle. The term "British" refers to "Britain," the larger island just east of Ireland. Just because the term "British Isles" is more concise than "The United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and the Isle of Man" does not make the term acceptable.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can explain why applying the term "British Isles" to Irealnd is so offensive. In past years, Asians were called "Orientals." Oriental means Eastern, and implies that Asian people are defined, not by their own culture, but by their relationship to Europe(ie. they are east of Europe.) The term is Euro-centric and entirely unacceptable. I could point out a litany of such terms to define a people that were once acceptable in polite society but are no longer. (African American wikipedians will instantly recognize the specific term that I am implying.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Douglass_7ab5.html" title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> told us that slaves and dogs are named by others, but that free men name themselves. The Irish, and Ireland, are not defined as a variation on Britain, or by their relationship to Britain.</p>
<p>Please stop reverting to "British Isles." It is offensive.</p>

Some of the email we get are from people who are upset about what is written about them, or people that they care about, either in articles or on talk pages. Insulting comments and unreliable malicious gossip often turn up on talk pages, AfD discussions, and, even worse, in actual articles. This information is routinely removed through deletion or blanking; when we are no longer publishing it here it is no longer spidered through Google and distributed through our reusers. There is another point here that I don't want to get lost, however. When you see an editor make an edit that you don't understand, don't blindly revert. Ask about it. Administrators regularly do things that might be confusing to people who don't know the whole story; removing copyright infringement, reverting what seem like normal edits made by banned users, or in response to many other problems. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assuming good faith</a> is a guideline for a practical reason; one cannot expect that they are going to be informed about everything that goes on at a project as large as en: has become, so we have to trust each other to be doing the right thing. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 20:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gaelic in Lewis</span></h2>
<p>Hi there. You told me before that you come from the west side of Lewis and I was wondering what you thought about the <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis.html" title="Lewis">Lewis</a> article where it states:</p>
<p>"Historically the island has been a stronghold for the preservation of the Scottish Gaelic language, although the language recently has been dying out, with very few of the island's younger generation being fluent speakers. The main language on the island is English; in 1988 approximately 1/6 of the students at the secondary school who studied Gaelic were native speakers, the other 5/6 were classed as learners."</p>
<p>I didn't realise the language was in such a precarious position in Lewis with very few of the younger generation being fluent speakers. Is this really true? If so, I imagine that most native Gaelic speakers would not choose to study the language at school because they already have it and feel there is no need to study it any further. In Gaeltacht areas of Ireland, young people speak English to each other because it is "cool" but I would say most go back to Irish when they come of age. Teenagers rebel against a lot of things, not just Irish. One thing I do remember from my cycling tour through the Outer Hebrides in 2004 was the number of people from Glasgow and England who have settled in the islands, even more than one would encounter in Irish speaking parts of Ireland. Is there any Gaelic in Stornoway? I heard a lot of Gaelic in the streets in Stornoway but I suspect that they were people from outside the town rather the local inhabitants. I remember the barmaid in one pub deliberately ignoring me when I tried to order a drink in Gaelic, although, maybe she was in the minority. I also remember the lady in the hostel being very bitter about the Free Church, and by extension with Gaelic, which she equated with the Free Church. She softened her tone, though, when I pointed out that for years people automatically equated the Irish language with Catholocism and Republicanism, even if one was neither a Roman Catholic or a Republican. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Muimhneach_Machnamhach_62bf.html" title="User:An Muimhneach Machnamhach">An Muimhneach Machnamhach</a> 12:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</pre>
<p>an Siarach, I wasnt intending to be antagonistic about Scottish Gaelic on the Scots language talk page regarding its relationship to Irish Gaelic. I would hate to see Gaelic die out as a spoken language and support all language campaigns in the face of globalisation. But persuading speakers that there is no such thing as Scots is all too easy if they are lead to view it as a lesser form of English (as was the case with Norwegian in relation to Danish a couple of centuries ago). I believe that all language definitions are to a great extent driven by state policy (in the form of standard grammars at school level) and in the case of Scots, this has been its fate since the 19th century, and media pressure to conform to the "right way of speaking". An Afrikaans speaker would have no difficulty in reading and understanding a Dutch text, yet the definition of Afrikaans is not Dutch", and the assertion by a prominent contributer there that Anglic is "biased", when in fact its a more useful linguistic term to define Scots as a language variety, is no less biased than asserting the opposite (IE there was political pressure to ridicule the idea of "Scots as a seperate language" whereas Gaelic could not be assumed to be a form of the state language at variance with Standard English in the effort to create a new state following the Act of Union, so could be left with its definition intact, despite the efforts to get rid of it). I have heard it asserted that there are there are as many differences between "dialects" of Irish as there are between the standard written varieties of Scottish and Irish Gaelic and my point was merely to emphasise the way in which there is an assumption at state level which cannot but influence the assumed "languages" and "dialects" in the general public (which can and do change in line with government language policy...check out the history of Luxembourgish. I dont think I am an anti Gael (though I could be at some sub concious level a Pinkertonian Teuton of some sort, but I wouldnt be aware of this of course:}) I would be objectively interested in your opinion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Irish_language" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Irish_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Irish_language</a> as I think this demonstrates the complexities of defining when a language is a language which at that period effected Scottish Gaelic in paralell with how Scots is effected at present .
