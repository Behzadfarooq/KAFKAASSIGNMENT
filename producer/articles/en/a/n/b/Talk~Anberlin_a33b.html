<p>== Christian Rock? == and so cool</p>
<p>Just because they are signed to a christian label and are Christian's doesn't mean their genre is Christian Rock. Calling them Christian Rock says nothing about their music style. I read all of the lyrics from their second album and only found one God reference, Black Sabbath make more references but they aren't Christian Metal. What makes this band Christian Rock? In my opinion nothing. This band sings about reltionships and so should be considered some form of emo music rather than some form of christian music.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Much as I despised this argument when it was used against me in my argument to remove <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creed_%28band%29.html" title="Creed (band)">Creed</a> from the Christian rock category, the term has been defined at Wikipedia as <i>"a perceived connection to what [self-identified fans of CCM] regard as Christianity"</i>. This band is played consistently on Christian radio stations, tours with Christian artists, has Christian lyrics (most notably on the second album the entire song "Paperthin Hymn", I don't know how you managed to miss that in your search). Emo and Christian rock are not mutually exclusive categories; many emo bands are also christian rock bands, Anberlin included. There is absolutely no doubt that Anberlin falls into the loose (in my opinion, overly so, but even by a stricter definition, such as the band saying so themselves, which I think would be a much more logical minimum boundary) restraints we currently have on the definition. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKertrats_a151.html" title="User:Kertrats">Kertrats</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKertrats_10d0.html" title="User talk:Kertrats">Talk</a> 22:46, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm new here, so still have no idea how to use the boards or reply to the correct thread. I was the annonomous poster and now I'm replying. My problem isn't with this band being classed as a christian band the problem is more that there are other 'genre' labels that better fit this band. I'm sure they are happy to classify themselves as christian rock and get played on christian radio but the fact is if they weren't christians then they wouldn't simply be classifed as 'rock' but as 'melodic emo' or something to that effect. The same situation applies to the 'christian metal' band 'still remains'. Sure they are christian and metal but the fact is that says nothing about their music. I think in situations where bands are classified as christian as a genre it would be better to give them more than one genre. They belong in the christian genre because they're christian and belong in other genres because their music sounds that way. It's not a massive problem but if you asked a person to put each song into a genre then christian rock would certenly not be the most common.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You're right. There should have been a more specific label than "Christian Rock" there. I went with your melodic emo, but if somebody who knows more about the band's musical style then me has a better label for it go to it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7ESTAREYe_1906.html" title="User:STAREYe">STAREYe</a> 02:03, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The First Album contains alot more references to God such as in the song Cadence where the chorus to the song is<br /></p>
<center>"The Closer I come to you<br />
<p>The closer I am to finding God<br />
You're a miracle to me<br />
The closer I come to you<br />
the closer I am to finding God<br /></p>
You're a miracle to me"</center>
<p>Also again with another verse relating to St. Paul and Joan of Arc Newedge14 5:09, November 27 2006</p>
<p>Because saying the word "god" means you're religious. That means that any person who's ever screamed, "Oh my God!" at something is a devout Christian ready to be crucified. The Joan of Arc and St. Paul arguments are just as shallow. I can point out perhaps dozens of bands in the last 30 years that would never be pegged as a Christian Rock band, but have made numerous references to God, the bibles, and various other commonly religion affiliated items. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndigoAK200_999a.html" title="User:IndigoAK200">IndigoAK200</a> 08:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The thing that truly makes them a religious band other than songs that relate to God. Is the fact that they are all Christian, and that they all have stated that Anberlin is a Christian Rock band. Of course I wouldn't be able to cite this because it has been said in concerts. The whole references to God by other bands, yes every band can make references to God, its when they actually preach about God, or worship him in song does the band become Christian. The reference to Oh My God is extremely un-Christian as a true Christian band would never use the lords name in vain, in fact that is seen as a form of Anti-Christianity. -- <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a> 8:35, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, they have said it at concerts, however, being Wikipedia, and people being people, there's no real way to state it, and interviewers seemingly don't ask, as if they already know Anberlin is a Christian band, in common sense.<a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronCrow_efd6.html" title="User:IronCrow">IronCrow</a> 00:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anberlin fits in the Christian Rock genre. I think some people have been denying this as a fact because they don't want to believe that one of their favorite bands is considered "Christian", a term that can turn some people off. But it makes more sense to say that they are Christian rather than they aren't; they play at Christian concerts, their lyrics reflect a Christian way of thinking, their music is sold in Christian stores, you get the picture. Anberlin, unlike Switchfoot, has not officially proclaimed the band to be secular, either. They may be Christian rock, but that doesn't make them any less of band. Really, in my opinion, the term "Christian" shouldn't really be a genre of music at all, and the segregation is a bit disappointing, but since the genre exists anyway (there is a Wikipedia article on it), we might as well place Anberlin in that catagory. This is not to say that Anberlin does not fit in any other genre (alternative rock is still feasible), but Christian rock is a legit entry to their list of genres. You may not agree with Christianity, but I'm sorry, but I can't change Anberlin's faith. To be frank, they are Christian whether you approve of it or not.

<dd>Strayer, the second guitarist, left right before <i>Cities</i> released; Christian, formerly of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceptance_%28band%29.html" title="Acceptance (band)">Acceptance</a>, has replaced him. All the original members (Stephen, Joey, Deon, and Nate) are still in the band. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoofi%27s_Publicist_4c33.html" title="User:Roofi's Publicist">Roofi's Publicist</a> 19:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I thought, but I've heard other mixed reports. Thanks for the clear-up!&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELiscobeck_f89a.html" title="User:Liscobeck">Liscobeck</a> 05:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do we really need the entire headlining tour list? I think not so I am going to remove it. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidepolcycne_eerf_1280.html" title="User:Aidepolcycne eerf">Aidepolcycne eerf</a> 22:23, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article title says "anberlin," but everywhere else in the page, it's capitalized as "Anberlin." To date, all of their CDs have had a lowercase 'a', but is this due to stylization or is it how they actually prefer it to be spelled? D3PyroGS 16:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is just stylization. The Newsboys are another example of this; their logo usually has a lower-case "n", but everywhere else it is capitalized. Therefore, the article title has been changed to "Anberlin" and not "anberlin." <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELiscobeck_f89a.html" title="User:Liscobeck">Liscobeck</a> 23:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
