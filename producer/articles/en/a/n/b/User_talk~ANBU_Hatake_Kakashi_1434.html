<hr />
<p>I figured out the timeline issue:</p>
<p>Well we know that Link from OOT's past sealed Ganon away in the FUTURE. Once Link left the future the seal weakened, permitting GANON to break free. FUTURE</p>
<p>Link was not there after that he set off on a journey, he was unaware of this because not only was he gone, he was from the PAST, so he left Hyrule, not knowing that the FUTURE Hyrule was doomed, In Wind Waker, they said the hero showed himself once to banish Ganon, and then dissapeared. And after everyone prayed for the hero to rise once more, he did not appear. The reason for this was that Link was in the PAST and set off on a new journey, a friken weird one at that, so he was unable to communicate to his friends in Hyrule, Present or Future, he was in Termina and also a diffrent timeline makes it's way to surface. Since Ganon Ravaged the Future, it created the TImeline we currently have in Wind Waker, making this the Wind Waker timeline.</p>
<p>And since nothing happened back in the PAST, where Link set off on his journey to find Navi, This created The Twilight Princess ERA Timeline, meaning that only Ganon was introduced to the king, and his evil ambitions were only to surface, since our current from OOT left Hyrule, to find his small naked winged pixie this may have caused the Twilight Era.</p>
<p>Ganon's plans may have taken alot more time to surface, the sequence of the events are unknown but one thing I can say is everything has a side effect, something must had delayed Ganon's plans to take in Hyrule as his own, was that a good or a bad thing I don't know. What slowed him down a few decades?? Okay if this theory is true, why is the Ganon from Your thinking that Link TP is From The same era of Link OOT &lt; You have good reading skills, he is&#160;!!!&gt;</p>
<p>The Link from TP travels to The WW era well before WW era to resolve the issue there so it does not spread to The PAST where the Link from Tp currently resides.</p>
<p>Your asking why he could not save Hyrule? Think of this as a 50/50 sad ending where Zelda tells him to go Home and there is nothing he can do for her in the future, but the fate of his world, The OOT world from the past is safe, after this he returns home, and bids farewell to Zelda, and then with no other way left to save the future Hyrule, she calls upon the gods to help her, by doing so tehy sink it, then WW era truely starts.</p>
<p>--=But this Era seems alot like the timeline I was thinking of when possibly thinking of Ganon's "Hyrule Domination" Yeah correct again=-- So the Link In Twilight princess should be called OOT LINK # 2 , Because him and the one from ocarina of time share the same timeline, and it gets very confusing when I use TP Link because there is no such Link!!</p>
<p>Okay for those who don't want to read look here it explains the diffrent parallel worlds. 10 years 10 years The game starts here+</p>
<p>HyruleFuture=&gt;HyruleFuture=&gt;Twilight Era because the Hero never appeared because he was Born in this time and was brought to the DEKU tree in the past. Then since present Link could not stop the Twilight Destruction =&gt; Wind Waker era flooded Hyrule.</p>
<p>10 years 10 years The game starts here + OOTMM</p>
<p>HyrulePast=&gt; HyrulePast=&gt;HyrulePast begins to change a bit-----Link OOT#2 Could not stop the twilight in the future, but saved his current timeline, so meaning HyrulePast is saved. But not the future, leading to WW.</p>
<p>So that would solve some things and it's hinting that all we will see from Link WW timeline will be on DS. That is a good thing.</p>
<p>And in conclusion: I still don't know what in the hell happened to OOT Link #1&#160;!!!</p>
