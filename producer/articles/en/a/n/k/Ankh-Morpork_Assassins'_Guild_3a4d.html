<p>The Assassins' Guild was founded on 27 August AM1512 by Sir Gyles de Munforte as the <i>de Munforte School for Gentlemen Assassins</i>. Sir Gyles was a warrior knight who, during his crusades in <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klatch.html" title="Klatch">Klatch</a>, was intrigued by the Klatchian tradition of professional gentleman assassins, and decided to set up a similar organisation at home, only without the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashshashin.html" title="Hashshashin">drugs</a>.</p>
<p>In AM1576 the school was elevated to the status of a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild.html" title="Guild">Guild</a>. The name was changed to the <i>Royal Guild of Assassins</i>.</p>
<p>The 'Royal' was dropped after the 'events' of AM1688 (i.e. the <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a> Civil War).</p>
<p>In response to huge demand among the aristocracy for their children to receive the well-rounded education the Guild offered, the Guild's charter was expanded to include those intending to gain skills in proper Assassination. This new class of students were known as Oppidans, from the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Discworld_concepts_ca4b.html#Latatian" title="Minor Discworld concepts">Latatian</a> for <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townie.html#University_context" title="Townie">town</a>.</p>
<p>For most of its history the Assassins Guild School was a male-only establishment (although talented, self-taught women might become members of the Guild itself), however it has recently become co-educational. The Assassins' Guild is known for providing the best education in Ankh-Morpork. Most of the nobility in the city (and beyond) send their children there. Very few actually become assassins; many who attend do not learn valuable weapon skills, but are mainly there for the arts courses. Guild graduates can be expected to be at home in any company, and to be able to play at least one musical instrument. However, those who do not graduate are generally never seen again; as noted in <i><a href="../../../w/y/r/Wyrd_Sisters_b925.html" title="Wyrd Sisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></i>, the Guild is fond of competitive examination.</p>

<p>The <b>Bell Tower</b> houses the Inhumation Bell, which marks not only the hours (though fashionably late) but also the successful completion of an assassin's contract. It also tones to mark the passing of assassins (these can be the same thing). The Bell Tower is topped by <b>Wiggy Charlie</b>, a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weathervane.html" title="Weathervane">weathervane</a> in the shape of a cloaked man.</p>
<p>The <b>Cloister</b> houses the busts and portraits of famous victims of the guild's various graduates, along with the date of death and the name of the Assassin with whose "assistance" they passed off their respective mortal coils.</p>
<p>The <b>Museum</b> contains many noted tools and traps, such as rigged <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_bears.html" title="Teddy bears">teddy bears</a>, used in successful killings.</p>
<p>The <b>Library</b> is the largest in Ankh-Morpork outside that of the <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unseen_University_8e20.html" title="Unseen University">Unseen University</a>, though it probably surpasses the former in "relevant tomes."</p>

<p>Pratchett describes the Assassins' Guild in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_Discworld_122a.html" title="The Art of Discworld">The Art of Discworld</a></i> as a typical British public school with the knobs turned up to eleven. Like a British public school, it is divided into houses, often named for a deadly animal. The most oft-mentioned is Viper House, though Scorpion, Tree Frog, Raven and Cobra Houses have also been mentioned. Many houses appear to have been named after benefactors, such as Mrs. Beddowes or Wigblock Prior. Initially a purely male institution, it has recognised the value of female students and has opened Black Widow House for girls.</p>
<p>When an assassin reaches the end of his final year, he must undertake a "final exam" known as 'The Run', which consists of a run through an obstacle course at night in Ankh-Morpork and the targeted killing of a single individual. To prepare for this, the Guild encourages particularly competitive forms of recreation; in particular the "Wall Game" (far more sadistic than the more famous <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_wall_game.html" title="Eton wall game">Eton wall game</a>, it is essentially an extreme hybrid of <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock-climbing.html" title="Rock-climbing">rock-climbing</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodgeball.html" title="Dodgeball">dodgeball</a>), and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stealth_Chess_515d.html" title="Stealth Chess">Stealth Chess</a>. Furthermore, a school sport is edificeering--the climbing of buildings, often done on unusual/notable buildings in the city itself. School houses have their own teams, and the teams compete against one another.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_Assassins%27_Guild_3a4d.html" title="Edit section: Code of Conduct">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Code of Conduct</span></h2>
<p>The Assassins' Guild has a strict code of conduct. It is considered absolutely unforgivable for an Assassin to kill (or as they refer to it, "inhume") for any reason other than being paid to do so. Of course, to distinguish themselves from common <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitmen.html" title="Hitmen">hitmen</a>, the assassins' code also demands that they be paid a <i>very large amount</i> to do so. After an inhumation they must by law always leave a receipt. They must also give the client (they view the victim as the client) a sporting chance. With this in mind the Guild strongly disapproves of firearms (which are, in any case, extremely uncommon on the Disc), and also of most (but not all) other mechanical or chemical weapons.</p>
<p>It is accepted that an Assassin may find it necessary to inhume bodyguards, including other Assassins, while on a commission. However, if these can be incapacitated <i>without</i> being killed, it is considered good manners to do so.</p>
<p>In very rare cases, usually of personal offence, the head of the Assassins' Guild may stretch some of those rules, if only to make a statement. This is known as "Inhumation with <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_prejudice.html" title="Extreme prejudice">extreme impoliteness</a>." It is also the case that the rules may be relaxed if the Assassin is "outside civilisation" (the <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwald</a> area is considered outside civilisation, as are the more remote areas of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_%28world%29.html#Klatch" title="Discworld (world)">Klatch</a>. The Assassins have not, as yet, been known to operate in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_geography.html#Counterweight_Continent" title="Discworld geography">Counterweight Continent</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_geography.html#Fourecks" title="Discworld geography">FourEcks</a>).</p>
<p>An Assassin must always act with style. Without style, he's just an expensive thug. They must always dress stylishly in black (which, although not the best colour for being unseen at night, is the correct colour for being an Assassin) and must always seem vaguely bored and, if possible, slightly foreign.</p>
<p>The rules of Assassination are so utterly formalised and strict that anyone with a strategic mind, a decent budget, and a firm knowledge of their code can usually avoid death at their hands, as <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Vimes_02a2.html" title="Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> has proved many times.</p>

<p>The current head of the Assassins' Guild. He succeeded Dr. Cruces after his death; before that he was his deputy. He is a kindly looking, distinguished old gentleman with white hair, eminently professional and seemingly unflappable. Certain evidence suggests, however, that he was not always quite as intelligent or in-control as he is now. He was at school with Havelock Vetinari, where he was a bully and something of an imbecile, with a propensity for calling everyone scags, including Vetinari, whom he also referred to as dog-botherer. Thirty years' passage seems to have improved him.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Lord Downey's preferred method of inhumation is poisoning, though no deaths have yet to be attributed to him. Pratchett suggests this is probably due to the fact that he is very good at his job. His special recipe for <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humbug.html" title="Humbug">humbugs</a>, submitted to <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanny_Ogg_3e07.html" title="Nanny Ogg">Nanny Ogg</a>, calls for "arsenic to taste", though, since arsenic is actually very traceable, this is likely a slight bit of misinformation on his part. One current tradition he maintains is inviting certain students to his office for sherry and an <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almond.html#Sweet_and_bitter_almonds" title="Almond">almond slice</a>. Given the nature of most Assassins' Guild traditions, this could be seen as a kind of impromptu "pass or fail" examination.</p>
<p>Lord Downey first appears in <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_at_Arms_1b2e.html" title="Men at Arms">Men at Arms</a></i>, makes his first appearance as Guildmaster in <i><a href="../../../f/e/e/Feet_of_Clay_7598.html" title="Feet of Clay">Feet of Clay</a></i>, and appears again in <i><a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogfather.html" title="Hogfather">Hogfather</a></i>.

<p>A <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klatch.html" title="Klatch">Klatchian</a> warrior who accompanies the Klatchian envoy Prince Khufurah on a diplomatic journey to Ankh-Morpork in the novel <i><a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingo_%28novel%29.html" title="Jingo (novel)">Jingo</a></i>. He speaks with a heavy accent and has a penchant for chewing on cloves. Following an attempt on the prince's life by an unknown assassin, he is suspected of killing the Watch's prime suspect, provoking Vimes and other Watch members to pursue him back to Klatch (Particularly after he captures Angua in werewolf form).</p>
<p>Apart from belonging to a vicious but honorable warrior clan known as the <a href="../../../d/27/r/D%27reg.html" title="D'reg">D'regs</a>, he is later revealed to be a Klatchian equivalent of a watchman on par with Vimes. It also turns out his obsessive clove-chewing and broken Morporkian are in fact a disguise meant to delude foreigners into falsely assuming he is nothing but an uncivilized barbarian. Like many privileged foreigners, he was sent to the Assassin's Guild as a child on the assumption that he would get an excellent education. He confounds Vimes by his fond memories of Ankh-Morpork, and even <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cut-Me-Own-Throat_Dibbler_0da0.html" title="Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler">Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler</a>. He and Vimes eventually develop a wary respect for each other, mostly based on both of them being basically-honest cops in unenviable positions.</p>
<p>He got his nickname after killing a man (guilty of poisoning a well, and killing a number of villagers and very valuable camels) one hour before the traditional D'reg three days of hospitality, during which even your greatest enemy should be shown respect, would have run out.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Jonathan Teatime</b> appears in <i><a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogfather.html" title="Hogfather">Hogfather</a></i>. His last name is actually pronounced "Teh-ah-tim-eh."</p>
<p>He was taken into the Guild as a child because the administration took pity on him after he lost his parents at a young age. It is never specified what happened to young Jonathan's parents; it is, however, implied that what happened to them was young Jonathan.</p>
<p>He is boyishly handsome, with curly hair and a ready smile, but these features are ruined by his eyes. One is <a href="../../../o/c/u/Ocular_prosthetic.html" title="Ocular prosthetic">glass</a> and the other is off-white, with a tiny, pinhole-sized pupil. He is, undoubtedly, a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a>, but also <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociopathic.html" title="Sociopathic">sociopathic</a> to an astonishing degree. His mind has been compared at times to both a corkscrew and a shattered mirror (i.e. something brilliant, sharp, and dazzling, but also fundamentally and irrevocably broken). His main problem seems to be that he 'sees things differently from other people, in that he sees other people as things'. This gets him into a spot of trouble early on, as his assassinations often include the brutal murders of not just the target, but also their family, their servants, and very often their pets, all of which is a direct violation of Guild protocol.</p>
<p>However, when the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditors_of_Reality_8c2f.html" title="Auditors of Reality">Auditors of Reality</a> need someone to assassinate the Hogfather, Mr. Teatime is just the man for the job. When questioned, he reveals to his superior, Lord Downey, that he often used to lie awake in bed at night and think of ways to kill, not only the Hogfather, but also the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tooth_Fairy_f820.html" title="Tooth Fairy">Tooth Fairy</a> and the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Cake_Tuesday_Duck_a4c9.html" title="Soul Cake Tuesday Duck">Soul Cake Tuesday Duck</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_%28world%29.html" title="Discworld (world)">Discworld</a>'s version of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Bunny_43a3.html" title="Easter Bunny">Easter Bunny</a>), among others (including <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Discworld%29_41df.html" title="Death (Discworld)">Death</a>...). He commissions the help of a cadre of lowlifes, ranging from big Banjo Lilywhite to the locksmith Mr. Brown, and sets about putting his ingenious plan into action, which inevitably pits him against <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Sto_Helit_507e.html" title="Susan Sto Helit">Susan Sto Helit</a> and her grandfather, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Discworld%29_41df.html" title="Death (Discworld)">Death</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, Mr. Teatime seems a pleasant, albeit odd young man. He only seems to get irritated when people mispronounce his name. However, he possesses physical abilities which defy <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, and has been known to perform feats such as stabbing through all layers of clothing but stopping before hitting flesh, doing the same thing but with eyelids instead of clothing and eyes instead of flesh, flipping on thin air, and killing so fast he appears to be a blur, all of which he will do without any notice or provocation. Rumours among his associates (somewhat confirmed in the non-canonical <i><a href="../../../g/u/r/GURPS_Discworld_31cb.html" title="GURPS Discworld">GURPS Discworld</a></i> sourcebook) imply that the glass eye is in fact a scrying crystal, which might go some way towards explaining his abilities but also means that he implanted notoriously erratic Discworld <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_%28world%29.html#Magic" title="Discworld (world)">magic</a> <i>into his own eye-socket</i>.</p>
<p>The Assassins' Guild lists him as having vanished without trace since the events in <i>Hogfather</i>, though they have named a "Teatime Prize" in his honour, which is given annually to the student who devises the most creative, but technically accurate, hypothetical inhumation, preferably complete with maps and a proposed route that avoids or disables any guards.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_One_1b6b.html" title="Sky One">Sky One</a> adaptation of <i><a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogfather_%28TV_series%29_906f.html" title="Hogfather (TV series)">Hogfather</a></i>, Mr. Teatime is played by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Warren_3705.html" title="Marc Warren">Marc Warren</a>. Warren plays Teatime with a soft American accent, partly based on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Depp_9e6a.html" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a>'s version of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Wonka_9737.html" title="Willy Wonka">Willy Wonka</a> (another unpredictable and "childlike" character). His homicidal character is shown through the way he interacts with his victims, for example, Teatime has just entered a heavily locked door, upon entering he sees a cowering guard, he tells the guard "I am your worst nightmare" the guard stop's to consider, then asks "Is it the one with the big whirring thing and the teeth..." upon which Teatime replies softly "Sorry not that one. I'm the one where this stranger comes out of nowhere, and kills you" Teatime then proceeds to stab the guard, along with a dry remark.</p>
<p>Mr. Teatime is very popular within the Pratchett fandom. This is most likely due to his interesting personality, and he is usually paired with Susan in fanfiction.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Note: "Officially unlisted" means that, while the Guild has priced these people as "clients", it now refuses to accept contracts on them, on the grounds that their deaths would destabilise the city, endangering the Guild itself. Lord Vetinari and Samuel Vimes are, as of the events in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Watch_%28novel%29_3acc.html" title="Night Watch (novel)">Night Watch</a>, the only people currently unlisted. In the case of Vimes there is some thought that he was actually removed since he's far too hard to kill and the Guild was fed up of its members coming back hurt, beaten up, humiliated, or on foot after walking from a remote region. Vimes is considering appealing the ruling.</p>
