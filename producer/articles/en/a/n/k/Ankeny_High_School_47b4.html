	    <p><b>Ankeny High School</b> is a high school located in a medium sized suburban town <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankeny%2C_Iowa_d347.html" title="Ankeny, Iowa">Ankeny, Iowa</a>.</p>
<p>The school mascots are the Hawks (Men) and the Hawkettes (Women). Ankeny is part of the Central Iowa Metro League or CIML. They are extremely competitive in the state with all their sports and musical activities. It is well-known for its musical program.</p>
<p>The school serves 1,487 students, and has 92 teachers. The number is growing each year. The school is now faced with the problem of overcrowding and whether or not to expand to two high schools.</p>

<p>Ankeny girls athletics rose in prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s under Coach Dick Rasmussen, and his work with the basketball and softball programs. Star athletes Karlin Hayes, and sisters Mary and Connie Yori, were among a group that led Ankeny to two state basketball titles, six softball titles, and a state track title in just four years, 1978-1981.</p>
<p>Karlin Hayes became the first athlete ever to be first team all-state in softball all four years (and at three differing positions), and later Connie Yori became the second. Karlin is the only athlete to be captain of the all-tournament softball team more than once. She was named four times. Her speed and throwing skills allowed her to defend the outfield in an unparalleled way. Karlin Hayes reached base in every game but four played in a 250+ game career, and much was made of the near inability to strike her out. Opposing nationally-renowned, 1000+ win, and decorated coach Larry Niemeyer of Cedar Rapids Jefferson High, has called her softball's all-time best. Karlin Hayes set an all-time Iowa record in the long jump (19' 3 1/2") her sophomore year that lasted over 15 years. She anchored several state title relays, and was always a threat in the long individual hurdle races. She was inducted to both the Iowa State Softball and Track Halls of Fame. Karlin was a starting forward on Ankeny's winning 1980 basketball squad, and the runner-up in 1981. Karlin went on to play basketball and softball at Drake University. Many observers still see this 5' 6" girl from Central Iowa as the greatest all-around female athlete in the state's history.</p>
<p>Mary Yori, like Karlin, particpated in softball, basketball, and track. Her athleticism helped transform the traditional six-player basketball game. A power hitter, as well as superb shortshop, she was inducted to the Iowa State Softball Hall of Fame. Post high school, Mary was a stellar performer in softball at Creighton University, and post-college she remained in Nebraska to make the University of Nebraska-Omaha a national softball force. Her winning coaching record there is one of the highest in NCAA history. Since 2000, she has been building the softball program at Colorado State Univeristy.</p>
<p>Connie Yori benefited from Ankeny's earlier exposure and titles, and her sister's good last name, to make her own name one remembered most-fondly. Her lithe basketball frame, amid playing still the six-player half-court game, allowed Connie to weave magic on the basketball court. While others (Jan Jensen, Denise Long, Lynne Lorenzen) may have scored more points individually in games and in their career in Iowa, Connie was the first to cause observers (albeit sounding sexist) to compliment her with phrases like "she plays like a boy." Recent radio/newspaper polls still cite her, twenty-five years later, as the all-time favorite Iowa High School basketball player. Connie replaced her outstanding older sister at shortshop as a freshman, where she excelled as well. While she may not have been the power hitter her older sister was, she was a most imposing presence on the infield, and always a threat at bat. Connie used her throwing skills on the track team, and won three state softball throwing titles. She was inducted to the Iowa State Basketball and Softball Halls of Fame. Connie played college basketball at Creighton University where later she became head coach. In 2004, she accepted the position of head basketball coach at the Univesity of Nebraska in Lincoln.</p>
<p>The girls basketball team holds the record for the most consecutive state titles<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. They won the state championship in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, and hold the record for the most state titles by a school in Iowa history. Nicki Wieben, now playing at Iowa State, was a star player all four years under Coach Scott DeJong.</p>
<p>Ankeny also has a very successful football team, coached by Head Coach Jerry Pezzetti. Pezzetti has coached over 300 wins in his 40+ year career there including a state championship in 1997.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
