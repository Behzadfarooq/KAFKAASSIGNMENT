<p>Sergeant <b>Cheery Littlebottom</b> is a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic.html" title="Forensic">forensic</a> <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">alchemist</a> for the City Watch and one of the first <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarfs_%28Discworld%29_2239.html" title="Dwarfs (Discworld)">dwarfs</a> to be openly female, changing her name to Cheri. Her name translates in Dwarfish as <i>Sh'rt'azs</i> ('shortarse'). Her family lives in <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwald</a>, except for her late brother Snorey who died in a gas explosion somewhere under <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borogravia.html" title="Borogravia">Borogravia</a>. She is introduced in <i><a href="../../../f/e/e/Feet_of_Clay_7598.html" title="Feet of Clay">Feet of Clay</a></i> and appears in all subsequent Watch novels, most notably <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fifth_Elephant_041e.html" title="The Fifth Elephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></i>. A <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> features her (<a href="http://www.cheerycomic.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.cheerycomic.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">The Adventures of Cheery Littlebottom</a>).

<p><b>Reginald Shoe</b> (usually Reg Shoe) is a <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead_%28Discworld%29_da4d.html#Zombies" title="Undead (Discworld)">zombie</a>, and a Constable in the Night Watch. He was introduced in <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Reaper_Man_cce5.html" title="Reaper Man">Reaper Man</a></i> and joined the Watch in <i><a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingo_%28novel%29.html" title="Jingo (novel)">Jingo</a></i>. He died in the Ankh-Morpork Revolution that took place during now-<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Vimes_5e83.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Commander Vimes'</a> first days on the Watch force, some thirty years before the present. (Details in <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Watch_%28novel%29_3acc.html" title="Night Watch (novel)">Night Watch</a></i>.) Reg died from several <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> bolts to the chest, although it took him some time to realise this. Afterwards he became strongly interested in his own "Dead Rights" movement, spending the years between then and now on creating his "Fresh Start Club", preaching to the cemeteries of the city on how maltreated dead people are, and taking a job as an <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undertaker.html" title="Undertaker">undertaker</a> merely so that he can leave flyers for the Fresh Start Club on the inside of the <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffin.html" title="Coffin">coffins</a>.</p>
<p>Reg was hired on to the force by Carrot Ironfoundersson, on the basis that if the authorities maltreated the dead, they needed some more expertise. Since then, the number of complaints doubled - all against Mr. Shoe, who claims it is all because of a lack of understanding of the demands of policing in a multi-vital society. While he spends most of his time outside it, Reg has a grave in the Small Gods cemetery next to the other important casualties in the revolution.</p>

<p><b>Visit-the-Infidel-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets</b> (sometimes referred to as Visit-the-Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets) is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constable.html" title="Constable">Constable</a> of the City Watch. He is generally just called 'Constable Visit', or occasionally, for unspecified reasons, 'Washpot'. He first appeared in <i>Feet of Clay</i>. He is referred to by Pratchett as follows: "There's one in every station, and Constable Visit was enough for two"</p>
<p>He is an <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnian.html" title="Omnian">Omnian</a> of a gentle but determined <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytising.html" title="Proselytising">proselytising</a> nature.

In off-duty moments he goes door to door with his fellow Omnian, Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments. His name is, apparently, shorter in Omnian. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Vimes_5e83.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Samuel Vimes</a> says he is a good copper, his highest form of personal praise. Entire pubs have been known to draw the curtains, turn off the lights and lie on the floor whimpering at news of his coming down the street.</p>

<p>Lance-Constable <b>Salacia "Sally" von Humpeding</b> is a Lance-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Constable.html" title="Constable">Constable</a> in the City Watch and the first <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead_%28Discworld%29_da4d.html" title="Undead (Discworld)">vampire</a> to join up. Originally from <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwald</a>, she travelled to <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a> to join the city watch there. This coincided with the request by Lord <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havelock_Vetinari_85f2.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Vetinari</a> and the Ankh-Morpork Mission of the Überwald League of Temperance to Commander Sir <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Vimes_5e83.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Samuel Vimes</a> to accept a vampire constable.</p>
<p>"Sally" was greeted with some suspicion by Commander Vimes and deep dislike by Sergeant <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angua.html" title="Angua">Angua</a>, who as an <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwaldian</a> <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead_%28Discworld%29_da4d.html" title="Undead (Discworld)">werewolf</a> felt that bad blood was involved. Her abilities as a vampire become of great use to the Watch, and she even manages to reach an understanding with Sergeant Angua. "Sally" von Humpeding is introduced in <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thud%21.html" title="Thud!">Thud!</a></i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_City_Watch_members_a357.html" title="Edit section: Lance-Constable A.E. Pessimal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lance-Constable A.E. Pessimal</span></h3>
<p><b>A.E. Pessimal</b> was first a government inspector assigned (in <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thud%21.html" title="Thud!">Thud!</a></i>) to inspect the Watch and judge whether the Watch gave fair value for the civic funds it used. He is described as a neat little man, with very shiny shoes, and has no friends and no sense of humor. He does not have a first name, as others would understand; he was 'initialled' at birth rather than named. He was in a position to seriously inconvenience Vimes with difficult questions such as "Why is C.W.St.J. 'Nobby' Nobbs in the Watch? Are you aware you employ a petty criminal?"</p>
<p>Eventually, Vimes decided to shake the man up, and swore him in as a Special Constable for the duration of an impending street fight of roughly a thousand trolls and dwarfs. Vimes thought he could scare the man while showing him what it was like to be a copper. Instead, A.E. took his position seriously, to the point of bare-handedly attacking a troll who took a swing at Vimes.</p>
<p>A short while later, A.E. came to Vimes' office and was offered the position of Lance-Constable and adjutant, with an estimate that he could be a Sergeant in a year. Vimes' reason for taking A.E. on was A.E.'s patience and intelligence; Vimes needed someone who could look through paperwork and understand what was being said. As a condition of his employment, A.E. was told that he would go on patrol twice a week, so he would be able to learn what's important.</p>
<p>A.E. could be based on <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant-General_9c10.html" title="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Ernest_Percival_0380.html" title="Arthur Ernest Percival">Arthur Ernest Percival</a>, or A.E.

<p>A <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golems_%28Discworld%29_3671.html" title="Golems (Discworld)">golem</a>, <b>Dorfl</b> joined the Watch during the events of <i><a href="../../../f/e/e/Feet_of_Clay_7598.html" title="Feet of Clay">Feet of Clay</a></i>, at which time he was set free by Captain Carrot, sustained considerable damage fighting the golem king, and was rebuilt to a considerable degree, granting him a voice (which is considered blasphemous for golems to possess). Dorfl quickly became the Disc's first <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceramic.html" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheist</a>, to the displeasure of at least one god, and has been issued an official chit to label him "alive" to avoid interference in this state of affairs. He will believe in any god whose existence can be proved by rational argument. A thunderbolt to the head is deemed wholly unconvincing (in Dorfl's own words, "I Don't Call That Much Of An Argument.") He is the apparent founder of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golems_%28Discworld%29_3671.html" title="Golems (Discworld)">Golem Trust</a>, although this is never conclusively stated. Dorfl speaks 'With The Beginning Of Every Word Being Capitalized', and like most golems he is quite literal in his choice of words. Some of his lines take a considerable amount of inspiration from <a href="../../../r/o/b/RoboCop_feae.html" title="RoboCop">RoboCop</a>, such as his description of his own duties: "To Serve The Public Trust, Protect The Innocent And Seriously Prod Buttock".</p>

<p><b>Igor</b> is an <a href="../../../i/g/o/Igor_%28Discworld%29_0027.html" title="Igor (Discworld)">Igor</a> who was considered "too modern" for <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwald</a> by his family, and went with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Vimes_5e83.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Samuel Vimes</a> to <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a>. He specialises in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">genetic</a> experiments ("bio-artificing"), which, on the Discworld, involves really small stitches. His creations include a pet rabbit called Eerie, a particularly suitable name as he grows spare human ears on it. Another early experiment was breeding noses, which act as independent lifeforms until sewn on. He also experimented with swimming potatoes in the hopes of breeding Fish &amp; Chips.</p>
<p>He has a speech impediment (for an Igor, anyway) in that he sometimes forgets to lisp. Vimes employs him because of his surgery methods, which Vimes considered to be considerably more advanced than most of Ankh-Morpork's doctors, in that most of his patients survive, and he doesn't use hot tar.</p>

Being a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28Discworld%29_bfe9.html#Other_kinds_of_troll" title="Troll (Discworld)">gargoyle</a>, he is capable of remaining motionless in one spot and watching for days at a time, a "world champion at not moving" as Vimes once put it. He has no use for money and instead receives his salary in <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigeons.html" title="Pigeons">pigeons</a>, which he considers quite tasty.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnomes_%28Discworld%29_3226.html" title="Gnomes (Discworld)">gnome</a>. Introduced in <i><a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingo.html" title="Jingo">Jingo</a></i> (possibly in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Light_Fantastic_0ebf.html" title="The Light Fantastic">The Light Fantastic</a></i>; there was a gnome identified only as Swires), Buggy possesses the hard-nosed, bellicose personality typical of his species, proving able to shout down uncooperative witnesses despite being only six inches tall. He has since established himself as the sole member of the Watch's Airborne Section through his ability to tame various species of bird (most recently a <a href="../../../b/u/z/Buzzard.html" title="Buzzard">buzzard</a>) to act as aerial reconnaissance. He may be of the same race as (though probably of a different tribe than) the <a href="../../../n/a/c/Nac_Mac_Feegle_ff4c.html" title="Nac Mac Feegle">Nac Mac Feegle</a>. He appears to have the same strength as a normally sized human, compressed into a gnome's body; as a result, being headbutted by Buggy is like 'being hit with a steam-powered toffee hammer.'</p>
