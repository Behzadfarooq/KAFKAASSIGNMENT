<p><b>Ankh-Morpork</b> is a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fictional</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/City-state.html" title="City-state">city-state</a> which prominently features in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Pratchett_8474.html" title="Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld.html" title="Discworld">Discworld</a></i> series of fantasy novels. As cities go, it is on the far side of corrupt and polluted, and is subject to outbreaks of comedic violence and brou-ha-ha on a fairly regular basis. It is home to the <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unseen_University_8e20.html" title="Unseen University">Unseen University</a>, a centre of magical learning.</p>
<p>Ankh-Morpork is also the mercantile capital of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_%28world%29.html" title="Discworld (world)">Discworld</a>, and the books give an excellent flavour of a "working" quasi-medieval city. Even when it is under attack from a <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_dragon.html" title="European dragon">dragon</a>, the vegetable carts still have to come in.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_Discworld_122a.html" title="The Art of Discworld">The Art of Discworld</a></i> Pratchett explains that the city is similar to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallinn.html" title="Tallinn">Tallinn</a> and central <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a>, but adds that it has elements of 18th century <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, 19th century <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a> and modern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. He also states that since the creation of <i>The Streets of Ankh-Morpork</i>, he has tried to ensure that the descriptions of character movements and locations in the books match the Ankh-Morpork map; this has allowed him, and fans of the series, to visualise the story more clearly. Ankh-Morpork is also referred to as "The Great [or Big] <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Discworld_concepts_ca4b.html#Wahoonie" title="Minor Discworld concepts">Wahoonie</a>" on occasions, further increasing the bond with "The Big Apple", New York.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Edit section: Geography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
<p>Ankh-Morpork lies on the River Ankh (the most polluted waterway on the Discworld and reputedly solid enough to walk on), where the fertile loam of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Sto_Plains_875d.html" title="Sto Plains">Sto Plains</a> (similar to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>) meets the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_Sea_8b03.html" title="Circle Sea">Circle Sea</a> (the Discworld's version of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a>). This, naturally, puts it in an excellent trading position.</p>
<p>Lying approximately equidistant from the cold Hub and tropical Rim, Ankh-Morpork is in the Discworld's equivalent of the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temperate.html" title="Temperate">temperate</a> zone.</p>
<p>The name "Ankh-Morpork" refers to both the city itself, a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_wall.html" title="Defensive wall">walled city</a> about a mile (1.6 km) across, and the surrounding suburbs and farms of its <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiefdom.html" title="Fiefdom">fiefdom</a>.</p>
<p>The central city divides more or less into Ankh (the posh part) and Morpork (the humble part, which includes the slum area known as "the Shades"), which are separated by the River Ankh.</p>
<p>Ankh-Morpork is built on black loam, broadly, but mostly what it is built on is more Ankh-Morpork. Because of the nature of the Ankh-Morpork citizenry and the flooding of the River Ankh, they figured it was simply easier to build on top of the existing buildings when the sediment grew too high, rather than excavate them out. This has resulted in two things: First, many people own basements and have no idea they do. Second, there is a "cave network" below Ankh-Morpork made up of old streets and abandoned sewers – these "unknown basements" allow people to get around relatively unimpeded. The city's <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf.html" title="Dwarf">dwarf</a> population have extended this into a complex network of tunnels, which has recently been made <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal.html" title="Municipal">municipal</a> property.</p>
<p>Ankh-Morpork is also the city with most dwarfs on the whole disc and has over 50 000 dwarfs living there (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Truth_%28novel%29_bbf7.html" title="The Truth (novel)">The Truth</a></i>).</p>
<p><a name="The_River_Ankh" id="The_River_Ankh"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Edit section: The River Ankh">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The River Ankh</span></h3>
<p>Even before it enters Ankh-Morpork, the River Ankh is full of <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silt.html" title="Silt">silt</a> from the plains; by the time it gets to the seaward side of the city, "even an <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a> could walk across it" (although in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Truth_%28novel%29_bbf7.html" title="The Truth (novel)">The Truth</a></i>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_characters.html#Arnold_Sideways" title="Discworld characters">Arnold Sideways</a> plays it safe by distributing his weight over boards).</p>
<p>The citizens of the city are strangely proud of this fact, even going so far as to say that "it is easier to suffocate than drown in the Ankh." They also claim it to be the purest water on the Disc, as "Anything that's passed through so many kidneys has to be very pure indeed." Owing to the build-up of centuries, the bed of the river is higher than some parts of the city. When winter snows swell the flow, the low-rent areas of Morpork flood. In spring some parts of the river catch fire, others sprout small trees and also the spray of the Ankh turns into a shade of green. Wading birds are apparently uncommon, as their legs would be eaten away by the pollution. Such fish as are known to exist are described as looking like vacuum cleaners, and explode when brought to the surface. There are a lot of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microorganisms.html" title="Microorganisms">microorganisms</a> living in the river, which <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustrum_Ridcully_2dcc.html" title="Mustrum Ridcully">Mustrum Ridcully</a> believed was proof that the water was safe to drink - as anything capable of supporting that much life had to be healthy.</p>
<p>Although some cities have been invaded by barbarians approaching by river, there is small danger of this with the Ankh, since any invasion fleet would have to be preceded by a gang of men wielding shovels. If this does happen, there is a magic horn in the Patrician's Palace which is said to blow itself.</p>
<p>In the times when the city catches fire, the river gates are closed, and the river rises and smothers the flames. This also has an unfortunate side effect of destroying any remaining buildings that the fire missed.</p>
<p>In both <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_At_Arms_efc8.html" title="Men At Arms">Men At Arms</a></i> and the computer game <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_Noir_5fc1.html" title="Discworld Noir">Discworld Noir</a></i>, the Ankh is described as "the only river in the world on which you could draw a chalk outline".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>According to legend, the first city of Ankh-Morpork was founded thousands of years ago by twin brothers who were raised by a <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippopotamus.html" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> (an allusion to the myth of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulus_and_Remus_a434.html" title="Romulus and Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>, albeit with a hippo replacing the original wolf). It is in memory of this that the hippo is the royal animal of Ankh. One legend has it that if danger ever threatens the city, the eight stone hippopotami guarding the Brass Bridge will come to life and run away. Another legend claims that many centuries ago, the Disc flooded. <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">An ark was constructed</a>, containing two of every animal. When the accumulated dung of forty days and nights was dropped over the side, they called it Ankh-Morpork.</p>
<p>The original city was little more than a walled keep, surrounding the <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unseen_University_8e20.html#Tower_of_Art" title="Unseen University">Tower of Art</a>, a building of mysterious origin which may even predate the Disc itself.</p>
<p>At one point it had an empire, similar to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, that covered half the continent including the neighbouring country of <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klatch.html" title="Klatch">Klatch</a>. These were the days of the "Pax Morporkia," another reference to Rome and their <a href="../../../p/a/x/Pax_Romana_8c5c.html" title="Pax Romana">Pax Romana</a>.</p>
<p>The empire was largely the creation of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Tacticus_b69c.html" title="General Tacticus">General Tacticus</a> (an obvious <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pun.html" title="Pun">pun</a> or <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_play.html" title="Word play">play on words</a>, and a reference to <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>), the greatest military mind in history. Tacticus refused to accept that the Empire was growing too big to control, and was finally shipped off to be king of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genua.html" title="Genua">Genua</a>. As king he decided that the greatest threat to Genua was the Empire, and <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_war.html" title="Declaration of war">declared war</a> on it (a probable reference to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden_0ed7.html" title="Charles XIV John of Sweden">Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte</a>, who served under the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_I_of_France_e789.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Emperor Napoleon</a> but later, as King of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, allied with France's enemies).</p>
<p>This was a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_6ed8.html" title="Golden Age">Golden Age</a>, ruled by the Kings of Ankh, who are recalled in legend as wise, noble and fair. The line died out approximately 2000 years before the present, giving way to real kings who were realistically corrupt and peverse and ultimately leading to the collapse of the empire.</p>
<p>Shortly before this, however, the mage <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_%28Discworld%29_de68.html" title="Albert (Discworld)">Alberto Malich</a> had founded <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unseen_University_8e20.html" title="Unseen University">Unseen University</a> (UU) in the Tower of Art, and Ankh-Morpork continued as a service town for the wizards.</p>
<p>Royalty became extremely debased and the later kings of Ankh-Morpork are recalled in history as power-mad and corrupt, or just mad; some are mentioned by name in <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_at_Arms_1b2e.html" title="Men at Arms">Men at Arms</a></i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen Alguinna IV</li>
<li>King Artorollo (a contemporary of Alberto Malich)</li>
<li>King Cirone IV</li>
<li>Queen Coanna</li>
<li>King Loyala the Aaargh (Had a 1.13 second rule from coronation to assassination) - <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Discworld_Companion_e586.html" title="The Discworld Companion">The Discworld Companion</a></i></li>
<li>King Ludwig the Tree (Known to issue royal proclamations on the need to develop a new type of frog and similar important matters, and also responsible for the city motto "Quanti Canicula Ille In Fenestra") - <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Discworld_Companion_e586.html" title="The Discworld Companion">The Discworld Companion</a></i></li>
<li>King Paragore</li>
<li>King Tyrril (ruled circa AM 907)</li>
<li>King Veltrick III</li>
<li>Webblethorpe the Unconscious</li>
</ul>
<p>The last and worst - the euphemistically-remembered Lorenzo the Kind (the full extent of whose infamy is not revealed, save that he was said to be "<a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">very fond of children</a>" and had in his dungeons "machines for . . .") - was overthrown in the Ankh-Morpork Civil War of 1688 (dating from the founding of UU). The question of what to do with the deposed king (no judge would try him) was settled when he was executed by the then Commander of the City Watch, Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes. Known as "Old Stoneface," his regicide resulted in his being banned from bearing arms (These events parallel the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> of the <a href="../../../1/6/4/1640s.html" title="1640s">1640s</a>, and the execution of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> by <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>). Afterwards "Old Stoneface" (an ancestor of the current City Watch Commander <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Vimes_5e83.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Samuel Vimes</a>) and his Ironheads (a play on "<a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundheads.html" title="Roundheads">Roundheads</a>") attempted to introduce <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, but the people voted against it. After "Old Stoneface" himself was overthrown, Ankh-Morpork reverted to a non-hereditary <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oligarchy.html" title="Oligarchy">oligarchic</a> system, where the leaders are still ruthless tyrants, but don't have the audacity to invoke divine right. It is, however, rumoured that the royal blood line of the Kings of Ankh has not in fact died out but instead continued, and that the true king, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrot_Ironfoundersson_5fbc.html" title="Carrot Ironfoundersson">Carrot Ironfoundersson</a>, walks the streets of the city on a nightly basis. The <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havelock_Vetinari_85f2.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Patrician</a> rules the city, and operates a specialised form of "One Man, One Vote" democracy: the Patrician is the Man, and he has the Vote.</p>
<p>Under the Patricians the city has become the mercantile and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_capital.html" title="Political capital">political capital</a> of the Discworld, so much so that the Sto Plains operates under a new Pax Morporkia, which operates not on the principle of "If you fight, we will kill you," but on the principle of "If you fight, we will call in your mortgages." The current Patrician has opened the city to <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarfs_%28Discworld%29_2239.html" title="Dwarfs (Discworld)">dwarfs</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolls_%28Discworld%29_6242.html" title="Trolls (Discworld)">trolls</a>, <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnomes_%28Discworld%29_3226.html" title="Gnomes (Discworld)">gnomes</a>, humans from across the Disc and even the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead_%28Discworld%29_da4d.html" title="Undead (Discworld)">undead</a>, making a truly <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiculturalism.html" title="Multiculturalism">multicultural</a> society, with both the advantages and problems that suggests. Mimes are strictly forbidden. (The current Patrician's own, typically pragmatic, view on multiculturalism is "<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloys.html" title="Alloys">Alloys</a> are stronger.")</p>
<p>Civic symbols include Morporkia, a woman in a cabbage-spangled cloak and an old-fashioned helmet, carrying a shield with the civic <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">coat of arms</a> and a toasting-fork symbolising "something or other" (compare <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Columbia_26b5.html" title="Historical Columbia">Columbia</a>).</p>

<p>The succession of the Patrician is normally either by assassination or revolution. It has been known for Patricians to resign, but it is very much the exception.</p>
<p>Power is to some degree shared with the many Guilds (see above) and the surviving nobility. They form a sort of advisory city council, but the Patrician has the only vote at meetings.</p>
<p>The current office-holder is Lord <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havelock_Vetinari_85f2.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Havelock Vetinari</a>, a former <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassin.html" title="Assassin">Assassin</a>.</p>
<p>The nearest surviving relative of the former <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_family.html" title="Royal family">royal family</a> seems to be Captain <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrot_Ironfoundersson_5fbc.html" title="Carrot Ironfoundersson">Carrot Ironfoundersson</a>, technically a human, but fundamentally a dwarf (or vice-versa depending on point-of-view). However, he has gone to some effort to keep this as quiet as possible. The origin of Corporal <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobby_Nobbs_7277.html" title="Nobby Nobbs">Cecil Wormsborough St. John (Nobby) Nobbs</a> remains shrouded in mystery. At one point he was identified as being a descendant of de Nobbes, the Earl of Ankh (and therefore the next in line), but this was (probably) a deliberate deception.</p>
<p>A Patrician has almost absolute power over the affairs of the city and works together with the leaders of the city's <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilds_of_Ankh-Morpork_3153.html" title="Guilds of Ankh-Morpork">Guilds</a>, who are the ones who elect him in the first place (through the Guild Council, as shown in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Truth_%28novel%29_bbf7.html" title="The Truth (novel)">The Truth</a></i>. Eligible for election are members of rich and influential families. Unfortunately, almost all of the people who have held the post through the years proved once in office to be little different from a king, except that power did not pass automatically to their descendants. They were despotic, oppressive and fairly often mad. Past Patricians have included:</p>

<p>Vetinari appears rather more permanent than most, largely due to his <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machiavelli.html" title="Machiavelli">Machiavellian</a> ("for a given value of Machiavelli", according to Terry Pratchett) machinations. He has arranged the politics of the city in such a way that to remove him from office would cause chaos among the Guilds and nobility. He firmly believes that what people really want is stability, and that is what he provides.</p>

<p>The primary engines of Ankh-Morpork's economy are the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilds_of_Ankh-Morpork_3153.html" title="Guilds of Ankh-Morpork">guilds</a>. There are hundreds of guilds, for every conceivable profession, from <a href="../../../f/o/o/Fools%27_Guild_%28Discworld%29_945a.html" title="Fools' Guild (Discworld)">clowns</a> to <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butchers.html" title="Butchers">butchers</a>, and each has its own strictly maintained laws and trading practices.

<p>As Ankh-Morpork does not appear to have anything approaching a public education system, the primary means of education is the vocational training imparted by the guilds to their young members. Foundlings are, for instance, often dropped at the doorsteps of guilds in the hopes of their learning a useful trade. The <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_Assassins%27_Guild_3a4d.html" title="Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild">Assassin's Guild</a> is considered the top educational establishment on the Disc and, whether one intends to be an assassin or not, is considered the school of choice for young aristocrats such as the future <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Vetinari_01ff.html" title="Lord Vetinari">Lord Vetinari</a>. Many children from poorer backgrounds are educated at <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_schools.html" title="Dame schools">dame schools</a>, similar to the institutions in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_England_ad9b.html" title="Victorian England">Victorian England</a> of the same name; Sideney (in <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogfather.html" title="Hogfather">Hogfather</a>) and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Vimes_5e83.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Samuel Vimes</a> (in <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thud%21.html" title="Thud!">Thud!</a>) were educated at dame schools.

<p>The laws and protections offered by the guilds are the city's main form of personal security. The most obvious example of this is the <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_Thieves%27_Guild_4a9e.html" title="Ankh-Morpork Thieves' Guild">Thieves' Guild</a>, which, by regulating the crime trade, acts as the city's main law enforcement agency; however, many of the guilds also have private enforcers, such as the Agony Aunts for the Seamstresses' Guild and the Bloody Fools for the Fools' Guild.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, law in Ankh-Morpork operates on the principle that a grocer is free to mix soil in his coffee, and also to be vivisected by any customer who happens to find out. Other than that, options are slim. In cases of personal grievance, one might make an appeal to the Guild of Lawyers, providing, of course, one is wealthy enough to pay (The Lawyers' Guild consider this a very reasonable arrangement, as the poor are inveterately criminal anyway). Barring that, the only course of action in criminal cases is a direct appeal to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Patrician_6a81.html" title="The Patrician">the Patrician</a>, which frequently works, as he sees such a result as highly instructive.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havelock_Vetinari_85f2.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Lord Vetinari</a> has begun to reassert the power of the state by reintroducing formerly decrepit government agencies such as the <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_City_Watch_e6c3.html" title="Ankh-Morpork City Watch">City Watch</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_Post_Office_caf9.html" title="Ankh-Morpork Post Office">Post Office</a>, and most recently, the <a href="../../../m/a/k/Making_Money_6503.html" title="Making Money">Royal Mint</a>.</p>

<p><b>Biers</b> is a pub frequented by creatures of the night, usually lumped together as "undead", though they can include werewolves and bogeymen. Difficult to find, unless you happen to be "the right sort." It is often compared to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheers.html" title="Cheers">Cheers</a> but with the tagline "Where everybody knows your shape". <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Sto_Helit_507e.html" title="Susan Sto Helit">Susan Sto Helit</a> is a noted frequenter of Biers.

<p><b>The Shades</b>, Ankh-Morpork's slum district, comprise the oldest region of the city. The moral equivalent of a black hole. A pretty nasty place, all told (a horse in the Shades is often called "lunch", and nothing is seen as more suspicious than fresh paint).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Edit section: Anthem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anthem</span></h2>
<p><i><b>We Can Rule You Wholesale</b></i> is the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a> of Ankh-Morpork; it is a parody of the song '<a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule%2C_Britannia%21_8dbc.html" title="Rule, Britannia!">Rule, Britannia!</a>'. The use of 'ner ner ner' as official lyrics (see below) is also heavily reminiscent of the British football anthem, '<a href="../../../v/i/n/Vindaloo_%28song%29.html" title="Vindaloo (song)">Vindaloo</a>'.</p>
<p>It was not written by a native Ankh-Morporkian, but by the visiting <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead_%28Discworld%29_da4d.html#Vampires" title="Undead (Discworld)">vampire</a> <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">Count</a> Henrik Shline von <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwald</a> (born 1703, died 1782, also died 1784, 1788, 1791, 1802, 1804, 1807, 1808, 1821, 1830, 1861, finally staked 1872). His inspiration came from his observations that Ankh-Morpork's chief means of defence was not warfare but corruption, bribery and mercantile tactics, since most of the weapons used against the city were actually made there in the first place.</p>
<p>The anthem is particularly noteworthy for being the only one that has a second verse <i>officially</i> consisting of incoherent muttering. Count von Überwald had also observed that any group of people singing their country's national anthem never remembers how the second verse goes <i>anyway</i>, so he decided to make things easier for Ankh-Morpork. The anthem's sentiments are of course summarised in the new Pax Morporkia: "If you fight, we'll call in your mortgages. And incidentally that's <i>my</i> pike you're pointing at me. <i>I</i> paid for that shield you're holding. And take my helmet off when you speak to me, you horrible little debtor."</p>
<p>In formal occasions, the anthem is supposed to be performed by a large <a href="../../../s/o/p/Soprano.html" title="Soprano">soprano</a> singer wearing a sheet and holding a torch in one hand and a fork in the other.</p>
<p>The lyrics of the anthem are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp_dragon.html" title="Swamp dragon">dragons</a> belch and <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippopotamus.html" title="Hippopotamus">hippos</a> flee<br />

<a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_%28finance%29.html" title="Credit (finance)">Credit</a> where it's due."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final part of the anthem is usually sung much louder than the rest of the second verse, since the singers want to show they know the words...</p>
<p>The anthem was actually written in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> by Pratchett (words) and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Davis_e983.html" title="Carl Davis">Carl Davis</a> (music), for the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_3_08b7.html" title="BBC Radio 3">BBC Radio 3</a> programmme <i>The Music Machine</i>. It was performed by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Scottish_Symphony_Orchestra_b9d0.html" title="BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra">BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra</a> and the soprano was Clare Rutter. It was also performed at that year's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Proms_5d0b.html" title="The Proms">Proms</a> by the Prommers' Orchestra and Chorus.</p>

<p>Ankh-Morpork was twinned with the town of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wincanton.html" title="Wincanton">Wincanton</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>, in the south-west <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> on the spherical <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planet</a> <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> (known in the Discworld books as <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Discworld_concepts_ca4b.html#Roundworld" title="Minor Discworld concepts">Roundworld</a>) on the 7th December 2002 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2549557.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2549557.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The town is home to a Discworld shop called <a href="http://www.artificer.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.artificer.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">The Cunning Artificer</a> which is named after a street in Ankh-Morpork. However due to legal reasons, the twinning is not officially displayed on the road sign. Fans however have added stick-on notices to some of the signs <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/3002242.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/3002242.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This has now been changed and a new town sign prominently declaring the twinning with Ankh-Morpork and other Roundworld places has been erected. This sign was designed by the Cunning Artificer himself, Bernard Pearson. There are rumours of a footpath to be named the Ankh-Morpork Way coming to pass in due course.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_Queensland_2d83.html" title="University of Southern Queensland">University of Southern Queensland</a> <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roleplaying_game.html" title="Roleplaying game">Roleplaying games</a> club is called <i>The Mended Drum</i>.</p>
<p>Many details of Ankh-Morpork appear to have been inspired by <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Leiber_b097.html" title="Fritz Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s fictional city <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lankhmar.html" title="Lankhmar">Lankhmar</a> (although Pratchett has said "I didn't -- at least consciously, I suppose I must say -- create Ankh-Morpork as a takeoff of Lankhmar"<a href="http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/the-colour-of-magic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/the-colour-of-magic.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).</p>
<p>The most obvious similarities include the names of the two cities, the similar-sounding titles afforded to the respective rulers (a Patrician for Ankh-Morpork, a Patriarch for Lankhmar), the browned-iron equipment that characterises both sets of city guards, some conspicuous buildings (Tower of Art, Rats Tower), the similar names of associated countries (in particular; Klatch and Klesh) and what may be termed a certain general atmosphere. This resemblance is most marked in the earliest Discworld books, and becomes increasing diluted as the series moves away from parody into satire.</p>
<p>Lankhmar's only Patriarch to feature prominently in one of Leiber's stories was Glipkerio Kistomerces. Like Ankh-Morpork's Lord Vetinari, Glipkerio is described as tall, thin ("emaciated" is the word most frequently used), and dressed in black. After which resemblance ceases, as "Glippy" is an inept ruler, a hopeless sadist and an extreme physical and moral coward.</p>
