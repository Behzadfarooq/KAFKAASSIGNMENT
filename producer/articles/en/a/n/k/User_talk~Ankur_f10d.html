<p>Hi Ankur. The message wasn't computer generated&#160;? I really wrote it&#160;:) Regarding your first question about removing text&#160;?I would advise that while we do tell editors to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a>, that you do tread carefully, particularly on pages that people are currently working on and where there have been a large number of contributors. Try not to remove too much in one go. Take it in smaller steps, and explain, at least in the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a>, if not on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">talk page</a> why you are removing it. Talking to the person who added the information can also be a good idea.</p>
<p>I have no answer to your second question: "how do I tell myself it is OK not working for wikipedia full time"&#160;? sometimes I have to remind myself that this is <i>not</i> my full time job! Can you give me an example of what you mean by submitting it to a site that says it will become their property? Normally other sites might have different licences, but on the ones I've seen, you would still be the copyright holder, meaning you could also submit to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If someone has removed something you did, it is definitely better to discuss that on the talk page rather than just revert to your version. You could end up in an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a> otherwise. If you get no response on the talk page of the article, try asking them on their user talk page.</p>
<p>Finally, don't worry about making mistakes. There re lots of people monitoring recent changes to make any necessary corrections. There is a page called <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a> where you could ask for someone to check your work if you feel it needs it. If you have any more questions, just drop me a <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">line</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 22:39, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Those blue dots are obsolete/unused cricket fielding positions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Long Stop</b> is directly behind the wicketkeeper (generally not used, I don't know why - I like it as it cuts down the third man and fine leg)</li>
<li><b>Straight hit</b> is not used in contemporaty cricket (may be used in other forms) as it interferes with the bowler's vision.</li>
<li><b>Fly slip</b> is rarely used in ODI's but used sometimes in Test's and Australian domestic cricket.</li>

<p>Since a person might come across such a term, I showed it in a different colour.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/User_talk%7EAnkur_f10d.html" title="Edit section: Featured pictures">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Featured pictures</span></h2>
<p>I too was startled by how rude mav was on Featured pictures. I don't think that kind of language was called for. That said, I think it would be nice if you could elaborate a bit on your votes. There is certainly no requirement that you explain your vote, but it is the custom. I do it for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, it tells the submitter (and often the photographer or artist) what they should do differently next time - look for better lighting, more topical relevance, whatever. In fact it often occurs that an initially unacceptable (non-brilliant) picture can be improved through several rounds of discussion until it is brilliant.</p>
<p>Also, for almost every one of these pictures, the submitter (and/or the author) have a personal stake in seeing the picture approved. While it's quite reasonable to oppose the picture on some definite grounds, a brusque "oppose" is likely to annoy or offend the submitter. Usually they're mature enough not to make a big deal out of it, but it may lead to strife or unhappiness, which are more serious than they sound in a volunteer community project of this sort. A statement like "This picture is far from brilliant", with no further explanation, is even more likely to cause offense.</p>
<p>Finally, without some explanation, readers may assume that you're opposing the nomination for no good reason, perhaps out of curmudgeonliness or personal grudge. Since the final outcome is decided by discussion rather than a simple vote tally, this can significantly reduce your influence on the final outcome.</p>
<p>In summary, it's good to be critical of pictures submitted for featuring, but if possible I think (and it is the custom) that criticism should take the form of explicit discussion rather than simple voting. It is also a good idea (as in any public forum) to watch one's phrasing so as not to cause unintentional offense (intentional offense is a matter of personal style). --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 01:02, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Believe me I'd have loved to say why I did not like those pictures (I voted against a lot of them that day.) But I do not have reason its simple as this - while I love classical music and a friend does not, none of us can give reasons for it. We simply have those choices. I am after all human. I do not decide based on parameters passed to me, I do not quantify my love, I do not use mathematical formulas to describe beauty. I fail to see it. Maybe I am looking for near professional photographs that I find in National Geographic print or web edition. Maybe I am looking for the kind that I download using Webshots every day. Maybe I think different. Anyway, I had this question (maybe you can help&#160;:-). I find the debate at Featured picture candidates obtrusive to the voting process. I want to remove all of it (including my vote) - it is pointless anyway. The problem is I will inadvertently have to remove other people's comments, which is not recommended I suppose. What do I do about it. Thanks for your message BTW. I'll see if I can do anything about posting proper comments with my vote. --<a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnkur_0fc1.html" title="User:Ankur">Ankur</a> 01:23, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree, there are some pictures I just don't really like, and I can't explain why; also vice versa. Usually I figure that if I can't describe what's wrong with it, maybe it really is just personal taste, and my personal taste alone shouldn't keep a picture out of FP. So I usually just don't vote on those ones. Since I've started learning more about photography and about art, though, I've found that for most of the ones I don't like, I can at least narrow it down to what part I don't like - the composition, the lighting, the colors, the relevance to the article, or something. At the least I can almost always indicate whether it's the picture quality or its relevance.</p>
<p>I think you may be setting standards a bit higher than is useful, though; after all, National Geographic specializes in the best photos by world-class photographers. I'd love it if Wikipedia had lots of such pictures, but (apart from public domain photos from other sources) Wikipedia is more-or-less restricted to amateur photography. Perhaps more to the point, FP should contain the best pictures in Wikipedia - and it should contain a reasonable number of them. I suppose we could have a formal "top hundred pictures in Wikipedia", but there's no need to be formal about it. I think it suffices to judge the quality compared to what's there now: if it's better than most of what's there, it should probably go in. Put another way, unless we start having too many featured pictures, it doesn't make sense to set the standards too high. As we get more and better pictures in Wikipedia, the standards can and should correspondingly increase. Of course, this means we should also go through and demote pictures that aren't up to the new standards, but that's kind of an unpleasant business.</p>
<p>As for the debate at FP, in general most of the debate serves a good purpose; most of the rest does no harm. But I think that that specific discussion (your vote with comments, mav's response, your response, etc.) does make kind of a mess of Wikipedia. I suggest moving it here (to your discussion page) and leaving behind a note saying "vote and argument moved to my discussion page" with a link. Make it clear that you're removing your objection if you do that, though, so the voting process can continue unimpeded. Or just wait; the picture will be voted one way or the other sooner or later, and the discussion will be archived. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 04:59, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oppose. This seems to be the fourth image where my views differ from other wikipedians. I simple fail to notice the brilliance so many people are talking about. I guess the Camera I've been using lately is to be blamed.

<li>I've almost never seen such language at Wikipedia and I least expected it from someone who is works so much here. I did agree with you (about unsatisfactory) its just that I did not write it down, I would have supported a better image but the vote is for the current image. About being insulting *kindly* point out what exactly do you find insulting it will certainly be a lesson in etiquette for me. "There seems to be nothing brilliant about the montage", are my own personal views and are based on the past 20 years spent on looking at photographs (I am 23). That I care to be more selective is not a fault. I have observed the first few images that were selected for featured picture were brilliant. The newer pics that are being proposed and selected fail considerably in meeting the the standard set by original selections, yet Wikipedians are supporting most nominations. This and the other few pictures that I have voted against (on 6th of July) are examples. I find your work short of brilliant and I end up being called asshole!! What does this say about you?

<p>Hey, I was the one that added the translations at the first place the terms appeared. Please see <a href="../../../r/a/j/Talk%7ERajpath_038e.html" title="Talk:Rajpath">Talk:Rajpath</a>--<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">iFaqeer</a> 06:37, Sep 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sorry, I am not sure what you are talking about. <b>I know</b> you added the translation. I just suggested that 'the second line' was becoming too long. I mean there were four names and two translations in one sentence. I think it is more appropriate to move the translation to the place where I described the features. Sansad Marg can be translated but I did not like the idea on the bases that, Sansad Marg is a proper noun and never translated. Rashtrapati Bhavan on the other hand is translated. While it is more likely that a English news reader will speak Rashtrapati Bhavan, Presidents House is used too. With those suggestions on the talk page I left the article hoping that you will edit the article in the way you deem fit. Then I waited for you to edit. Maybe you were involved somewhere else. So I waited more for you to edit. Finally I edited myself. Its still as much your article as mine, edit it if you dont like what I did.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnkur_0fc1.html" title="User:Ankur">Ankur</a> 06:59, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Hmm. You're right about the long sentence. I think there was some confusion. I think I had already added the translations to that long sentence when you went in to add them.</dd>
<dd>Anyways, the way I was looking at the translations was not to imply that these things could be called that, but as a way of explaining to users what they are. Of course, you are right that in the case of Rashtrapati Bhavan, for example, the English phrase is also used. Hmmmm.

<dd><b>Quoth:</b> <i>I was wondering if you discussed this thing at the Wikipedia mailing list (or anywhere else) before you went around putting it on everyone's page. If you did I'd love to know what was the general view.</i>
<dl>
<dd>I asked the first 200 - 400 users over the course of two weeks individually and based on the results of the pool of users that responded I created a more general message that I posted above. The users I asked were ranked highest for number of edits, so that I could see if the project was even feasible. Based on the fact that of those that responded over 90% agreed, I considered that to be overwhelming support. Those who have not yet responded are not included in that figure, but responses keep trickling in as people look into the issue and decide. I am still in the process of responding to the rest of the users I've asked, so I don't know the current number, but so far over 400 have agreed to the CC-by-sa and over 100 have released into the public domain. I originally was just going to ask those users who worked on rambot articles, but since the response has been so overwhelming for all articles, I've widened my project a bit.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Quoth:</b> <i>If say 50% wikipedians did agree to dual licence and a wikitraveler came here for say information about Timbuktu he would have to go through the entirety of history and know about the licence used by every contributor to be able to use some exact text and that would be a horrible pain in the neck.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but i'm willing to do it. In general though many of the U.S. city/county articles are capable of making more than 50%, but that obviously depends on the response. As of the first 400 people asked, 25% of Wikipedia's user edits have been multi-licensed. That's just after two weeks. It should have grown a bit more since then, and keeps growing.</dd>

<p>The strange characters you're seeing is probably 'cos the default character set of the page is set to Western or ISO-8859-1 on your browser. The sanskrit text is obviously in utf-8.

<dd>Hi, thanks for taking the trouble on the map. However I have been having discussions on the status of Arunachal Pradesh and what <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">user:ran</a> says is that the status of AP is disputed between India and China. Here's the map to the Chinese claim <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_india_e_border_88.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_india_e_border_88.jpg" rel="nofollow">Arunachal Pradesh</a>. To make a POV map, is it possible for you to add another coloured layer over AP, and set the transparency to 20% or thereabouts marking the state as "Region claimed by China"? I hope I am not asking too much from you. Your maps will last for a long time if it is made a NPOV map. Thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
First of all I appreciate your patience for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>I am Amruta. I am a first year masters student, studying Human Computer Interaction at Georgia Tech. Currently i am enrolled in a course on online communities. As part of the course we are supposed to study an online community of our interest.</p>
<p>I went through wikipedia and was really amazed to find that they also had a site in Hindi. I found this really interesting and so thought about exploring how the content differs when the language changes, how people access wikipedia when it is in a different langugae or specifically when it is their mother tongue.</p>
<p>And so the theme for my project is</p>
<p>Wikipedia is available in many different languages. While the interface and concept stay the same, the content and the way people utilize it seem to be significantly different from one language to another. I can see this clearly when I compare the Hindi and English versions. How does culture effect the content and the way people participate in creating it? Which features stay the same? Which features are more exploited in different languages/cultures? If there are similar sites to Wikipedia in their original language, why do those subjects prefer (or do they) to participate in Wikipedia rather than the other alternative?</p>
<p>As part of this project we are supposed to interview 3 people from the community we are studying. The final result of this paper will be to write a paper based on our findings. I have a project group of 3 people all of different nationalities, one Turkish and another Spanish. I was trying to find indian and hindi speaking users for this and came across your name on wikipedia and so i thought you might be able to give me some insight on this.</p>
<p>The main reason to write to you is, i would really appreciate it if you could be one of my subjects for conducting an interview as you might be able to give me some insight into this issue. Participation in my study is completely voluntary. Your name or personal details will never be revealed to anyone during this course.</p>
<p>In case you have any doubts you can go through this page <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2005/cs6470_spring/researchstudy/" class="external free" title="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2005/cs6470_spring/researchstudy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2005/cs6470_spring/researchstudy/</a></p>

<p>Hi Ankur, kudos to you for all the work you've put into your maps. Just a query about Arunachal Pradesh: some members of Chinese Wikipedia have expressed to me their concern that the Chinese claim ("Zangnan") is not represented. I've read some of the previous posts on this, especially Ran's requests.

<blockquote style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;">
<p><b>Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language.</b> This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is <b>Devanāgari</b>; the script/font-system for English is <b>Roman</b> script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation. Recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose "underline links -&gt; Never". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for "justify paragraphs", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.</li>
<li>All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on <i>facts</i>—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_Editing_Wikipedia_f2e1.html" title="Help:Contents/Editing Wikipedia">help page for editing in general</a>. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.</li>
<li>Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately.</li>
<li>Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of <a href="http://malayalamkeyboard.com/hindimozhi.htm" class="external text" title="http://malayalamkeyboard.com/hindimozhi.htm" rel="nofollow">Hindimozhi</a> or <a href="http://bangla.name/isis/" class="external text" title="http://bangla.name/isis/" rel="nofollow">of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)</a>—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the "normal" keyboard with this software, typing <i>ga</i> would give ग and <i>ghaa</i> would give घा.</li>
<li>Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Organization_e65b.html" title="United Nations Organization">UNO</a> (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.</li>
<li>Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for <i>technical</i> and <i>specialized</i> vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी is recommended and usually mandatory. Thus: <i>upper House of Parliament</i>—संसद का उच्च सदन, but not Urdu—मजिलिस का ऐवान-ए-बाला&#160;; <i>Foreign Minister</i>—विदेशमन्त्री, but not Urdu—वज़ीर-ए-ख़ारिजा&#160;; <i>knowledge/science</i>—ज्ञान/विज्ञान, but not इल्म. Use spoken Hindi's ये and वो instead of यह and वह / वे. Do not use the title of respect जी after names, it is unencyclopedic. Thus: कृष्ण / श्री कृष्ण but not कृष्ण जी. Use the आप form and its corresponding 3rd person verbal conjugation for writing about respectable persons. Thus: श्री वाजपेयी मध्य प्रदेश में जन्मे थे. But not: वाजपेयी मध्य प्रदेश में जन्मा था. But do not use the pronoun "आप" itself in-text in biographies.</li>
<li>English should be used sparingly, only when required; i.e., if the corresponding शुद्ध हिन्दी word is too "difficult and not generally encountered", or if it is a proper name of non-Indian person/place/terminology/title, or if the user is highly unsure of the proper translation. It is recommended (but not required) for English-to-Hindi translation while writing articles, the <a href="http://www.shabdkosh.com" class="external text" title="http://www.shabdkosh.com" rel="nofollow">Shabdkosh online dictionary</a> should be used. For each English word, that alternative should be used which is generally encountered in everyday spoken Hindi, and also fits well into the context. Use of intelligent guesses for newly encountered words is also allowed, and so are translations encountered in Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries, Hollywood films, Hindi-translated books, etc. e.g., दमपिशाच for <a href="../../../d/e/m/Dementor.html" title="Dementor">en:Dementor</a> (used in dubbed HP films).</li>
<li>If used, it is recommended to use the English words within the articles using the English (Roman) alphabets rather than devanagari (or better, the devanagari transliteration should be used in the sentence, followed by the English word in Roman alphabet in parentheses). Such words should be italicized and not put in quotation marks. Preferably, there should be an in-page interwiki link (like&#160;:en:) on the word to the English wikipedia. If the word comes as an integral part of a sentence, so as not to break the continuity, the <i>en:</i> prefix should be hidden by writing the word again after the pipe sign (piped link). Thus, recommended: <code>हैरी पॉटर ने ''[[:en:Pensieve|Pensieve]]'' के अन्दर ''[[:en:Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]]'' गाँव में लॉर्ड वोल्डेमॉर्ट की माँ ''[[:en:Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]]'' को देखा.

Thus, recommended: <b>ललिता सहस्रनामन</b> हिन्दू धर्मसुधारक <a href="../../../%E0%A4%86/%E0%A4%A6/%E0%A4%BF/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF.html" title="आदि शंकराचार्य">आदि शंकराचार्य</a> द्वारा रचित देवी <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%A6/%E0%A5%81/%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:दुर्गा">दुर्गा</a> को समर्पित एक पूजा-मन्त्र है, जिसे कई हिन्दू रोज़ श्रद्धा से जपते हैं । But not: <b>ललिता सहस्रनामन</b> मन्त्र जपने के लिये लड्डू-पेड़ा, ताम्बुल, सिन्दूर, लाल चुनरी के साथ नित्य इस मन्त्र का पाठ करें, तो जल्द ही गड़ा हुआ ख़जाना मिलेगा । Recommended: <b>वैमानिक अभियान्त्रिकी</b> (<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautical_engineering.html" title="Aeronautical engineering">en:Aeronautical engineering</a>) <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%B5/%E0%A4%BF/%E0%A4%AE/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8.html" class="extiw" title="hi:विमान">विमानों</a> (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">en:Aircrafts</a>) की अभिकल्पना, निर्माण और प्रचालन करने का विज्ञान, कला और कार्य है । (<i>translated from Eng. Webster's New World Dictionary</i>). But not: आजकल वैमानिक अभियान्त्रिकी के लिये देशभर में कई कॉलेज खुल गये हैं, जिनमें अग्रणी स्थान यूटोपिया स्थित लालू-यादव टेक्लिनक कॉलेज का है ।</li>
<li>For names of countries, cities, places, languages, people, books, films, technical vocabulary, mythology, etc, start the article like this:
<ul>
<li>1. <code>The name in bold ('''अपोलो''')</code></li>
<li>2. <code>starting parenthesis, then English name in Roman script, in-page interwiki-linked to English wiki ff. by semicolon ((अंग्रेज़ी : [[:en:Apollo]];)</code></li>
<li>3. <code>The native name(s) if applicable in the italicized native script, preferably followed either by its italicized approximate Hindi pronunciation or non-italicized</code> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonetic_transcription.html" title="Phonetic transcription">phonological transcription</a> <code>within / /, ff. by closed parenthesis (यूनानी : ''Aπollων अपोल्लोन''))</code></li>
<li>4. <code>the rest of the definition or introduction (प्राचीन [[यूनानी धर्म]] (ग्रीक धर्म) और प्राचीन [[रोमन धर्म]] के सर्वोच्च देवता थे ।)</code> For country names, only the standard short form of the name is needed in the first line. If there is a common name for a difficult word in Hindustani, also mention it. Whence: <b>अपोलो</b> (अंग्रेज़ी&#160;: <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">en:Apollo</a>; यूनानी&#160;: <i>Aπollων अपोल्लोन</i>) प्राचीन <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%AF/%E0%A5%82/%E0%A4%A8/%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80_%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:यूनानी_धर्म">यूनानी धर्म</a> (ग्रीक धर्म) और प्राचीन <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A5%8B/%E0%A4%AE/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8_%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:रोमन_धर्म">रोमन धर्म</a> के सर्वोच्च देवता थे । If you don't give the interwiki English/another language link (which would be deemed to be the default reference), then you MUST provide an appropriate reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please leave no article without an appropriate category. See the list of created categories <a href="../../../../hi/c/a/t/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%7ECategories_b9c2.html" class="extiw" title="hi:विशेष:Categories">here</a>; you can also make a new category (pref. in Hindi). Please leave no article without at least <b>ONE</b> off page (like en:) interwiki link. E.g., the user can check the article name (say Apollo) on the finally redirected English page and append to the Hindi article (<code>[[en:Appolo]])</code>). These interlanguage links will help a bot to update all interwiki links for that article in all wikipedias. The category and the aforementioned link should be typed at the end of the article. If the article is very small, mention it as a stub/substub.</li>
<li>Use of templates is welcome. See the list of templates <a href="../../../../hi/t/e/m/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%80%7ETemplates_cb0d.html" class="extiw" title="hi:श्रेणी:Templates">here</a>. If creating a template, name it pref. in Hindi.</li>
<li>Use पूर्णविराम ( । ) instead of a period (.) for ending statements. The पूर्णविराम, semicolon, colon and dash (but not comma) must come after one space after the word to prevent ambiguity. Use the international form of the Hindu-Arabic numerals (1,2,3 instead of १,२,३), as used by the Constitution and the Government of India (even for Hindi). There is no need to use the हलन्त at the end of Sanskrit words wherever it occurs. Hence, prefer: संसद over संसद्; अथर्वन over अथर्वन्. Use the proper quotation marks “” from the Insert toolbox, not "". Write dates as 2 मई 2006 (ईसवी or ईसापूर्व). Write time as 3:45 pm. Separate common suffix-words like शास्त्र, विज्ञान, ज्ञान with a hyphen. Thus: रसायन-शास्त्र. For most others, leave both the words of the noun-cluster free. Combine them into one word only if it is very common to do so. Thus: सामवेद.</li>
<li>The use of <b>ज़</b> for the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_alveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiced alveolar fricative">en:voiced alveolar fricative</a> (/z/, as in <b>z</b>oo, ro<b>s</b>e) is fundamentally wrong. Its nearest counterpart is the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiceless alveolar fricative">en:voiceless alveolar fricative</a> /s/ (as in <b>s</b>ea), and not Hindi ज (<a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_palatal_plosive.html" title="Voiced palatal plosive">en:voiced palatal plosive</a>). Hence, it is suggested and recommended that for the sound /z/, whether it comes in English (etc.) spellings (z) for while pronunciation otherwise, should be transcribed as <b>स़</b> (स with a dot below, available in the Insert toolbox). Hence: Reason <b>रीस़न</b>, not रीज़न&#160;; Roses <b>रोस़ेस़</b>, not रोज़ेज़. But common Hindi words borrowed from Persian/Arabic (so-called Urdu words) are allowed to continue with ज़ spelling. Thus: ज़रा, नज़र, तर्ज़. The <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_postalveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiced postalveolar fricative">en:voiced postalveolar fricative</a> (/ʒ/ as in trea<b>s</b>ure), inexistent in Hindi, can similarly be transcribed with <b>श़</b>. Thus: treasure <b>ट्रॅश़र</b>. The nukta (dot) available in the Insert toolbox can be combined with various consonants to suggest a more exact phonetic devanagari rendering of foreign sounds. E.g., since phonetically, English Think and this are not equal to थिंक and दिस, a better transcription could be <b>थ़िंक</b> and <b>द़िस</b>. <b>Please take care of the dot below in so-called Urdu words, otherwise the Hindi spelling is deemed incorrect</b>.</li>
<li>For the following English vowels m<b>e</b>t, m<b>a</b>te, m<b>a</b>t, transcribe as मॅट (short vowel), मेट (not मेइट), मैट (not मॅट, as popular in Marathi). However in contemporary Hindi and here, it is acceptable to use ए instead of ऍ. Thus: अमेरिका is more popular than अमॅरिका. For c<b>o</b>t, c<b>oa</b>t, c<b>au</b>ght, transcribe as कॉट, कोट, कॉट (not कौट). Transcribe English /t/ and /d/ as ट and ड.</li>
<li>Use half-न before त, थ, द, ध, न, instead of anuswaar अं. Use half-म before प, फ, ब, भ, म. Use the anuswaar before all the rest of the consonants (not half-ङ, ञ, ण). If the मात्रा is not above the alphabet, use chandra-bindu, but only for <b>nasalization</b>. Thus: अन्दर, not अंदर&#160;; अन्त, not अंत&#160;; हिन्दी, not हिंदी&#160;; सम्भव, not संभव&#160;; पंचमी, not पञ्चमी&#160;; अंडा, not अण्डा&#160;; कंठ, not कण्ठ&#160;; लैंड, not लैण्ड&#160;; आँख, not आंख. However, both forms are acceptable in contemporary Hindi as well as here; the prec. are just recommendations.</li>
<li>When proceded by another vowel, use the pure vowels instead of य (unless the य is clearly articulated while pronouncing). Thus&#160;: जाएँ, not जायें (not जावें)&#160;; आएगा, not आयेगा . However, both forms are acceptable in contemporary Hindi as well as here.</li>
<li>Please pay careful attention to the masculine/feminine gender (and singular/plural) in adjectives and verbs, else the sentence becomes ungrammatical.</li>
