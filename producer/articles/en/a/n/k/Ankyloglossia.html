<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Incidence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Incidence</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incidence.html" title="Incidence">incidence</a> of ankyloglossia has been reported from .02 percent to 4.8 percent (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2003b). According to Lalakea and Messner (2003b), the different reports of incidence may be due to the lack of objective grading systems and uniform definitions of ankyloglossia. It has been found to occur more frequently in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Males.html" title="Males">males</a> than in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Females.html" title="Females">females</a>, with a 2.6:1 <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratio.html" title="Ratio">ratio</a> (Messner <i>et al.</i> 2000). The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevalence.html" title="Prevalence">prevalence</a> of ankyloglossia has been to shown to increase with maternal use of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> (Harris, Friend &amp; Tolley 1992). Harris <i>et al.</i> (1992) examined 500 <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infants.html" title="Infants">infants</a> at a well-baby <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nursery.html" title="Nursery">nursery</a> and found that ankyloglossia occurred in 3.5 percent of non-drug users’ <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offspring.html" title="Offspring">offspring</a> and 10.4 percent of cocaine-users’ offspring. The study also found that ankyloglossia was not dependent on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>. Limitations of this study include that examiners were not blinded to the purpose of the study and the effects of ankyloglossia in the infants were not assessed.</p>
<p><a name="Diagnosis" id="Diagnosis"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Diagnosis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>According to Horton <i>et al.</i> (1969), <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnosis.html" title="Diagnosis">diagnosis</a> of ankyloglossia may be difficult; it is not always apparent by looking at the underside of the tongue but is often dependent on the range of movement permitted by the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genioglossus.html" title="Genioglossus">genioglossus</a> muscles. For infants, passively elevating the tongue tip with a tongue depressor may reveal the problem. For older children, making the tongue move to its maximum range will demonstrate the tongue tip restriction. In addition, palpation of genioglossus on the underside of the tongue will aid in confirming the diagnosis.</p>
<p><a name="Effects" id="Effects"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects</span></h2>
<p>Ankyloglossia can affect <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeding.html" title="Feeding">feeding</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech.html" title="Speech">speech</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_hygiene.html" title="Oral hygiene">oral hygiene</a> (Travis 1971) as well as have mechanical/social effects (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2003a). Ankyloglossia can also prevent the tongue from contacting the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anterior.html" title="Anterior">anterior</a> <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palate.html" title="Palate">palate</a>. This can then promote an infantile <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swallowing.html" title="Swallowing">swallow</a> and hamper the progression to an adult-like swallow which can result in an open bite deformity (Horton <i>et al.</i> 1969). It can also result in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandibular_prognathism.html" title="Mandibular prognathism">mandibular prognathism</a>; this happens when the tongue contacts the anterior portion of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandible.html" title="Mandible">mandible</a> with exaggerated anterior thrusts (Horton <i>et al.</i> 1969).</p>
<p><a name="Professional_Opinion" id="Professional_Opinion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Professional Opinion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional Opinion</span></h2>
<p>Opinion varies, however, regarding how frequently ankyloglossia truly causes problems. Some professionals believe it is rarely symptomatic, whereas others believe it is associated with a variety of problems. The disagreement among professionals was documented in a study by Messner and Lalakea (2000). The authors sent a <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sample_survey.html" title="Sample survey">survey</a> to a total of 1598 <a href="../../../o/t/o/Otolaryngologists.html" title="Otolaryngologists">otolaryngologists</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pediatricians.html" title="Pediatricians">pediatricians</a>, speech-language pathologists and lactation consultants with questions to ascertain their beliefs on ankyloglossia; 797 of the surveys were fully completed and used in the study. It was found that 69 percent of lactation consultants but only a minority of pediatricians answered that ankyloglossia is frequently associated with feeding difficulties; 60 percent of otolaryngologists and 50 percent of speech pathologists answered that ankyloglossia is sometimes associated with speech difficulties compared to only 23 percent of pediatricians; 67 percent of otolaryngologists compared to 21 percent of pediatricians answered that ankyloglossia is sometimes associated with social and mechanical difficulties. Limitations of this study include a reduced <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sample_size.html" title="Sample size">sample size</a> due to unreturned or incomplete surveys. It was not clear why otolaryngologists and pediatricians differed in their opinions.</p>
<p><a name="Feeding" id="Feeding"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Feeding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Feeding</span></h2>
<p>Messner <i>et al.</i> (2000) studied ankyloglossia and infant feeding. Thirty-six infants with ankyloglossia were compared to a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_group.html" title="Control group">control group</a> without ankyloglossia. The two groups were followed for six months to assess possible <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breastfeeding.html" title="Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> difficulties, defined as <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nipple.html" title="Nipple">nipple</a> pain lasting more than six weeks, or infant difficulty latching onto or staying onto the mother’s breast. Twenty-five percent of mothers of infants with ankyloglossia reported breast feeding difficulty compared with only 3 percent of the mothers in the control group. The study concluded that ankyloglossia can adversely affect breastfeeding in certain infants. Infants with ankyologlossia do not, however, have difficulties when feeding from a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottle.html" title="Bottle">bottle</a> (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2002). Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the fact that the quality of the mother’s breast feeding was not assessed.</p>
<p>Wallace and Clark (2006) also studied breastfeeding difficulties in infants with ankyloglossia. They followed 10 infants with ankyloglossia who underwent surgical tongue tie division. Eight of the ten mothers experienced poor infant latching onto the breast, 6/10 experienced sore nipples and 5/10 experienced continual feeding cycles; 3/10 mothers were exclusively breastfeeding. Following a tongue tie division, 4/10 mothers noted immediate improvements in breastfeedings, 3/10 mothers did not notice any improvements and 6/10 mothers continued breastfeeding for at least four months after the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>. The study concluded that tongue tie division may be a possible benefit for infants experiencing breastfeeding difficulties due to ankyloglossia and further investigation is warranted. The limitations of this study include that the sample size was small and that there was not a control group. In addition, the conclusions were based on subjective parent report as opposed to objective measures.</p>
<p><a name="Speech" id="Speech"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Speech">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Speech</span></h2>
<p>Messner and Lalakea (2002) studied speech in children with ankyloglossia. They noted that the phones likely to be affected due to ankyloglossia include <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibilants.html" title="Sibilants">sibilants</a> and lingual sounds such as [t d z s θ ð n l]. In addition, the authors also state that it is uncertain as to which patients will have a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_disorder.html" title="Speech disorder">speech disorder</a> that can be linked to ankyloglossia and that there is no way to predict at a young age which patients will need treatment. The authors studied 30 children from one to 12 years of age with ankyloglossia, all of whom underwent <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frenuloplasty.html" title="Frenuloplasty">frenuloplasty</a>. Fifteen children underwent speech evaluation before and after surgery. Eleven patients were found to have abnormal <a href="../../../a/r/t/Articulation.html" title="Articulation">articulation</a> before surgery and nine of these patients were found to have improved articulation after surgery. Based on the findings, the authors concluded that it is possible for children with ankyloglossia to have normal speech in spite of decreased tongue mobility. However, according to their study, a large percent of children with ankyloglossia will have articulation deficits that can be linked to tongue tie and these deficits may be improved with surgery. The authors also note that ankyloglossia does not cause a delay in speech or language but, at the most, problems with articulation. Limitations of the study include a small sample size as well as a lack of <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blinding.html" title="Blinding">blinding</a> of the speech-language pathologists who evaluated the subjects’ speech.</p>
<p>Messner and Lalakea (2003a) also examined speech and ankyloglossia in another study. They studied 15 patients and speech was grossly normal in all of the subjects. However, half of the subjects reported that they thought that their speech was more effortful than other peoples’ speech.</p>
<p>Horton <i>et al.</i> (1969) discussed the relationship between ankyloglossia and speech. The authors believe that tongue tie contributes to difficulty in range and rate of articulation and that compensation is needed. Compensation at its worst, the article states, may involve a Cupid’s bow of the tongue.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Mechanical/Social">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mechanical/Social</span></h2>
<p>Ankyloglossia can result in mechanical and social effects (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2003a). Lalakea and Messner (2003a) studied 15 people, aged 14 to 68 years. The subjects were given <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionnaires.html" title="Questionnaires">questionnaires</a> in order to assess functional complaints associated with ankyloglossia. Eight subjects noted one or more mechanical limitations which included cuts or discomfort underneath the tongue and difficulties with <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kissing.html" title="Kissing">kissing</a>, licking one’s <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lips.html" title="Lips">lips</a>, eating an <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_cream_cone.html" title="Ice cream cone">ice cream cone</a>, keeping one’s tongue clean and performing tongue <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricks.html" title="Tricks">tricks</a>. In addition, seven subjects noted social effects such as embarrassment and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teasing.html" title="Teasing">teasing</a>. The authors concluded that this study confirmed anecdotal evidence of mechanical problems associated with ankyloglossia and that it suggests that the kinds of mechanical and social problems noted may be more prevalent than previously thought. Furthermore, the authors note that some patients may be unaware of the extent of the limitations they have due to ankyloglossia since they have never experienced normal tongue range. A limitation of this study is the small sample size that also represented a large age range.</p>
<p>Lalakea and Messner (2003b) note that mechanical and social effects may occur even without other problems related to ankyloglossia such as speech and feeding difficulties. Also, mechanical and social effects may not arise until later in childhood as younger children may be unable to recognize or report the effects. In addition, some problems may not come about until later in life, such as kissing.</p>
<p><a name="Intervention" id="Intervention"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Intervention">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Intervention</span></h2>
<p>There are varying types of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intervention.html" title="Intervention">intervention</a> for ankyloglossia. Horton <i>et al.</i> (1969) have a classical belief that people with ankyloglossia can compensate in their speech for limited tongue range of motion. For example, if the tip of the tongue is restricted for making sounds such as /n, t, d, l/, the tongue can compensate through dentalization; this is when the tongue tip moves forward and up. When producing /r/, elevation of the mandible can compensate for restriction of tongue movement. Also, compensations can be made for /s/ and /z/ by using the <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorsum.html" title="Dorsum">dorsum</a> of the tongue for contact against the palatal rugae. Thus, Horton <i>et al.</i> (1969) proposed compensatory strategies as a way to counteract the adverse effects of ankyloglossia and did not promote surgery.</p>
<p>However, intervention for ankyloglossia sometimes includes surgery in the form of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frenotomy.html" title="Frenotomy">frenotomy</a> (also called a frenectomy or frenulectomy) or frenuloplasty (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2002). This may be done by laser. However, authors such as Horton <i>et al.</i> (1969) are currently in opposition to it. According to Lalakea and Messner (2002), surgery can be considered for patients of any age with a tight frenulum as well as a history of speech, feeding or mechanical/social difficulties. Adults with ankyloglossia may elect the procedure. Some of those who have done so report post-operative pain.</p>
<p>A viable alternative to surgery is to take a wait-and-see approach (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2003b). Ruffoli <i>et al.</i> (2005) report that the frenulum naturally recedes during the process of a child’s growth between six months and six years of age; thus, it is possible for the child to outgrow ankyloglossia (Lalakea &amp; Messner 2003b; Harris &amp; Friend &amp; Tolley 1992).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankyloglossia.html" title="Edit section: Conclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>In conclusion, ankyloglossia can have feeding, speech and mechanical/social effects as well as result in other problems such as an open bite and mandibular prognathism. There is professional disagreement regarding how often ankyloglossia is symptomatic. In addition, intervention is also controversial as researchers such as Horton <i>et al.</i> (1969) believe that people with ankyloglossia can compensate in their speech for limited tongue range of motion and do not require surgery.</p>
