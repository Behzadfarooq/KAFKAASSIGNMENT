	    <p><b>Team-Member Contribution</b></p>
<p><b>Elizabeth Ashley:</b> Elisabeth Ashley has volunteered to work on the buffer portion of the project. She has completed building all the required sub-parts of the buffer which is the D Flip-Flop, and is currently in the process of testing the digital logic using B2 Logic. There is still more work for her to do by building the circuits at both the gate and transistor level in B2 Spice after the digital logic testing has been completed. In regards to the Mid-Term report, Elisabeth is writing the sections on Professional and Ethical Issues for both part I and II of the report. She has also offered to assemble the individual parts that everyone else is writing which entails proofreading and re-writing certain parts as necessary to assure that the report flows correctly. She will also be taking the report to The Writing Center to have them proofread it, and will also be assisting in the creation of the Power Point presentation for the oral presentation.</p>
<p><b>Chris Hakala:</b> I have researched many different digital to analog converters, and have chosen a few to concentrate one. I started with an R2R ladder DAC but have passed that on to Ankit Khanna. I am now currently designing a binary weighted DAC. I have produced a functional 4-bit version of this DAC. I am also researching the segmented and pulse width modulator type DACs.</p>
<p><b>Jeremy Erndt:</b> Jeremy Erndt contributed specifically in the deglitcher sub-block of the design implementation. From DAC output to Deglitcher analysis, several spice simulations were recorded, noted and altered in order to find the optimum performance of the system. He also worked on the overall generation of the team’s semester schedule. Another aspect of contribution was the cost analysis section, he developed and proposed potential percentages of the amount cost per section of design implementation, such as, R&amp;D, Marketing, Components, and Manufacturing. Jeremy took a broader look into the infrastructure of engineering firms in order to get a better understanding of the average costs for productions similar to the one being simulated in this semesters design project. Final contributions included additions to the ethical and professional codes section, including IP issues such as trademarks, patents, designs, and copyrights, in order to protect our team’s rights throughout the design process. Continued work on the deglitcher will remain the focus for the entirety of the semester, as well as, a general focus on codes and regulations.</p>
<p><b>Ankur Singhal:</b> For the past six weeks, I have been working on the design and analysis of the Butterworth filter. The research on the theory is done from the two text books on filters [Singhal 1, 3] and a filter design paper [Singhal 4]. The formulas are used from these references to design component values of the filter and the results that I achieved are shown in Appendix [Singhal]. I have also worked on Maple [Appendix Singhal] to verify the calculations done in class for distortion estimation. With regards to the midterm report, I am responsible for putting together design strategy in proposal and personal contributions in the update section.</p>
<p><b>Ben Pagano:</b> I have been focused on designing a passive Chebychev filter for the low pass filter section of the DAC. The primary goal has been to design a filter and simulate it in B2 Spice. Deliverables I have provided are Bode plots, hand calculations, and spreadsheets showing distortion figures for my design. I have assisted team member Rohit Gupta in the design of a 7th order Elliptic filter and its simulation. I have helped to revise the teams overall schedule showing team goals and important milestones. I have worked with Jeremy Erndt to develop a project plan to investigate cost of R&amp;D, marketing, components, and manufacturing. In the future I will investigate the low pass filter portion of the design further and contribute to report writing and presenting the work of the team.</p>
<p><b>Rohit Gupta:</b> I have been working on elliptic filter for this project. The main objective I was focusing on was to construct a passive filter and understand the working of it by using different LC component values. I used tools like Matlab, B2 Spice and Maple to check and verify my calculations. Bode plots, phase diagrams and step responses were created to understand the characteristics of the filter behavior. As a team we compared our results with each other and learned behaviors of other filters as well for example Chebyshev and Butterworth. We all provided feedback regarding which filter is good for what kind of application. I helped solving equations for the hand calculations for other team members.</p>
<p><b>Evan Hagerstrom:</b> I have been focusing on the design of a stable clock oscillator for the digital audio system. Over the course of the semester, this has included researching various oscillators, including op-amp, RC relaxation, and series resonant. This has also required the modeling of various gates, including an inverter and a NOR gate in B^2 spice. I plan to continue to research oscillator design and develop a system that performs within acceptable boundaries. Within the scope of the midterm report I am responsible for generating the “Plan of Action” section of the proposal, and compiling the “Work Remaining” section of the update.</p>
