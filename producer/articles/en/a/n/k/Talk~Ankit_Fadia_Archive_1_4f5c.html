<h2><span class="mw-headline">have we lost our senses?</span></h2>
<p>citation #2 (chennaionline.com) not only claims that he was contacted by a 'classified agency' to 'decipher' a bin-laden related message, but that he 'also handles the Asia operations of a classified intelligence agency'. Now come on, he either does handle asia operations, or we know about it. can't be both.</p>
<p>unfortunately, a simple phrase search: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ankit+fadia%22+%22bin+laden%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ankit+fadia%22+%22bin+laden%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">"ankit fadia" "bin laden"</a> shows us that the same sentence, with the same wording appears on his official site and on many copies of his 'CV' stored on several different websites. As an alternative topic, I can suggest comparing different versions of his CV to see how much knowledge he gains between seminars&#160;:)</p>
<p>what i'm trying to say is, if i wanted to be the World's Most Strongest Password Cracker Ever on wikipedia, all i had to do was make a website supporting my claim, a few seminars in india (a few dollars arrange this easily) and a writeup on an online-only publication, which hopefully the reporter will use very little effort for, quoting directly from my 'CV' and 'official website'</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia doesn't claim that Ankit Fadia was contacted by any classified agency. Wikipedia article just states that Ankit Fadia has claimed to have done these things and provides references. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 07:22, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">should be deleted</span></h2>
<p>This article must be deleted. Ankit Fadia is a self proclaimed hacker and the Hacking community doesn't acknowledge him as a hacker. Most of his books have also been copied from other genuine books. An article in BBC no way proves that whatever is stated is true. I think there should be a vote whether we must keep this article.</p>
<p>Ankit Fadia doesn't have even one Bugtraq entry in <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid" class="external free" title="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid" rel="nofollow">http://www.securityfocus.com/bid</a></p>
<p>Also, one thing I would like to say. If there is an article on Ankit Fadia, why don't we keep articles on other good hackers like Luny, etc. who are really hackers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article doesn't exist because Ankit Fadia "is a self proclaimed hacker".

<p>If Ankit Fadia should be added as a biography in Wikipedia, then there are many others who should be added. For example there are many genuine Hackers who feature in Bugtraq and various security lists.</p>
<p>Though these people are less heard of but they have done more to the hacking community than Ankit Fadia. As a proof their names appear on many security sites and organizations. If we don't have biographies on these people, we shouldn't be having biographies on Ankit Fadia too.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">not worthy enough of a biography</span></h2>
<p>I agree with the above mentioned points. There are thousands of good hackers in this world. Ankit Fadia is not even close to being a hacker. He is a preacher and that too mostly for school or college students. Most of his presentations and books are merely a copy of other books. He doesn't deserve to be present here as a biography. I agree, if there is a biography about Ankit Fadia, why not a biography about the persons listed in the above comment because they have done something more constructive for the hacking community. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.227.179.5 (<a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.227.179.5.html" title="User talk:220.227.179.5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.227.179.5_0db0.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.227.179.5">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>If so, then don't comment any more on gather. I will leave your place but you too leave. Stop badmouthing alongwith ankit fadia. I will handle it my self. As I mentioned before also, I have nothing to do with you peoples. Why are you supporting Ankit Fadia in this way by commenting on my gather.com articles. India is a democratic country where you or no one else is allowed to stop any one by suggesting, giving their opinions or protesting against frauds. I hope we will now not be a part of this debate any more. My policy is to LIVE and let others LIVE, but not peoples like Ankit Fadia.</p>

<dd>I don't want this turn to a flame war but I really have a serious question for Kalpesh. Neither Ankit has a bugtraq entry nor Kalpesh has one. Neither Ankit has come up with any new security concept nor Kalpesh has come up. All I can see for a google search on "Kalpesh Sharma" are some reports in which he was arrested and his own "self-claims". Apart from this Kalpesh Sharma has not made any significant contributions to the 'hacking' community (I doubt whether he understands the meaning of this word). So on what basis is Kalpesh abusing others? -- <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoot_exploit_dcdf.html" title="User:Root exploit">Root exploit</a> 12:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>None. But this discussion about Kalpesh Sharma is moot. It has already been decided by the wikipedia community that Kalpesh Sharma is a non-notable person. Hence his article was deleted from wikipedia. I would appreciate if we do not discuss Kalpesh Sharma here. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 12:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Kalpesh, thank you so much for the information. As per your suggestion, I've edited the article and included the information about Ankit Fadia being declared "Person of the Year" by Limca Book of Records in 2002. Next time when you put email headers, please remove the e-mail addresses, as they can be picked up by spammers' bots. Thank you for your valuable information. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 12:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kalpesh on Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I want to refer the following notable reliable source to be edited to ankit fadia's page, about the details of ankit fadia mentioned in 'take aways' and 'did you know section of article'.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/101014/hacking_a_fullstop_on_esystem.html" class="external free" title="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/101014/hacking_a_fullstop_on_esystem.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/101014/hacking_a_fullstop_on_esystem.html</a></p>
<p>According to information posted on wikipedia about the associated content website, check that how this is notable reliable source:</p>

<p>This is a notable reliable source similar to the source which was edited by administrator utcursch and can be edited because of following reasons:</p>

<p>This message is for every one from management of wikipedia to administrators&#160;! I am not here now with any intention to fight with wikipedia admins. But as concerns to policies and what's right and to be edited in wikipedia. So, this is the final warning for Aksi to not edit any off topic matters such as "I am wasting time". Do you mean that what I am doing that's all wrong and what Aksi is posting is right? Do you all administrators are here to fight so many with one? Come one by one and out of wikipedia website if you all have so much desire to fight out? You have no rights to comment on my or ankit fadia's issue where the discussion of topic is something else. Any number of times and what ever I think according to my opinion is right, I will post several thousands of time. If the wiki admins think that it's wrong to any extent then prove and don't allow me to edit. But no such comments which continously aksi is giving. What a worst adminstrator is this aksi, telling me anything on wikipedia website itself and on other hand saying I am doing self publicity. This is all also giving me publicity which is a part of war. Then&#160;?</p>
<p>Now let's come to point&#160;! I know that any one from 13 years old age can submit content. But every content is verified and when accepted by the content manager then only it's published. So, in this sense it can be said as reliable.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's presence on wikipedia and the words such as, "Associated Content, "The People's Media Company" provides quality editorials, newsworthy and timely information and facts, and quality content and informational articles. " used on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Content#Content" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Content#Content" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Content#Content</a> proves that it can be trusted as a notable source.</p>
<p>Even then if you have any reasons. Then let me know&#160;! IT's not a force to post the contents, instead this all is treated by me as a part of discussion with you all. And again I say that what ever matter is between ankit fadia or kalpesh sharma, no one from wikipedia has been given right to put their nose into some one other's matter.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to request that please all administrators and management of wikipedia do something of this guy Aksi Great? -- From: Kalpesh Sharma</p>

<dd>The Associated Content article is unreferenced with respect to various attacking claims made against Ankit Fadia. It's quite poorly written. I have no idea who these content managers are, but frankly, if this is indicative of the quality of the articles found on that website, there's no doubt in my mind that any Associated Content article should be scrutinized with a veritable mountain of salt. Indeed, I think I'll edit <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Content_48c7.html" title="Associated Content">Associated Content</a> -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 02:06, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
