<p>I've read a number of places that Ed Sullivan (Famous American TV Talk Show Host 1901-1974) suffered from the disease - his posture and the way he held his neck would support that.</p>

<p>I can appreciate putting Norman Cousins in the list of sufferers since he wrote a famous book with his illness as the focus. <b>However</b>, I wonder if he wasn't misdiagnosed. He became "cured," though there is no known cure for AS. His spine never "ankylosed." All in all, a top of the head diagnosis which doesn't stand up too well under the scrutiny of time. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStudent7_e401.html" title="User:Student7">Student7</a> 22:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been reviewing the history of this page and I am at a loss trying to understand why some quite informative hyperlinks have been removed? I see numerous modifications saying "Reverted edits by xyz" without giving a REASON for removing what for all the world look like good contributions. So far I have only one "reverted edit" that I could see had a clear reason..</p>
<p>I found some useful links in the page history and I can't fathom the reason why they were removed, for example:</p>

<p>According to my consultant exercise is not an alternative therapy. Exercise is essential with Ankylosing Spondylitis. ALL experts recommend exercise combined with NSAIDs or anti-TNF medications. If you don't exercise the spinal fusion will be far worse - period. Putting exercise under the Alternative Therapy heading is misleading and potentially dangerous because it is not an alternative. The current article (21/12/2005, 12:35BST) suggests that exercise is an Alternative Therapy. That undermines the entire entry because it is such a basic thing to get wrong, and is even contradicted by the information referenced by the links.</p>
<p>...response from yb... Not everyone will define 'alternative therapy' the same way. Right or wrong some will consider almost anything that isn't drug therapy as alternative therapy.</p>

<p>Any sport that involves impact will have (especially in an active phase of the disease) almost immediate effects. I'm writing this as "jogging" is mentioned, and it can have a very high impact on all the AS affected joints, it probably shouldn't be recommended?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You can remove it, as long as you provide an adequate reference that a) impact exercise is not recommended and b) jogging counts as an impact exercise. I found a lot of articles about exercise but couldn't get to most full-text versions. Nothing mentioned impact sports or jogging in the abstracts. A search of the web found a lot of replication of this article and one other. I did find several sites which recommended jogging as long as it is not painful. I do not personally know of any proscription against jogging (and I've been seeing a lot of kids with spondyloarthritis recently!), so I wouldn't remove it myself! <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 12:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just my two cents. I suffer from AS. My doctor also told me to not engage in any impact exercises if possible (I play basketball). She would allow jogging if it doesn't hurt but prefers I wouldn't. I tried light jogging and it didn't hurt while I was doing it. But the next morning I couldn't get up at all... ugh! Of course the disease has progressed untreated for a number of years already. I tried Pilates and I think it's better than swimming because it also strengthened my core muscles and was able to do more activities despite the pain.</dd>

<dd>There is the advice in the article that <i>All physical therapies must be approved in advance by a rheumatologist, since movements that normally have great benefits on one's health, may harm a patient with AS</i>. Yes, jogging isn't great I know in first person, swimming is perfect since it envolves movements in a low-gravity environment. But AS is very complicated, all movements may improve or harm depending on how much of your spine is sealed, on how much your ankles are affected, and so on. In my opinion, an advice is sufficient. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenseiwa_d74a.html" title="User:Senseiwa">Sensei</a> 09:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I realize that this is merely "anectodal," but to confirm the above, I have been through quite a few tests recently in order to discover that my severe headaches were caused by herniated neck discs, most likely caused by jogging. I am 70 and had AS diagnosed some 20 years ago. I now use the cross-trainer and elevated treadmill to attain aerobic heartrates. On the plus side, my therapist pointed out that a usual surgical cure for herniation was fusion which I am getting "for free" from the AS!&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStudent7_e401.html" title="User:Student7">Student7</a> 22:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The modifications adding porphyria were indented in order to distingush them from the text. I didn't find any evidence on PubMed about <b>connections</b> between autoimmune diseases and porphyria. I only found a case study, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=17048215" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=17048215">PMID 17048215</a> (patient with AS and porphyria), but I don't see any journal about this very particular topic.
