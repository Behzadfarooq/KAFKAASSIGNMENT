<p>You don't seem to get it. Korean names are in reverse order. The surname of Lee Kyang Hae is Lee. His given name is Kyang Hae. --Wik 06:08, Sep 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think what we need to do is rewrite Asian names in the Anglicized order -- its absurdly confusing to have to check and see whether or not the name is in whatever order. We should always list surnames last, regardless of the culture of origin. Pizza Puzzle</p>
<p>just like we use native names for stuff like towns in the UK, and other names of places and things we should use native names for Japanese,Korean,Chinese,Icelandic and other countries that have different naming systems. --Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason 17:00, 2004 Apr 24 (UTC) I don't know why we're having this discussion here, but it is discussed in detail at Talk:Figure skating. The correct order for Chinese names is =Surname Lastname=. As I mentioned on the other page: "This is the correct convention, and Wikipedia should follow it as such. Consider basketball superstar Yao Ming. Yao is his family name (you can verify this because his father's name is Yao Zhiyuan. As you can see, the basketball press correctly identify him as "Yao Ming", even though his basketball jersey, which traditionally has last names, reads "Yao"." DropDeadGorgias 21:17, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you! Exactly what I say...but this Wik might have an agenda against me.</p>
<p>God bless all you who support my way of writing them Asian names! and Wik too, of course, God bless him too.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, AntonioMartin</p>
<p>You really can't read can you? I have never complained about giving the whole name in the oriental order. It was Pizza Puzzle who did. I have only tried to tell you that you have to alphabetize oriental names in lists under their surname (e.g. "Lee Kyang Hae" is to be listed under L since Lee is the surname - whereas you did the nonsensical "Hae, Lee Kyang"). Is it so hard to admit you were wrong? --Wik 04:16, Sep 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>

Hi Just a FYI in the WNBA the first season Houston was in the eastern conference. In 98 both Houston and Phoenix were in the West. They played in the championship because only four team made the playoff the Western Champs/ Eastern Champs and the next two team regardless of conference. It just work out that two teams from the WC played for 98 WNBA champ. Smith03 03:32, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Rubén B Hola flaco, I just finished an article on Rubén Blades and thought you might be interested in taking a look (BTW, I moved a few lines from Salsa music to it). If it meets your awsomely high standards for accuracy, readability, digestability, danceability, and allround good taste&#160;;-) perhaps you might consider adding it to New articles on the Main Page.

<p>Hi Antonio. Just to let you know, you need to set up a user page on Meta for your vote to count. It should have a link to your user page here, or redirect to it. Angela 01:55, 1 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Antonio, I notice you added some names to the List of famous gay, lesbian or bisexual people however in the top part of the article you will note a request that you place you rationale for adding those people to the talk page. Could you please do that and state your references, particularly for the addition of Britney Spears and Christina Aguillera? It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for some people and although Wikipedia hasn't been sued for libel yet, there's a first time for anything! Graham &#160;:) 00:02, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Dreamfights.com, George Francises, and other stuff Hello, Antonio. How's it going? I was just wondering... what did you mean on Wikipedia:Votes for deletion about Dreamfights.com? being a mistake? The page seems to have been deleted anyway (I don't know who did it), but I was just wondering what was wrong with it...</p>
<p>Oh, and there were some other things that I've been meaning to ask you about, so I suppose I should, now that I'm here... You might remember that you started a page on an alleged criminal by the name of George Francis a few months ago. I found that there were a couple of other well-known people with the same name, so I moved your chap to George Francis (suspected mobster), and made George Francis into a disambiguation page. Is that all right with you? I'm not sure about the article title, actually. Maybe it should be something else, but I'm not sure what. Anyway, one of the other George Francises was a boxing trainer, so I thought you might be interested in him. I put him at George Francis (trainer), though again I'm not sure that's a good title. What do you think? That article is a pathetic stub at the moment, but I thought I'd tell you about it anyway, just in case you were interested. He trained Frank Bruno, who I also started an article on quite recently. It's a bit lacking in information, though, since I know nothing about boxing! I don't know if you know much about British boxers, but if you do, any extra information would be much appreciated.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Oh yes, and thanks for the note on my talk page that you left back in... erm... May(!) about your niece's pre school graduation and all that. Sorry for the slow reply. That's a funny idea, though, a pre school graduation. In the UK we usually wait until we've finished university before having a graduation ceremony.&#160;;) Oh, and here's some nice news - I'm going to be an uncle myself in a few months' time, which is all very exciting.&#160;:) -- Oliver P. 11:31, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the information on Frank Bruno's boxing career. Good stuff. -- Oliver P. 08:33, 13 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why did you re-add Christina Aguilera &amp; Britney Spears to the LfGLBP. The burden of "proof" should be on those who add people to the list; please post evidence that Christina Aguilera &amp; Britney Spears are (homo|bi)sexual. Drolsi Susej 05:29, 15 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Antonio, Greetings from a cold England (it's mid-autumn here), 11C (52F) today and a cold wind. The solution to your Prinair problem was simple, you just missed out the two slashes in front of www. It works now.</p>

<p>Hi Antonio. I was clearing up the village pump and found this. I didn't know if you'd seen it so I thought I'd move it here rather than it be hidden forever in the archives. Take care. Angela 08:26, Nov 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Benitez, Duran, Hagler, Hearns and Leonard</p>
<p>Im thinking of writing an article about the important and historical rivalty these 5 boxers maintained among themselves dthrought the decade of the 1980s, with a timeline for each of their fights against each other. The problem is, since no official nickname was ever given by writers, critics, historians, etc to these fab five of boxing, I have no idea what to call the article..any ideas? Antonio Fab One Martin</p>
<p>Maybe it's not worth an encyclopedia article? Otherwise, I'd suggest going completely generic and write articles like Boxing in the 1980s which could also cover other topics specific to certain decades. Daniel Quinlan 23:47, Oct 29, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hola Antonio, Acerca de tu pregunta en el cafe de wikipedia, poner los enlaces de idioma abajo es la practica recomendada desde hace algun tiempo, como puedes ver en Wikipedia:Interlanguage links, sin embargo, todavia hay resistencia.

<p>[edit] List of noted autograph signers? Hi Antonio. I hope you are well. Here's your question from the village pump. Sorry to have to move it here but the village pump was 110kb! Feel free to move or delete it as appropriate. Angela</p>
<p>I have been debating for months within myself whether to do this list or not. I decided to post my query here based on the limited encyclopedic value I think it would have: Any autograph collector could look up the list and find out if a celebrity who is in town likes signing autographs or not. I have vast experience in this field, I am an autograph collector myself.</p>
<p>Like I said, the value would be limited, but that value makes me wonder. Antonio Megacrazy Martin</p>
<p>There are quite a few people who are weary of lists of dubious value. I say only go for it if you can tie it with the article of broader scope about autographs in general. Perhaps list of autographs (images) might be more "worthy"Dori 05:50, Nov 11, 2003 (UTC) I think it would be hard to confirm the correctness of additions or deletions; if a celebrity doesn't give an autograph to some annoying person, does that mean the disappointed seeker should then run to WP and delete the celebrity's name from this list? If you can come up with criteria that other editors can use, then the list makes sense. In the meantime, you could always create the list as one of your user subpages and "test-drive" it for a while, see how it works to maintain. Stan 07:06, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sounds pretty dubious to me and also rather POV. Isn't this the sort of thing that really belongs in a autograph signer enthusiast web site or something. Daniel Quinlan 08:49, Nov 11, 2003 (UTC) It might be of interest if you recorded idiosyncracies. For example, Terry Pratchett has a particular style for each book (or at least he did when he last signed a batch for me). Or maybe a list of authors who really do not like signing books might be more useful&#160;:-) Phil 14:46, Nov 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>[edit] List of fictional characters? Moved from Village pump 28th Nov 2003</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe we could do that. Many people who are ficticious, like Tony Montana, Rocky Balboa, Memin, Pedro Navaja, Superman, Barbarella, etc etc are so famous that they are more famous than some real life people. Antonio Low Class *itch Martin</p>
<p>Yeah. Although we'll most definitely end up getting innumerable obscure characters, like [Ray-gun Daring Devil] and [Manga Guy # 12]. --Menchi 07:15, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC) Special:Whatlinkshere/Fictional_character should give you an automatic list, so I think creating a non-automatic one would be a wasted effort. It would be better to link all fictional character articles are linked to Fictional character to make sure this feature works. Angela 07:20, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC) A worthwhile idea in my opinion. But I think the list could use some work. Maybe one list in alphabetical order and a second list broken down by sources (grouping all of the Star Trek and Simpson characters together for instance). And I'm pretty sure Alfred Bester and Sarah Bernhardt aren't fictional characters. MK 03:48 (EST) 21 November 2003 Here's two examples which, in my opinion, should what should and should not be done. Characters in Atlas Shrugged is the good entry: a collection of the characters from the book, explaining their individual roles. Characters in The Sandman is the bad entry: a list of links to individual entries, some of which are misdirected and have no relevance to the subject, others of which are stubs or orphans. MK 18:56 (EST) 23 November 2003 Such a Star Trek and Simpsons characters sub-list are already existent on one of the sub-articles of Star Trek and Simpsons. To repeat would be redundant. It may be be good bad idea to place in some famous char, but of course, somebody will come and say, "wait, that's POV, I think Death-blaster III is also important". The list will grow and grow until it explodes. --Menchi 08:56, 21 Nov 2003 (UTC) [edit] Thanks for Concorde support Antonio, many thanks for your support on the Concorde undercarriage caption vote. Because I took the pic and wrote the initial caption, I felt particularly annoyed by the addition that Pigsonthewing made. Lets hope this is the end! Thanks again from Adrian.

<p>[edit] Melwin Cedeño Hello, Antonio. Do you know much about Melwin Cedeño, apart from the fact that he is a Puerto Rican actor? There is now a page on him, but it has been nominated for deletion. I thought you might know something. But if not, never mind! -- Oliver P. 17:23, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! Antonio from a cold England. Today (December 21st) is the shortest day of the year so it will be dark at 5pm and not light again until gone 7am. But at least the days will now grow slowly longer. Temperature today about +5C and tonight -2C. Enough about the weather! No, I cannot put the pic of Prinair onto the article (even though to do so would be easy) because it's copyright to the photographer and there would be a row if ever they saw it in the article. Ask permission by going to www.airliners.net, find the picture and click on the photographers name. This should put up an e-mail box and you can then ask permission to use the pic. If they say you can, then I can put the pic on the article for you. I'd copy it off airliners.net so there would be no need to send me a copy of the pic. You ask me to to look at the requested pics list but I can't find it. Tell me the name of its page, please. Best Wishes and a Happy Christmas, Adrian Pingstone 14:58, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>[edit] Tito Kayak as 'leader' for the Cause of Vieques? Hullo Antonio!&#160;:)</p>
<p>I have posted a message on Tito Kayak's discussion page that I would like you to read for your POV input.</p>
<p>Also, if you could, please don't format Tito Kayak's nickname in italics, as that is how most people refer to him. To give you an example, lets assume that your real life name is not 'Antonio Martin' but 'John Doe'. Everyone in Wikipedia refers to you as Antonio Martin, without italics, as it is the most common way these people refer to you. If not, everyone's boilerplate signature would be in the form of Username.</p>
<p>Any comments, suggestions, or criticism is more than welcome.&#160;:'-)</p>
<p>- Maio 15:33, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Re: Tito Kayak as 'leader' for the Cause of Vieques? Antonio, thanks for your input regarding this matter. I will be making the appropiate changes as soon as I can.</p>
<p>...please stay in Puerto Rico for as long as you want to, youre more than welcome to live in our island and spend your lifetime there. I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.&#160;;)</p>
<p>That said, I am a little short on whats going on in Puerto Rico for the last 13 years and I write based on what I read on papers such as El Vocero, which I receive in my house by subscription, but not WHAT I read at El Vocero. Translation: Half of the time, I only know half of what Im writing about concerning modern Puerto Rico..LOL! Don't worry about that, I for once, welcome all submitted information. For example, I have used text formerly written by you for other articles (see: Navy-Vieques protests).</p>
<p>Changing topics... Please, if you can, add only pertinent information to the remarks column regarding the List of famous Navy-Vieques protesters and supporters. Remember that all details should be explained on the appropiate person's article. Only a quick and summarized text of their occupation and done actions should be written in the remarks.</p>
<p>For example, stating that Ricky Martin is a former Menudo, is kind of irrelevant to the list.</p>
<p>I will be adding a "How to edit this article" section to that article soon, being a controvertial issue, that —again— I would like you to read for further input. I will let you know on your talk page when I submit it.</p>
<p>With all due respect, - Maio 23:46, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Prinair Pic Hi! Antonio, greetings from a chilly England (5C today and perhaps some snow later). Your Prinair pic is now on the article. Just one comment: Mr Sierra might not like the fact that I have removed his copyright notice (at the bottom of his pic) and put it on the Image Description Page (the one you get when you click on the picture). This is because Wikipedia does not allow copyright notices to remain on a pic, they are still there but only seen by clicking on the pic. If Mr Sierra objects, then I think the pic would have to be removed. Let's hope he doesn't mind! Best Wishes, Adrian Pingstone 11:09, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, regarding your reversion of George W. Bush--that wasn't my edit, but I'm curious why you did it. I don't recall the exact details, but I think that the Bush administration did in fact attempt to recognize the anti-Chavez government, even though Chavez was still in fact in power. Don't we need something about this? If you know anything about it, please edit that text rather than reverting. Thanks. Meelar 04:24, 24 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Since the text seemed relatively accurate as I remember it, I'm going to put it back, if that's alright. Good luck with Fernandez. Meelar 05:03, 24 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>[edit] Re: Photos of famous Puerto Ricans Well, you can always use Google's Images Search Engine (<a href="http://images.google.com" class="external free" title="http://images.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com</a>) or IMDB (<a href="http://www.imdb.com" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a>) for media people (ie: Menudo).</p>
<p>The only picture of Wilfredo Gómez that I know that is public domain is [5] (<a href="http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/images/gomez.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/images/gomez.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/images/gomez.jpg</a>), but the image is vandalized. There is a better version here [6] (<a href="http://www.xsn.net/fravel/images/wilfredo.gif" class="external free" title="http://www.xsn.net/fravel/images/wilfredo.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.xsn.net/fravel/images/wilfredo.gif</a>) but the image is cropped.&#160;:-/</p>
<p>You can check out on the websites of the boxing associations that he and Benitez fought for. For example, the World Boxing Association has an article with a picture of Gomez available at [7] (<a href="http://www.wbaonline.com/news/prensa160503a.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.wbaonline.com/news/prensa160503a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wbaonline.com/news/prensa160503a.htm</a>), but the source of the article comes from prensa.com (<a href="http://www.prensa.com" class="external free" title="http://www.prensa.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prensa.com</a>)</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that you can claim fair use for the pictures of Gomez and Benitez, but for the Menudo guys.. well, that's different.</p>

If you want, you can get a page on Geocities (<a href="http://geocities.com" class="external free" title="http://geocities.com" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com</a>) and upload them there so that I can copy them. --Maio 14:29, Feb 11, 2004 (UTC) No man, they didn't get sent.&#160;:( Have you checked your computer for viruses ultimately? Get AVG Anti-Virus (<a href="http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_dwnl_free.php" class="external free" title="http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_dwnl_free.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_dwnl_free.php</a>); it is free software. If that doesn't fix it you will have to try the Geocities route. --Maio 06:49, Feb 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>[edit] from village pump Hey, in the spirit of the Super Bowl happenings et. all, how about if we go Britney Spears-Janet Jackson-Dennis Rodmanesque and call ourselves Wikipedia, the kickas* encyclopedia instead of wikipedia, the free encyclopedia?..LOL Just a comment to light it up a little but wouldnt it be funny if we could do that? LOL</p>
<p>Antonio The Wikipedia Crazy Resident Martin</p>
<p>No. You are neither as crazy, nor as funny, as you think you are. Martin Ok, let's start with the basics.</p>
<p>Laughing at your own jokes is a sign of being a bore, not a wit. When you say something funny, don't sprinkle "LOL" in there. It's like, LOL, I can barely, LOL, get, LOL, to the punchline, LOL, because I'm so hilariously crazy! Commenting on how hilarious your idea is is likewise a good way of making a funny idea less funny. Using signatures humourously is great and all, and I've seen lots of neat signature jokes, but doing it every time becomes formulaic. Formulaic comedy is possible (cf Fast Show), but very difficult. You're not a professional comic, so stay away from formulaic comedy. Making jokes of dubious quality on a very high traffic page that is far too overcrowded already is bad. Make jokes in places with less traffic. You'll get the same number of readers over the long term, and you won't annoy the heck out of everyone. And thank you for the compliment. I think I'm hot too. Martin 01:06, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Lighten up, Martin, you've taken Antonio's joke much too seriously. I enjoyed his zany humour, such a cold cruel analysis of his joke was unnecessary. Antonio, no reasonable person would object to a moment of humour in the Pump. Well done! Adrian Pingstone 16:19, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC) I wouldn't object to a moment of humour...</p>
<p>Antonio, I don't find your signatures offensive, but I do, as you say, find them annoying. If you want to use them to reflect your inner emotional state... well, I can cope with that. Please don't try to make them funny as well! Using the same signature trick for two different purposes detracts from both elements: better to do one and do it well.</p>
<p>You're an attention seeker, and I'm fine with that - all part of the variety of life. However, for my tastes, you force attention, somewhat to excess. I'd rather you earned your attention, to a greater extent than now, from the process of writing articles. Adrian disagrees with me, and it's very much a matter of taste, but that's how I feel.</p>
<p>You're welcome to email: wikipedia@myreddice.co.uk. Martin</p>
<p>Next time you should discuss such things in a private forum (e-mail, whatever). Reading stuff like this is like not having salt and getting ramble eggs as breakfast. --Maio 06:49, Feb 12, 2004 (UTC) But then I wouldn't have the benefit of your and Adrian's excellent advice, would I?&#160;;-) Martin</p>
<hr />
<p>[edit] Re: photos by e-mail Antonio, I did receive both e-mails with the photos included as attachments. Unfortunately, none of them were sent. When I download the images, they have no data inside them. When I try to open them it says "This is not a valid JPEG file".</p>
<p>Regarding the Menudo photo, you can always claim fair use and put a reason of why are you claiming it. See the image of Don Cholito for example.</p>
<p>--Maio 13:34, Feb 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Try opening them with Microsoft Paint Brush (<a href="http://www.lkwdpl.org/classes/MSPaint/paint.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lkwdpl.org/classes/MSPaint/paint.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lkwdpl.org/classes/MSPaint/paint.html</a>) or convert them from JPEG to PNG. You can also use GIMP. --Maio 00:49, Feb 14, 2004 (UTC) [edit] Adrian will put your photos on Hi Antonio! no problem, let me know on my User page User talk:Arpingstone the exact URL where the photos are on the Net and I'll upload them and place them in the two articles. I'll also send you how to upload pics to WP. It isn't a question of more memory or any extra hardware in your computer, it's just a question of knowing how to do it.</p>
<p>Just a hint: when you send someone an email with an attachment, also put yourself on the send list. I put the address of the real recipient in the TO box and my own address in the CC box. Then, if I can open the attachment, it's fairly certain the real recipient can. Better still just send it to yourself at first before you even send it to the real recipient! Then they don't have the annoyance of trying to open a faulty picture.</p>
<p>Please also let me know a bit about your computer if you know it (my values are in brackets), like is it a PC (mine is), hard drive size (120 GB), its speed in MHz or GHz (3 GHz), its make (a UK company called Evesham), what graphics you have (Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Paint, Serif Photoplus), which OS (Windows XP) and if you have a Virus Checker (Norton 2003). Adrian Pingstone 09:50, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Got your email OK, will put the pics up in 24 hours or so.Thanks,</p>
<p>Adrian Pingstone 10:54, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC) OK, the pics are on Wilfred Benitez now. Hope I got the correct ones. If I got anything wrong just let me know and I can correct it.</p>

<p>Adrian Pingstone 21:09, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC) [edit] Is Puerto Rico in the United States? Let's talk over the status of Puerto Rico. I support putting Puerto Rico under the United States in most, if not all Wikipedia articles as...</p>
<p>Puerto Rico is in free association with the U.S. All Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens Puerto Rico has a non-voting representative in the House of Representatives In addition, look around in several other lists involving puerto rico. Many of these have it under the United States.</p>
<p>By the way, in the List of statues, I have a comprimise - there is now a section "The United States, including territories" WhisperToMe 07:08, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>wow, your refreshingly pleasent and kindly! I appreciate that, thank you. I've been almost wanting to say this, and now you give me a chance, that my comments should not be considered an objection to the articles inclusion, but rather that it would be so much nicer with an image, which you clearly agree with :).

<p>[edit] Photo Upload Hi Antonio. Uploading images is very easy. It takes only a couple of steps. For example, say your picture is named example.jpg. You click on the Upload file link on the sidebar, at the bottom of the page that comes up, click the Browse... button and navigate to where you have the file example.jpg in your computer, select it, and click Open on your browser window. Enter something on the Summary that says basically what the image is, and where you got it from (and the author in this case), along with the fact that it's GFDL-ed (if it is, otherwise it has to be under fair use. If there are no problems, another page will come up that tells you the file was uploaded, along with the name of the file, and the file description page. To insert the picture in an article, you simply enter example.jpg in the article (For more specific markup see Wikipedia:Image markup and Wikipedia:Extended image syntax). It is better not to have spaces or weird characters on the image filenames. Simply replace the spaces with an underscore (_) before doing the uploading. You can then click on the talk page of the image desciption page (i.e. Image talk:example.jpg? and enter the information from the author allowing for the work to be used under the GFDL.</p>
<p>I can do the uploading for you, but I think it is better if you learned how to do this on your own. It's not difficult at all. You can use the E-mail this user feature to send me an e-mail.</p>
<p>Good luck and let me know if you have any further questions Dori | Talk 15:43, Mar 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Copyright notices Hi Antonio! I've just removed your copyright notice from the Prinair picture and then I read your village Pump entry about copyright notices for pics. Perhaps the supplier of the photo would be content with a link to the web site, put at the bottom of the article? The link for the Prinair pic is: <a href="http://www.airliners.net/open.file/180264/M/" class="external free" title="http://www.airliners.net/open.file/180264/M/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airliners.net/open.file/180264/M/</a> Regards, Adrian Pingstone 18:05, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Aircraft uploads Hi Antonio! I notice that Dori has sugested you try really hard to do the uploads yourself but I don't think there's much chance you would succeed so I'll certainly do them for you. Just let me know, on my Talk Page, the URL and I'll put them on. On the subject of copyright, I'm afraid we don't (as far as I know) allow copyright notices in pic captions. Surely your suppliers would be happy with a link at the bottom of the article? If they insist that the copyright notice be directly under the pic then I can't help you. It's certainly not a solution to do the notice then erase it later! I'm very sorry to hear what happened to your relatives, Best Wishes, Adrian Pingstone 09:31, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Fotos Hola Antonio!! ¿Cómo estás? Mirá, por lo de las fotos, te cuento el sistema más nuevo, que le pone como un bordecito alrededor de la foto. Es así: (right, center o left)|thumb|Texto El último texto es lo que deseas que diga abajo de la fotografía. Al menos en es.wikipedia funciona! Espero que te sirva de algo.. a mi me está ayudando bastante, porque no tengo que agregar además una foto más pequeña o más grande. Según tengo entendido, también se puede determinar el tamaño de la fotografía, pero eso no sé hacerlo. Con poner "thumb" alcanza. Saludos y hasta pronto! Julie en español, como de costumbre.</p>
<p>[edit] I've got your e-mail Hi Antonio, thanks for the e-mails telling me the aircraft pics you'd like put on. I'm a bit busy for the next couple of days so don't hold your breath until they're on but I promise they will be done, Best Wishes, Adrian. Adrian Pingstone 20:19, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Aircraft pics Avianca pic is done. Delta Air Lines pic is done. Futura pic is done. (Antonio, I notice that Funchal (Madeira), where the plane was photographed, is not on the list in the article. Should it be?) Aeroperu pic is done. Monarch Airlines pic is done. Polar Air Cargo pic is done. There's no problem doing these pics, Antonio, I only didn't reply to you because I've had a busy time at home. Let me know any more you want, it's not a problem! Lots of luck, Adrian Pingstone 09:38, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Motorcycle deaths I wish you hadn't moved that page - misadventure was what I meant, not accident. What if somebody rode their bike into the Sahara and, getting lost, died of dehydration - that's a death by misadventure not accident (and it very nearly happened to one world traveller) You could at least have updated the link on the list of lists!

The last three I put in to WP were Aeroperu, Monarch and Polar Air Cargo, did you email me with some more? Incidentally, I don't know where you live, I have a feeling it's Mexico or Phoenix?

<p>[edit] Blocked Hi Antonio. I noticed you keep having problems where you are being blocked as a result of being on an AOL proxy. As you are a sysop, you can easily unblock yourself whenever this happens.

<p>[edit] Airline lists Hi Antonio. I spent some time tonight trying to reconcile the List of airlines and the Alphabetical list of airlines. I found many examples that were on one list but not the other, and quite a few that weren't on either. I think that until our coverage of Airlines past and present is more comprehensive, it will be much easier to maintain just one of these lists and turn the other into a redirect for now. What do you think? And if we were to redirect one, which one should we keep active? For the moment, I've updated both lists. --Rlandmann 12:33, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would you object too strongly if we kept the list of airlines as the main list? The only reason I suggest this is because I think the categorisation by region adds a lot to the list - it means that a reader straight away knows at least a little bit about that airline. Since you seem to be the most prolific contributor to the airline material around here, I'll accept whatever decision you make. But I think we need to do this soon, before the two lists have a chance to drift away from one another again! --Rlandmann 21:59, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC) [edit] Planes and pictures Yea I would happy to elp you with posting photos. I'v not posted any photos since I was never really sure about fair-use stuff, so I would be happy to post them- A lot of planes need picture to. I became interested in aircraft when I was little looking/reading books about planes and machines, my first flight that I actually remember was on new Boeing 777, very exciting.

What do you guys think? Antonio Spank me Baby! Martin</p>
<p>woohoo! Sam Spade 05:32, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC) Looking forward to it. &lt;KF&gt; 09:39, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC) I'm not personally enthusiastic about this as an encyclopedia article. I would think there are enough websites that deal with this. I think it would be much more interesting to try to document the ebb and flow of cinematic treatment of sexuality in general (just how hot was the 1913 movie Traffic in Souls? Just when did the Hollywood starting showing married couples' bedrooms with separate twin beds and no toilet in the bathroom? How much skin was exposed in movie prior to the institution of the Hays Office?

<p>Antonio Kelly's Lover Martin</p>
<p>If you check the history of that redirect you will find that that article contained just 2 sentences before it became a redirect, nearly the same information as you can find now in the list of characters of MwC. As I doubt there is much more to write about that character (note that wikipedia is not a fanzine, so a list of all her adventures in that series etc. are not much relevant for an encyclopedia) the redirect is perfectly fine, better than having a stub which is just a repetition of what is already written in the main article. andy 09:55, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC) True, but what I meant is, shouldnt anyone make that redirect dissapear? Its pointless anyways, its like I used to do when I was a rookie: for example, when I wrote the article about Wilfredo Gomez, I made this: Wilfredo Gomez instead of this: Wilfredo Gomez at the article's introduction. That was my second article, by the way, in September of 2002. Having a Kelly Bundy page redirecting to the same page we are reading is basically about the same. BTW; A little POV here, but I did HATE the way they portrayed Kelly as the dumb-blond. Very funny indeed, but poor blonds! Too stereotypical. It was almost as comparable as anyone saying that all Black men can do is play in the NBA!. Thanks and God bless you! Antonio Kelly's Nuts Martin</p>
<p>What you did for Wilfredo Gomez is correct--both the redirect (because people will type in the spelling that way) and the bold alternative in the article. Simliar for Kelly Bundy; if it's removed entirely, someone else might try to create an article with just stubby stuff in it. So it's fine as is. Elf | Talk 17:01, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC) Not entirely sure I follow what is meant here, but if you are referring to having a link to Kelly Bundy on the Married...with Children (which of course only redirects back to the same page), then that should be fixed. Just remove the link on Kelly Bundy. If you mean that you want Kelly's name to appear in bold on the MWC page, that would have to be manually formatted, though I don't think it would be appropriate by current style guidelines to bold the names of the stars in an article about the show. Bkonrad | Talk 17:36, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC) [edit] My Drawing Board Antonio, I know you meant well, but please don't edit my drawing board.

<p>[edit] Penis photo I didn't think you were being "too much of a jerk". I didn't think you were being a jerk at all! I'm glad the vagina picture was added back into the article, I am very much against censorship. I feel that if people do not want to look at pictures of genitals, they shouldn't look at the articles that are about them. As for being sued, I feel very strongly, that we should always strive to stick up for what we believe is right, and not allow ourselves to be bullied by people with more money than us. Besides there is no case to answer. A ten year old girl can look at all the pictures of penises she wants to in any public library. theresa knott 12:10, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>[edit] Public domain photos What exactly identifies a photo as public domain or not? I need to know because Ive been trying for decades (well, not really but it seems like it) to find non copyrighted photos of, say, Menudo, Marvin Hagler, Wilfredo Gomez, Pilar Montenegro, Lucecita Benitez and countless others.</p>
<p>The photos of airliners I get permission to use I find them easily, I just go to Airliners.net and ask for permission. It has been the other photos that have been hard for me to find permission of.</p>
<p>Thanks, and God bless you!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, Antonio Bird's nest Martin</p>
<p>AFAIK, an image is only public domain if the person who would otherwise own the copyright says so - so unless you happen upon a rich seem of such things, I think asking permission is the only way to go.

Wik: Weak has listed a number of people in a list of people he doesnt like or who are bad sysups and this list needs to be checked out by many trusted wikipedians. He calls people names. Indeed, but Wik isn't an admin. So there surely is no "admin action" to request a review of, no? -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 01:31, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC) Hi Antonio. I completely agree with you, but as Wik is not an admin, Requests for review of admin actions was not the right place for this. Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Wik2/Evidence might be more appropriate, though it has already been mentioned there. Angela. 01:43, Apr 28, 2004 (UTC) I think your edit to his user page was funny. theresa knott 10:29, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC) I think it was completely inappropriate, and a total act of vandalism from a sysop.

It's pretty appalling to me that a sysop would sink to something like that instead of taking more diplomatic action. - DropDeadGorgias (talk) 15:45, Apr 28, 2004 (UTC) That's pretty funny too. unless you were being serious, in which case it's even funnier. theresa knott 18:41, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC) Later &lt;stern schoolteacher peering over glasses look&gt; Ok Antonio, once was funny, but three times?

<p>[edit] Aircraft pics Antonio, I've got your email about the next three pics. I'm out tomorrow (Sunday), photographing at Bristol Airport, so it might be late Sunday (UK time) before I can put them on, Best Wishes, Adrian. Adrian Pingstone 18:32, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Enzo Fiermonte Antonio, I know you like boxing and wondered if you knew about some ancient boxing history. Apparently one of the wives of John Jacob Astor, Madeline Talmadge Force-Astor married an Italian boxer, Enzo Fiermonte? in 1933. She divorced him in 1938 and apparently paid him $17,000 to disappear (sounds sort of gigoloish....). Anyway, I was wondering if you could find out enough about him to see if he merits an article. -- Nunh-huh 05:47, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] School district question Since you live in Puerto Rico, I think you would be able to answer this question?</p>
<p>Does Puerto Rico close down its school system partially during inclement weather (E.G. on the east side, it is shut down, but not on the west side)?</p>

<p>[edit] Diet soda questions Please take a look at Talk:Diet soda. I've placed a couple of questions there that you may be able to answer since you wrote the original text in question. TreyHarris 16:47, 27 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Avianca I removed "with Air New Zealand Boeing 747 nearby" from the Avianca image caption, as it was clear which plane was Avianca, and I assumed that it would be of little immediate interest to readers of the article whether the visible tail was from a Boeing 747 or some other plane. It is of course worthwhile information to have on the image page, and is already there. Did you have a particular reason for wanting to keep the info in the caption? --Zigger 00:30, 2004 May 29 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Wikimedia Chapter Hello. If you have the ability, I think you should start a local Wikimedia chapter in Puerto Rico that would serve all of the Caribbean.</p>

<p>[edit] Current Sports Events The reactions on VP seem mostly favourable. Are you going to go for it? –Hajor 15:54, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Antonio: hi there. The pic on my user page is Egyptian, but not from the pyramids. It's the god Thoth, who appears -- well, he appears all over, but that one is on a wall in a truly astounding ruined temple called the Ramesseum, near the Valley of the Kings, about 500 km south of Cairo and the pyramids.</p>
<p>Current Sports News -- great plan; I'm glad to hear you're going to run with the idea. Re the other comment (seeking out links from other sites), I'm honestly not convinced that it's a great idea or worth the effort. Maybe you're younger and more enthusiastic/energetic than I am, but my days of going out and proselytizing are well and truly behind me now; I now prefer cultivating secret vices to promoting good causes. It's probably a good idea to write to a site and tell them you've written an article about them, but I wouldn't get too excited about encouraging them to link back to us (or expect it to happen, particularly on a commercial site). In any event, wikipedia's popularity already far outstrips that of many, many other websites, including -- I suspect -- those two you named on the VP. What the heck, write a letter, give it a shot, but don't expect too much or get your hopes up too high.</p>
<p>Dunno. Maybe I'm just a miserable old toad. Con un saludo, –Hajor 03:35, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Sharing with other sites from the pump On another topic, I wondered if I could ask the sites I have written about to spread the word about us. Ive tried hard to get my doctor, my pharmacist, my pastor, a cop, a boxing trainer, a former Marine and a pastor to be to help us. The only one who has been hired by me out of those is the former Marine my dad.</p>
<p>By asking some sites I visit and have written about, we might increase traffic, although two of these sites, Projectvoyeur.com and PurePanties.com are of dubious material.</p>
<p>Put your opinions down here, hehe: Antonio Porn Addict Martin</p>
<p>Dude, some things are best kept to yourself. Pcb21| Pete 08:56, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC) The question is shall we do that or not? Besides everyone here knows Im the Madonna of wikipedia! Antonio Wikidonna Martin If you think the webmaster of a site called purepanties.com can help improve the coverage of our articles on clothing, go ahead and ask. Without having visited the site however, I fear we would be more likely to attract spam than anything else! Pcb21| Pete 10:57, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC) Uh...I don't know. Are the people from "Project Voyeur" the spam-type?? --Menchi 11:44, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, what I meant by was like, if we should ask them to adversite us by mentioning us on their home pages. Besides, its not just those two websites. How about Airliners.net and a Christian band's website Im working with? If they could just put a note telling people to visit us, that would increase the page's hits and maybe bring more collaborators. --Antonio Manic Panic Martin !:16 AM 9 Jun 2004 (MST) [edit] Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports Hey Antonio, I noticed you popping up on my watchlist the last week, and I invite you to join: Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports. Burgundavia 07:04, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Welcome. Add your name to the list on the page. Currently we have finished all categorization of existing airports. We just today rolled out a test infobox to Hong Kong International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Frankfurt International Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and London Heathrow Airport. We are going to leave them in place for a week and are looking for comments at:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Airports/infobox. Generally read all the pages off the main Project page. If you have any further comments, drop a note my on my talk page. Burgundavia 09:16, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC) [edit] Airports Project Just an update on what is being done.</p>
<p>A test infobox was rolled out, and is still on several different pages. see Wikipedia:WikiProject_Airports/infobox for more info We are trying to get one airport for every country in the world. See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Airports/country for more info Burgundavia 03:32, Jun 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>[edit] Puerto Rico Unfortunately, Puerto Rico is not a country, so as such it belongs under the US. I know being a colony (effectively) of the US probably riles most PR's, this is legal status of the country. Burgundavia 09:26, Jun 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, sounds more complicated than Northern Cyprus and the Puntland. If the airports are considered to be in another country, then they shouldn't really be put in a subcategory of the US, I would think. Thus I will move it and place Puerto Rico back in the country page as well. As for the infobox, the rollout is going to happen, and all current airports will get it. I am going to devise a standard layout for all the pages. Anyway, thanks for the promp t and well considered response. Having local knowledge is infinitely useful. Cheers. As an aside, if you want to fill in the holes of the other Latin american countries, go nuts, it would certainly be appreciated.
