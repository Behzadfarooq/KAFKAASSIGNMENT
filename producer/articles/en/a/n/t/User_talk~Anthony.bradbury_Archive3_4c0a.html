<p>Hi there; I know it's been sitting there unchallenged for more than two years, but could you possibly document your statement that the belief that Saint Peter was held here is unfounded?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 22:51, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See the Catholic Encyclopedia article in the external links: "there is no reliable evidence that the Chief of the Apostles [i.e. Saint Peter] was ever imprisoned in the Tullianum". The article goes on to say that the claim seems to be first made in the Acts of Saints Processus and Martinianus, which were written hundreds of years after the event. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:48, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem. It's always valid to go back and ask past editors to clarify which source is intended to support which point, particularly with articles like that one which haven't been updated to use footnote-style references yet.

<dd>Well, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence!</dd>
<dd>To the best of my (inexpert) knowledge, there is no particular reason to believe that St Peter was <i>not</i> held there. It seems more to be a case of scholars preferring to take a sceptical view of any story that first appears so late. The tradition itself is likely to be considerably older than the written legend, so I would think it can be considered plausible: it just cannot be proven true or false.</dd>
<dd>(I have modified the article to reflect that it is best described as a tradition, not a "misconception" or a "former == The Lonesome Guest ==</dd>

<p>What is the story in The Lonesome Guest?... After earning a Ph.D. in Literature and Philosophy from the University of Heidelberg in 1921 he worked as a journalist and tried for several years to become a published author. His work included an autobiographical novel called Michael which no publisher would take at the time, and two plays written in verse - The Wanderer, about Jesus Christ, and The Lonesome Guest - which no producer would stage. belief".) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:21, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the speedy reply.

<dd>I will if I need to. I was aware of that page, however I was just doing things differently before. I was using the {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletebecause_5e38.html" title="Template:Deletebecause">deletebecause</a>}} tag, filling the reason in as "Unremarkable people, groups, companies and web content"... The same text listed under Articles (#7) on that page. I was doing a round-about route instead of directly using tags such as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}}. Now that you have helped me to clearify what I should be doing, I'm pretty sure that I'll get things right.

<p>I appreciate your help! I've been on wikipedia for about a year, but never started making serious changes until recently.

<p>Because you have presented me an oppurtunity to ask a question, I figured I could get something answered that has bothered me for some time. In the event someone creates a page about themselves, how do you move the page to the person's userpage? I tried using the moving pages, and I am attempting to follow the guidelines of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserfication_cba5.html" title="Wikipedia:Userfication">Wikipedia:Userfication</a>, but I don't want to mess anything up. An example of this is Morishige joe.

<dd>Two options. You can always tag it as {{speedy-bio}}. If you want to move it, just hit the "move" tag at the top of the screen, and in the box that appears near the bottom of the move-page type in "User talk:whoever". Then go to their talk page, where you will find a blue tag saying "redirect from Userpage:whoever". Click on this tag, which will take you to the userpage, and edit to remove the redirect.

In future, you might also want to consider allowing more than a few dozen minutes for the original author to finish making an article before deciding it has no content. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhialto_3647.html" title="User:Rhialto">Rhialto</a> 03:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. I wasn't aware of the "under construction" tag. My intention with the article, as with the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_World_War_II_destroyers_02a6.html" title="German World War II destroyers">German equivalent</a>, is not to replace the ones on specific classes but to try to summarise the classes and trace the evolution and changes. I think there's also a case for the equivalent for the US and for cruiser classes. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 15:11, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good morning! I'm honoured both to be your adoptee and the FIRST ever adoptee, wow. I was wondering if you could help me answer this question then: What's the code to express that I can translate French into English and vice versa? I'm guessing it would be two lines, but I can only find the French code (I've registered on the French site as well, how bizarre that they are two totally different sites that require two user names and registration processes...) I've read the tutorial and practiced in the sandbox like a good little girl. Now off to do some proofreading. <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylviaroberge_53a8.html" title="User:Sylviaroberge">Sylviaroberge</a> 08:43, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course Anthony I agree that anyone can edit a page, but in this case this page was DELETED - and not just anyone can do that. And because it was deleted all the page history has gone (or is not generally accessible) and so I cant revert the delete - if you know how to then please do. IMHO the Admin that deleted this article should be shot, or at least questioned about their actions. As it was obviously that <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abaana.html" title="Abaana">Abaana</a> was not CSD material and an Admin should have tagged it PROD or AFD. This sort of action is what drives noobs away (the noob in question here User:Abaana has had their first two articles deleted with CSDs even though they were both likely noteworthy).</p>
<p>Sorry this has made me very cross - I will seek to bring this to the attention on the Admins and try and get it sorted. Many thanks <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_f0fa.html" title="User:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 23:40, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am no deletionist, and I would gladly keep your article if you showed me some viable evidence that it passes notability guidelines. On multiple occasions I have overruled previous decisions and favored restoring the article because a user presented some evidence that asserted the article's notability. If you do so, then I will definitely change my position and throw support for keeping the article. And...by proof, I mean some actual 3rd-party references that asserts the organization's notability. If it follows one guideline of <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, then it's a keeper. Lethaniol failed to show me anything that asserts the notability of the organization. P.S.

<dd>Hey you remember that <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_Tariff_eddf.html" title="Drug Tariff">Drug Tariff</a>, the article is still a stub, but its still got useful info and links on. I suppose that article was my inspiration for this discussion (but in that case you added a PROD appropriately I think considering your info).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was a noob then, and it was painful to see someone request the deletion of one of my first pages. Now I see the same happening often with noobs when New Pages patrolling, they are often treated harshly when some are testing and others (like in this case obviously) are trying to add good content (if not always notable). This case pains me in particular as this charity is obviously international in scale, and does a lot of good, yet I see "junk" articles all the time about this and that sports person or local company - I feel this is what wikipedia is for (even if I don't like missionary organisations!)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your help though - it is nice to have support - sorry to bring up the age issue - is not really relevant and detracts from the arguments. Oh well.

<dd>Although I disapprove of the tone of your comments you made on my talk page (which I translate as you thinking that I am incapable of making decisions), I am dropping my case on <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abaana.html" title="Abaana">Abaana</a>. After looking it over, I have reconsidered the deletion, as it seems keeping the article would be of best interest for Wikipedia. By the way, 14000 Ghits is not a lot. Visit AfD, and you'll see many articles get deleted when they have 50k+ hits on Google. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 21:58, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>You might well be right, and when it looks like it could be an article in progress I generally hold off tagging it and stick it on my watchlist if I think deletion would cause the author to have to re-do a good deal of editing. In this case I reckon if (s)he does have to re-start from scratch there are only a couple of lines to retype. I suppose I should use {{blank-warn}} more in these cases!

<p>Hi - the program is thoroughly manually run, like <a href="../../../v/p/r/WP%7EVPRF_2210.html" title="WP:VPRF">VP</a>, so I decided to brandish it nonsense - realistically because, as you noted, it is a clear deletion candidate, and also because I wanted to check the warning system in the program for nonsense (I'm yet to find the templates for attack pages). I hope this clears it up, and by the by, I'm looking for testers for it, so if you're interested, just let me know&#160;:) <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 00:17, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there; I was just warning this user when you beat me to it. Although you gave him a final warning, I could not see any previous examples of his vandalism. They may, of course, have been deleted. Please tell me to mind my own business if you are so moved, but you do know, I trust, that wiki policy is to give a suspected vandal four warnings, of increasing firmness, before blocking him/her? Giving a level four warning for a first offence is liable to result in no admin being willing to block, which negates your effort.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 01:06, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
