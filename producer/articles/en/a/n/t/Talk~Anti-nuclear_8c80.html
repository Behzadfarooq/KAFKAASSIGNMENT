	    <p>In theory, "anti-nuclear" could mean a number of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>It could mean opposition to <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>, as the current introduction suggests: <i>The anti-nuclear movement holds that nuclear power is inherently dangerous and thus ought to be "replaced with safe and affordable renewable energy".</i> See also the <a href="http://www.ecologia.org/newsletter/year90/jan90c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ecologia.org/newsletter/year90/jan90c.html" rel="nofollow">external link</a> currently in the introduction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It could mean those opposed to <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>, that is the disarmament movement. This is presumably the sense in which those who redirected <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-nuclear_movement.html" title="Anti-nuclear movement">anti-nuclear movement</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament_1b48.html" title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> took the term. As its name suggests, the CND website concerns itself primarily with nuclear weapons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It could mean those opposed to <i>both</i> nuclear weapons and nuclear power. In practice, groups (including CND) opposed to one have traditionally opposed the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction has become more relevant with several prominent environmentalists recently suggesting that nuclear power may be preferable to fossil fuel. Pro-nuclear environmentalism has been an insignificant minority view (to which I admit to subscribing) up until now, but may be becoming more politically viable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 01:52, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The lack of Pro (for) Nuclear Power Arguments while Anti Nuclear Arguments are being presented seems to be in clear violation of Wikipedia's NPOV policy. I am proposing a "arguments for nuclear power " section. Revengeofthynerd 04:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed many parts of this article actually said very little about what anti nuclear groups believe, and seemed to be written as to present the arguments against nuclear power. As Wikipedia is intended to be Encyclopedic, I tried to rewrite it in the form "Anti-nuclear groups believe" or "Anti-nuclear groups claim" as this is more descriptive and encyclopedic. In particular, the part on energy conservation said a lot about what energy conservation was, which I believe is material which belongs in the article's on energy conservation rather than here. I think it would be better if this article focused on what anti nuclear groups believe and how they tend to differ from their opponents. Thus "Energy conservation can replace nuclear power" is POV and unsuitable, whereas "anti-nuclear groups consider energy conservation a preferable and realistic alternative to nuclear power" is much more NPOV and more encyclopedic. Also, the referencing could need some work. Wikipedia has a great referencing system and seeing that there already is a lot of articles on the subject in the external links section it should be possible to utilise it better. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.Ring_0f58.html" title="User:J.Ring">J.Ring</a> 01:27, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's true that opposition to nuclear power is rooted in the ban-the-bomb movement of the 1950s, but it didn't get started until the 1970s. In between, the same people concentrated on the Vietnam War, even in Europe. In the US, this movement was sympathetic to, but competed with, the civil-rights and free-speech movements.</p>
<p>Along with those political movements was a second stream, a counterculture one, that rejected materialism and middle-class conventions. To a large extent, this second group's membership overlapped the first's.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, many people became aware that large-scale industry and agrichemistry were threatening the environment, so a third, broader stream became highly vocal, though distinctly more middle-class.</p>
<p>These three streams, as well as the anti-war and free-speech movements, joined together to form what is commonly called the environmental movement. The Green Party and new political-activist groups started, such as Friends of the Earth and Union of Concerned Scientists, as well as numberless smaller groups. The Sierra Club changed from a conservation club to another political organization.</p>
<p>In all these groups, anti-nuclear concepts were combined with malthusian beliefs, anti-materialistic principles, anti-government prejudice, anti-business convictions, and faith in renewable energy. The combination worked for adherents because it was internally consistent but failed for the general public because the parts were inseparable. The movement was never successful politically, but was able to attract minor celebrities and promote its doctrines, helped by scientifically untrained journalists whose primary goal was to obtain watchable film footage. Its success did not depend on justifying its beliefs, but only on creating doubt in the public mind about the safety of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>There never has been a pro-nuclear movement. The only people who advocate nuclear energy are scientists, engineers, and the people who've worked in the field. They've never organized. Cde3 06:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
