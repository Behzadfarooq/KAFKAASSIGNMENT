<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if "Christianophobia" is meant as a Christian analog of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a>, then it should refer to only to an deeply ingrained fear and/or hatred of Christians, specifically because of their Christianity. This may be a legitimate problem in some cases, but, in my opinion, the writers of this article seem to be applying this definition to many things that the term really shouldn't apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything expressing even remotely anti-Christian sentiment, or even simple disagreement with the tenants of Christianity. Even <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">Apostasy</a> seems to fall under the author's definition of Christianophobia.</li>
<li>Things that aren't specifically against Christians/Christianity, but are targetted against ANY belief system other than that of the group in question. These are cases of general <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_intolerance.html" title="Religious intolerance">Religious intolerance</a>, not Christianophobia.</li>
<li>Placing blame for events like the Crusades on Christianity. It might be unfair to personally blame a modern Christian for these, but the Christians of the time <i>were</i> responsible for these, so it's hardly unfair to call this Christianophobia. Mind you, some of these events might be a contributing <i>cause</i> of some culture's properly-labeled Christianophobia, so it could be a legitmate point to bring up in the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I'm not sure if this article is savable. Other than the term itself, it doesn't seem to be saying anything that isn't already covered on the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> page. While that page has it's share of controversy, it at least seems to -try- to be neutral. The best thing to do might be to reduce this page to a short description of the term, and then link to the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> for details.</p>

<p>"Christianophobia is very intense in Muslim countries" - what kind of blanket statement is this? This page needs to be purged of its major POV, if it needs to exist at all. --<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraic_5df6.html" title="User:Padraic">Padraic</a> 19:52, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has gotten notably better recently, but still has a long way to go. The new opening and the "Causes of" sections are good and I think pretty fairly neutral. However the 'Effects of' section seems pretty biased, and I still think the whole 'history' section is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> material at best, and could very well deserve to be dumped entirely.</p>

<dd>i agree that the history could go. how would you suggest fixing the "effects of" section to make it more neutral? <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 15:24, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How about deleting it entirely? Most of the points are practically unsubstantiatable. The phrase "many Christians perceive' comes up in half the points, which alone should invalid them as valid 'effects'. The last point wants to blame a whole <i>slew</i> of things on "Christianophobia" - while some of these might fall under <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> (ie the attempted purging of the Russian Orthodox church), I wouln't blame ANY of them on "fear/hatred of christians" - <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacula_c10e.html" title="User:Pacula">Pacula</a> 20:13, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>i understand that you wouldn't blame it on christianophobia, but many christians do. do a quick google search on "christianophobia" and "christophobia" and you'll read a lot of opinions to that effect. there's a lot about media portrayals, the exclusion of christianity from the EU constitution, and a lot of stuff from canada. it's a widely used term used by christians to describe their experiences. it doesn't qualify as <i>persecution</i> per se -- because it's more subtle and culturally based. i don't see the purpose in deleting those views as long as they're attributed -- if you'd like balance, there are a lot of "christianophobia is a bunch of crap" articles other there too you could summarize ... <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 01:28, 10 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ungtss, your recent additions to the 'effects of' section are making it worse POV-wise, not better. Calling stuff like keeping nativity scenes off public property 'fear/hatred of christians' is silly - at <i>worst</i> it could be considered <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a> gone too far. Also, the idea of there not being <b>any</b> positive portrayals of Christians in seven year's worth of film is laughable - and using a quote like that from a non-christian to turn 'many christians believe' into 'many people believe' is a pretty dishonest way of dodging my earlier complaint. - <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacula_c10e.html" title="User:Pacula">Pacula</a>
<dl>
<dd>I can definitely understand where you're coming from. I suggest that the solution here is to keep in mind the structure of npov -- it doesn't mean that all readers have to think that all views expressed in the page are good -- it means simply that all views be relevant and attributed to those who hold them -- pro AND con. the bit about nativity scenes (although often seen as laughable) is seen by others as quite serious -- particularly the person who wrote the linked article. I would be <i>thrilled</i> if you would add a "criticism of christianophobia" section that summarizes the many criticisms of this concept, in order to add balance. I'd gladly do it myself, but i think that given my "christianophobia exists" bias, i wouldn't be as qualified to do it as you. would you be willing to do that to add balance to the article, rather than simply deleting the views which you find to be groundless? the purpose of wikipedia is to provide the sum of human knowledge. christianophobia as a concept exists -- and there are arguments pro and con for whether it exists in <i>reality</i>. would you be willing to provide the "con?" <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 00:37, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I had been avoiding editing the article myself directly, because in all honesty I don't really know THAT much about the subject - just that my 'BS-detector' went off when reading the original article. But in all fairness, since I'm the original complainer, I should at least make an attempt. I'll read it over carefully and see what I can do, mainly with the 'Effects of' section, which I might turn into a 'count-vs-counterpoint', which probably will end up being biased too far the other way...&#160;:) - <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacula_c10e.html" title="User:Pacula">Pacula</a> 20:27, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly, I don't like this article or anything about it. Unfortunately, I'd say the same thing about <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> or <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a>. This is a valid, encyclopedic article whose topic is fundamentally (no pun intended) different from both <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_intolerance.html" title="Religious intolerance">Religious intolerance</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a>. Religious Intolerance deals with an attitude where particular religious <b>beliefs or acts</b> are either prohibited, abhorred or suppressed. Persecution refers primarily to a <b>governmental or societal</b> attack upon a particular religious belief system. The term Christianophobia deals with a <b>personal</b> revulsion, fear or prejudice felt by individuals or groups toward an individual based solely on the knowledge of the target's Christianity. It is not intolerance because the feelings are toward the practitioner not the practice; it is not persecution because it is personal, not societal. I think this is a valid topic. On the other hand, that does nothing to solve the fact that the article is POV-saturated. It will be very hard for anyone, especially any North American, to find a NPOV from which to write. We are so steeped in religion that neutral ground is difficult to find. Also, the article needs to dump a lot of the martyrdom references, since few resulted from Christianophobia. Stick to things that are NOT state-sponsored or resulting from overt acts contravening local custom or law. A good example would be the killing of missionaries in India. PS: Neologism was a neologism in 1800, and Wikipedia is one today. We make up words constantly to describe new, newly recognized or newly differentiated concepts. To knock articles out on this basis is, at best, arbitrary and an attempt to "nail down" a living language (with nods and obeisance to the WikiGods). <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin Wells</a> 18:59, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whomever (untss?) has been making the most recent changes has been doing a reasonbly good job - I'm still not sure what to do with this whole article, but it's looks less and less like something that deserves to be deleted. The mostly-new 'critisism of' section definately seems fair and helps to counter out some of the bias in the previous sections - except the 'effects of' which while improved a bit still needs major work or a trip to the bitbucket. Still though, I think the word is too much a neologism to deserve it's own article - perhaps after the current 'delete' situtation settles (which I must emphaize I did NOT initiate - I had considered it,but I'm still too much a 'n00b' here to make that kinf of descion), the good parts of this article (quite a few now) could me merged to a 'modern persecution' section of the 'percectution of chrtisians' page (perhaps even calling it something like <i>christianophobia - fear and persecution of christians in the modern world</i>), and the current page redirected there. My own 'deleteion' vote is currently remains 'delete', though if the article improves significantly more, I'd be more than happen to change my vote to 'merge' with POC.</p>

<p>I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm starting to think that this page is getting close to where is should be.

<p>This seems to be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> -- even though a very famous and influential person coined the word, it's still just a neologism.

<dd>After reading through the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> pages, I'm in complete agreement that this is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> and that this page should be at least considered for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deletion.html" title="Deletion">deletion</a>. I'm not completely convinced that deletion is the best idea though - even though it is almost unarguably a neologism, perhaps the page itself should be kept because of the term's origin. In this case, the page should be reduced to a quick description of the term and where it came from.

<dd>The problem is that the article as written has NOTHING to do with any 'real' christianophobia, which as I understand it is a relatively recent issue, or even if it really is a real issue at all. This entire article is about historical percecution of christians and general religious intolerance, and has nothing at all to with 'irrational fear (and possible persecution) of christians because of their christianity', which is what I understand the word is supposed to mean. Also, I would not consider 'irrational fear of western civilization in general' to be the same thing as christianophobia, since though christianity is common and traditional in most 'western' countries, it is far from universal. - <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacula_c10e.html" title="User:Pacula">Pacula</a> 21:12, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I wish to throw my weight behind deletion. First, it is a neologism. Second, the article is clearly biased. Among other errors it follows the rights current path of arguing that somehow underrepsented minorities have become some powerful that they are oppressing the majoirity. To argue, as this article does, that only christians are capable of democrat government is racism of the worst kind. The article devalues the views of Islamic countries which oppose Christian mercanaries, but not Christian practice. The Shari'a is clear prohibiting prosletizing of all religions, except Islam, so why is this anti-christian. It is pro-Islamic, not a good thing, but not anti-chrisian specifically.</p>

<dd>I'm in agreement that deletion isn't the solution to a POV issue, but I had been thinking that the original article was SO bad that it needed to be started over from scratch. Also, 'christianophobia' arguably is a neologism, which <i>is</i> a possibly valid reason for deletion - though I am unsure if this is the case here. Some of the new material added since my original complaint is actually quite good and unbiased (the opening and the 'causes of' section) but the 'effects of' section is extremely biased, and (as I've already said multiple times) the whole 'history' section belongs on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_intolerance.html" title="Religious intolerance">Religious intolerance</a>, if not deleted outright. - <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacula_c10e.html" title="User:Pacula">Pacula</a> 12:34, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meaning what - that Christians <i>are</i> Nazis, I suppose? There's a tidy illustration of what the article is talking about, I suppose! But, I have a strong suspicion that it took someone a lot of work to dig up this term. Personally, I would be profoundly disappointed to hear the words, <i>Christianophobia</i>, or <i>Christianophobe</i>, slipping into common use. The article is overblown given the rarity of use, it substantially overlaps <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> (at least in principle - that article is now a horrible mess, too), it doesn't provide the a better venue for discussing, and the article quickly runs out of real material and devolves into a recursive examination of how the word might be applied. Like other "-ophobe" concepts it has a political and rhetorical payload which it hopes to spread by popularizing the use of the terminology. I don't think it is encyclopedic to publish usage guides for politically charged neo-logisms. A brief history of the origins and meaning of the word, and the phenomenon it symbolizes, is the most that it deserves. <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 22:26, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While Weigel may have written on a book on this subject, I have to take issue with whether some of the things he lists are actually causes of christianophobia.</p>
<p><i>George Weigel attributes christianophobia today to a number of causes</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The rejection of Christianity in favor of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular_humanism.html" title="Secular humanism">secular humanism</a> by many European and American intellectuals in the 19th century.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The link between this and an "irrational fear of Christians" seems tenuous to me. This is an example of individuals making personal choices, and given they the fact they were intellectuals, the presumption should be that it was a rational, not an irrational choice. One can choose to be a secular humanist without having an irrational fear of Christians. To compare, would you say that "the rejection of the Jewish faith in favor of secular humanism by many European and American intellectuals in the 19th century" was inherently anti-Semitic?
<dl>
<dd>After the article makes a distinction between a <b>phobia</b> of Christians, and simply not being one, this claim blurs that distinction. The article is not self-consistant. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireWeed_ada3.html" title="User:FireWeed">FireWeed</a> 22:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>The experience of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, which many European intellectuals concluded was the logical outcome of Christian bigotry through the centuries</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have not heard this claim much, but if intellectuals made this claim, then even if they are wrong, it's not an <i>irrational</i> fear...regardless of whether the link is warranted or not, they are citing verifiable historical events, so the claim that this is an <i>irrational</i> conclusion doesn't hold up (it may be an <i>incorrect</i> rational claim, but that's another matter)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>Europe's present associations of "religiosity" with "America," and in particular with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, who still scores reliably high negatives in opinion polls across the continent</i></li>

<dd>Has it ever come across both your minds that the number of Christians killed might actually be larger than you percieve or are even told, especially considering the difficulty and inaccuracy of body counts? And that doesn't even count any instances of suicide by the persecuted. 'Dubious' indeed. In addition, the source of the data is cited, so the reader can verify for her/himself the validity of the claim.

<dd>Please sign (and date) your posts. It seems this discussion happened two years ago, but it's not entirely clear when you replied.</dd>
<dd>In line with the question you asked, has the thought occured to you that many of the people included in your statistic were killed for their ethnicity and not their religion? Normally that would be splitting hairs, but when you say "... killed <u>on account</u> of their beliefs ..." you've already made the distinction.

<dd>The nice thing about <i>Anti-Christian prejudice</i> is that it means exactly what it says. <i>Christianophobia</i>, like <i>anti-Semitism</i> and "homophobia", seems to suffer from a confusion between "unfavorable mental attitude" and "hate-motivated behavior", while the word itself means "fear of Christians" (and <i>Christophobia</i> would literally mean "Fear of Christ"!).

<p>My edits have been reversed (in some ways) twice now by Pollinator, and while I have (in my opinion, anyway) attempted to frame the section "Issues Concerning the American Government" in an un-biased way, the statements Pollinator has added are mildly to heavily biased, including the following:</p>
<p>"including the intelligent design, anti-abortion and opposition to the homosexual agenda."</p>
<p>It could be argued that a "gay agenda" does not exist. Thus, I propose that to make the statement less POV we add the phrase "opposition to gay rights" and link it to the article of the same name.</p>
<p>Also, we have this from the same section:</p>
<p>"while the ACLJ seeks to define separation of church and state in the same way as the founding fathers, and that policies designed to foster religious tolerance are actually intolerant of Christians. A large part of the ACLJ caseload involves defending the first ammendment rights of Christian students who are denied freedom of speech or assembly by school administrations, while other groups do not encounter this same discrimination."</p>
<p>Which, unlike the questionable stauts of the last statement, is blatantly POV. If anyone would like to discuss this, feel free. I also think that we might want to expand some areas of the article concerning discrimination against Christians in other nations.</p>

I personally have encountered many Christians who have been discriminated against (speech-wise) in school administrations and colleges, but I think that though this is more publicized (and maybe even more common), other groups do encounter discrimination in this way as well.

<dd>While I prefer to speak a little more eloquently, I must agree basically with the point of view expressed above. This article seems to be the English Wikipedia's Christian equivalent of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>, which is a much more neutral term. I have plenty of anti-Christian <i><b>sentiment</b></i>, but I really don't like a supposedly neutral encyclopedia openly accusing me and those with similar views of "religious intolerance...stereotyping, discrimination, [and] persecution", when in fact my views are inspired by the obvious fact that Christianity has always promoted intolerance, bigotry and hatred. I am a universalist, in that I believe that all mythologies and philosophies ("religions" in common terminology) deserve to be allowed to exist and continue to flourish. Christianity (and to a lesser extent Judaism and Islam) has always sought to proselytize all others - paganism throughout Europe, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto, Taoism, etc. - into extinction. It's right there in their "holy" scriptures. I've researched it. I am not guilty of prejudice, as I believe any "Christian" who is not actually an intolerant bigot is about as good as a non-Christian. Whereby this article must be saved, for there is not salvation in any previous editor, it seems, for their names are not given under heaven. Or something. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">elvenscout742</a> 01:10, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we reading the same article? The one I read might as well have said "Christians make trouble and then whine when people don't like them so here's their whiner persecution-complex word." It says little to nothing of majority non-Christian societies and the prejudice Christians still face their. Granted much of that fits <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a>, but some is just general prejudice. What you're saying of Christianity makes me think you think it's not clear enough that "Christianity is bad so it deserves it's intolerance and here's why." Also of course you are prejudiced. Your view on Christianity is nothing but prejudice. What matters is if you're prejudice is justified.

<p>Elvenscout, your views seem to be a bit prejudiced and so I wouldn't be surprised if someone did accuse you of being a bigot or intolerent. The very fact that you claim all Christians are intolerent (or Non-Christian) shows both your lack of understanding of teh scriptures you have read, or the fact that you have read a book and thought it was the Bible, and your intolerence. I am not intolerent, I agree with teh choice to belief what you wish, I think all good people will go to heaven, I have no problems with Homosexuality and I respect all other faiths...I also believe in parts of other faiths...but I am a Christian and I am slightly annoyed that you are making an attack on all christians. Please do not be a bigot, I will say again that Religious Intolerence is as bad as Racism, Homophobia, Sexism and all other intolerences. Idi Amin wouldn't have thought himself a tyrant! <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigurd_Dragon_Slayer_429f.html" title="User:Sigurd Dragon Slayer">Sigurd Dragon Slayer</a></p>

<p>Secularism hasn't been much better going back to the French Revolution when people, including my ancestor, lost their heads because they were Christians. Secular regimes have murdered more Christians in the name of tolerance and equality in France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Russia, China, Nazi Germany, etc., than all of the Inquisitions or religious wars combined. BTW, Germany of Hitler's time was largely secular. Secular regimes are responsible for the deaths of 10s of millions people in the name of tolerance, science, open-mindedness, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe Stalin, Mao and Robespierre are the typical atheist, or at least who atheists should look up to. LOL.</p>
<p>Maybe the Inquisition wasn't so bad after all, considering maybe 300,000 people were killed in all of Europe over its 800 year history, or roughly 375 people per year in a continent of 30 million people.</p>
<p>BTW, why is these same Christianophobic bigots always ignore the good Christianity has brought into the world. If it wasn't for the Catholic Church; universities wouldn't have developed in Europe; the learning of the ancient world would have been lost, and if it wasn't for the development of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholasticism.html" title="Scholasticism">Scholasticismin</a> the Catholic Church, modern science never would have developed. I guess the intolerant Catholic missionaries were real evil men when they allowed themselves to be murdered by the Spanish as they took up arms to prevent the enslavement of the Indians.

</dl>
<p>Here's the fallacy of your perspective. If all religions are true, then Christianity is true. Therefore if Christianity is true, and Jesus taught that he was the only way to attain unity and peace with God, then the theory that all religions are true is also false. Logically speaking. Besides, how can you prove that all religions are the same or worthy.</p>
<p>Would those of you who hate Christianity because it teaches that it alone has truth consider the Aztec religion or Celtic religions that practiced human sacrifice to be just as good as others? Perhaps human sacrifice should return to Europe, just as it was practiced by the Druids and other pagan groups.</p>
<p>It's a contradiction in terms to say that all philosophies/religions should be allowed to exist, save one: Christianity. Secular fundies are so hypocritical because on one side they say everyone has to be tolerant, but that tolerance excludes Christians. In the malignant secularist viewpoint, in action not words, Christians are supposed to be second-class citizens who are supposed to sit in a corner and be quiet.<a href="http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ470.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ470.HTM" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<ul>
<li>That's a straw man argument. I don't know any secularists who say that all religions should be allowed to exist except for Christianity. Do you have counterexamples, or are you just stereotyping/exaggerating? Most secularists I know are happy for all religions to co-exist as long as their followers don't try to force others to follow the same religion. The often aggressive attempts by some Christians to force others to live by the same Christian rules (as they interpret them) is where the problems begin. (And most people who say Christianity shouldn't exist say the same thing about all other religions.) <a href="../../../g/o/u/User%7EGoulo_62ba.html" title="User:Goulo">Goulo</a> 07:16, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Christianity and secularism have a unique relationship. The West is secularism's home turf, and Christianity, as the dominant religion in the West, is the only religion that has faced secularism's constant and focused challenge, with the exceptions of Judaism and Shinto (and those cases are exceptional in other ways). No religion in the world has had to face secularism the way Christianity has. The Muslim world has been spared such a confrontation, and most religions of the Far East are by their natures seldom at odds with secularism. In the West, especially Eastern Europe, secularism has on occasion been more aggressive than any religion in history in forcing people to follow its rules, so the claim that aggression is foreign to secularism does not stand. Goulo, you have to admit that some secularists sometimes take up the defense of non-Christian religions thinking "the enemy of my enemy is my friend", and that others sometimes even take up the defense of non-Christian religions as a weapon with which to attack Christianity. That by no means happens often, but it happens. There are aggressive people in any belief system, including secularism, who will use, and have used, any means at their disposal to deal with their enemies. You seem to be sending one straw man against another. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 17:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To quote GK Chesterton,"There is no bigot quite like an atheist."</p>
<p>Chesterton was also fond of pointing out just how narrow-minded the Pharisees of tolerance and indifferentism were because their open-mindedness was limited. It was limited by the fact, the admission the Christian God was real would undermine their universe.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A Christian is only restricted in the same sense that an atheist is restricted. He cannot think Christianity false and continue to be a Christian; and the atheist cannot think atheism false and continue to be an atheist. But as it happens, there is a very special sense in which materialism has more restrictions than spiritualism. Mr. McCabe thinks me a slave because I am not allowed to believe in determinism. I think Mr. McCabe a slave because he is not allowed to believe in fairies. But if we examine the two vetoes we shall see that his is really much more of a pure veto than mine. The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe. But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle. Poor Mr. McCabe is not allowed to retain even the tiniest imp, though it might be hiding in a pimpernel. The Christian admits that the universe is manifold and even miscellaneous, just as a sane man knows that he is complex. The sane man knows that he has a touch of the beast, a touch of the devil, a touch of the saint, a touch of the citizen. Nay, the really sane man knows that he has a touch of the madman. But the materialist’s world is quite simple and solid, just as the madman is quite sure he is sane. The materialist is sure that history has been simply and solely a chain of causation, just as the interesting person before mentioned is quite sure that he is simply and solely a chicken. Materialists and madmen never have doubts."<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/orthodoxy.v.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/orthodoxy.v.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>I really did not want my view of Christianity to play a part in this, but to point out the systemic bias on English-language Wikipedia when this article is allowed to exist and there is no <i>Anti-Hindu prejudice</i>, <i>Anti-Jewish prejudice</i>, <i>Anti-Buddhist prejudice</i> or <i>Anti-Muslim prejudice</i>. There is no need for this article, and its name clearly indicates an assumption of bad faith - "prejudice" is an inherently derogatory term, accusing the target of ignorant bigotry, even when they could have rational reasoning. I included the broken link to Anti-Christian sentiment and the comparison to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> as part of this, and then (I admit) went off on an off-topic tangent. Please do not accuse me of "anti-Christian prejudice" - I am merely raising the valid point that this article is heavily biased, and my conflicting views (which I generally keep in check on Wikipedia) are irrelevant. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">elvenscout742</a> 20:21, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Elven, we already have an article for positions that might be based on rational reasoning, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Christianity_6a03.html" title="Criticisms of Christianity">Criticisms of Christianity</a>. Irrational, ignorant, bigoted, and ill-informed views against Christianity--and I could point out an example for you--have a needed home in this article. If you plan to go off on any more of your "off-topic tangents" (I would use a different term), you should first revise your "research" methods. If you had done your research properly, you would know that secularism (your claimed "religion") drove Shinto to near-extinction, not Christianity, and that Buddhism (your example of a non-proselytizing faith) is actually one of the three great missionary religions, alongside Christianity and Islam. On a final note, I hope that the other editors' replies have made you aware that no religion in history has has ever used as much violence in asserting itself as your secularism has. I hope that knowledge lets you realize the shortcomings of relying on guilt by association. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 17:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not really - the Jews killed by the Nazis could not change their race, and it was not a valid indicator of their political allegiances or any such thing. The Third Reich was just a racist institution that had no interest in real facts, while anti-Christian sentiment could quite reasonably be caused by narrow-minded televangelist bigots personally giving Christianity a bad name.

<dd>People are resposible for their own actions, because they freely choose those actions. People who freely choose to persecute and discriminate against Christians are the only people responsible for that persecution and descrimintation. No one else could ever "cause" them to freely choose to do those things, only "give them cause". Being "given cause" by no means always means "being given good cause", and in my mind, there is NEVER good cause for persecution and discrimination (you seem to be of a different mind). If Christians do "cause" others to persecute and discriminate against themselves, as you claim, well, Christians must have their very own sci-fi mind control devices. On the other hand, if Christains give others cause to persecute and discriminate against themselves, the people who choose to act on that (which is faulty as hell anyway) are still the only ones responsible. Either way, your claim that the victims are to blame is at best illogical, and at worst...well...a lot worse. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 18:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is looking much better than when I came by here a few months back. Kudos to the recent editors. Lots to do yet, though, at least on finding citations to support most of the "reasons" for Christophobia. By the way, the Pope used <i>Christophobia</i>, and since other references in this article appear to have been swept with a broad brush into this new <i>Christianophobia</i> standard there are likely conflicts with cited sources there (whether it seems grammatically correct to the editors or not). 64.111.226.46 11:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Christians make up 33% of the world's population. If they made up 51% they would be the majority, but that is not the case. Being the largest minority makes Christians neither the worldwide majority, nor a majority in every country of the West. America, with 85% of its population Christians, is an exception, not the rule. Most countries with such large populations of Christians are outside the Modern West in the Third World of South America and Africa. Europe, part of the Modern West, is largely secularist these days. Christians form minorities in Sweden, Albania, Denmark, Russia, Estonia, and the Czech Republic, for example, and larger minorities or slim majorities in a good number of other countries in the Modern West. Christians have suffered persecution in the Middle and Far East, but in the Modern West like nowhere else. The persecutions Christians suffered in Eastern Europe during the 20th century at the hands of Modern Western political ideology are staggering. The persecutions against Christians undertaken by the Communist states of the Modern West stand as the largest and most extensive religious persecutions in history--Modern, Western, or otherwise--and those carried on into our own lifetimes. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 09:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How is that POV or biased? That the proponents of the Modern Western political ideology of Marxism in the Modern West have persecuted Christians like no one else in history is a matter of historical record attested to by numerous historians, scholars, and other acedemics. Read the article on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_the_Soviet_Union_b08b.html" title="Religion in the Soviet Union">Religion in the Soviet Union</a>, and the sections about the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution of Christians</a> for descriptions of the things they did. If you still fail to grasp the historical concensus presented in those articles, I would suggest that you are the one with the POV and bias problem. You should now know that Christians are a minority worldwide and in many countries and have been persecuted in the Modern West. Your original statement does not stand to truth at all, as it reflects a mindset focused on the realities of the 19th century and America. Bring your knowledge up to date to include the history of the 20th century and expand its focus to include countries outside of America, and you will agree with me. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 22:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You <i>do</i> understand the distinction between east and west, don't you? <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireWeed_ada3.html" title="User:FireWeed">FireWeed</a> 00:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know, when skydivers pull their ripcords and a bunch of cutlery comes out of their parachute packs, like in old cartoons?</p>
<p>The distinction between the East and the West:</p>
<ul>
<li>The West: European culture associated with Christianity, and, later, modernism, industrialism, and secularism.</li>
<li>The East: Non-European culture that Westerners associated with non-Christian, premodern, and agrarian societies to the East of Europe.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The Near East and Middle East: Arabian culture associated with Islam and, later, Islamism.</li>
<li>The Far East: Oriental culture associated with Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Russia has long been considered part of the European cultural continent because it is neither Arabian nor Oriental, but Western. Eastern Europe is not the East, and Western Europe is not the West. The division between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc during the Cold War was a divide within Western culture, not between Eastern culture and Western culture. That much larger divide existed for a long time before the last century, and still exists in a perforated form, unlike the Bloc division, which began following the Second World War and dissolved altogether with the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Soviets, founded in the West, embraced modernism in its purest form, rationalism, as well as industrialism, marking them as decidedly Western. The Soviets took great pains to present themselves as the zenith of Western civilization, modernism, and science. The Soviets industrialized their territory at an amazing rate, owing to their embrace of industrialism. All of these features mark the Soviet Union as decidedly Western.</p>
<p>Marxism developed in Western philosophy as a hybrid of materialism and Hegelian dialectics, both developments in Western philosophy separate from their analogues in Eastern philosophy.</p>
<p>Marx was an atheist in Germany who read Hegel. If Marx had been a Muslim in Iran who read the Koran, Marxism would be Middle Eastern. If Marx had been a Hindu in India who read the Vedas, Marxism would be Eastern. For an example of Communism in the East, see Maoism, or Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.</p>
<p>When I think of Communism, I do not hear zithers, smell incense, or see Vishnu meditating. Nor do I see Communists laying out prayer mats or hear them reciting the Koran. Maybe you do, but most people do not consider Communism an Eastern phenomenon, but rather a Western.</p>
<p>I hope that explains it. You seem to be using the narrowest definition of the terms (The East=Eastern Europe, The West=Western Europe), and I seem to be using the broader (The East=The Eastern World, The West=The Western World). That is what I tried to demonstrate to you using the image, but you missed that. The broader use is the more appropriate, given our context. Once again, I have to ask that you try to broaden your view of the world. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 01:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From your text "The West: European culture associated with Christianity" - the Soviet Union was, officially, a nation of Athiests. Also, your graphic itself says its accuracy is disputed, and a much more widely held definition of "the west" in political terms would be "nations participating in the global capatilist economy," which, again, the <b>communist</b> Soviet Union was not. No amount of twisting of the facts, or hallucinations of the scent of insense will change the fact that by any definition the former Soviet Union was <b>not</b> a western nation. The only way that can be done is to invent a radically new definition for the word "western," which you're obviously trying to do.

<dd>Before state atheism was established, the countries of the Soviet Union were Christian with long histories of being Christian. You did know that, right? Did you neglect to read the part in my text about "later...secularism"? Did your eyes just skip over it, or did you read it and are just now ignoring it? The accuracy of the image is disputed over whether or not to have some countries in Eastern Europe blue (considered Western by all definitions) or yellow (considered Western by the broadest definition). That dispute in no way negates the yellow definition. Most countries in the Soviet Union participated in capitalism before the revolution, and, following the fall, now participate in it again. In both its history and its existence, the Soviet Union was part of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_civilization.html" title="Western civilization">Western civilization</a>, not the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_world.html" title="Eastern world">Eastern world</a>.</dd>

<dd>I am not "twisting the facts". You just do not know them, or you are ignoring them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_ae2a.html" title="The West">The West</a> is older than capitalism, and a lot older than communism. So how can either of these things provide the only definition of it? "Hallucinations"? So, you lack an imagination. I am sorry to hear that. Please read the article on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_culture.html" title="Western culture">Western culture</a> that explains the different definitions and how they relate to one another. The one I have been using is actually the older and broader definition, not "radically new", nor any invention of mine, but of writers hundreds of years ago that still finds wide use.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What is happening here is you are trying to steamroll a certain definition used in certain contexts into being the only definition used in all contexts. You were unaware of other definitions, so you mistook my use of the term as "uneducated", and so have been trying to justify that mistake despite the information I have presented to you. You probably have heard of the older and broader definition before, if you have any history education past high school history of the 20th century, but you are ignoring it. Why?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Here are some articles that will give you the information you need to realize the definition I have been using is accepted:

<p><b>Some people believe organizations such as ACLU are intentionally trying to prohibit freedom of religious expression in a veiled attempt to secularize America.</b></p>

Despite the fact that the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a> has defended the <i>practice</i> of <i>all</i> major religions, and is under attack for also defending freedom <i>from</i> religion, as well as the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_of_church_and_state.html" title="Separation of church and state">separation of church and state</a> enshrined in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_8cc4.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> ... these are almost beside the point.

<p>Also, attributing false ( or guessed at ) motivations is something children play at, not something that has a rightful place in an encyclopedia.</p>

<dd>As no one has commented on this, I've gone ahead and begun to clean up the bottom section somewhat. In a first draft, I've tried to do three things: replace as many weasel words as possible ( some people -&gt; specific examples ), make the text less biased, and improve clarity. There was an aweful lot of redundancy in the text, the same word being used several times in a paragraph, two sentances in a row beginning exactly the same way. I realize that's probably the lowest priority ... but bad writing bugs me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I broke the section on the American Government into two subsections - one on the government itself, and a second on the ACLU. While these are two sides of the same coin, it seems enough of the text was directed at the ACLU that it merits being broken into its own section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, though, I think this entire section should go. We're simply repeating claims by the far right, that have little substance. Across eastern Europe, parts of Africa and Asia, anti-Christian prejudice means killing large groups of Christians, often in terrible ways. ( Remember the US war on Bosnia under Clinton? ) To suggest that not teaching intelligent design in science class ( because it doesn't follow the scientific method ) is anti-Christian prejudice when genocide is taking place belittles these crimes against humanity, in my ever-so-humble opinion.</dd>

<p>As it stands, this article is a collection of talking points from the extreme right. There's more about how <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a> isn't taught in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_class.html" title="Science class">science class</a> and how students are allowed a moment of silence, but not forced to recite a Christian prayer in public schools. It would seem the people oppressing Christians through prejudice are the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a> and those who say "Happy Holidays" when they walk past you on the sidewalk. Aside from the obvious POV issues this creates, and that it's missing the <b>real</b> prejudice being directed at Christians, it can easily lead one to conclude that anti-Christian prejudice is either not real, or whining by the US far right about not being able to force their religious views onto others.</p>
<p>The quote is accurate, though; prejudice against Christians is much stronger, and more likely to be acted on, in places where Christianity is a minority faith. ( Some 80 % of Americans identify themselves as Christians. ) Can somebody knowledgable about the subject add to this article, about atrocities in what's turning into a war surrounding Ethiopia, prejudice in Turkey, and so on? Some of what goes on in the Balkans? This article is <i>very</i> US-centric, but it's devoted to a subject that mainly happens outside the US. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireWeed_ada3.html" title="User:FireWeed">FireWeed</a> 19:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems that <b>Ecto</b> and I are the only editors taking a strong interest in this page, and Ecto seems to be on holiday. ( <i>Good for him!</i> ) Still, in the absence of any objections, I've gone ahead and followed my own advice. I've added sections on Turkey, Sudan, and China, although I'm not finished ( more like halfway done ) with China. I left a stub notice under the China section to indicate this, however another editor came along and removed the stub tag, probably feeling that there was ample content explaining the issue. This is probably a good thing, for the reader, but still I wanted to make note of it here. Mainly, I'm concerned that at present, the China section could give an anti-Christian POV. So far I've had time to explain the background that lead to what's happening today, but I haven't had time to write <i>about</i> present day China. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireWeed_ada3.html" title="User:FireWeed">FireWeed</a> 00:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, Joseph Smith being killed was not the result of anti-mormonism as much as it was anti-Joseph Smithism. The man was clearly a law breaker, I'm not suggesting he deserved to die, just pointing out the "prohphet" was not an innocent kitten. However, anti-Mormonism continues to this day <i>primarily</i> from evangelical Christian groups who insist the Mormon church is a cult. Evangelicals get to make this claim only because they have a bigger membership (big groups are religions, little ones are cults). Maybe I'll add more when I have time. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 23:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bulk of my knowledge here comes from <a href="../../../u/n/d/Under_the_Banner_of_Heaven_530d.html" title="Under the Banner of Heaven">Under the Banner of Heaven</a> by <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Krakauer_9637.html" title="Jon Krakauer">Jon Krakauer</a> ( ISBN-13: 978-0385509510 ). It seems that wherever they went, Mormons made themselves unpopular through their xenophobia, and their claims of a divine right to act as they saw fit ... including building what was almost a seperate country at Nauvoo, Il. Being killed by a lynch mob is obviously pretty extreme, but Krakauer makes it sound as if the Mormon faith "brought it upon themselves." In fact he goes so far as to argue that the persecution they suffered bound them together as a group, solidifying a cult into a major world religion. The man has an unfavorable view of Mormonism, so this all needs to be taken with a grain of salt.</dd>

<dd>My reasoning behind adding anti-Mormon and anti-Catholic sections was that the article stinks of a particular POV, and needed to address the fact that a good deal of "Anti-Christian prejudice" in fact comes from Christians themselves, and not from a global ( or just American ) secular conspiracy. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireWeed_ada3.html" title="User:FireWeed">FireWeed</a> 23:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fireweed, I was not clear. I was not suggesting the section did not belong, only he was not killed for his beliefs. I think I have clarified some of that section and added cites for support. It could stand some additional fine tuning I'm sure. And yes we agree the overwhelming majority of Christian persecution comes from within the Christian community (and not the ACLU) and yes that fact belongs in the article.

<p>I just tagged this section with the original research tag. Here's why. "-phobia" suggests a "fear of". It is often associated with a clinical meaning. So we're suggesting people "have" Christianophobia? Is this a new mental disorder? We don't even have a reliable or cited definition of the term yet our readers are lead to believe people suffer from this mental problem (fear of christ). Can you catch it? Is it hereditary? Is there a treatment cure for it?</p>
<p>Does counseling help? You can see where I am going with this. I have never met anyone in my life who had a fear of christ or christians, but perhaps I haven't met enough people. And then the section gives a Right wing Christian viewpoint of the so-called problem of Christianophobia. He's hardly a neutral party, and I have already pointed out some of the company he keeps are pretty shady to say the least. I am not suggesting we ignore the guy, but some balance is in order. Perhaps <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> may offer some reasons why some folks are prejudiced towards Christians (sorry, I refuse to use the term christianophobic until someone can prove that term exists and provide a reliable definition of it). <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 23:48, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These don't seem to fit under any definition of prejudice: The resistance to ID is because it is not scientific (In fact many Id supportters continually reject the fact that it is a religiously motivated "theory") and the other two are merely products of the first amendment that don't apply exclusively to christians: Practicers of Judaism and Islam are not allowed to do either of these and actually to saction any one would be prejudiced against the ones it did not endorse. And seeing as claiming a anti christian bias in these cases where there is no evidence to show that christians in particular are being singled out in the cases of alleged prejudice seems innapropriate for an encyclopedia without sources. Would anyone be opposed to deleting these three things?<a href="../../../z/v/y/User%7EZvyer_b725.html" title="User:Zvyer">Zvyer</a> 00:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since those are the three most popular examples of anti-Christian prejudice offered by the American Christian right-wing press, whether or not they really are, I think removing them would compromise the article's NPOV. They definitely need sources, but they should remain. Here's an example of a Jewish writer who has mentioned the prayer issue as an example of anti-Christian prejudice <a href="http://www.stonescryout.org/archives/2005/04/jews_against_an.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stonescryout.org/archives/2005/04/jews_against_an.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. That wouldn't be a useful source, as the article is written now, but I'll look for some more. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 02:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well maybe the last one, since under a far stretch of imagination I could understand why someone would maybe think that it could be prejudicial, but in the first one as I said there has actually been attempts to distance christianity from ID in attempt to bypass the first amendment. I have actually never heard it as an example of anti-christian prejudice. As for the second one it actually has only been connected to religious leaders talking about morality rather than anti-christian prejudice. At the very least I think that it would be best to delete them if no one can find sources after a time because as it stands they seem to be unverifiable and actually even contrary to what right wing pundits even cite as prejudical.<a href="../../../z/v/y/User%7EZvyer_b725.html" title="User:Zvyer">Zvyer</a> 03:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there are no objections I would like to delete these uncited claims after one week unless I, or anyone else, can find sources to the claims as they seem to not be factual.<a href="../../../z/v/y/User%7EZvyer_b725.html" title="User:Zvyer">Zvyer</a> 01:09, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The added sentence seems to require a bit of cleanup or clarification, I don't know exactly what the editor was talking about so I don't want to rewrite something willy-nilly;</dd>
<dd>"The increased usage of BCE/CE, not just limited to strictly non-Christian studies but also to more general historical terms, even including Christianity or societies which eventually lead to Christianity (such as Greece and Rome)."</dd>
<dd>I don't quite understand how Greece and Rome "led to Christianity" or how a society in general leads to a religion, maybe it could be rephrased a little. <s>Also does it seem to anyone else that the majority of these claims of discrimination are actually attempts to protect the rights or feelings of others?</s> sorry about that, not pertinent to discussing the article.<a href="../../../z/v/y/User%7EZvyer_b725.html" title="User:Zvyer">Zvyer</a> 15:13, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
