<li>Is Anti-tank dogs, and dog mines the same thing? the picture depics an anti-tank dog, but what would a dog mine do? stay put with a vest of explosives, and wag its tail to the passing tanks? I dont think that dogs can be trained to stay put or sit for a very long time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>and second, wouldnt the tank commander see the dog, i mean the vest isnt really that camouflaged with the dogs' fur color. Couldnt he take his pitol ( or a gun he would <i>certainly</i> have with him, or a machine gun on the tank, and start shooting the poor dog, instead or running away at 25 km/h?</li>
</ul>
<p>I dont want to be of a negative tone to this article ( its been very useful to be and I appreciate the person who wrote it), but I just dont think that a <b>anti-tank dog would have been the cleaverlest idea to be used in WW2. and what surprises me, is that both sides used it.</b></p>
<p>I guess its like the US that start shooting at every car that just comes too close to their Humvee or sumthin like that ( i read it in the newspaper - its like a <i>comfort zone</i>). But coming back to WW2, I believe that if the tank crew spotted anyone (<i>not allied</i> soldiers inparticular, or really just anything hostile) advancing towards their tanks, they would shoot him/her. So why wouldnt they shhot the dogs?lol. And now we can see the evolution about the unknown, that we are mistaking some lunch bag for a bomb. Always fun to see it on the news and have the robot shoot a few of those water rockets into it...</p>
<p>I'll do abit of research, and I'll try to add to this article <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaat_e5ec.html" title="User:Paat">paat</a> 21:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The dogs were probably kept in trenches with their handlers, until a tank got close. Then released. Incase you werent aware, a tank cant shoot straight down. often times, at close range, you cant even hit a human with the coaxial machine gun on a tank. The dogs normally used for this sort of detail were short, runty dogs, not a pure bred german shepard. That said, a dog could be anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 feet tall probably. A tank probably cant hit a target this small if its 50 feet or closer. Maybe the machinegunner next to the driver could, but he doesnt have the best visibility in the world. Even if a tank could hit the dog, i think they would be more preoccupied with a t34, or a anti tank gun, as they make more noise, and are kinda bit and noticible. Not to mention, a tank might damage its self if it shoots reall close to its self.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>And to address getting out of the tank to shoot the dog, yeah, right, try that in the middle of a battle. A piece of shrapnel, a sniper, a machine gun, or an infantry man will take you down the second they get a bead on you. You'd have to be a crack shot with a pistol to hit a dog in the head, while the dog is running at you, and you are ontop of a moving tank, in the middle of a tank battle, and you probably have adrenaline pumping through your system (not the best thing for keeping a steady hand). The chance of hitting the dog is very little, and if you do, he might not even stop from the first shot. Yes, a Mp40 or liberated ppsh41 might rid you of the dog, but youll still probably get shot in the neck by some one like <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasily_Zaitsev_ac20.html" title="Vasily Zaitsev">Vasily Zaitsev</a>.--<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper6Eight_72a2.html" title="User:Super6Eight">Ryan</a> 07:04, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I remember reading that one problem was that Russian tanks used diesel while german tanks used Petrol (or maybe it was the other way around?).

<p>1. Changed 'tipped' to tripped'.</p>
<p>2. Deleted 'bomb', inserted 'explosive charge'. In the context of WW II, a bomb was a weapon dropped from an aircraft.</p>
<p>3. Deleted 'no armor'. inserted 'less armour'. Most armoured vehicles have their armour distributed thus: front - thickest, sides - lots, rear - some, underneath - least(but there is still some).</p>
<p>4. Changed 'climb under' - to my knowledge, dogs don't climb anywhere, neither up nor down&#160;!</p>
<p>5.Changed 'pulled' to 'withdrawn', I think it is better English.</p>

<dd>Strange, see 3.46 minute of this video either way it could be a bluff, these dogs are running under maquets of tanks (they seem happy so it might be just a game for them), it would be much harder to convince them during a battle to happily run under a tank that they are seeing for the first time. <a href="../../../m/i/e/User%7EMieciu_K_31a4.html" title="User:Mieciu K">Mieciu K</a> 17:01, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because tanks don't drive on a nice smooth track and road bed like locomotives. A few minutes of cross-country driving would knock such a thing off of the tank. Antitank dogs would probably have been rare enough that it wouldn't make sense to add such equipment when only, say, 1% or less of tanks would ever need it anyway.&#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-11-11&#160;22:09&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<p>Should'nt this article be more clear about the fact that the dog DIES in the process of triggering the mine? The way the article is read seems to imply that a dog can survive having an anti-tank bomb explode off its back! Should'nt there be some sort of section for the humanity of the practice, especally if it was carried on into 1996? Or am I just really f**cking confused? 69.250.130.215 21:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No it doesn't. Dog runs under tank, dog explodes, Tank go broke. And the dog? Well thankfully the Russians invented small portable force fields which at the moment of explosion surrounded the dog and caused him to suffer no harm! Or better yet those tricky Soviets used StarTrek Technology they stole from Time-traveling Occultic Nazi's to 'Beam' the dogs out of there right at the moment of the explosion! Yes I can see how you would be confused. Thankfully no one else is, so rather than make this Article make sense to people with IQ's of 8.6, we can just ignore you and move on to more pressing matters. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.58.37.168_465f.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.58.37.168">70.58.37.168</a> (talk) 07:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I added the hoax tag some days ago thinking it would obvious why. The whole concept, as described in the article, sounds extremely far-fetched. A google search for "hundeminen" results in 243 hits, and all but a few go to Wikipedia or sites citing Wikipedia. The more formal "panzerabwehrhund" has 334 hits, about as many as a "anti-tank dog" in English. All the sites i find in English seem to contain the same text and they all reference the "entire Soviet tank division" that supposedly was forced to retreat. Nowhere can I find a source for this. Finally, the Russian "Противотанковая собака" has a mere 60 google search results. So, has anyone actually read a <i>book</i> that mentions anti-tank dogs and the use thereof? Of course this could all be accurate and simply obscure, in which case I apologize.</p>
