<p>Antandrus,</p>
<p>Thank for the help regarding the Jeff Ellison article. I've since found a similar article at Subway Posse. I'm sorry to bother you with this, as I'm sure it's not your job, but I'm not sure where to list it. Would it be better to continue to post it at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village Pump</a>&#160;?

<li>Antandrus, again thanks for your help. I was curious though, I seem to recall there being a listing of notices on both the speedy delete and RC Patrol pages however they seem to be gone now.

<p>Hello again, I have (unilatterly) taken away the 'assembly' idea, as per my reasons at that edit summary and per Wikipedia talk:Esperanza/Charter. I have left the admin general, as some leadership is good. Now, all you have to do is be a member to establish consensus, the whole assembly idea is gone. Also, I have added an advisory committee, of four members, with limited power besides watching over the admin general and making sure he doesn't do anything stupid. Please look at the ammended charter, and I would love a comment. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 23:47, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Antandrus. As you may or may not know, there have been some troubles with Esperanza. So now, as a last ditch to save the community, please vote at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Reform_15b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Reform">Wikipedia:Esperanza/Reform</a> on all neccisary polls. P.S. I'm very sorry for spamming you all with these messages, and this will be the last time. I recommend putting ESP on your watchlist. Cheers and please look at that, let's stop the civil war then. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 02:41, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response. Yeah, well, come to think of it, you're right: the entire article needs to be rewritten. I think I'll do it myself tomorrow and invite you to look at the results. In case you happen to like Verdi, I assure you you won't be disappointed.</p>
<p>In the meantime... since you're a composer... and I'm the paying customer... and, with some reservations, we both agree on that...</p>
<p>I suggest you read (if only for fun) this article (when you have a free twenty minutes) -</p>

<p>I'm not the author. It was sent to my little online publication by a friend and it absolutely fascinated me. You may find the general idea cruel and unjust; however, you still might benefit from it professionally. Honest. --</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just started to use a wiki format for my free sheet music site (Choral Public Domain Library). Would it make sense to add a link to these composer pages? They don't really have much bio, but the access to scores might be useful. Example: <a href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Jacob_Buus" class="external text" title="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Jacob_Buus" rel="nofollow">Jacob Buus</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Considering the difficulty of finding music from the 15th and 16th centuries, especially for the second line of composers (i.e. not Palestrina and Josquin), I'd say absolutely yes; I think this is a great link.

<p>Now that you're an Administrator (congrats! congrats!) - PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.</p>
<p>This is, like, the second time in two days.</p>
<p>I was working rather hard on the article about Verdi, editing, re-editing, copying and pasting, making sure everything is top-notch, and all of a sudden I get this gorgeous (expletive deleted) message -</p>
<p>"Your IP address is 152.163.100.201. Please include this address, along with your username, in any queries you make."</p>
<p>- and I can't get in anymore! The irony is that the article now is ENTIRELY my own. This is VERY irritating. Vexing. Frustrating. Stupid. Downright (expletive deleted) disgraceful. Not to mention that I had some info in the buffer which I needed to paste in; not to mention that now I've lost the thread of the edit I was making and will have to spend sometime picking it up again.</p>
<p>Is there a list you could put me on, some, I don't know, elite table or array, that would include my name, my nickname, and my IP, with strict and severe instructions to the system NEVER to block me again. Like, EVER. No matter what I do. Matter of fact, make the system bump all other uses off and give me all the resources. Sheesh...</p>
<p>I happen to like editing and adding entries, and I have scads to contribute, and, like everyone else here, I do it for free, and I'm quite an expert in quite a few areas - doesn't that deserve something? Thunder and lightning...</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick response, and thanks for unblocking me. It's a great comfort knowing you can rely on someone.</p>
<p>About the Verdi page:</p>
<p>Another wikipedian who's an opera buff has made some suggestions to me regarding the intro, sections, etc, which I immediately made very good use of and am grateful to him for his time and effort.</p>
<p>He also noted, however, that a passage concerning Rigoletto contained (and still does) something that can be classified as a pretty strong POV. I promptly invited him to join me in my Great Verdi Conspiracy.</p>
<p>Here's my point.</p>
<p>No encyclopedia entry can be entirely free of bias. There's just no way it can happen. There's simply no "sticking to the barest facts," since facts themselves are in some degree the result of someone's interpretation.</p>
<p>That said, consider this an invitation.</p>
<p>Sadly, we're all of us caught in the middle of a pretty impressive cultural disaster. In view of which, the five opera greats - Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, Bizet, and Tchaikovsky - could use ... sorely need ... should be given ... all the help they can get. If it takes a little bit of a personal opinion tossed in here and there, so be it. Seriously. Towards the end of his career, Puccini said that (and I quote, from memory) - "The art of opera is finished. The audiences have lost their taste for that which is the foundation of music and are willing to tolerate works completely free of melody."</p>
<p>A new Renaissance is most certainly in order. Most music composed since World War Two (including the popular genres) is bureaucratic rather than artistic. The last good opera premiered in 1924. Operetta lasted a bit longer (Kalman peaked in 1931, with his "Violet of Montmartre," and it went downhill from there).</p>
<p>So, yes, by all means - let us be as neutral as we can when it comes to, say, Massenet. Or Copland. Or Dvorak. Who cares! But let us stubbornly promote the great Club of Five, anywhere and everywhere, as best we can, bending (and breaking, if necessary) rules that get in the way.</p>
<p>Sincerely, <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpressionist_b4ca.html" title="User:Impressionist">Impressionist</a> October 8, 2005</p>

<p>LOL; my theory was that if anyone would even notice I had posted it, it'd be you.&#160;:-) I am fond of Xenakis, for his writings and theories about music as much as his music itself (what can I say: I'm a math nerd).

<p>Thank you SO much for your cleanup after the dreadful "203.153.231.50" vandal. I find the subtle vandalism even more contemptible than the overt vandalism, as it's harder to notice and can sometimes be taken at first glance as part of the article. The pollution of information is really, juvenile prank or not, a serious problem on Wikipedia. Fortunately through the participation of vigilant users like yourself it's kept in check somewhat. Many thanks on behalf of everyone who reads and edits Wikipedia. Rest assured that had I yet grasped the concept, I would be presenting you with some form of JPEG recognition!</p>

<p>Hello, Antandrus. Had you noticed that the Lutoslawski article is set for the main page on <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_November_6%2C_2005_136a.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/November 6, 2005">Sunday</a>? It turns out that I probably won't be around at all to police and revert the inevitable vandalism - I'm sure the usual RC patrol will do the usual fine job, but if you will be on the Wiki can I leave you with an informal watching brief, please? I'm looking forward to seeing whether the article will have been improved by Sunday's edits when I look at it on Monday!

<p>"Are you the creator of the Noleta wiki, by any chance? There seem to be no visitors so far, and I was unable to make a login."</p>
<p>Yes, I started making notes to myself before the Goleta City Council SOI meeting, and turned it into an open wiki at noletawiki.jot.com, thinking that I'd learn more about the issues if others commented. (Expecting that people would have strong opinions I didn't think an actual Wikipedia page was appropriate. Besides the jot.com site allows for calendar and forum content.) I wrote to Tom Schultz and one other News Press reporter about the site before the City Council meeting, but there has been no traffic to the site. It is setup with no passwords and "guest" privleges for everything, so I'm puzzled if you couldn't login... It seems the problem with these things isn't vandalism as expected, but getting participation.</p>

<p>Thanks for the warm welcome! I'm surprised at the speed with which I've been welcomed to the community; everyone here is so friendly. And I haven't even been here 24 hours! You guessed right, I am a fan of Shostakovich. I look forward to helping out with composer and performer bios on wikipedia. I noticed you have a Ph.D. in composition; I don't have any degrees, but I plan on majoring in music with a concentration in composition. I don't suppose you have any hints for me? I'm busy throwing my portfolio together so hopefully I can go someplace good, but I'm afraid what I have won't be good enough...</p>

<p>I'm contacting you in response to your removal of my edit on the Magnesium page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium</a>). I am curious as to why someone with such a deep interest in music is watching pages about subjects like magnesium, as well as to why you removed my correct information in favor of false information. Magnesium does not, in fact, react spontaneously with water or oxygen (air). I removed this information on november 3rd and you reverted the incorrect data not 30 minutes later. I have roughly 3 feet of magnesium ribbon sitting on top of my bookshelf right now, and it has been there almost a week. It has yet to react with the surrounding air, and i even tested it in water with no results whatsoever. If you would like to come see it you are very much welcome to do so. I am a Chemical Engineering major at Virginia Commonwelth University, and I would appreciate it if you and Vsmith (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vsmith" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vsmith" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vsmith</a>) would let me remove the false infor mation on this page. You can contact me at headmm@vcu.edu if you so choose.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance, Mike Head</p>

<dd>Hi Mike,</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I reverted your edit because you deleted an entire section of the article with no explanation, no discussion on the talk page, and especially, no edit summary. Deletions of this nature from articles are one of the commonest forms of vandalism on Wikipedia. If you believe the information in the article to be mistaken, you need to make your case before making a change to an article as dramatic as deletion of an entire section. And by the way, you did not add any correct information; you only deleted. This was the edit I reverted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnesium&amp;diff=27227460&amp;oldid=27195351" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnesium&amp;diff=27227460&amp;oldid=27195351" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>My appologies, I was unaware that i had deleted the entire Precautions section of the article. That was not my intended purpose. I only meant to remove one incorrect sentence and add a contridictory statement. I am new to this, so I did not realize what had happened. I appologize for attacking you about modding the entry.</dd>
