<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Walker_445a.html" title="Edit section: Player profile">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Player profile</span></h2>
<p>Walker is a versatile big man who can play either forward spot. He is mostly used as a <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_forward.html" title="Small forward">small forward</a>, where he establishes himself as a prolific scorer (career average 19.0 points per game) and deft rebounder, using his 6-foot-9 frame well (career average of 8.3 boards per game). He is also known as a capable passer, as 3.9 career assists per game prove. Walker is also known for his ability to shoot field goals, as he has taken 3771 three-point attempts in his career (as of September 2006), averaging about five per game, and made 1241 of them (.329). His all-around game earned him three All-Star call-ups so far (1998, 2002, 2003).</p>
<p>In spite of his consistent scoring and rebounding, Walker's game has been widely criticized over the years, mainly because of his questionable shot selection. By the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000-01_NBA_season_96bc.html" title="2000-01 NBA season">2000-01</a> campaign he had become the NBA's leader in three point attempts, although .329 was not a remarkable three-point-shot average. Walker's penchant for shooting three-pointers is thought to stem from his playing for coaches <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Pitino_3b4c.html" title="Rick Pitino">Rick Pitino</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_O%27Brien_8e13.html" title="Jim O'Brien">Jim O'Brien</a>, whose offensive techniques of shooting high volumes of three-pointers became known as the "Bombs Away Offense" among Celtics fans. However, Walker has improved this in his days with the Miami Heat, shooting a 43.3% from the field, profiting from playing third fiddle to teammates <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaquille_O%27Neal_ca3b.html" title="Shaquille O'Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> and <a href="../../../d/w/y/Dwyane_Wade_565b.html" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a> who often draw double-teams, so Walker frequently has wide-open shots. He was once asked why he shoots so many threes, and he replied, "because there are no fours."</p>
<p><br />
Walker is also notorious for performing the "Walker Wiggle" (a.k.a. "The Shimmy") - a move that involves raising one's hands up to chest height while simultaneously shrugging one's shoulders. He used often in his early Boston days after completing a difficult play or a big shot. This was toned down as he matured but was still brought out twice during the Miami Heat Championship run in 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Walker_445a.html" title="Edit section: Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Records</span></h2>
<p>Walker holds two NBA records. In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_NBA_Playoffs_ae17.html" title="2002 NBA Playoffs">2002 first round playoff</a> series against <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_76ers.html" title="Philadelphia 76ers">Philadelphia</a>, Walker knocked down six <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-point_field_goal.html" title="Three-point field goal">three-point field goals</a> in the second quarter alone, the most ever in one quarter of a playoff game. His other record is a more dubious distinction: In a game against Cleveland during the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002-03_NBA_season_7dbd.html" title="2002-03 NBA season">2002-03 season</a>, Walker shot 0-10 from three-point range <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, the most 3-point attempts by a player in one game without a successful conversion. He is also the Boston Celtics' all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted (2,815). Walker was also part of the NBA playoff record 21 point fourth-quarter comeback in 2002 against the New Jersey Nets.</p>
