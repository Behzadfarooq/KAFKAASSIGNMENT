<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> based Top 40 station <a href="../../../w/h/t/WHTZ_f788.html" title="WHTZ">WHTZ</a>, better known as Z100, received a prank call during a morning radio show from a person who claimed to be Barney. When one of the DJs asked Barney what he does on the weekends when he's not filming the show, he admitted that he had "a severe addiction to sex with BeBop and crack" and that he "just can't stop smoking the stuff".</p>
<p>The people who made the prank call are believed to be high schools students from northern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, this is still uncertain though.</p>
<p>The call received semi-national re-recognition as a user at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.com.html" title="Newgrounds.com">newgrounds.com</a> used the audio from the station and created an accompanying <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_animation.html" title="Flash animation">Flash animation</a>, he even depicted the baby stealing Barney's crack at the end.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Barkley_2856.html" title="Charles Barkley">Charles Barkley</a> was the guest host of the television program <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">25 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>.

<p>One of the first well known anti-Barney songs was "Barney's on Fire" by <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Mason_0404.html" title="Tony Mason">Tony Mason</a> (often miscredited to <a href="../../../22/w/e/_Weird_Al__Yankovic_79e3.html" title="&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another well-known song, "Jurassic Park," was released on <a href="../../../22/w/e/_Weird_Al__Yankovic_79e3.html" title="&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alapalooza.html" title="Alapalooza">Alapalooza</a></i> record. The song featured the lyrics, "I'm afraid these things might harm me / Cause' they sure don't act like Barney." The music video featured a scene in which a <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannosaurus.html" title="Tyrannosaurus">tyrannosaurus</a> bites Barney's head off but later chokes on it and is given the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heimlich_maneuver.html" title="Heimlich maneuver">heimlich maneuver</a> by an <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apatosaurus.html" title="Apatosaurus">apatosaurus</a>, which causes him to vomit it back out. A more recent music video, also by Weird Al, <a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Sue_Ya_70c1.html" title="I'll Sue Ya">I'll Sue Ya</a>, has a badly patched up, evil looking Barney chewing on a decapitated arm at the part where he sings about suing <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toys_R_US_c2df.html" title="Toys R US">Toys R US</a></p>
<p>An online video combines clips from Barney and Friends with <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>'s song "<a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%27Em_Up_6334.html" title="Hit 'Em Up">Hit 'Em Up</a>", making it appear that Barney and other characters from the show are rapping. Perhaps what actually makes this humorous is that the actual song contains heavy levels of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a> and violent content, which is quite the opposite of lessons and content regular on Barney.</p>
<p>An online audio clip called "Elmo Kills Barney" is another anti-Barney skit. The lyrics are Barney singing "I love you, you love me, We're a happy" and <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmo.html" title="Elmo">Elmo</a> shoots Barney with a machine gun and yells "shut the f**k up!"</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_video.html" title="Music video">music video</a> for the 1993 re-recording of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicidal_Tendencies_805b.html" title="Suicidal Tendencies">Suicidal Tendencies</a> "Institutionalized" features frontman <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Muir_a884.html" title="Mike Muir">Mike Muir</a> playing cards with Barney towards the end of the video, implying that Barney is really into [[ ]], a topic if covered on his show he probably would have been against. Barney's face is also <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censored.html" title="Censored">censored</a> in the video.</p>
<p>In the AtomFilms video "Chipmunkz Gangsta Rap", Barney and Winnie the Pooh were seen in a brief moment together going on a killing spree.</p>

<p>A small comic book imprint, Parody Press (an imprint of Eternity Comics), released an anthology comic book entitled <i>Kill Barny</i> in 1994, a collection of short stories and one-page strips depicting the death of the purple dinosaur. One multi-page story depicts "Beaver and Butt-Chin", characters drawn to resemble <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-Head_d0ba.html" title="Beavis and Butt-Head">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>, playing "Dinosaur Baseball" and setting the purple dinosaur on fire.</p>
<p>Several months later, another issue was released under the name <i>Kill Barny Again!</i>, reprinting most of <i>Kill Barny</i> but with some new material pages and a new cover.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Barney_humor_2939.html" title="Edit section: Nine Months">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nine Months</span></h3>
<p>The movie <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Months_1430.html" title="Nine Months">Nine Months</a></i> (with <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Grant_c592.html" title="Hugh Grant">Hugh Grant</a>) had a Barney rip-off character called "Arnie". The "Arnie" character was clearly meant to represent the growing amount of Anti-Barney humor.</p>
<p>"Arnie" was making a personal appearance in the store. The Arnie character taunts <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Arnold_%28actor%29_abb2.html" title="Tom Arnold (actor)">Tom Arnold's</a> character of Marty by trying to get him to buy various "Arnie" merchandise. Marty graciously says 'no thank you', but Arnie proceeds to chide Marty for not buying the merchandise. After being chided several times, Marty attacks "Arnie". Eventually Grant's character of Samuel is drawn into the fight. The fight occurs before stunned children.</p>

<p>A group of adults wrote fiction revolving around not only killing Barney, but portraying him as a demonic force to be defeated in an epic tale. The most highly regarded of these were a series of short stories by writer Brian Bull including the <i><a href="http://de.jihad.net/lib/bull-dotb.txt" class="external text" title="http://de.jihad.net/lib/bull-dotb.txt" rel="nofollow">Day of The Barney</a></i> novel, and the cult hit <i>Batman versus Barney</i>. The popularity of stories by Bull and others elicited the attention of the producers of <i>Barney and Friends</i> who moved to shut down the sites, although the stories may still be found on the internet.</p>

<p>1. Barney is well-described with the following phrase:</p>

</dl>
<p>2. The old <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> used the letter 'V' in place of 'U', therefore the above phrase is modified to:</p>

<p>Anti-Barney humor emerged from the modability of early 90's computer games, such as the popular <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_person_shooter.html" title="First person shooter">first person shooter</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a>. Numerous "mods" circulated the Internet and third party mod collections would replace specific monsters. Other similar mods were released, replacing one or more monsters with Barney, often with new sounds as well. One such of these mods is Barneystein 3D, a spoof of <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfenstein_3D_e125.html" title="Wolfenstein 3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, where, instead of killing Nazis, the player has to kill Barney's minions <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-head_99e4.html" title="Beavis and Butt-head">Beavis and Butt-head</a> and finally kill Barney himself. Closely related was the "mashup" WAV file of Barney starting his theme song, interrupted by some German speech and various weapon sounds from the game Wolfenstein 3D (with the implication of killing Barney dead, over and over).</p>
<p>There also was a computer game for Mac called <a href="http://www.electric-games.com/mac-games/b/mac-barneycarnage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.electric-games.com/mac-games/b/mac-barneycarnage.html" rel="nofollow">Barney Carnage</a>.</p>

In 2001, Gibney, Anthony &amp; Flaherty, LLP who were the lawyers for Lyons Partnership, issued a threat letter to EFF claiming infringement of the Barney character.

<p>Since 1995, when the website <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> was established, several fan-made cartoons demeaning Barney have appeared, some of them depicting Barney as a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addict.html" title="Drug addict">drug addict</a> or a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorist</a>. One of the most popular includes "Barney Busdriver", which depicts Barney as a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addict.html" title="Drug addict">drug addict</a>/<a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic.html" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadist.html" title="Sadist">sadist</a> who is driving an elementary school bus.

<p>Many <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoons.html" title="Cartoons">cartoons</a> targeted at older children have made fun of Barney directly or indirectly. Most cartoons do not mention Barney directly. Instead they use a parody and depict it as being mean. Some examples of shows that have done this include <i><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaurs_%28TV_series%29_df7a.html" title="Dinosaurs (TV series)">Dinosaurs</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugrats.html" title="Rugrats">Rugrats</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../a/n/i/Animaniacs.html" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></i>.</p>

They discuss their recent occurrence at the beach when Micky had amazed an 8-year-old boy by 'throwing up' confetti (His great new idea for a group gimmick, similar to <i><a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss.html" title="Kiss">Kiss</a></i>). Davy had admitted that 8-year-olds deserve better than that. He soon stops and asks the others: "What's that purple dinosaur thing?" Peter then brings out a Monkees hand puppet (A popular children's toy from the 60's.) Davy responds: "That's exactly my point. All that purple dinosaur thing is is one of those...but WAY out of control! I mean, we're talking about mesmerizing four-year olds here!"</p>

<p>There is a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> group named alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die . However, as of the early 2000s, it has been dropped from a large number of usenet servers. It is still accessible through Google Groups, though, and some usenet servers still carry it, although its legitimate traffic has receded due to the increased traffic in spamming and trolling. The regular members of the group have moved on to a message board called CGIAB4D, which requires membership and thus is less prone to flooding and trolling.</p>
