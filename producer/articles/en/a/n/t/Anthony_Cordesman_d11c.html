Burke Chair in Strategy at the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies_345f.html" title="Center for Strategic and International Studies">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>, specializing in energy issues, the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, defense policy, and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and transnational threats.

<p>Previously, Cordesman served as national security assistant to <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Senate_9c97.html" title="US Senate">Senator</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a> of the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_Armed_Services_Committee_2333.html" title="Senate Armed Services Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> and in a variety of high level posts within the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Department_of_Defense_9887.html" title="US Department of Defense">US Department of Defense</a>, which earned him the Department of Defense's Distinguished Service medal. Cordesman has also been a professor in national security studies at <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgetown_University_1892.html" title="Georgetown University">Georgetown University</a> and a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars at the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian.html" title="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a>. His publications have dealt with a variety of topics, such as energy and defense policy, the lessons of modern war, and threats posed to vital infrastructure by terrorism.
