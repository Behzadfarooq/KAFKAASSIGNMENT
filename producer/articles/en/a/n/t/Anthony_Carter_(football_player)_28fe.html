<p>Carter played for Michigan from 1979-1982. Although the Wolverines employed an offense that relied mostly on its <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_back.html" title="Running back">running backs</a>, he was one of the most productive receivers in the school's history. Standing five feet, eleven inches tall and weighing only 160 lbs., Carter relied on his speed to make plays, and provided an effective counterpoint to coach <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Schembechler_0872.html" title="Bo Schembechler">Bo Schembechler</a>'s slow-and-steady game plan. In addition to his duties as a receiver, he was also the team's kickoff and punt returner for most of his career.</p>
<p>During his freshman season Carter was used sparingly. He caught more than two passes in a game only once that season, but made the most it when the ball was thrown to him. Seven of his seventeen receptions were <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touchdown.html" title="Touchdown">touchdowns</a>, and he averaged 27.2 yards per catch. His 45-yard TD catch and run against Indiana as time ran out to give Michigan a 27-21 victory is considered one of the greatest plays in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Wolverines_football_3be9.html" title="Michigan Wolverines football">Michigan football</a> history.</p>
<p>By his sophomore year he was the Wolverines primary option at receiver. That season he became the first second-year player to by voted Michigan team <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Valuable_Player_9a8e.html" title="Most Valuable Player">Most Valuable Player</a>. A three-time <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_All-America_Team_166c.html" title="College Football All-America Team">All-American</a>, he was named <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_Silver_Football_e07b.html" title="Chicago Tribune Silver Football">Big Ten Conference MVP</a> his senior season, and finished fourth in voting for the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001 Carter was elected to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_85e4.html" title="College Football Hall of Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

<p>At the time he graduated, Carter held nearly every Michigan career receiving and return record. He was the team's all time leader in:</p>

<p>Upon graduating from college, Anthony Carter chose to play in the upstart <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Football_League_4cc2.html" title="United States Football League">USFL</a>, rather than in the NFL. The league employed a territorial draft, aimed at sending players to teams whose fans were already familiar with them. Because of this unique system, the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Panthers_e181.html" title="Michigan Panthers">Michigan Panthers</a> were allowed to select Carter prior to the league's traditional draft.</p>
<p>1983 was Carter's first season with the Panthers and one of his most successful as a professional. Although the team started 1-4, they finished the regular season 12-6 and went on to defeat the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Stars_%28football%29_a738.html" title="Philadelphia Stars (football)">Philadelphia Stars</a> to win the first USFL championship. With his team behind late in the fourth quarter, he scored the game-winning touchdown on a 48 yard pass from <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hebert_dff8.html" title="Bobby Hebert">Bobby Hebert</a>. He finished the game with nine reception for 179 yards. For the season, he gained 1,081 yard on 60 catches, nine of them touchdowns.</p>
<p>Carter's 1984 season was cut short after only six game when his arm was broken in a game against the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_Gunslingers_2b3e.html" title="San Antonio Gunslingers">San Antonio Gunslingers</a>. Before the 1985 season the Panthers merged with the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Invaders_64af.html" title="Oakland Invaders">Oakland Invaders</a>. In his last USFL season, he led his team in receiving yards (1,323), receptions (70), and receiving touchdowns (14).</p>
<p>When the USFL folded after the 1985 season, Carter signed with the NFL's <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_fba7.html" title="Miami Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>, who drafted Carter back in 1983 in order to secure his NFL rights. However, he was traded to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> before playing a game with the team. He led the Vikings in receptions five of his first six seasons with the team, and was selected to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> in 1987 and 1988. In the 1987 season, Carter helped his team reach the NFC championship game by recording 10 receptions for an NFL playoff record 227 yards, along with 1 carry for 30 yards in the Vikings 36-24 upset win over the 13-2 <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> in the divisional playoff round. The following season, he caught 4 passes for 102 yards in a 28-17 divisional round win over the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Rams_42e3.html" title="Los Angeles Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>. Although <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cris_Carter_d0d3.html" title="Cris Carter">Cris Carter</a> became the team's number one receiver in 1991, Anthony Carter remained an effective offensive weapon through 1993, his final season with the team.</p>
<p>The final two years of Carter's career were spent in the city where it began, this time with the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a>. Most of his time with the Lions was spent attempting to come back from injury. He played in only four games in 1994, and failed to catch a pass in 1995.</p>
<p>Carter finished his 11 NFL seasons with 486 receptions for 7,733 yards and 55 touchdowns. He also rushed for 289 yards and 2 touchdowns, returned 15 punts for 165 yards, and returned 4 kickoffs for 65 yards.</p>
