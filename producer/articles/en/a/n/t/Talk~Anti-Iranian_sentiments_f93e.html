<p>Anti-Iran and anti-Persian are conflated. Ethnic Persians comprise around half the Iranian population, but the article uses the terms anti-Iranian and anti-Persian interchangeable. Please clarify what you mean by this. It is important in assessing whether for instance Saddam was anti-Iran in terms of opposing a state or anti-Persian in terms of racial supremacy.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 01:42, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's nothing wrong with using them interchangeably. Persia was the official name of the country before 1935, and it is the word used by the Arabs to refer to Iranians. On the other hand Iran has been used since 300BC. Saddam was against Persians as an ethnic group. He was against Iran as a country.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So it's both.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe a good solution is to change the article's title to "Anti-Iranism by Arabs".--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 02:40, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why not just "Anti-Iranianism"? I am sure that you can find more "enemies" of Iran than just Arabs. The Greeks, perhaps?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, there still needs to be a distinction between hatred of an ethnic group - the Persians - and hatred of Iran. In parts, this article mixes and confuses the two. You need to define what you mean by Persian.</dd>

<dd>Being at war with Iran is not proof of anti-Persian or even anti-Iranian sentiment. The Iranian government always accuses the "Zionist Entity" of challenging its sovereignty, but is Israel's alleged transgressions anti-Iranian, anti-Persian, anti-Islam or just self-defence?</dd>

<dd>Yes it is. Have you seen pictures of the war? The murals Saddam painted of "The Persian Rostam being slain by the Arab muslim?" Have you even heard the speeches that Saddam gave during and before the war? Do you know anything about Magus, the Shu'ubiyah movement, the revolts, etc? These things are deeply rooted. Youre not an Arab obviously. Otherwise youd be well aware of such things.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 13:23, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You continually accuse me of being a liar and continually make this accusation, but without any basis. It is a method of vilification and of trying to dismiss any of my edits and opinions. But you still haven't answered my point.

I think it's pretty obvious youre British or Anglophile, and youve learned some Arabic as a second language. I dont know, maybe youve lived in Dubai or somewhere for a while. Beats me. But youre definitely not from Ahvaz, Khuzestan, or anywhere inside Iran. That I can bet on. I have far enough experience to tell a genuine Arab when I see one.

<dd>Indeed. That's because the only folks who have sentiments against Persians are Arabs. The Brits do as well, but it is more political (hence targeted more against Iran). Furthermore, Ive told you 10 times before: google is not any criterion for anything. It gives 50,400,000 hits for "flat earth".--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 13:23, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, I fear that the "Tensions in Khuzestan" section is straying off the subject somewhat, away from "Anti-Persianism" to promoting the argument that Bilderbergers are conspiring to destroy Iran. I believe that the Bilderberger meetings are held in secret and are informal, so the reliability of this source is doubtful. You also talk of a "British plan for Iran's invasion", but this is a misrepresentation of British foreign policy as successive British foreign secretaries - particularly under the Blair administration - have gone on the record as saying that they <i>oppose</i> military action against Iran. The article you refer to was written in 1980 during the government of Margaret Thatcher and amid the unrest of the 1979 revolution. There is no proof that this was the stated position of the government and, 26 years on, there is no proof that this continues to be British policy.</dd>

<dd>Uh-oh, we're not supposed to judge sources now, are we. That is exactly defined as "original research". I suppose you see no involvement whatsoever of your dear mother queen and her former empire in chopping up the ME into 16 little pieces. Why is it that everywhere we look in the ME we see Britan involved in the formation of every new country (Iraq, Israel, Bahrain, etc)? I suppose they were just having a vacation there. Kinda reminds me of these republicans we have here that still think Saddam was involved in 9-11.

Hence the enemy of my enemy. If Iran is making loud noises about Israel, it's not because of "Zionist" hegemony (that's all surface smoke screen designed for the masses), but merely because Iran wants to define itself as a regional power. Saudi Arabia is no threat, they cant even pilot their own aircraft. The Baathists are already dead, thanx to Bush's war.

<dd>Britain has been involved, and directly involved, up to its neck, in Iranian politics, all the way up to the 1950s. We even have buildings that still stand in southern Iran that were built for british soldiers. roads built by them, Sir Charles this and Sir Harford that graffitti all over the stones and reliefs of Persepolis. Im not even going to debate that. Britain is still involved in the region, albeit not as much, nowadays. But it sure as hell lies somewhere at the roots of this Arab secessionist plague that you keep propagating on WP. Read Morgan Shuster's "The Stranglig of Persia" for an American account of how the British were involved in Iran. And they are still present in Iraq and have a direct say in Iran-EU negotiations, and are quite influencial in lobbying for or against Iran when needed.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 20:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, we Iranians dont see Israel as a threat. You may speculate what we think. But Israel is actually admired by many Iranians. The most Israel will do is bomb Iran's nuke installations. And not even that in my opinion. Dissecting Iran based on ethnicity however is a trade Britain has been involved with for over a century (since the days of Sheikh Khazal).

<dd>I followed your Google search link and many of the pages refer to military campaigns against Persian by the Greeks and Ottomans. I can find very few that refer to "anti-Persianism" as an ideology among Arabs. Perhaps you can say that some Arab states have advocated anti-Iran policies, but the context is not necessarily racial - there are also religious, political and strategic factors. Iran is a Shia majority country, it is militarily powerful and its policies towards some Arab states have been confrontational and often involve support for opposition groups (Shia extremists in Bahrain or the support for Sciri under Saddam). I am not trying to justify aggression towards Iran, but I don't think that all this can be seen as soley the result of hatred of Persians - it is a far more complex matter. Again, I think it would be better to have an article on "Anti-Iranianism" (to cover the points raised on British and American policies) and/or Arab-Iranian relations.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 10:58, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not in common usage is no criterion for whether or not something should be acceptable. Otherwise 3/4 of Meriam Webster's dictionary would have to be discarded for words "not in common usage".</li>
<li><i>Youre the one whos trying to score points</i> with your anti-Persian drivel on WP, Ahwaz.

<dd>Where have I been "anti-Persian"? I have pointed out that Iran has sponsored terrorism in Bahrain. This is not an accusation against Persians, but a fact about the regime in Iran and a reason why Bahrainis would be glad to defeat Iran in soccer. I have lived in Bahrain and I know how much they hate the bomb attacks by the terrorists. Bahrain is a multi-ethnic state with a sizeable Persian minority. If there is proof that the Persians are racially persecuted in Bahrain, then provide the information. But in reality, many Persians go to Bahrain because they want to earn a good living.

<dd>Iran is 50% non-Persian. The Azeri Turks are about a quarter of the population and hold considerable power and influence. Iranian is not necessarily Persian. Iran is one of the world's most ethnically diverse countries. So, when you say someone is anti-Iranian, it applies to the entire country not just the Persians. The issue of Jawahiri is not proven as anti-Persian, even if it is true that it was anti-Iranian. As the article makes clear, he was an Arab (and I think Husri would have known this due to the man's name, family and place of origin) and was the victim of anti-Iranianism - ie a fear of Iranians. Anyway, this article says he was born in Najaf <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_n4_v19/ai_20576619/pg_3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_n4_v19/ai_20576619/pg_3" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>

<p>Regarding above discussion and so termed " anti persianism", Zereshk, dooste azeez, with all due respect, i think the subject matter encompasses too vast a terrain, that it can be squeezed into a single term and associated with Arabs alone. You will surely agree that sentiments against IRAN and/or its inhabitants can have many causes and have been ubiquitously prevalent at different points in time, during the last two and a half millennia. Be it Babylon or Egypt or Greece in Antiquity, or the Arab Caliphates,as well as India , Afghanistan and the Ottoman Empire in more recent times. Too complex and too different in nature were the myriad respective misgivings, fostered against Iran and its inhabitants, that a single term would do the subject justice. Animosities by Sunnites against Shiites surely differ from the contempt and hatred evoked among US Americans in recent years. Israel, a staunch ally during the Sha's days has changed its position by 180 degrees, due to Iran's stance during the Islamist Republic's tenure. I would delete the Article and, instead, seize the countless opportunities to address the subject in ALL the many articles touching on it, by virtue of dealing with Iran as a subject (Kerbela, Nadjaf, Ottomans, Safavids, CIA/MI6 supported (counter-) coup 1953, Iraq, Bahrain, Islands in the strait of Hormuz....... etc., etc.) I am not at all taking sides here (I am not defending User Al-Ahwaz's position, to be sure!) The relationship between Arab peoples and the inhabitants of Iran, be they of Arian, Turcoman, Jewish,or Christian extraction -beside the Arab minority, dwelling mainly in Khuzestan- reflect, in fact, only one of many facetts of unfriendly dispositions toward Iranians, as both of you will surely agree. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPantherarosa_c18e.html" title="User:Pantherarosa">Pantherarosa</a> 14:40, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You say you are not defending my position, but essentially you are I are saying the same thing. I actually suggested that Zereshk start an article on Anti-Iranianism last week, which would obviously cover all the aspects of fear or hatred of Iranians and could include anti-Persian sentiment as a basis for Anti-Iranian ideas. Instead, he has chosen to write an article on "Anti-Persianism by Arabs", which conflates a wide range of issues that are not necessarily related to anti-Persian racism. I have repeatedly said that it would be better to have an article on anti-Iranianism (and not just among Arabs), but have been over-ruled. Consequently, another editor has decided to AfD it.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 15:31, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I would opt to do without an article on the subject altogether, as I tried to express further up. While the subject would surely make great reading as an essay in a periodical, it seems hardly suitable for an article in an Encyclopaedia, i would say. There are ample opportunities to exhaust the subject in countless articles touching on it, as mentioned above. And as for you, akhi Al-Ahwaz, you would make it much easier for readers not familiar with the Arabic script, if you kept your name HERE in Latin letters, for them to to know whom they are dealing with. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPantherarosa_c18e.html" title="User:Pantherarosa">Pantherarosa</a> 16:19, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This topic may warrant an article in Wikipedia, but certainly not in its existing format. It reads as a polemic that conflates all instances of hostility towards Persia/Iran the state as somehow being a form of discrimination. There is no treatment of (real) ethnic hatred and condescension from Imperial Russia, while Russian territorial aggression is supposedly passed off as being an example of ethnic hatred?! Russia expanded because it wished to become more powerful. It expanded into Iranian territory because Iran at the time was weak and an easy target. That's only one example from a long list of fallacious assertions in this article. If we are to keep this article, we should start over from scratch with a coherent and limiting definition of what Anti-Iranianism (awkward term in my opinion) actually is. I would suggest: statements or beliefs regarding the cultural or ethnic inferiority of Iranians and actions taken based upon such beliefs. To include an action in this category, therefore, it would have to be demonstrable that it took place because of a belief in cultural/ethnic inferiority of Iranians.</p>
<p>I don't believe that this article is being nominated for deletion because of a desire to stifle discussion of this topic. I believe it is nominated for deletion because it is 1. presented in an unencyclopedic, unscientific, and unprofessional manner and 2. about a english term which neither exists in the popular consciousness nor is widespread in academic literature. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreemother199_9604.html" title="User:Treemother199">Treemother199</a> 03:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2. The confusion is related to the interpretation of "anti-Iranian" policies or actions as "anti-Persian". The Bahrain soccer incident, for instance, is obviously a bit of xenophobic nationalism against Iran, not specifically against Persians. It also comes in the context of terrorist attacks in Bahrain by Iranian-backed groups, although you claim this is irrelevant. To use an example, British anti-German sentiment commonly seen at soccer matches comes in the context of past wars against Germany and is not just targetted at the people of Bavaria, where Hitler spent most of his early life.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 22:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I digress on this one. It is against the "ajam", which can refer to both Persian and Iran. The word Ajam has a long history that ties in anti-Persian sentiments in this article together. The word ajam in fact appears in the links presented as evidence. And furthermore Persia was simply the name of Iran prior to 1935.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 22:48, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you need to point this out more clearly, if this is what you mean. But this is just one example of anti-Iranian sentiment and I think the way this article has been constructed is restrictive, not allowing for other forms of anti-Iranian sentiment that might influence policy-making in America, Turkey, etc, or the fact that the ancient Greeks led anti-Persian wars.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 22:58, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

Persians originate from Iran and most are Iranian, but not all Iranians are Persian - a quarter are Azeri Turks and the rest are Kurds, Balochis, Arabs, Turkomen. If someone hates Iran, they hate all Iranians including non-Persians. What is the objection to Anti-Iranian prejudice? It would be a more substantial and broader article than focussing specifically on Arabs-versus-Persians.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 00:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps a better example is "anti-English". There are some Scottish and Welsh who hate the English, but people who are anti-British hate them all. Likewise, there are some non-Persian Iranians who are anti-Persian, but it would be wrong to confuse them with anti-Iranians. Of course, Persia existed as a nation-state. But it no longer exists in name, so does all contemporary anti-Iranian sentiments cannot be considered anti-Persian. If you are talking of hatred towards one particular country, then "anti-Persianism" ended in 1935.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 00:44, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the anti-Iranian (citizen of Iran) parts should be moved to a new article since this article is about racism, not really anti-national sentiment.

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a>. There is plenty of material here for two articles, one on anti-Persian sentiments and other on Anti-Iranian prejudice. I just saw the link to the store selling t-shirts advocating nuclear attacks on Iran <a href="http://conservativebuys.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop/tshirtcrusade/tshirtcrusade/1165108" class="external autonumber" title="http://conservativebuys.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop/tshirtcrusade/tshirtcrusade/1165108" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. It is not "anti-Persian" in the sense that it is not directed at the Persian people but all Iranians. It is also an American website and I think that there is a lot of material on such attitudes in the US.</dd>
<dd>I disagree with Zereshk on his claim that Persian is just an old form of Iranian. In the contemporary world, Persian commonly applies to the ethnic group not Iran. Some may still use Persia as the name for Iran, but in my mind they are in a minority - most Persians describe themselves as Iranian. I still don't understand the reluctance to use the term "Anti-Iranian prejudice/sentiments/etc". It would completely settle the whole dispute, since "anti-Iranian" is a far more commonly used term. While Zereshk may dispute Google as a research tool, "anti-Iranian" gets just under 100,000 pages <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2DIranian%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2DIranian%22" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> while "anti-Persian" gets under 700 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-42%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22anti-persian%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-42%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22anti-persian%22" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

<p>Here is my suggestion for an article on Anti-Iranian prejudice (or whatever other title you think appropriate):<br />
<b>1. Definition</b>, linked to good souce<br />
<b>2. Roots/Origins</b> - the religious, political, historical and racial origins, eg anti-Shi'ism, anti-Persian racism (with link to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a>), the international response to the Ahmadinejad administration, etc<br />
<b>3. Anti-Iranian sentiments by Arabs</b><br />
<b>4. Anti-Iranian sentiments by Americans</b><br />
... etc<br />
Some of the content in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a> relating to Iran could be used in this article, such as the theories about British plans for a division of Iran.</p>
<p>Maintain an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a> article that focusses on prejudice against Persians as an ethnic group - this could include any anti-Persian sentiments among other Iranian ethnic groups.</p>
<p>How do other editors feel about this? I think it could dissipate the arguments and make more coherent and less confusing articles. For me, a clearn distinction between the racism facing Persians and the anti-national sentiments facing the whole of Iran - in two separate articles - would solve my remaining objections to the way in which this article has been formulated and I would vote to keep the article. But while there is a conflation of racism and anti-national sentiment in the whole premise of this article, I will maintain my vote for deletion.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 11:31, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I state again my suggestion that the ethnic bias (Anti-Persian) and national bias (Anti-Iranian) be made separate. We cannot and should confuse the two. Also the part about "Arabs" should not be included since it is only some Arab regimes that are anti-Persian. My original suggestion avoids this general terminology. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 12:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. There is a lot to cover, so it will take time.

<dd>In my opinion, the sections on early Islam should be kept as historical background to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a>, but the section on Shi'ism should be moved to a "religious origins" in the Anti-Iranian prejudice article, since Shi'ism is not just the religion of Persians and Saudi Arabia's conflicts with Iran have had a religious dimension. "Anti-Persianism in modern times" largely relates to Anti-Iranian prejudice, although references to Saddam's attempts to whip up some civilisational conflict between Arabs and Persians is more appropriate to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a>. Issues relating to Western foreign policy or Western perceptions of Iran should go into the Anti-Iranian prejudice article as it is clear to me that this is driven by fear or hatred of a nation rather than an ethnic group. Also, political and territorial disputes should be explored in the context of Anti-Iranian prejudice.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 23:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's pretty much what I have in mind too. But let me take care of it, Ahwaz. After its done, then read both articles, and then see what you think, and we'll take it from there. Right now, there are parts that need to be added, which I havent done so yet (like Alexander, the Mongolians, etc). And also, there will be lots of overlapping and common sections. The farther back in time you go, the more overlapping there will be.

<p>Iran has had an "ethnic problem" ever since Reza Shah tried to convert an "empire" into a modern nation-state. You can't blame that on outsiders. It's a problem for all the old empires. Austro-Hungary fell apart. The Ottomans fell apart. Russia (finally) fell apart. China and Iran <i>may</i> fall apart. Depends on the wisdom of the central government. Old adage says that that when you pen cows into a small area, they will try to break out until they succeed. If you give them a huge pasture, they won't try to leave. Iran is trying the "small pen" gambit.</p>
<p>BTW, you seem to be accusing me of wishing the dissolution of Iran. I don't. I wish the government was so humane and competent that Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan were pounding on the doors to get in (vide Turkey, EU). <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:38, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zora,</p>
<p>You may not be intentionally <i>wishing</i> for the dissolution of Iran. But that is precisely what you have been actively engaged in, deliberately or not. After all, you do admit that you are against Iran as a <i>nationality</i>. And that puts you in direct conflict with me. Because I, and the majority of the Iranians, favor a strong Iranian nationality, but one in which there is justice, equality, and maturity for and among all Iranian people, whether Arab, Lur, or Gilaki. You <i>can</i> have a central national system that umbrellas a multi-ethnic nation: All these multi-ethnic European states are living proof of it. Austria-Hungary is dead. But Spain/Basque, France/Corsica, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany/Bavaria, are all well and alive. Ethnicity is not a playing factor in the success of these systems; their functionality is. If there is equal participation for all, the system functions and prevails. And Iran performs poorly there. It is such a dysfunctional system that people will now riot for any little reason. Think about it: The guy who drew the so called Azeri cartoon was himself an Azeri.</p>
<p>Tell me Zora, howcome this "ethnic problem" doesnt exist in Hawaii? Or does it? Only, the American system (despite its shortcomings) is far more democratic and advanced and <i>functional</i> than Iran is. That's why you dont see people on your island running around with the Kahili flag.<a href="http://www.hawaii-nation.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hawaii-nation.org/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> An "ethnic problem" is not really a "problem". It is a symptom: a symptom of a dysfunctional government. And it can have many solutions. <i>State fragmentation</i> or <i>secessionism</i> is the worst one, and unfortunately, the one most encouraged by some particular foreginers that have a vested interest in seeing Iran break up.</p>
<p>Obviously, these domestic Iranian crises we hear of in the news all will indeed depend on how fast the ruling govt of Iran wisens up to some realities. I do agree that they are the main culprit. Incompetent, foolish, intolerant, and zealous. If it was not for their stupidity, Iran would not be in the multi-faceted mess that it is in today.</p>
<p>Zora, people like me fall asleep every night dreaming of a united, powerful, advanced, mature, and <b>free</b> "United States of Iran" that respects the rights of all its citizens whether Bahai or Baluchi or atheist. After all, traditionally, Islam has thrived best in pluralistic free societies (e.g. Andalusia). And I am telling you this as a muslim. But Alas, the hardline thugs suffocating Iran on the one hand, and certain malicious foreign powers and individuals encouraging and waiting for the distintegration of Iran (under the guise of "minority rights"), both will destroy Iran.</p>
<p>And I know I will die and never live to see the day I dream of.</p>
<p>Hah. So be it. But at least I will die with a dream. And I will not die ignorant.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 03:05, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I agree with you Zereshk. You have continually called me a liar and a separatist and I have repeatedly said I am not. The most diverse countries can maintain political unity with systems that, like you say, are functional. And in my mind, in the Iranian context, functionality would mean a certain amount of devolution of power to provincial governments, with elected governors, greater power of taxation and spending, etc. You will find many countries with a federal form of government that has been adaptable: mature, functioning, tolerant and developed democracies. A United States of Iran would be a good way forward. You know that Texans have a strong sense of identity, but also feel American.</dd>
<dd>There is a minority rights issue in Iran. There is a minority rights issue in every diverse society in the world. And where there is a minority rights problem under a tyrannical regime, it manifests itself in ugly forms: racism, discrimination, land evictions, ethnic cleansing and genocide. The sad thing is that despite all the evidence, many Iranians see minority rights and calls for a federal democratic system of government as tantamount to separatism. I guess they see what is happening in Iraq and are scared that Iran will spin out of control. But this won't happen if Iranian opposition groups build minority rights into their platform, instead of shoving them aside and handing over the issue to groups that advocate more extremist ideologies and methods. The problem I see is that while many Ahwazi Arabs do not see separatism as a way forward, an increasing number are cheering on the extremists because no-one else is prepared to recognise the problems they are facing, which are bound up with racism.</dd>
<dd>Zereshk will probably deny that Ahwazi Arabs are treated any differently from other Iranians, but I think he is ignoring the evidence pointing towards a systematic persecution of a minority group who are perceived by the government to be an obstacle in the development of the oil industry and agro-industrial enterprises as well as an "enemy within". That's my point of view and I hope that Zereshk understands and respects that.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 09:21, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "enemy within" which Ahwaz is talking about, is every single Iranian who wants a democratic and free nation and fights for their rights. Be it Persian, Azeri, Kurd or Arab. Ethnicity is not the issue. I am sympathetic to every Iranian who has been mistreated by the opressive regime but I am not sympathetic to those who instead of uniting with the rest, all they care about is themselves and their mistreatments and even try to make it an ethnicity issue by becoming the enemy, wouldn't they realise that they will only be left alone and become even more minority?!

<dd>Don't you think that the abuse of ethnic and religious minorities is an important aspect of the regime's oppression? You say that ethnicity is not the issue, but provinces with large non-Persian populations are witnessing rising anti-government unrest - and I don't believe the propaganda that this is all conducted by Tony Blair. People are not so stupid that they can be programmed by foreigners en masse. I'm not saying that minorities are the only oppressed people, but there is an issue of ethnicity due to the nature of anti-government activism among non-Persian groups and the nature of the oppression they face.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 12:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Religion for sure, but ethnicity? One or two protests a year in Tabriz doesn't mean there is uprising in ethnic areas. I encourage them to come out everyday and fight it. Tehran witnesses a lot more and as far as I know Tehran is a multi-ethnic city but with majority Persians. Even after a newspaper was closed because of some cartoon, it was the Tehranis who got out there and protested. The government is responsible, but government is not Persian. Same with Kurds who say Oh both Shah and Khomenini attacked us. None were Persian. The supreme leader is Azeri, so is the president of Iran, it doesn't get much higher than that.

<dd>Kash: I think you have a very Tehran-centric view of the situation in Iran. In May, there were demonstrations in Shilang-Abad, Masjid-Soleiman and Abadan. There are protests every month in Khuzestan, mainly by Arabs. But you are right, this is not an Arab-versus-Persian issue and there is no violence between Arabs and other communities in Khuzestan. It is directed at a government that is treating the local Arab population poorly, a situation that predates 1979.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 14:24, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem, my friends, is not complicated, but simple. Most of you are scholars on this issue, but unfortunetly most readers know nothing about Anti-persian sentiments, much like myself. So, I would appreciate it if in the first paragraph someone could dumb-it-down to provide a basis of understanding.

<p>I think a good duo for this article is one talking about persian racism and supremacism, especially in relation to surrounding ethnicities in specific Arabs, Indians and Kurds. Most of my experience with this issue comes from discussions with Iranians, and some of the statements I heard would put people of other ethnicities in western countries in serious trouble if they said them. I'd appreciate it if someone writes about the history of Persian supremacism and how widespread and persistent it actually is.</p>

<p>I don't agree that Zereshk's list of people who have used the term "anti-Iranianism" actually improves this article. First, it doesn't contribute anything to an understanding of the concept of anti-Iranianism. I searched through several of the links and I did not see anything in them that would help a reader understand the issue, they are generally brief mentions. Second, it adds needless clutter at a key point in the article (right in the beginning) which dramatically effects readability. Third, it is a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Don't add clutter to an article just to prove that the topic isn't a neologism. Zeresh himself said: "If nothing, at least it refutes your claim of "neologism" which is what this AfD is based on." Here is my suggestion: move the list to the AfD page as evidence that the term is not a neologism. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, note the word "at least". "At least" means that there are other reasons too. The section improves the accuracy of the article by letting readers know that the phenomenon is well established and discussed by academics, the media, and even the United States Senate. That is by itself a top notch merit, and clearly negates the AFD's premise.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 02:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to establish that the term is discussed by scholars, provide a list of scholarly publications about the topic. For example, a quick google books search shows that there are 16,000+ books on antisemitism<a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=anti-semitism&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=anti-semitism&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. However, I found almost know scholarly books on "anti-Iranianism." Your citations don't prove that this is a term that is being used. The Farrokh article mentions the term once, the MacArthur piece uses the phrase once, the Pollack piece uses the phrase once, the Asia Times piece uses the phrase once, the Reid piece uses the phrase once, the rantbug piece uses the phrase once and is not a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">reliable source</a>.

This will mean at the very least (1) renaming (2) deleting a number of sections of the article such as the sections on imperial russia and the US (3) basing the article on a scholarly discussion of what anti-Iranianism actually is. Are you and Zereshk willing to accept the changes that have been proposed at the AfD?

<dd>Well, those sound like improvement issues, not deletion issues. (1)Why rename? Apparently, Persian Google uses this term. It describes the situation well. (2)I agree that the talk of Russia and US wars don't belong unless examples of anti-Iranian sentiment during these events are provided. I think that it is possible to do so, at least for the US case. (3)As I have said, I agree that the article should actually discuss anti-Iranian sentiments, rather than random military history that involves Iran.</dd>
<dd>These were my concerns when giving a "Weak Keep," but I definitely think that the article can be worked with, especially with the stricter oversight it now receives. Unfortunately, the Afd has, understandably, angered Iranians, especially since some have reason to believe that this may be somehow related to the anti-Iranian sentiments of certain voters(not saying its you Gabriel). I think it would be best if we all agreed to improve the article based upon these principles, and close the Afd with a "Keep" before more hostile comments are levied. In sum, this article is workable if the correct approach is taken. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 02:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think we can work out a reasonable compromise along these lines. I would like to see some of the proposed changes implemented before I withdraw the nomination. If, for example, I removed the section on the US would you support me? I don't mind an article on this topic discussing prejudice against Iranians in the US, but I don't see anything in the section right now (correct me if I'm wrong) that is actually sourced as being prejudice against Iranians. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that should be removed. The article currently has a silly military-oriented focus; usually "anti-" trends are with the people. I definitely know this exists in the US; while it <i>may</i> be reflected through political/military actions against Iran, a source needs to make this connection. For now, simply <i>hide</i> the section text, and if Zereshk or anyone else finds something that meets the criteria that was overlooked, it can be cropped back in. Ultimately, there <i>will</i> be a US section, but not as currently written. Really, just hide everything that can be soundly described as irrelevant, and then discussion can decide the rest after that.

<dd>And what exactly does that mean? Millions of non-Jews were also killed by Hitler. Concentration camps also existed for Eastern Europeans. And yet we have <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a>. Why is that? Why should there be a "special sentiment" requirement anyway? That's illogical. If thousands of others were also killed by Genghis Khan, then it needs to be told in its own place. Not withheld! I think the very fact that mountains of severed heads were built in <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neishabur.html" title="Neishabur">Neishabur</a>, even the cats and dogs killed, and salt scattered everywhere is enough reason to qualify the Mongolian Raid as a classic case of "Anti-Iranianism". Think about it: if the victims were Jews, we would probably have 342 movies of it made by now, with 3420 pages of WP articles on them. Is it not enough that millions of Iranians have been killed by this Anti-Iranianism in history?

<dd>Did the Mongols kill the Persians <i>because</i> they were Persians or just because they happened to be in the path of their conquest? A ruler can order the killing of thousands or millions of people without holding any ill-will toward them other than that their existence hinders his/her political aims (or that their extermination furthers them). <small><b>Note</b>: I am not mentioning this with particular reference to Hitler.</small> The information on the Mongol raids should be in a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol_raids.html" title="Mongol raids">Mongol raids</a> and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Persia_17af.html" title="History of Persia">History of Persia</a> articles. The more modern, concerted international effort to isolate Iran (since the Islamic Revolution, possibly earlier--my knowledge of Iran before then is rather limited) may also deserve its own article (separate from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States-Iran_relations_7086.html" title="United States-Iran relations">United States-Iran relations</a> article), but it should not be conflated with past (and I would argue present as well) animosity toward Persians and/or Iranians. That being said, I still maintain that the article should be kept and that time be given for these matters to be discussed on the talk page. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It's like me raping a girl and then telling her: "I hold no ill-will toward you other than that your existence hinders my political aims (or that your extermination furthers them)". By that very statement, I am declaring that I do not recognize her as a fellow human with rights and integrity. In your dictionary, what do you classify that as? And besides, what does it matter what the intention is anyway? I'll still face charges no matter what the intention for such a crime. "Anti-Iranianism" doesnt necessarily carry with it anti-Iranian <i>sentiment</i>. It can carry with it acts of war, acts of destruction, harm, and death to any entity affiliated with Iran, or Iran itself. Hence we can change the definition and be more clear: Anti-Iranianism is that act of which brings, or has brought, great harm to the Iranian people, culture, integrity, usurping their rights, and which is irrespective of the intention to which that act was carried out.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 09:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But I have to disagree with deleting racist actions taken by politicians. In many ocassions racism become notable when racist ideas are put into practice by peole who have power. About Iran-US relations, I would prefer to be a bit conservative as the subject is more or less a "current event" and like any other "current event", it takes time before we can cover it at a high quality. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 15:16, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, racism can be politically motivated. I agree that there was a connection between Saddam's racist ideology towards Persia and his political goals, but his propaganda manifested itself as prejudice. I agree that the reverse can also be true, although I don't think that racism is what motivates US foreign policy. The point is that we now have 35k of text that is making a highly controversial claim (that the policies of various governments towards Iran amounted to racism) without any supporting evidence that racism played a role. Not only is this a smear on the US (and the colonial powers and, I suppose, even the Mongols) but it also devalues legitimate racism against Iranians in the same way that crying "antisemitism" every time someone attacks Israel makes it more difficult for ordinary people to identify legitimate antisemitism as such and oppose it. As for wikipedia, if there are <i>notable</i> critics who identify a political decision as being racially motivated (say <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Woodward_db31.html" title="Bob Woodward">Bob Woodward</a> writes that the President's has decided to take a hard line on Iran because he thinks Iranians smell funny) than it can be included here, but right now, nothing in the sections that have been removed (and correct me if I'm wrong) is sourced as being racially motivated. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 15:28, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not think all political actions should be excluded. The Rwandan Genocide was a political action but I it qualifies as an example of "anti-Tutsi sentiment" (pardon the understatement).

If Ahmedinejad has accused the Bush administration of such, that should definitely be included.

<dd>Gabe, in my latest RV, with respect to your edits, I only added back in the Teller quote. Teller is a Nobel Laureate. That by itself qualifies his quote. Also, I will be adding to the Mongolian section. I have sources to emphasize the impact the raid had on the progress of Iran in the second millenia CE.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 01:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The raid may have had an impact, but were they acts done from anti-Iranian prejudices? Attacking a country alone isn't evidence of a prejudice against its people. Consider the Achaemenids; even though they took over other lands by force, this wasn't because of a special hatred for the peoples who lived there. Of course, the Mongols were much more brutal, but it appears that they were like that to just about anyone they attacked. The sources you add have to cite the Mongol raids as anti-Iranian acts, and preferably this will be backed up with historical evidence. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 02:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The intention doesnt matter, because that's not what "anti-Iranianism" means. <b>Anti</b> + <b><a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranianism.html" title="Iranianism">Iranianism</a></b> is clear in its meaning: Anti-Iranianism refers to any act act that causes the vast mass suffering of any entity affiliated with Iran. Trust me, if it were the Jews, they would have 10 names for it: "Holocaust", "Genocide",... . We dont have to drag the article into a scrutiny of semantics. The purpose of the article is clear: To give an overall account of the forms of suffering and assault the nation and country of Iran has gone through in its long history.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 02:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your definition of anti-Iranianism is off; this may explain the problems at this page. I don't believe I am alone here in saying that the "anti-" concepts for ethnicities refer to bigotry/racism, not merely the committing of wrongs against the people. Holocaust is antisemitic because the reason for killing those Jews was because of their Jewishness. German belief had held them as subhuman abominations that needed to be destroyed. On the other hand, the killing by the Mongols doesn't appear to be motivated by a profound hatred of Iranian peoples. It is possible that this was indeed the case, but right now, the Mongol section doesn't include any actual evidence that it was bigotry motivating the Mongolian actions. Only content that directly attests to Mongolian bigotry should be included in this article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 02:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Your analogy with the Jews is not applicable. Jews are a religious group, Iran is a country. Jews were murdered during the Holocaust because of <i>who they were</i>. Iranians were murdered by the Mongols because they stood in their way. If a Jew in Nazi Germany had blond hair and blue eyes he might hypothetically have been able to hide his Jewishness and survive. As far as I know, the Mongols pretty much killed everyone who wasn't a Mongol. There's a bigger problem here though. You are defining the term "anti-Iranianism" as "any act act that causes the vast mass suffering of any entity affiliated with Iran" - this is NOT the same as antisemitism or the other forms of racism you are comparing your "anti-Iranianism" to. If a guy puts a big rock in front of a train and unbeknownst to him a train full of Jews gets deraield and all the passengers die, <i>it isn't antisemitism</i> because the religion of the passengers was purely coincidental. However, under your definition, if a train full of Iranians derailed and all of the passengers died it would be anti-Iranianism because under your definition anti-Iranianism is "any act act that causes the vast mass suffering of any entity affiliated with Iran." This article is completely OR because it <i>defines</i> the term anti-Iranianism to include actions that are not racist. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Teller is a nobel laureate in nuclear physics, not history. Including a quote from him just looks silly, not to mention that Teller's analysis of Persian history encompasses about two sentences in an article about SDI. If Teller's analysis of the situation is in line with historians, than it shouldn't be a problem to find a real historian who can say exactly what Teller is saying. Of course this doesn't address the more fundamental problem which is that the Mongols don't fit in the same category as modern racists, at least without a source. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No... Teller can say whatever he likes.

<dd>Teller was also a political activist. I think it's important to have a Nobel Laureate in there, because it diversifies the sources.

<p>The only problem with Gabriel's edits is they did not go far enough. If you want this to be a serious article that does not get deleted, follow our policies. be encyclopedic. If anti-Iranianism is a real form of racism, use appropriate verifiable sources - no primary sources, and no nuclear phsyicists - as sources. To not muddle the article with irrlelvant information. For example, Wikipedia ought to document conflicts between persia and the Macedonians and Greeks, or Iran and the British or Americans - but that belongs in articles on Iranian history, or on "history of Iran-US conflict." Also, avoid NOR. This article was FULL of NOR.</p>
<p>The following was in the article but is not about anti-Iranianism any more than the war of 1812 is about anti-Americanism. However, some of this content may be valid. I suggest that people see what is appropriate to move to an article on Iranian or Persian history, that is where this contents belongs: <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:01, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One of the architects of Iran's partitioning was <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, who in fact first unveiled a project for the separation of Khuzestan from Iran during the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg_group.html" title="Bilderberg group">Bilderberg Meeting</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/d/Baden.html" title="Baden">Baden</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, on April 27-29, 1979.

<dd>British footprints can also be seen when exploring the origins of the Iraqi invasion plan of Iran in 1980, which were reported in a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> article early in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Iraq_war_32fd.html" title="Iran-Iraq war">Iran-Iraq war</a>. <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup>. The report was largely ignored by the mainstream press and media. The points of this report are summarized as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>A detailed invasion plan had been prepared for the Iraqi armed forces in 1950 by the British Military advisors for Iraq, a full 30 years before the invasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein.</li>
<li>The main draft of the plan had been in preparation by the British since 1937. The main axes of advance detailed in the plan corresponded exactly to the Iraqi invasion of Iran on September 22, 1980.</li>
<li>The main objective of this war plan "...called for Iraqi forces to occupy Khuzistan province and then negotiate an armistice with the Iranian government that would include the relinquishment of the province to Iraq...also liberate the Arab-speaking people living in Khuzistan". Significantly, successive changes in the Iraqi government over the next thirty years did not alter the major objectives of the British plan; these were simply updated as time progressed.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The alleged British plan for Iran's invasion indicates that even before the Bernard Lewis Plan was unveiled in the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg_group.html" title="Bilderberg group">Bilderberg Conference</a>, detailed British plans for eliminating Iran as a state have been in place long before 1979, and thus claims of foreign support in instigating ethnic unrest in Iran are not totally unfounded. Nevertheless, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg_group.html" title="Bilderberg group">Bilderberg meetings</a> are informal and are held <i>in camera</i>, without minutes - a situation that has attracted much criticism for lacking transparency and accountability <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg.html#Perspectives_on_the_nature_of_the_group" title="Bilderberg">(see)</a>. Consquently, the veracity of such reports is a matter of considerable debate, with many "insider" reports remaining unproven. What does remain certain however is that "the British would regularly toy with the idea of partitioning Persia, usually as a temporary response to a crisis". <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></dd>

<dd>I completely disagree with the "neologism" criticism. It may not be a term that is widely used by the English-speaking world, but if it has currency within Iranian scholarly circles, then it is no longer a neologism (could you perhaps add some Farsi sources documenting that the term is used?). In any case, trying to have the article deleted for that only approaches <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in my opinion. However, also note that "anti-Semitism" refers to antagonism against Jews, not the state of Israel itself (even though too often criticism of Israel or its politicians is labeled as anti-Semitism). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well in that case, then youre both wrong. You said: "Your analogy with the Jews is not applicable. Jews are a religious group, Iran is a country". That's false. "Iran" is not a country. The "Islamic Republic of Iran" is. That's why you have the name "Iran" mentioned in 200BC. Thats why it is derived from the word "Aryan", which is the name of a race and group of people. See etymology for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran#Etymology" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran#Etymology" rel="nofollow">Iran</a>--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 04:42, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I consider Jews an ethnic entity, a people, not just a religious group (though there are converts). The discrimination against them in Germany was because of their "racial" aspect; converting to Christianity did not usually save Jews from the destruction. And by the way, Anti-Iranianism is "allowed", but currently needs a lot of improvement as dictated by certain principles, and I cannot help but note that you aren't being cooperative in this compromise attempt to save the article from deletion. Deletion currently seems imminent because of the greater merit of the "delete" arguments.

<dd>Deletion is actually not "imminent" because there arent enough votes for that to happen. And no, Jews are not a race. There is great genetic difference from the Jew from Iraq or Iran, and the Jew that comes from Poland. Furthermore, Arabs are also<b>by definition</b> "semites". Please look up the word in a dictionary. Also, Genghis Khan did in fact respond only to Iranians, because his envoys were killed by Kharazm-shah. <i>In return</i>, he invaded Persia and executed Iranian civilians by the hundreds of thousands in public events, <i>because they were Iranian</i>, i.e. subjects of the Iranian king. And finally, if there is anyone that <i>is</i> being cooperative, <i>it is me</i>: I am the only one making actual <b>changes</b> to the article to improve it (adding sources, re-writing, re-phrasing, etc). All other edits so far have been nothing but <b>mass deletions</b> of multiple sections.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 06:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It ain't a poll. The delete arguments have merit, and some pretty well-established editors behind them too. I want it to stay, so I think that the compromise is a good idea. Based on your narrative, the Mongol killed a ton of civilians to get back at the king who killed the envoys. How was this because they were Iranian, <i>because of their Iranian-ness?</i> If any other king had done the same thing, would Genghis have let them go, saying "I <i>could</i> slaughter many of your people for this, but they aren't Iranian, so I'll let them go." By the way, while Arabs are technically Semites, "antisemite" only refers to Jews; please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#Etymology_and_usage" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#Etymology_and_usage" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. You may consider yourself cooperative, but as far as working <i>with</i> the concerned editors to improve the article goes, you haven't put much of an effort. The sections were deleted for very specific reasons, and given very specific criteria for re-inclusion, which you mostly ignored. However, I am glad to have you talking here; I hope you will soon realize our concerns. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 07:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, it's not a poll, but there isn't any <b>consensus</b> for deletion. And consensus is what determines the fate of the article.</li>
<li>Good answer, and now here's mine: Why do u think Hitler hated the Jews so much? Do u think he just decided one morning out of nowhere to hate Judaism? Do u think he hated Jews from day one, because of Judaism? Do u think he hated Jewish people from day one, just because of who they were? If your answer is yes, well then I have news for you. Because the answer is no. <b>Hitler grew to hate the Jews because of his personal failures in his academic career.</b> In 1939 Hitler personally permitted Dr. Bloch, a Jewish physician to emigrate from Austria. Dr. Bloc was the gentle physician who provided intensive care for of his ailing mother, and on several occasions Hitler expressed his gratitude. Another Jew was his WWI commanding officer, who recommended Hitler for the Iron Cross. Hitler's years in Vienna from 1907 to 1913 were the most difficult years of his life. He was trying to become an Architect and to make himself a name in field of arts. He was twice rejected from the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. The second rejection by the Academy was one of the most traumatic experiences of his life; all his dreams were shattered.<a href="http://www.kimel.net/hitjew.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kimel.net/hitjew.html" rel="nofollow">(and the very words Im using here are from an actual Holocast surviver)</a> After discovering that four out of seven professors that rejected him were Jewish <b>he blamed the Jews for his failure</b>. Contrasting to his own failures he saw the successful and prospering Jews in all fields of arts and culture, business and politics. That's why he writes in Mein Kampf: <b>"Gradually, I began to hate them."</b> So no, youre wrong. The wrath of Hitler against Jewry are in the same exact category of the wrath of the Mongols against the Iranians. Only, they took place in a different time and different place and in a different manner. But the reason was exactly the same: A "reaction".</li>
<li>I dont know what u mean by "pretty well established editors". Firstly, I am the primary author of this article. Second, I have nearly 20,000 edits on 2,500 WP articles of Iranian relevance. So that makes me more <i>established</i> than all of you combined. Thirdly, I actually speak the Persian language and know its history better than those who are voting for its deletion. That by itself makes them un-knowledgeable of Iran. Basically, they are voting for deletion based on a false premise.</li>
<li>So "Semites" refers to Arabs, and yet its "anti" does not. Now how ludicrous is that? Hence I hope you realize that "anti-semitic" referring only to Jews is a <i>popular (and well established I might say) misnomer</i>.</li>
<li>As for me not "working with the concerned editors", an "editor" is one who has actually participated in the formation of the article. <b>None</b> of the people on this pro-AFD are actual "concerned <i>editors</i>". They contributed NOTHING to this article's body. I am THE ONLY one present who has. The people I am going up against, only want the article erased from public exposure. And that's sad.</li>
<li>The "criteria" you speak of are based on a fallacies: There <i>is</i> no "neologism". There <i>is</i> no such thing as a <i>country</i> called "Iran", and yet the article defines itself to cover both sentiments against the country <i>and</i> the people.</li>
<li>I have to go. Peace.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 07:53, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is you should realize the legitimate concerns others have regarding this article. It's a close call; you need to work out the issues they have with the article, or their deletion arguments will retain merit.</li>
<li>How is that the same as Genghis Khan? So what if his antisemitic sentiments started with some bad experience with Jews? The sentiment was still because of <i>who they were</i>. Besides, since when was Hitler the origin of the German anti-Semitism of that period? He definitely was a big player but it had its roots in crazy academics, traditional antisemitic views, and more. But really, you need to point to a specific anti-Iranian sentiment of Genghis, not just killing civilians to punish a king who killed a diplomatic envoy.</li>
<li>Well, if you don't think that the people voted at the AFD are well-established, that is your opinion. Of course, minor editors like me aren't that established, but I was surprised at some of the people who showed up there.</li>
<li>Yes, the "semite" thing is silly, but that is the way it is. On the bright side, you have just learned a new thing.</li>
<li>I was referring to "editors" in the sense of "Wikipedia editors," though they still qualify as editors even if they just remove passages. Plus, some have added improvements, and the removals were done for specific and justified reasons. If you want to prevent this article from being erased, I recommend working with the other editors. The compromise is possible because the AFD nominator GabrielF was willing to drop the AFD if certain things were removed or changed because were not actual examples of anti-Iranian prejudice. On the other hand, your reverts and similar reverts from other editors have threatened this compromise and have strengthened the AFD by demonstrating that the article is unworkable.</li>
<li>The criteria I spoke of are the ones regarding improvement, not the deletion. Specifically, the removal of irrelevant passages, primarily from the Mongol, Russian, and USA sections. The article should address what all of the other "anti-ethnicity" ideas address; prejudice. Not simply any act that happened to affect the people negatively. Until agreement is found on the definition, this article will remain unworkable.</li>
<li>Peace to you as well. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 08:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Come on Behnam, ghabool kon I have a sound conculsion: If instead of Jews, he had suffered his personal misfortunes from (say) Chinese people, he would have developed his (evil) theories of hatred against the Chinese. He says it himself that he didnt harbor initial hatred against Jews, but that he "grew to hate them". And also, anti-semitism was an academic thing going around. But it was Hitler that massacred 6 million Jews, just like the genocide of Persia by the Mongols. And btw, there is no real difference between a mass deletion, and an AFD to delete the article. That's not a "compromise". You remind me of Condi Rice agreeing to talk to Iran about its nuclear program, on the pre-condition that it abandons its nuclear program. And finally, I actually dont mind if at the end, GabrielF et al successully delete the article, because it proves my point: it's all a politically motivated move. Iran is about to be invaded in a new great war, and pro-Israeli WP editors are denying that anti-Iranianism exists? sweet.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 08:41, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added what could be a start for an "In the United States" section (actually, I'm thinking of adding 1-2 sentences in front of what's there now about Iranian immigration to the US and/or general animosity against Muslims in general).

<p>I cant revert anymore because of the 3rr rule. However I will copntinue to revert the <b>mass blackout</b> of 2/3 of an article with over 100 sources until we reach a consensus. That's just not right. Here's my proposal and position:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can help with improving the article, but I wont agree on a mass deletion of entire sections. That's just not justifiable, unless you convince me that there is a difference between <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a>.</li>
<li>I cant let the Mongolian section be totally wiped out. I challenge u to prove to me that the genocide of Persia by the Mongols is any different than the genocide of the Jews by Hitler. Behnam tried, but failed (and obviously he refuses to accept the failure of his argument, but u can read the discourse 2 sections above and see for yourself).</li>
<li>I cant let the colonial sections be wiped out. From an Iranian perspective, and Im talking what is officially taught in schools in Iran, the policies carried out by Imperial Russia and Great Britain during <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_game_fc4b.html" title="The Great game">The Great game</a> are the most "despicable moments of Iran's history", both against the country, and against her people (which is why the clerics were so involved, issuing fatwas against both GB and IR). For example, the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmanchai_Treaty_5744.html" title="Turkmanchai Treaty">Turkmanchai Treaty</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golestan_Treaty_4621.html" title="Golestan Treaty">Golestan Treaty</a> are seen by Iranians, as one of the, if not <i>the</i> saddest events of Iranian history. I can bring u sources that exactly say this, if u want me to. Im not making this stuff up. Theres even a proverb in Persian language/literature: "If there's any blaming to be made, blame it on the British". I urge u to study Iran's history in the past 3 centuries, then pull out your judgement. If it werent for the Colonialist policies of the British, Iran would be a VERY diffferent country today. (<a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan_Shuster_bcb0.html" title="Morgan Shuster">Morgan Shuster</a> would not have been forced to resign, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ajax_0f22.html" title="Operation Ajax">Operation Ajax</a> would not have happened and thus <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khomeini.html" title="Khomeini">Khomeini</a> would probably not have had an Islamic revolution, etc etc)</li>
<li>I cant allow the US section to go either. That is <b>directly relevant</b>. And I wont buy the nonsense hogwash that "I need to prove" that shooting down 290 Iranian civilians by the US navy, or unilateral sanctions against Iran, or supporting Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war, is anti-Iranian. That's just plain ridiculous. <b>Killing Iranians IS anti-Iranian. IT NEEDS NO PROOF.</b></li>
<li><i>Instead</i> of going back and forth on reverts, let me go thru the article again, and further trim out the sections that I think can be condensed, trimmed, transferred, or cut out. Then we can discuss the rest. But u have to discuss why an ENTIRE section has to be deleted. U have to convince me historically a case of non-significance to drop an entire section.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 09:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You need to distinguish between conflicts between states and racism. They are not the same and deserve separate articles. There may be specific moments in history where there is overlap or convergence and both articles should summarize those moments of convergence. But these are otherwise two topics that do not belong in the same article. Killing Iranians is no more anti-Iranian than French killing Germans is anti-German or Germans killing French is anti-French, in any sense <i>other</i> than that used in International Relations. A better analogy: during WWII there was plenty of racism betwen Japanese and Americans. But an article on American racism against Japanese that discusses the entire war in the Pacific is absurd and would be deleted or severely edited. We would have one article on racism against Japanese and another on WWII. You are conflating many different things here just to push your own agenda.

<dd>The Mongolian arguments still stand; you can't just dismiss them by claiming you defeated them! Anyway, do you even have a source defining anti-Iranianism as a 'anything that affects Iranians negatively'? I really doubt it, since in my experience, the usage refers to bigotry against Iranians. And that appears to be what most of the other editors consider it. This isn't <i>your</i> research page; you can't define anti-Iranianism as 'anything that affected Iranians negatively' and then go and narrate upon everything bad that happened to Iranians. Everything needs to be relevant according to the sources themselves, not just your interpretation of them, and of course, this article needs to operate upon a sound definition of the term. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Possible solution with multiple sourcing?</b> - Zereshk, if you can provide sources (I don't even think they <i>have</i> to be English-language) that show that certain people (either in the Iranian government, high-profile social figures, or academics) perceive the Mongol raids and actions by the US as anti-Iranianism (in the sense of being motivated by animosity against the Iranian people and not just the Iranian regime), then I think these claims should be included. However, as there is controversy surrounding this, <b>they should be presented as claims, not as obvious facts.</b> On a side note regarding the Iran Air incident, killing certain members of a group is not proof of animosity against the group in its entirety (it is not even proof of animosity against the individuals killed). Note that if the Iranian government claims the shooting was motivated by hatred/dislike of Iranians, then <i>that</i> should be noted (and sourced). If such sourced claims exist (and you've noted that they do), deliberately excluding them would (in my opinion) constitute <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<p>Very well then. You all agree that all of it stays with more sources. Luckily, ضد ایرانی (which means "anti-Iranian") gives 272,000 hits on google. Unfortunately, I have a full time job, and dont have time to spend disputing you people 24/7. But then again, on the long-run, your efforts are useless: Iran is about to be invaded and bombed into a new war. Trumpeting things like "how does killing Iranians relate to Anti-Iranianism?" just makes you look even more ridiculous.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 21:17, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the consensus is that it can stay with sources that document that someone notable entity or a reliable source considers it anti-Iranianism or anti-Iranian sentiment. I still maintain that killing Iranians is not anti-Iranianism. If I remember correctly, there are 20,000 - 25,000 murders in the US every year--very few of these murders are motivated by anti-Americanism or perpetrated by anti-American individuals. And finally, I hope no one is stupid enough or greedy/reckless enough to invade Iran--actually, I'm sure there are many politicians who fit this criterion, but in any case, I hope they don't succeed.

<dd>First I would also like to congratulate you all on your eloquence and your instrumental contributions despite your sometimes (to-me-natural) frustrations (Ok now you should know that I am a rookie and I am stepping up the soapbox, ehem!). I think to some extent Zereshk's comment addresses the root causes of today's Iranian/American jazz. We can differentiate between the government grand policies and the common people, nonetheless <i>De Facto</i> the line is gray, given the PR of both sides. And many feel and interpret the action/reaction attitude, which stimulates the "happy triggers" radicalism both in Iran and in the US. What I am trying to say is that history has a memory, over-rating it, is as dangerous as ignoring it. It is interesting to know that the popular Persian anthem "Ey Iran"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ey_Iran" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ey_Iran" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, written by Hossein Gol-e-Golab, was inspired when he saw an <i><b>American soldier beating an Iranian grocer</b></i><a href="http://www.avanama.com/view.asp?id=40&amp;cat=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.avanama.com/view.asp?id=40&amp;cat=3" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> in Tehran, when Iran was under occupation. I am not sure about Behnam and Zereshk, but many people (from different backgrounds or mindsets) consider this piece somewhat a national anthem. I am having a rather “after-taste” now after I learned the story and every time that I hear it. Every time I hear it, it reminds me that the nation was insulted under occupation by the Americans. More technically, do I consider it anti-Persian or anti-Iranian? Probably not in my conscience but <b>definitely yes</b> in subconsciousness since I am sentimentally associated to Iran and the Persian people. All said, I wish these bad memories and hatred would be replaced by goodwill and benevolence.
<dl>
<dd>Irrelevant though to the above, but as an aside, during WWII, using the local workforce, Americans were making millitary airplanes and tanks for Russia in Iran (I guess in Andimeshk) as a part of lend-lease (aid) treaty between the US and Russia. After the war ended, they dismantled the whole thing.</dd>

<p>I have noticed that there are a lot of unsourced claims in the article. That should probably be addressed right away, as unsourced content can be removed without warning.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 16:37, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, I <i>strongly</i> suggest that those who have an interest in keeping a majority of this article intact need to find RS reference citations for many of the statements in the article. Many of the statements are clearly POV pushing and obviously biased. Those of you who know the subject well need to go through this article by Sunday and remove or correct the statements. After that time, uncited information will be removed without warning.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 02:39, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A certain part of this page regarding Alexander the Great which lacked a lot of citation was edited repeatedly and the editor stated it was due to extreme POV (Point Of View??). After reviewing it I edited changing 2 key things (and reverted some of it to the original because the new content seemed based on that editors thoughts and lacked citation) It was written that the ENTIRE Persian Empire was conquered and it is very likely certain cities remained independant so I removed the word "entire". Secondly in a source I had read before it was stated that Alexander's conquest was during the time which Darius the Great was poisoned. This was reverted back and my edit was passed off as "nonesense" by Behnam, care to explain why? You seem to be removing everything I write, I want an explanation as to why it is not correct. I did not sign up in order to "troll" or write nonsense so if any of the information I write is incorrect I want to know why. Cyrus777</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but some of the claims were highly questionable. For example, the one about <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius_the_Great_2b10.html" title="Darius the Great">Darius the Great</a> being poisoned, this causing chaos, and Alexander taking advantage of this chaos. First of all, what is the reliable source for the fatal poisoning? More importantly, what is your source for the notion that a 'chaos' set in such that Alexander was able to conquer the empire? Are you aware that there is more than 150 years between Darius the Great's death and Alexander's conquest? The claim is dubious. Also, the claims about 'common Iran-folk' not being in the army are questionable. The tone of your passage was sort of apologetic/refutational, which is not appropriate for WP. Really, that section needs to be cut down; the historical information is not about Anti-Iranianism. I'll get to that trimming soon. Anyway, the 'trolling' issue was the highly uncivil rant against Arcayne that you posted on that other page. Since you seem pretty new you may want to see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Basically, just stick to constructive criticism.

<p>I would be lying if I said I remember the sources as I do not that is why I didn't state them. I will look into this and see if I can find any creditable sources when I get the time. Secondly the other claims were not my writing, it was previously written and edited. The editor's edit seemed to be based on point of view (at first glance) as it lacked citation so I reverted much of what was written. I should have more carefully read what was being reverted because as you say it may be incorrect. As for the rant against Arcayne, it is questionable if that was trolling, I think it was rather apt. Removing things as he did is just disrespectful. As you were able to tell, I am new to this (I don't even know how to state what type of edit I have done in those tags), that is why I am reading the page which explains the basics of editing. Hopefully next time I will have solid proof of what I write. You seem to know a fair amount about these topics, to prevent any possible mistakes in things I edit in the future, how would I be able to contact you (or other wikipedia users)? Through the individual's talk page? Or is there another way. Cyrus777 10:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've posted the contact help on your talk page. If you ever find the sources bring them here so that we can also take a look at them. I'm completely serious when I say that I never have seen the 'chaos' claim, so it is best that we all take a look at whatever the source was for the idea.

<p>"The image shows how the western world thinks of Persian Empire as the evil because of what is told by Greek historians"</p>
<p>I'll ignore the odd use of the definite article. Does the picture show what it allegedly shows? What do you mean by the "Western world"? Would that be the single mother in a British council estate who has never heard of the Persian Empire? Or is it the art collector with a myriad of scenes from across the globe? It's a bit rich to have a whine article on how others supposedly ascribe negative characteristics to your own group and at the same time make such sweeping generalisations. I do hope I'm not being anti-Iranian by saying that.</p>

<p>In 2007 the Arab director of "New York South Asian Film Festival" admitted that a conscious decision was made not to invite any Iranian filmmakers. Ahmed Issawi said: "That’s a territory I no longer want to tread". "It’s over. Given the whole thing with Iran—I refuse to approach it.", Issawi added.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
