<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zordrac's categories</span></h2>
<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty of refactoring your separate nominations for Zordrac's various categories into one single nomination. It seems obvious to me that people who will vote on one of those categories will vote similarly on the others, and collecting them all into one nomination seems to make things easier.</p>
<p>However, I have no strong feelings on this one way or the other, so if you think the community is better served by having them listed seperately, feel free to revert me. In any case, I felt you'd wish to know.</p>
<p>All the best.<br />

<dl>
<dd>I actually think it's better to list them all as one nomination, so I thank you for the refactoring. My listing them all separately was motivated in part by the knowledge that any minor deviation from the letter of the procedure would be jumped on by the users harassing me and cited as purported instances of my flouting the rules. (Though I don't know why they bother; it's not like they haven't shown themselves willing to testify to entirely fictitious events...) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:32, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That page is certainly getting out of hand. I have now removed both the personal attack against you as well as the "sarcastic" delete vote comments and added some advice to 'stay cool'; hopefully that will end the revert war. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 22:01, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

It has. On my end anyways. Thanks Quarl. LHF</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">re: reply</span></h2>
<p>Hey Antaeus, I just wanted to reply to your note. I don't think what I did was quite as exaggerated as your metaphor of stealing from Habitat for Humanity - although as a writer and artist, I do love a bit of drama peppered in here and there. I understand you as well as hundreds of other editors face harassment due to your decisions in editing and revisions. but I think that is a choice you make when becoming an admin here - and as an admin to - not only make sure the quality the information is intact, but to encourage kind and thoughtful behavior - rather then belittling and judging someone and making assumptions about how they feel. I was thankful for Quarl for not only removing the sarcastic comments, but also acting in an unbiased manner to mediate.</p>
<p>I was having harmless fun with wikipedia by posting the hoax article - and when I felt that you weren't gonna respond to inquiry about unnecessary sarcastic comments I adapted and began posting my own sarcastic comments.</p>
<p>I know doing so was basically counter positive, but I just couldn't grasp your comment that for me, summed up Wikiquette as a general "make up the rules as we see fit" idealogy. So that left me disappointed and was not encouraging me to seek some sort of positive conclusion.</p>
<p>My sarcastic edits/comments was me trying to quickly illustrate why i thought all sarcastic comments should follow the wikiquette in all instances - even AfD's.</p>
<p>And in general, I really don't think you are bad person or admin, I'm sure its hard to be an admin, and that is why I don't want to seek any such position out. Truth be told, if I were in your shows, my patience with Wikipedia in general would have worn out long ago. Anyhow, I'd like to think we are leaving off with under good terms. I don't have it in me to hold a grudge.</p>
<p>LHF</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, I'm not an admin. Many people have encouraged me to seek adminship; I have been tempted, but always declined, because I know the position requires some qualities that I don't at this point in my life have, primarily a great deal of <i>patience</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second of all, I understand that it may have been frustrating to you to read some sarcastic comments from Hedley, and it may have been frustrating to ask why sarcastic comments of that nature were permitted and not receive an answer in the timeframe you expected. However, are you trying to tell me that you don't see a difference between "sarcastically mocking a person's insistence that what they wrote was true" (and, let's not forget, it <i>wasn't</i> true, so you can't really fault Hedley for correctly guessing that it was a hoax) and "using Google to try and dig up dirt on a Wikipedia editor, then presenting it in a public place to try and embarrass that editor, and trying to seek out others who want to hurt that editor and hand them all the damaging information you can for them to use as a weapon"? I'm afraid that if you're telling me you thought Hedley phrasing the reasons why he was voting "delete" in a sarcastic manner -- and Wikipedians declining to let you edit other people's votes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gunk_Land&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32650994" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gunk_Land&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32650994" rel="nofollow">as you had done before</a> -- gave you free license to target editors for the kind of personal harassment you engaged in, that's not the way it works. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:44, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>I apologized - But Quarl and Hedley's sarcastic comments weren't constructive criticism - just plain insults. I removed the offending words - Quarl thankfully apologized and struck out his criticism. And Hedley knew it was a hoax, I had already posted numerous times that it was at that point. He was trying to sneak in an insult and criticism veiled in a strikeout. I have noticed that this is something that has happened to you as well - noted in your "In Progress" page. I take it as something that immature editors do to veil their insults.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I openly welcome constructive criticism when presented with it - but I won't stand for insults. As a newbie, I wasn't aware of the rules of "vandalism, and general editing guidelines. Perhaps there should be roadblocks for newbie's like me, that can't post until they have understood how to post. What I did was wrong - but it takes two to tango, and you engaged as well.</p>
<p>In any case, I apologize and I removed the offending edits from the current page. Lastly - outside the scope of this blemish - I think you would make a fine Admin. (And if you wanna delete this entry in your discussion section I am ok with it.)</p>
<p>LHF</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, so that perhaps you won't see Hedley's actions in such a poor light, please be aware that AfD is a <i>very</i> rough place, because of all the places of Wikipedia, it's the one with the highest concentration of both new editors who don't understand Wikipedia or its goals or its procedures, and malicious editors who are only out to cause disruption. Editors who take on the rigors of dealing with AfD deal with all sorts of personal attacks: claims that they're censors, claims that they're in the pay of the CIA/Big Pharma/The MediMafia/the vast right-wing conspiracy/the liberal media conspiracy, personal insults that they're too stupid to understand Wikipedia policy (that the page creator just read that day), claims that they're shallow and narrow-minded -- and <i>that's</i> just from editors who aren't violating the rules <i>purposely</i>. This is why AfD has a much different atmosphere than the rest of Wikipedia (and there <i>used to be</i> a prominent warning on the main AfD page, alerting people of this) -- anyone who spends any amount of time at AfD gets battle-hardened and tends to express themselves more bluntly, and with more sarcastic humor, than would be appropriate on other Wikipedia pages where new editors and troublemakers tend to show up one at a time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hedley's remarks were sarcastic, yes, and yes, they were mocking your continued insistence that the show <i>really had</i> existed. It wasn't, perhaps, a particularly acute and targeted bit of sarcasm, but it was on-topic; you <i>were</i> still posing as multiple people who had supposedly seen the show themselves and were testifying to its existence and its hard-to-believe contents, and you were even making personal remarks about anyone who would <i>fail</i> to believe you. "To say a show is a hoax because of its potent content is silly and short sighted." "I also can't help but see humor and irony in the concept of an anonymous jury debating the validity of my memories and experiences.&#160;:P" As I hope you now realize, attempted hoaxes, while they may be intended as harmless fun, are perceived as a hostile breach of faith, and this is <i>especially</i> true when attempts to keep the hoax going turn into attempts to discredit the people who have correctly determined that it <i>is</i> a hoax.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you'd like to know why you weren't allowed to edit Quarl's "crap" or Hedley's struck-out-by-him comments, reading <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Decision_Policy" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Decision Policy</a> may explain it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:34, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gator's not an admin, but I am. I've taken a quick glance at this stuff you mention. Could you provide some diffs for the supposed "vandalism" that DannyWilde alludes to? I think he is rather confused, but just want to make sure of the circumstances surrounding this.

<dd>Certainly. These are the edits to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a> that Danny calls vandalism:

</dd>
<dd>At this point I asked other editors for help, as Danny showed no signs of stopping or even of understanding that he <i>might not</i> be in the right, and it was my understanding of Wikipedia policy that merging the entire contents of an article under AfD to different articles was forbidden as it effectively made an end run around the whole AfD process. <i>Will continue finding all the links tomorrow -- have to go to bed now. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 07:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>I just took a look at those diffs and DannyWilde's deleted user page. Nothing that would be considered vandalism. Editing his user page might have been bad form, but since it morphed into essentially a user <i>talk</i> page discussion, not a blockable offense. As I remarked on his talk page, reverting what amounts to an end-run around AfD ought to be commended; it's not something you get blocked for. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 07:35, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dianetics problems</span></h2>
<p>Have you taken a gander at the current state of the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> article? The two editors who have been deleting stuff willy-nilly from many Scientology-related articles on grounds that statements are "uncitable" have turned the Dianetics article into a hash of run-on sentences, non-sequiters, and unabashed pro-Scientology POV. On the talk page, they're congratulating each other on how readable and useful they article has become. I don't have the time and energy to hash things out point-by-point with these guys, nor do I want to engage in an edit war. It seems like a good thing to have some Scientologists among the editorial mix for articles on those topics, but they're really making a mess of it. Any suggestions of how to proceed?

<dd>I'm aware of the two users you mention, but unfortunately I don't have a lot of time and energy myself, and most of what I do have is sadly being diverted to a number of problem users, one of whom is trying to get vengeance for what he calls "blanking vandalism" (the pre-emptive merging of the complete contents of an article under AfD to a different article) by posting what he thinks is my real name multiple places, the other of whom is telling lots of untrue stories: first claiming I threatened him and made wild accusations and told him I was watching him; then claiming that <i>after</i> that I then <i>requested</i> him to do what he did, which was write to a difficult person that Wikipedia has had multiple problems with and tell him "Antaeus Feldspar is using weasel words in an underhanded campaign to discredit you"; then claiming that after he "helped" me this way as I had "requested" I "stalked" him by finding out where he was telling people that I was vandalizing, Wikistalking, violating the fifteen-revert rule and suchlike, and posting the correct version of events along with the diffs for proof.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, uh, yeah. Ironically, one of the latest claims made by the guy who claims I "requested" him to misrepresent him to someone who <i>already</i> had a hard-on against Wikipedia is the claim that he is "unaware of any legitimate edits" by me. Well, a) it only proves that he didn't look, or more probably didn't bother to check the truth because he had no intention of telling it, and b) it's not like I'm going to make a lot <i>more</i> legitimate edits because I have these two harassing me. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:24, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per Wikipolicy I removed uncited sentences from the Squirrels portion of the Scientology article and placed it into the Discussion area. I pasted it, posted my reasons clearly and invited discussion. You Ignored the discussion which I cited the reason for the difference, the change and reposted your original research. That is against and counter to Wiki Policy. You have done and act which is wrong and counter to Wikipedia Policy. You ignored the discussion, you didn't cite or verify the sentences which you reposted. You are not editing appropriately. Specifically the last sentence of what I removed and you reposted is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, many point out that the Church has itself introduced changes to Hubbard's Scientology, such as the "patter drills" introduced in 1995, and cite this as an indication that the Church is more worried about losing its position as the only source of 'true' Scientology than in keeping Scientology true to Hubbard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is an inaccurate statement. The Patter Drills are not within the address of HCOPL of 16 April 1965 Issue II. That Policy Letter addresses Practical Drills. Patter Drills are not Practical Drills. Patter Drills are Theory Drills. Your misunderstand something. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 06:28, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Which makes a generality from one specific action (creation of patter drills) which is probably not true and then states that the CoS is "worried" and further implies the CoS is not using actual Hubbard doctrine. You are required to provide verification to place such a statement in an article. You are off policy. That is probably original research <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> but if it is not then a source of that information must be cited. I have posted this same line of reasoning on the Scientology Discussion page and you have ignored my alert of it my edit. I am posting it here.

<dd>Cite the information. One's ethics level can be observed by how easily the person under observation confronts simplicity. This is real simple.

</dl>
<p>Furthermore, you have proceeded past several misunderstoods. "You Ignored the discussion which I cited the reason for the difference, the change and reposted your original research." This makes it sounds as if I wrote the material which you removed about the patter drills being evidence of the RTC "pejoratively dehumanizing" those it calls squirrels, which I did not write, nor did I restore. However, I restored the facts: The Church instituted patter drills in 1995, after Hubbard's death, and many point to this as evidence for the view that the Church is <i>not</i> concerned with keeping Scientology in line with Hubbard, but in keeping themselves the sole 'official' source of it. If you believed that either of these statements were incorrect, you should have followed the procedures at <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccuracy_dispute_97fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute">Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute</a>, marking them {{<a href="../../../d/u/b/Template%7EDubious_a2d6.html" title="Template:Dubious">dubious</a>}} and making a request on the talk page for verification, rather than yanking them out of the article where it's unlikely that <i>anyone</i> will fix them, because very few people knew they were there. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is an important policy, but if you were under the impression that it gave you <i>carte blanche</i> to remove any statement whose verification</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> states: "Avoid weasel words such as, "Some people say…" Instead, make your writing verifiable..." Had you done that, this issue would not be before you now. Because the sentences in question begin with "many people ...." and is not cited. I therefore removed the uncited information per that same Citing sources directive. Specifically it states: "When there is a factual dispute .. Disputed edits can be removed immediately, removed and placed on the talk page for discussion.... Which I have clearly stated several times now. Those are the Wiki Policies and directives I actioned from and why I actioned from them.</p>
<p>...was not handed to you on a silver platter, you are, again, proceeding past your misunderstoods.</p>

You would be best advised not to, since you have been at Wikipedia less than a month, and it's just possible that you have not grasped as much of Wikipedia policy as you believe you have, particularly the end goal that all that policy is intended to serve. To be honest, your suggestion that you will go reviewing "every sentence [I] create", "pointing out line by line where and how you have failed and done wrong", smacks not just of arrogance, but of incivility and harassment.</dd>

<p>Note to Feldspar: Re clinical depression article. I only referred to my book in the edit summary, not in the article proper. The reason I referred to my book was that mjformica removed my contribtion, citing it as "patently incorrect." This kind of ad hominen attack is definitely against Wikopedia policy. I only referenced my book as a way of establishing my credentials. My Wikopedia contribution is based on years of research, including talking to the leading experts in mood disorders.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure just what you're referring to as an <i>ad hominem</i> attack, but none of what you've described matches the actual definition of an <i>ad hominem</i> attack.

<dd>As far as your book establishing your credentials, the problem is that we have no way of verifying even that you are who you say you are, let alone that your book really is coming out, that it really says what you say it says, and finally that what it says represents either the mainstream or a significant minority viewpoint.

<p>Hello Antaeus Feldspar, once again I find myself attempting to talk with you about something. I don't have great hopes, but here goes. You stated: "Narconon's dangerous use of vitamin overdoses to treat drug abuse but who also opposes drug abuse, you have disproved Scientology's beliefs. --Antaeus Feldspar" Which, from my point of view says you have some concern for those poor people who are forced into vast overdoses of vitamins in an effort to overcome their vast overdoeses of drugs. I realize you consider there is little hope for such sods anyway, but might we talk about this? 66.248.87.133 01:51, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You say "once again," so I'm guessing that I know you better under some other name. Terryeo, perhaps? Anyhow, the complete sentence that you quoted above was "If you find a single person who opposes Narconon's dangerous use of vitamin overdoses to treat drug abuse but who also opposes drug abuse, you have disproved Scientology's beliefs." I'm not sure why you think you "realize" that I "consider there is little hope for such sods"; I would hardly describe that as what I actually think on the subject, and I can't think of anything I've written that would even lend itself to that interpretation, but if you tell me what gave you that impression, I might understand better why you think that's what I think.</dd>

<dd>I'm quite willing to talk about "this", even though I have to admit, I'm not sure which "this" you mean -- whether I have concern for drug addicts in Narconon treatment, whether I think there is hope for drug addicts in Narconon treatment, or something else different.

<p>I saw your article on the fake author Anthony Godby Johnson and I saw an interesting connection with the JT LeRoy news. I'm not sure if you had heard about it, but it seems JT LeRoy is alleged to be a fake author, concocted to garner celebrity attention and assistance to help publish a fake history. There is an article on the New York Times and a few other AP sources -</p>
<p><br />
I figured you might enjoy the parallels between the two.</p>
