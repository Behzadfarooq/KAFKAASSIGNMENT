<p>Whoa, the proposed currency is fixed to gold? WTF? Which major industrial country still has a non-floating currency? This deserves some extensive coverage over the ramifications, especially in regards to trade policy with the US. If the renminbi is no longer informally fixed to the dollar, then that could drastically change the competitiveness of Chinese exports. I'm not an expert on the subject so I don't feel comfortable analyzing it, but someone who knows more about it should do a write-up. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKent_Wang_61ca.html" title="User:Kent Wang">Kent Wang</a> 17:03, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The historical claim is based on Chinese settlement of Taiwan during the Ming and Qing dynasties; including formal incorporation into the Qing empire in 1885 by Emperor Guangxu.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The sentence above was modified. It looks obsurd to use settlements for claims of sovereignty. Settlement does not imply sovereignty, otherwise Israle could have the sovereignty of Gaza already. Or perhaps Afican countries could claim all over the world since every single Homo Sapien springs from African settlements in other part of the world. If this sentence is the PRC official position, please restore that text when the source is attributed and refered. During the Ming dynasty, Taiwan was under Dutch rule. Even the Tungning Empire is an independent country signs trade treaties with western countries. That sentece does not comform the historical reality.<a href="../../../m/a/b/User%7EMababa_77df.html" title="User:Mababa">Mababa</a> 03:57, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A lot of things on this page may look absurd to people who don't understand Chinese thinking. This is a difficult article to write, because on the one hand it needs to describe accurately the position China has taken and on the other hand, being in the _English_ Wikipedia, it does need to attempt to explain that in a way that an English-speaking <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_World_97bb.html" title="Western World">Westerner</a> can potentially understand, which is hard. As far as settlements leading to sovreignty, that is not unusual in history; large parts of the land in the US is under US sovreignty at least partly because settlers kept moving into it until they were the overwhelming majority (the entire Eastern seaboard was settled in this fashion while the colonies were still under English control; later the US itself did this in such locations as the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Territory_2237.html" title="Northwest Territory">Northwest Territory</a>, Texas, and Hawaii). The example you give, of Israel, is arguably another example (see <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">Kibbutz</a>) of this phenomenon (although, Israel did also have a pre-existing historical connection with the land, albeit not in recent times). I do not think it is unusual for a government of China to base a claim to the island of Taiwan on settlement that happened during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and I doubt whether this is one of the more contested points of the whole issue between the ROC and PRC. However, I am by no means an expert on Chinese thinking (and in fact don't really understand the thinking behind the One China policy at all). --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a>, 2006 Jan 28.</dd>

<dd><i>By contrast, the pan-blue coalition has stated that they support a one China, different interpretations and the 92 consensus and would be willing to negotiate with the PRC on those terms. It is worth of noting that the so-called "one China, different interpretations" interpretation supported by the Taiwanese pan-blue coalition has been rejected by the PRC officials as part of the PRC defined 92 consensus.</i></dd>

<p>Sentences above removed. The pan-blue did not support the one China, different interpretations and the 92 consensus as a response specifically toward the enactment of the anti-secession law. That was their general value all the time.

<dd>Yes but all of these statements were made before the offer of <i>equal status</i>. I'm looking for a statement that the MAC or anyone else made after Hu's four point speech or in response to the anti-secession law that says in effect "we don't trust Beijing because of its position on WHO". <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadrunner_b57c.html" title="User:Roadrunner">Roadrunner</a> 06:37, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the text of the law, independence under whatever form or banner (以任何形式獨立) is also independence.

<p>Instntnood has placed this in his mainland China category. This is entirely incorrect. First, since it directly relates to how the PRC thinks it is dealing with it's own (claimed) provinces, <i>specifically Taiwan</i> it is incorrect to use the term mainland China, which excludes Taiwan. Second, national laws dealing with interactions of member states specifically aren't regional laws. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 14:46, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes from the political point of view it's deal with the PRC. But as a law it is only applied, valid and applicable within mainland China. It is not a national law as stated in the Annex III of the basic laws of the two SARs. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 15:01, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Doesn't the article say something to that effect? "state press mentioned explicitly that the law was not intended to be applied to Hong Kong and Macao." Good, gotcha covered.

<dd>Before the details of the law came out, ppl in Hong Kong expressed concern that it would be a general "Anti-Secession Law" aimed at everybody (Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, what have you), and so would in effect legislate by stealth Article 23 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong (a section dealing with sedition and treason, and very very controversial in Hong Kong).</dd>
<dd>This is why the state press came out to say that it wouldn't apply to Hong Kong and Macao, which it doesn't.</dd>

<p>Man what are you tryna do? Be sarcastic? Well I'm really disappointed at your comment in ur last edit summary. Calling me stupid is definitely a PA. As to your points above, unfortunately, your favorite PRC doesn't want to admit the existence of the ROC government in Taiwan maybe you should inform them they are not administering the 23 million population in Taiwan, so claiming the issue as a domestic affair is bootless and to quote you "stupidity to the extreme". Yes, people who are neutral should recognize the vast difference between Taiwan and China. I do have a problem with a Chinese government administering Taiwan, but not now when we have a democracy, the name is strictly formality (brought by KMT anyway when they came from China and massacred a whole bunch of Taiwanese in that 2-28 incident). My real concern is a Chinese government (meaning PRC) annexing Taiwan, I don't really care about the difference between ROC and Taiwan. Just to tell you I'm a really poor reader of simplified character and never lived in Taiwan in my life so accusing me possessing strong POV is unjustified. I just felt wikipedia need to educate the general public in a more neutral perspective so therefore my contribution is essential especially in the midst of Chinese communist propaganda administrators who are apparently gang patrolling these articles. As to Taiwan using Mandarin as the official language, I do believe Taiwan should make English and Taiwanese as well as Mandarin all official languages. But that's another issue, so let's not go that far. Anyway, final point, I realized you didn't read my new username properly, unfortunately.--<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">Certified.Gangsta</a> 09:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
