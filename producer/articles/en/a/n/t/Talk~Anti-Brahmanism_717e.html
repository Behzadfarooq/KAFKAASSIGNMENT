<p>Anti-Brahminism is not haterness towards people but the foolish traditions like denaial of lower people to temples,schools and publicplaces.It was necessary at that time to reform hindusim from caste and other bad things.No one hate Brahmins but their traditions and haterness towards lower cate(though i mentioned lower caste they are no lower but same as all)</p>
<p>I don't think its right to equate all rejections of Brahman culture and tradition as anti-Brahmanism. Of course anti-Brahamism does exist, but to suggest that separatist movements that simply want another system or culture are Anti-Brahman is unfairly categorizing it. If the article wants to link itself to anti-Semitism and such topics, it needs to focus more on hate that lacks justification. One way to find this distinction might be to create a section that outlines the possible causes.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think Anti-Hinduism is directly related to this topic.</p>

<p>Also, the links appear to be coming from the same group of thinkers. Are there any other perspectives on the term?</p>

<dd>The 'information' in this page is NONSENSE. Anti-brahmin movements and organisations oppose and challenge the domination and hegemony of the minority brahmin people over the rest of the people of India. These anti-brahmin organisations do not hate/vilify brahmins. They simply expose and challenge the existing injustices and cruelties perpetrated by the brahmins using their self-proclaimed'caste superiority' as an excuse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anti-Hindus are not Anti-brahmin and vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Khalistani seperatists belong to an entirely different religion- They are sikhs and they want a separate country for all sikhs. They may be 'generally' anti-brahmin, but they are also anti-hindu, anti-muslim, anti-christian and anti-India as a whole!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please read about Periyar EV Ramaswamy , who was one of South india's greatest anti-brahmin revolutionary and who fought for the freedom of the oppressed 'lower' castes.</dd>

There is also a significant amount of literature, generally anti-Hindu, which is anti-Brahmin. Anti-brahminism is often encountered in these regions.</p>

<p>The edit removes context (e.g. why anti-Brahminism exists), includes red herrings (e.g. the suggestion that Khalistani separatists are primarily anti-Brahmin, rather than more broadly anti-Hindu; or that the persecution of the largely Brahmin Kashmiri Hindu population is motivated by anti-Brahmin sentiments, rather than broader anti-Hindu sentiments), and adds spelling and grammatical mistakes (e.g. "or ethnic", "is is", lowercased "brahminism").</p>
<p>He also changed this:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The edit makes use of POV statements like "vilification of the Brahmins," removes context, deletes link descriptions, and adds a number of links of low relevance (e.g. Khalistan links, and a cached copy of an old message board posting).</p>
<p>Would it be ridiculous to undo these changes, and revert back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Brahmanism&amp;oldid=47474245" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Brahmanism&amp;oldid=47474245" rel="nofollow">the previous version</a>?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, <a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">User:ISKapoor</a> is attempting to drown out any rational explanations of why victims of historical or contemporary Hindu caste oppression might express sentiments against the high-caste Brahmin community. As a Brahmin, I obviously find knee-jerk anti-Brahminism offensive, but it's ridiculous to pretend that there aren't any reasons for it, or that all anti-Hindu sentiment is specifically anti-Brahmin. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 19:00, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you. When I first read this page, I was stunned at how it made no distinction between hatred and rejection, as well as Hindu and Brahman. The original article was much more NPOV and even informative, as it wasn't clouded with emotional language and opinion. 128.100.219.132 15:56, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is true that the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> are rich and influential. It is also true that the Jews have done what other wealthy people have done.</p>
<p>That does not justify promoting hate against them. There are reasons why a lot of people hate Jews. The success of the Jews is one of them.</p>
<p>I know about caste oppression. I have read numerous articles and books on them. I have to tell you this: Most, if not overwhelming majority, of caste oppression cases reported involve dalits and the members of land-owning castes. Not Brahmins.</p>
<p>Most of the Buddhist Acharyas were Brahmin. First anti-vedic religion (Lingayat) was founded by Basava, a Brahmin. Believe it or not, there would not have been any Sikhism without the active participation of many Brahmins, some of whom are among the Sikh shahids. Ambedkar's wife was a Brahmin. Many Dalit leaders have a Brahmin wife.</p>
<p>Why doesn't anyone hear about these facts? Why have these facts been suppressed?</p>
<p>There are groups and individuals opposed to Hinduism. Some of them need to identify specific people to hate - and the most visible of the Hindus - the Brahmins are there for them.</p>
<p>Hate is hate. Let it be acknowledged, let it be discussed fairly.</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a>. You don't address a single one of my concerns (removal of context explaining the roots of anti-Brahmin sentiment, the repeated conflation of anti-Hindu and anti-Brahmin sentiments, the deletion of link categories and descriptions, inclusion of low-relevance links, and grammar and spelling mistakes). You seem to suggest that it's OK to delete references to Brahmins' oppression of members of other castes because (1) Brahmins aren't the only ones who have been involved in oppressing Dalits, (2) Brahmins have been involved in the development of other religions, and (3) a few male Dalit leaders have Brahmin wives. The "suppression" of information about high-profile Dalit-Brahmin marriages is indeed tragic; perhaps it might make for an interesting sentence or two in an article about changing attitudes toward inter-caste marriage, but it's not immediately relevant to this article. You suggest that anti-Brahmin sentiment is just a kind of confused anti-Hindu sentiment, but that entirely fails to explain why members of other Hindu castes would bear anti-Brahmin sentiments; one can't talk about anti-Brahmanism without talking about the role of caste. Erasing historical context and conflating different types of prejudices is confusing and POV. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 00:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a>, this is in response to your latest revert, and subsequent edits. You still don't explain why anti-Brahmin sentiments exist, choosing to focus on what anti-Brahmanism <i>isn't</i>, instead of what is is, and why it exists, as if you can't believe that there can ever be home-grown anti-Brahmin sentiment. You also state four (!) times that anti-Brahmanism is supported by non-Indian organizations. You state that "Justification of anti-Brahmanism has now been incorporated in the curriculum of some states in India, and many intellectuals feel comfortable with anti-Brahmanism." What are those justifications that you allude to, but don't name? What is it that these intellectuals believe? You're too busy fighting a mute straw man to actual name and describe caste oppression. It's like trying to describe American black power or black supremacy movements, without ever referencing the history of racism that led to their development. I'm also puzzled by your attempt to compare the experience of Brahmins in India to that of Jews in Europe, as if members of the highest Hindu caste in a majority Hindu nation were in the same position as members of a persecuted minority religion.</dd>

<dd>I wanted to document that I deleted <a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a>'s new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Brahmanism&amp;oldid=48886806#History_of_attitudes_towards_Brahmins" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Brahmanism&amp;oldid=48886806#History_of_attitudes_towards_Brahmins" rel="nofollow">history of attitudes toward Brahmins</a> section of the article, an attempt to discuss the positive historical importance of Brahmins in various non-Hindu religions, and the growing role of non-Brahmins in contemporary Hindu religious life; both of these further obfuscate the obvious questions: what is anti-Brahminism, why it exists, what the various types of it are, and how it impacts the average Brahmin.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a> focuses solely on the positive, seeming to suggest (by omission) that Buddhists, Sikhs, Christians, and Jains in South Asia have uniformly positive views toward Brahmins or Brahminical Hinduism -- a very slanted and dubious assertion to make in light of South Asian religious history, given that he labels the section "History of attitudes towards Brahmins" (without qualifications), and that some of the anti-Brahmin links cited elsewhere in the article come from Christians and Sikhs. If some Sikhs and Christians are opposed to Brahmins or Brahminism, then why aren't the reasons they give cited or explored?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>He also focuses on the role of non-Brahmin Hindus in contemporary Hinduism, which would <i>definitely</i> make for an interesting section in an appropriate article, but seems to be intended here as a way of saying "non-Brahmins can indeed be part of Hindu religious life, so caste oppression doesn't exist" so as to undercut the reasons given by some non-Brahmin Hindus for their anti-Brahmin sentiments.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anti-Brahmin sentiment in South Asia is primarily a reaction to historical and contemporary caste-based oppression -- the cause of anti-Brahminism that ISKapoor persistently fails to mention, let alone discuss at any length. He's more focused on whitewashing history, showing anti-Brahmin sentiment as incredibly common ("Justification of anti-Brahmanism has now been incorporated in the curriculum of some states in India"), but actively resisting attempts to list or explain those "justifications." Creating a section that boils down to "everyone likes Brahmins, and caste oppression doesn't exist" fails to do justice to an article on anti-Brahmin sentiment. Some of ISKapoor's contributions might make for a series of interesting separate articles, but they're of low relevance in the context of an article on anti-Brahminism. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 17:37, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am thoroughly familiar with Buddhist, Jain and Sikh texts. There was no anti-Brahmanism in Sikh texts until the British-sponsored <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tat_Khalsa_8558.html" title="Tat Khalsa">Tat Khalsa</a> movement initiated a revision of Sikh tradition. An examination of history is needed to identfy the factors behind hate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Justifying and sugar-coating hate, (which is not spontaneous rather promoted by interested organizations) should not make hate acceptable. It should be represented factually, without bias, and without attempts to camouflage it.</dd>

<li>In my opinion*, both articles (by <a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a>) are lacking, but the one currently on display (<a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a>) definitely comes across as conspicuously biased and lacking in any real information. Many of the references (all?) point to the same website and therefore give little impression of any real anti-brahman `trend'. Surely, organisations such as the Dravida Kazhagam cannot be construed as completely `Anti-Brahman', if <a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a>'s definition of Anti-Brahmanism is taken into account. The main reason for the formation of the DK was social, religious, and political *equality*. If this has, indeed, degenerated into Anti-Brahmanism, then references must be provided to substantiate it. Moreover, as Anirvan said, it would be nice to have a section on the impact of this trend on the average brahmin. First and foremost, however, the existence of this trend must be established.--Srikanth srinivasan 19:35, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I did however make some recommendations for action by the editors.</p>
<p>In terms of the underlying issue on it comes down to this: there are two fundamental views of anti-Brahmanism:</p>
<ol>
<li>That it is a natural reaction to class issues inside of India</li>
<li>That is a form of racism promoted by people with anti India interests</li>
</ol>
<p>The article currently reads as bad propaganda for the second viewpoint. To correct this without starting a revert war I recommend that remaining editors do the following in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a section arguing clearly for the 2nd point of view. That is create a verifiable sub article on this theory quoting its major proponents</li>
<li>Pull from the main body of the article all the defenses of anti anti Brahmanism and simply relay facts about who, why, when, where, what....</li>
<li>Create a section arguing clearly for the 1st point of view. That is create a verifiable sub article on this theory quoting its major proponents.

<p>I recommend you read the article on nasranis or syrian christians of Kerala. They existed much before the arrival of the christian missionaries. The Syrian christians have some link with the Brahmin families such as a Kalli, Kalikaavu, Pakalomattom and Sankarapuri.

<p>Dear friends let us not put any comment in the article which amounts to hate perception among us and gives misleading picture of Hindu Society.The term anti - brahmin has many connotation one of which is being against Brahmin-- The people.But other side of it is being against Brahminism -- The Philosophy.People who were Anti--Brahmin need not be against Brahmin-- the people.<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior"><font style="background:red" color="white">Holy</font></a>|<a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHolywarrior_488c.html" title="User talk:Holywarrior"><font style="background:silver" color="white">Warrior</font></a> 11:21, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please provide non-partisan sources to prove this. By very definition anti-Brahminism means "those" who are opposed to Brahmins. There may be other interpretations of the word put there by missionaries etc. to try to lure other castes into christianity but they don;t apply to the main meaning, which is hatred for brahmins. By your logic, people could say that anti-muslim means being against Islamic fundamentalism, not just muslims. However, it is accepted that anti-muslims means hate for ALL muslims, not just against the unfortunate few who pervert the teachings of the Prophet (pbuh) and Holy Koran to justify terrorism etc. Thus, it follows that the logical meaning of anti-Brahminism means hatred for Brahmins and the Brahmin jaat.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 11:29, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>From reading this article, a person would have no idea that people of different castes might be using <i>resentment</i> as an excuse for harboring anti-brahmin feelings. Indeed, this article scarcely mentions how brahmins relate to other castes whatsoever. This article reads as if it were written by a Brahmin with wounded feelings. --Roger Williams 11:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Links and refrences: It is very stupid to link Dalitistan and other anonymous links. Dalitistan is registred in the US and the owners as well as the article writers are anonymous. From their language one can say, they are not even Indians. Why give link to them, therby giving them some credibility and publicity which they don't have by themselves. If you want to give reference , refer to real people, real organizations, real political/social organizations and web sites maintained by real people, however hostile they might be towards brahmins. - Vijayaraghavan</p>

<p>Then because all anti-Brahmin movements are also anti-Hindu, it is possible to analyze that to weaken Hinduism, one has to attack the Brahmin community, which has served as the clergy of Hinduism. All anti-Hindus portray Hinduism as "Brahminical" and while denying <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Hindus_bfaa.html" title="Persecution of Hindus">persecution of Hindus</a> by outsiders, blame almost all of India's problems on the Brahmin community (e.g. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Buddhism_60e9.html" title="Neo-Buddhism">Neo-Buddhists</a>.) Because the anti-Brahmin is an anti-Hindu, they see India as a union of Hindus and are antagonistic towards Indian unity as can be observed by all separatist groups, which are all non-Hindu (e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Liberation_Front_of_Tripura_094d.html" title="National Liberation Front of Tripura">NLFT</a>.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.211.233.78_ce46.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.211.233.78">66.211.233.78</a> (talk) 06:29, 27 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>This article is still in bad, bad shape and the deletion debate should be brought up again. It is still a bunch of POV and very poorly written.</p>
<p>I think the only way this article should stay as encyclopedic entry is if it reports the issue as an allegation and then delivers the evidence only by what is referencable. Remove all allegations and put them in quotes. Instead of "Tamil cinema is full of Anti-Bramin slander", say "Anti-braminism is alleged of the following Tamil films: [and list the titles of the films and the sources of the allegation (WP:NOR). I am going to add several templates to it. I think the Project Hinduism should take this to highest priority to dispose of this matter. The whole way in which this is presented and discussed unfortunately sheds a very bad light on Hinduism. Gschadow 20:41, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Anti-Brahmanism</b>, also known as <b>Anti-Brahminism</b>, refers to the hostility and prejudice towards members of the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">caste</a>. It ranges from individual hate-attacks to institutionalized attempts to vilify Brahmins. Anti-Brahmanism is allegedly carried out mainly in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> where some sections of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polity.html" title="Polity">polity</a> are alleged to engage in propagating a hostile view of Brahmins.

Thus, "anti-braminism" is alleged of the criticisms of Brahmins and the caste system as a whole, which had been raised out of mainstream Hinduism, such as <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramakrishna.html" title="Ramakrishna">Ramakrishna</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swami_Vivekananda_82f0.html" title="Swami Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a> (also associated with the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_Renaissance_70a3.html" title="Bengali Renaissance">Bengali Renaissance</a>). The label "anti-brahminism" is occasionally applied to such criticism against the caste system reflected in the laws and policies of India and its states, and against the presentation of the subject in the media and taught in the curriculum of schools. Also "anti-Brahminism" is alleged to receive support by organizations which are opposed to Hinduism or India. While doing away with Brahmins as a cornerstone of the Hindu religious is not anti-Brahminism, the expressed hatred for Brahmins individually or collectively is.</dd>

<dd>Regarding references, I did add references to other Wikipedia pages. I have also not taken any references out either. Instead, I have quoted factual statements which were POV by "it is alleged" etc. markings. I have even offered a mediating point referring to the strong propaganda of Dalit (e.g. the dalitistan page) to show how that might come accross as "anti-brahmin". In short, I am making a good faith attempt. I will likely decide very shortly that this is not worth my time though.

<dd>Secondly all I am attempting to remove unsupported claims on your part. You use non-neutral (inflammatory) language on tangential matters (Christian missionaries) and your recent references to newspaper articles do not support the claims you are making of specifically anti-brahmin communal violence. If you want you are welcome to delete this article. This is obviously your quest, so you are the one who needs to do the research and present the point in a manner worthy of Wikipedia. You need to support any and all claims you are making by reliable references. This is clearly not happening. I am now opening an RfC. Gschadow 06:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In contrast, you haven't sourced a single one of your edits at all, except use <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a> to whitewash the facts of this phenomenon. You have repeatedly assumed bad faith from everybody, have been intellectually dishonest in your edits and haven't contributed to this article at all. The references I cited clearly verify the text to which they refer, and I do not need to justify them to a <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">WP:TROLL</a> . By all means, post an RfC to this article and let some real wikipedians arrive. Maybe that will save me from the hassle to deal with editors with an agenda to abuse wikipedia for the spreading of hate propaganda.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 08:05, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am requesting an outside review on how to move forward with this article. I have been trying to address well-known POV issues on this article, and I am being worn out by <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> and another user who do nothing but reverting any edit without engaging in debate about detail. This article is basically in limbo as it seems everyone who has tried in the past to address the POV with any moderation has been consistently worn out. I am seeking advice on what to do next. Should it be deleted again? Earlier moderation attempts have failed, the deletion vote ended up keep with strong suggestions to clean up, but there is no progress to be made. I and others feel that the article contains inflammatory material and is not well supported. There are references which support some aspects of the phenomenon in question, but the points are overstated and also tangential parenthetical material seems to aquire more importance than the elucidation of the phenomenon. How can one possibly resolve this? Gschadow 06:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would really like to give a comment, but can you summarize the situation for me? Also, I'd like to remind editors to refrain from calling each other "POV-pushers", or any other names for that matter.

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for looking into it. The problem is, as you already noted, that one can't even give a summary of the problem which would remain undisputed. There is no consensus and no amicability here. You can see that both in the content and style of the article as well as in the very heated fire directed against you if you try to lay hands on it to bring in a more neutral perspective. That said, my main concerns are (1) mostly original research which presents a certain perspective on newspaper article and cursory (slanted) reading of history, just about none of this is supported by respectable literature, (2) extreme and confrontative language with unsupported emotive words such as "to villify", "angry", "their attempt to <i>eradicate</i> [us]", and (3) absence of anything to put what is said in context. <i>Some</i> description of the phenomenon may actually have merit, but the way this is done is, as I believe you can see, very bad style. The issue can be fought over by two extremes as has happened before, but even an attempt at presenting both points of view fails. Most importantly, attempts to edit out unsupported emotive words are being reverted almost instantaneously with untrue Edit Summaries (such as "added context" to a simple revert). I do not know what to do with that, the only hope is that readers will scrutinize for themselves before taking any of this seriously and in the worst case proceed to physical violence. I think the world should look and comment, and not leave it up to a few south-asian extremists. Gschadow 05:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. I've read the article in full, and I have to say, reading it makes me cringe. I rarely see original research like this. The first paragraph, for example, makes several accusations and cites no-one. The entire article is jam-packed with long stretches of unsourced claims. This is the first major issue with the article. When the OR is <i>this</i> bad, it has to be cleaned up first before anything else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are certainly neutrality issues with the wording, as you've stated. I'd recommend that the OR should be cleared up first. I personally think that anyone claiming this OR should be in better hustle to get some sources. The time spent arguing to keep OR in an article should rather be spent finding something to support the claims made here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't get me started on the sources that already exist. "Brahmanization Proved False" is an inaccurate title; I see nothing of proof here. I'm not familiar with the subject, as I probably already stated, and I can't see how this news article proves it false. If that's the case, I don't see how the description of the link could possibly be neutral. I'd also like to see more sources than just newspaper articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the most disturbing thing is the "Section of Unsourced and damaging Allegations", known in this article as "In The Media." There's a list of newspapers which are alleged to support this phenomenon, some of which have names tagged to it. I hope that the person who created that knows that unsourced libel can be deleted at any time -- and I think that calling someone and their publication essentially "racist" counts as that. By all rights, that unsourced material could be removed. So whoever wants to keep that better get in gear and find some backup for the claims. Wikipedia doesn't exist to smear people or their publications. As it stands, those are baseless accusations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So yes, I agree that there are serious issues with this thing. OR needs to be fixed badly, and in my opinion, should be the first thing to be corrected. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V.">.V.</a> 05:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your comments and agree completely. Should one just start over? Delete the whole thing and replace it with something else, more concise and shorter? Given the past experience, the moment I lay hands on this, it will be reverted right back. Gschadow 23:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: another user has once tried to rewrite this, and his attempt is here: <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_Anti-Brahmanism_ac66.html" title="User:Anirvan/Anti-Brahmanism">User:Anirvan/Anti-Brahmanism</a>.

<dd>That user's rewrite is actually very good. While reading the article in its current form, I found it very confusing, as I am not thoroughly versed in this issue. But that revised article you linked to is so clear that someone completely unfamiliar with the topic can understand it. Finishing what <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">User:Anirvan</a> started would be a good ideas. As for the reverts... more people will probably show up to this RfC, and I believe that many will agree to this.

Then I went in and marked all those many places where those who care for the subject need to do something to support their claims or else remove them. This time I knew better than to edit any text, because I have no POV to push. If people want to claim something, they must support it, and that is with reliable sources (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>).

<p>This article is in need of revision. As it stands, it appears like propoganda and not an objective article. My suggestions are the following: 1. Please read articles by David Frawley, Fancsoi Gautier and others on Anti-Brahminism before constructing this article 2. Re-start this article from scratch 3. Give source for every example of Anti-Brahminism to establish credibility for article. 4. Show by solid examples as to why Anti-Brahminism is a legitimate claim and how Brahmins are being oppressed today and how they were hstorically an oppressed group throughout Indian history (siteing sources such as Parashu Rama legend and Puranic stories as well as records from historians from ancient, classical, and medieval ages) - this may require more detailed research that only an academic would perhaps have the resources for. 5. Instead of including arguments against or justifiable reasons for Anti-Brahminism, creat a separate article on Brahmin Oppression and link to that article (and vice versa). Both sides have legitimate claims and both sides should back them up with proper source material. I believe with two separate articles, the rw wars will cease. Terr E.
