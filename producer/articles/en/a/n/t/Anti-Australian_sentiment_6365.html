	    <p><b>Anti-Australian sentiment</b>, or <b>Anti-Australianism</b>, is a hostility towards or disapproval of the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Australia_1eca.html" title="Culture of Australia">culture</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="History of Australia">history</a>, and/or people of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The term indicates a broad-ranging animosity, rather than hostility confined to specific issues (such as opposition to recent <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Australia_74b0.html" title="Government of Australia">Australian government</a> policies); however, specific issues may eventually give rise to broader hostility.</p>
<p>While Australia enjoys friendly, often sports-based, rivalries with other nations — such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> — some differences are more bitter.</p>
<p>In terms of the country's image overseas, modern Australia's origins as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_colony.html" title="Penal colony">penal colony</a> have proved particularly difficult to shake off. However, the most significant wave of immigration — in relative or proportional terms — was that of free, non-convict immigrants who arrived during the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_gold_rushes.html" title="Australian gold rushes">Australian gold rushes</a> of the <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850s.html" title="1850s">1850s</a>. Between 1850 and 1861, the European population increased from 400,000 to 1.2 million. Moreover, the largest wave of immigration, in terms of absolute numbers, occurred after 1947.</p>

<p>Geography and history play an important part in anti-Australianism. In spite of its location near <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Asia_e921.html" title="South East Asia">South East Asia</a>, Australia is predominantly populated by people of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic.html" title="Ethnic">ethnic</a> origins, who are decidedly members of a <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_culture.html" title="Western culture">western culture</a>.</p>
<p>By comparison, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, separated from Australia by about 200 kilometres of sea at the closest point, is the most populous <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> nation in the world. Proximity, combined with great cultural differences, is a major cause of friction. Modern Australia's origins and culture evoke unpleasant echoes of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> in neighbouring countries, where the populations were dominated by Europeans, for centuries in some cases.</p>
<p>There is also a perception that Australia does not respect its neighbours' <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a>. For example, criticism in the Australian <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_media.html" title="News media">media</a> of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> abuses in neighbouring countries is often interpreted by them as attempts to meddle in their internal affairs. This perception was heightened by a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> incident in which Prime Minister <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> stated his willingness to embark on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preemptive_war.html" title="Preemptive war">preemptive strikes</a> against terrorists in neighbouring countries, after the Australian embassy in Bali was attacked by a truck-bomb by an Islamic terrorist organisation.</p>

<p>Australia has long been a military ally of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, with close military ties dating back to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_War_bded.html" title="Pacific War">Pacific War</a> of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">WWII</a>. Since then, Australia has fought alongside the US in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korea</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a>, the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_%28disambiguation%29_10fa.html" title="Gulf War (disambiguation)">Iraq invasions</a>, and the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Afghanistan_%282001%E2%80%93present%29_53f3.html" title="War in Afghanistan (2001–present)">invasion of Afghanistan</a>. Although Australian contingents have been much smaller than their US counterparts, they have included a high proportion of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_forces.html" title="Special forces">special forces</a> troops, making them more significant than their size would otherwise suggest.</p>
<p>While the reliability of Australia's support has improved its standing with the US, it has caused hostility elsewhere: critics of the association have portrayed it as an extension of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>; Australia is viewed by some as a US <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet_state.html" title="Puppet state">puppet</a> in the predominantly Asian region. Thus, Australia has attracted hostility not only for its own actions in such wars, but also for its closeness to the US, with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-American_sentiment_f3d8.html" title="Anti-American sentiment">anti-American sentiment</a> feeding anti-Australian sentiment by association.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is strong among <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> groups in South-East Asia. Because of Australia's proximity to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and Indonesia, it makes a convenient surrogate for anti-American hostility, although there are several other causes for friction between Australia and these countries.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bulletin_f57c.html" title="The Bulletin">Bulletin</a></i> article described <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> as the US's "deputy <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff.html" title="Sheriff">sheriff</a>" in the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia-Pacific_5369.html" title="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> region.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Australian_sentiment_6365.html" title="Edit section: East Timor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">East Timor</span></h2>
<p>A particular point of contention was Indonesia's occupation of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timor_c0fb.html" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, and the subsequent independence process. While the Australian government long avoided commenting on the Indonesian occupation, some pro-independence East Timorese used Australia as a base, and drew a great deal of sympathy from the Australian public. Following the demise of the <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a> regime in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> moved to supporting self-determination for the territory, which prompted the new President, <a href="../../../j/u/s/Jusuf_Habibie_922d.html" title="Jusuf Habibie">Jusuf Habibie</a>, to raise the possibility of independence for East Timor in early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>.</p>
<p>Many Indonesians saw this move as hypocritical, as the <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Whitlam</a> government knew in advance about Indonesian plans to invade and annex East Timor in November <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>; it may even have actively encouraged these plans <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Subsequent to the invasion, Australia was the only country in the world to acknowledge Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor.</p>
<p>In fact, Prime Minister <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> had always supported Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, even when in opposition, criticising <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> governments for not being close enough to Indonesia and placing too much importance on human rights and East Timor. In a letter to President Habibie in December 1998, he wrote, "I want to emphasise that Australia's support for Indonesia's sovereignty is unchanged. It has been a longstanding Australian position that the interests of Australia, Indonesia and East Timor are best served by East Timor remaining part of Indonesia." He added that, "The successful implementation of an autonomy package with a built-in review mechanism would allow time to convince the East Timorese of the benefits of autonomy within the Indonesian republic."</p>
<p>Many Indonesian nationalists also believed that Australia was attempting to weaken its neighbour by supporting independence movements in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Papua_f9e9.html" title="West Papua">West Papua</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aceh.html" title="Aceh">Aceh</a>, although Australia has moved to reinforce its support for Indonesia's integrity since East Timor's independence.</p>
<p>During the referendum process, and especially after the East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence, the region was plunged into violence as anti-independence militia embarked on a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timor-Leste_Scorched_Earth_c90f.html" title="Timor-Leste Scorched Earth">scorched earth campaign</a>; at least some of the anti-independence groups were armed, trained, and funded by elements of the Indonesian military. Australia led a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> peacekeeping force to quell this violence; some took the arrival of Australian troops in what they thought of as Indonesian territory as a further insult to Indonesia.</p>
<p>In one incident during the peacekeeping mission, Australian and Indonesian patrols came into conflict near the East Timorese border, with a small number of Indonesian soldiers killed; it appears confusion caused by differing maps led both groups to believe they were on their own side of the border, and the other was intruding. Australian troops within East Timor also reported seeing <a href="../../../k/o/p/Kopassus.html" title="Kopassus">Kopassus</a> (Indonesian special forces) troops attempting to scout their positions. Such incidents further fuelled tensions between Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Ironically anti-Australian feelings in East Timor also run high. Australia's motives for involvement in East Timor have also been questioned by the East Timorese themselves, especially in connection to the division of revenue from the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timor_Gap_8997.html" title="Timor Gap">Timor Gap</a> oil reserves&#160;— an arrangement that is currently highly favourable to Australia. Many East Timorese, including the political leaders; and indeed some Australians&#160;— see this state of affairs as exploitative and unfair, especially since East Timor desperately needs money to further its development and has few other valuable resources.</p>

<p>While it is now believed that the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Bali_terrorist_bombing_d41c.html" title="2002 Bali terrorist bombing">2002 Bali terrorist bombing</a> targeted westerners in general, the fact that many of the victims were Australian, and the subsequent heavy involvement of Australian police and intelligence authorities in the investigation, added to perceptions of an anti-Australian motive. By comparison, the much less deadly <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Jakarta_embassy_bombing_6faf.html" title="2004 Jakarta embassy bombing">bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta</a>, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, appears to have been targeted specifically at Australians, although the victims were chiefly Indonesian.</p>

<p>Australia has at times faced hostility for being deemed unusually racist. The <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australia_Policy_da7a.html" title="White Australia Policy">White Australia Policy</a> played a large role in this. Also, the fate of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> has been a source of harsh criticism abroad and often domestically as well - specifically the accounts of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Generation_03cd.html" title="Stolen Generation">Stolen Generation</a> and the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Aborigines_ca8c.html" title="Tasmanian Aborigines">Tasmanian Aborigines</a>.</p>
<p>In more recent times the <a href="../../../m/s/_/MS_Tampa_2a72.html" title="MS Tampa">Tampa Boat Crisis</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_Overboard_fc96.html" title="Children Overboard">Children Overboard</a> affairs are seen as evidence of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> continuing in their immigration policy. The incidents were shown as indicating Australians may have <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacist.html" title="White supremacist">white supremacist</a> views, even though Australia has a relatively large number of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asian</a> immigrants. Some people in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> see the intrusion of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Special_Air_Service_Regiment_a23b.html" title="Australian Special Air Service Regiment">SASR</a> on-board the freighter <a href="../../../m/s/_/MS_Tampa_2a72.html" title="MS Tampa"><i>Tampa</i></a> as an act of war.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The mandatory detention in Australia of <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asylum_seeker.html" title="Asylum seeker">asylum seekers</a> who arrive in Australia by illegal means (that is, without visas) is widely criticized by other nations and by many Australians themselves. Institutions such as <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woomera_Detention_Centre_d87c.html" title="Woomera Detention Centre">Woomera Detention Centre</a> are often compared to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prisons</a> or even <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a>. The Australian government has received much criticism regarding this policy. Australians seeing the detention policy as unnecessary are divided into two camps: one group believes the detainees should be included in the Australian community, while the other group believes that the detainees should be promptly sent back to their point of origin.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Australian_sentiment_6365.html" title="Edit section: Stereotypes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stereotypes</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes, global <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a> stereotypically portray <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_Australian_7232.html" title="Anglo-Celtic Australian">Anglo-Celtic Australians</a> as wild, uncouth, boorish, uncultured, agrestic, sport-obsessed, alcoholic layabouts obsessed with consuming <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a> — especially successful export products such as <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fosters.html" title="Fosters">Fosters</a> and <a href="../../../x/x/x/XXXX_ad34.html" title="XXXX">XXXX</a> (which are often, incorrectly, assumed to be the most popular beers on the Australian market). While some Australians (deliberately or otherwise) conform to such stereotypes, both at home and abroad, many Australians are deeply offended by such perceptions. They point to statistics showing that Australia has lower rates of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> consumption than many countries, higher <a href="../../../p/r/o/Productivity.html" title="Productivity">productivity</a>, high rates of attendance at cultural and arts events/facilities, and a very high degree of <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urbanisation.html" title="Urbanisation">urbanisation</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of — or some might say because of — the many ties between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and Australia (including a large number of Australian <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expatriate.html" title="Expatriate">expatriates</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and vice versa) some British <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_conservatism.html" title="Cultural conservatism">cultural conservatives</a> dislike the supposed vulgarity and/or bad examples for young British people, demonstrated by Australian <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>. The most common targets of such discontent are Australian <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap operas</a> shown on British <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>, such as <i><a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_and_Away_4142.html" title="Home and Away">Home and Away</a></i>. Ironically, such programs are often far more popular in the UK, where they sometimes attract many millions of viewers, than in Australia. The <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship_between_New_Zealand_and_Australia_ad25.html" title="Relationship between New Zealand and Australia">relationship between New Zealand and Australia</a> is also an example of a love-hate relationship.</p>
