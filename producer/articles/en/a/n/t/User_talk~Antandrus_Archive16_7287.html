<p>So, I'm working on <a href="../../../r/u/g/Ruggiero.html" title="Ruggiero">Ruggiero</a> (as in the melodic/harmonic formula), and I noticed we don't have an article for Reciting formula, so I went to see if Grove did, which they don't. Is there another word for it that I'm not thinking of? It seems like a fairly important cross-cultural musical/poetic/oral tradition-y concept. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 13:59, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hm, yes, I've noticed that Grove often does not have articles on narrowly named or defined topics. Usually they are covered under something larger. I'd look it up in my Harvard Dictionary of Music to see if has other names (but I'm at work right now) ... try googling. I can't think of another immediately obvious name. Does that phrase occur in Grove at all? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems that "recitation formula" is a little more common, but seems to refer only to Western chant tradition things. I'm thinking of a larger class of musical formulas, all of which are basically to assist in memorizing and chanting/reciting back stories/poems/epics in a variety of oral traditions. Is there a more global word for that sort of thing? <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:32, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see. In that case, that would be worthy of mention in maybe a sentence or two in the article, but it does not justify transforming the entire first paragraph. Basically, until recently, most classes I had taken had taught that fire is not a plasma or a state of matter, but is simply heat and light energy produced by a combustion reaction. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">at</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk!</a></small> 17:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"are you really arguing at this length, and spending this much time on this talk page, out of the best interests in improving our encyclopedia? ". &#160;:Yes, I am . This issue is being discussed by the International Alliance of women in Music. The Vice-President of the International Music council (UNESCO) has been informed. This is being followed closely by any number of scholars and is going to be discussed at any number of Universities this Fall. Gender bias is only one aspect of exclusionist thinking in the Academic establishment which supports the so-called "Standard Repertoire" canon. Gender bias is the easiest to spot and to confront, as it is objective. So, this is the most effective way to discuss what is really a much more complex issue.</p>
<p>I am not saying that Mak is consciously expressing his/her gender bias, but scholars discussing this have pointed out that his/her reactions (especially the reference to the "Don't be a dick" article) would probably indicate that the person making these statements was most likely a woman interacting with a male-dominated hierarchy and trying to become "one of the guys" as means consolidating this power. This is often refered to as "Venus de Milo" syndrome because although the woman becomes a valued part of the male hierarchy, she is "cutting off her arms" in the longterm by supporting the gender bias of status quo. If you've seen the demographics of Wikipedia, there's no arguing about the male domination part. The point is, the resistent to change and the acceptance of suppressing this type of material would almost certainly by a symtome of deep-seated gender bias by a woman. But, I do not expect or want confirmation of the validity of this theory.</p>
<p>Thank you for worrying about spending so much time doing this, but since we have so much help from experts in this field, this isn't really that much trouble. Somehow, I've managed to write three hundred measures of music in the past week, in addition to processing our Fall stock orders, sending out catalogues, working on new concerts/recordings etc. None of us sleeps very much around here...Jean-Thierry Boisseau 10:02, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gender bias is "objective"? What exactly do you mean? Because there aren't any women on the lists of composers of opera, that this is proof of bias?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't you see the logical fallacies here? You are presupposing that something <i>must</i> be, and then going back and <i>proving</i> bias because you aren't finding what you suppose must be there. People are on those lists because their operas have been performed repeatedly in a wide geographic distribution, not because there is a cabal of evil Male Establishment Dominators saying their names belong there. Consider the possibility that the lists themselves reflect <i>reality</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want more operas to be written by women and widely performed, then by all means work towards that goal. I'd like to see that too. When the number and distribution of performances equals that of men on the lists, then they will be listed. And for heaven's sake try to assume some good faith of your fellow editors rather than ceaselessly attacking them as part of some vast male-domination conspiracy. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You ask why "Gender bias is "objective"?". Excuse me, but I didn't think that I had to explain the difference between girls and boys. I think that is a pretty objectively defined difference, unless you factor in "transgendered" people.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not what "I" expected to see or who should be on this list; Quite frankly, I really don't care. However, there are enough women who have written opera (especially in the past thirty years) that SOME should be on this list. The sources which could have proved that have been suppressed or dismissed. If they were examined, or if lists that include only men were discarded (aha, I'll bet that you didn't think of that...why are lists of only men neutral and lists of only women POV?), then at least one woman (in the case of these lists, that would be Judith Weir, but it doesn't necessarily HAVE to be her). The point is that the selection process of the lists had the POV agenda of confirming the standard repertoire, and that's basically what it did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before you ask "why didn't you express this in the discussion?". The answer is that since I was defined as having a POV bias to living composers and women, I was asked not to participate. I have counted less then ten people who made this list, two of whom were possibly women, the others who were almost certainly men. Regardless of what happens here, my contributions are neither wanted nor will they be accepted, given the "Great Purge" currently underway. So, there you have it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "Venus de Milo" syndrome came from a discussion with someone completely unrelated here, who teaches women's studies at an American University and who saw this as a textbook example. I'm not an expert at this, she is. I don't know anyone's gender in this discussion with certainty, so whatever it means to anyone personally becomes a question of their own self-exploration. If this is making people uncomfortable, then perhaps they need to think about this.</dd>

<dd>In any case, it looks as if Judith Weir is going to be added, as the criteria for the article is being changed.

That will be a minimum, but it's better than nothing. And perhaps it will allow other feministed-oriented scholars to correct this when research has been completed.

<p>I don't have much time to go into detail here as I have much too much work, but I will say that</p>
<ul>
<li>There is definitely a language and cultural problem here. I am struck by the especially violent reactions of the people from the United Kingdom, which is almost always the case. The "Objectivity/gender bias" example is a case in point. I understood what you meant, and was reacting in surprize to your reaction. The way I expressed this surprize was to point out the obvious, which should have lead to an discussion of the fundemental aspects of what gender bias is. Instead of seeing the implied subtext and the invitation to explore this fundemental question, you only saw what you perceived as arrogence and insult. This happens all of the time with anglophones and I really do not know what to do about it. I am aware that this problem exists. I cannot completely change the way I think and express myself, which is noticably more formal than the rest of you. I do try not to make things worse, however. You will notice that in the RfA discussion, when the list of Articles for deletion went up with commentary which was not exactly polite, I did not react. I think that I have shown a great deal of reserve in dealing with some aspects of this situation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Would you also mind having a look at Carson Cooman and <a href="../../../g/i/a/Gian_Paolo_Chiti_d4da.html" title="Gian Paolo Chiti">Gian Paolo Chiti</a>? Both people should have sufficient notority to be included in the site and Maestro Chiti (head of the comp. dept at the Academia Santa Cecilia in Rome for 30 years) was very happy to have a complete works list up. Both of these people have a percentage of their catalgoue which is published by us, but that is not their only claim to notority and should not be judged just because of whatever alleged "misconduct" that we've done here. I must also say that I find the commentary on the Cooman AfD to be getting quite catty...Luckily they haven't figured out yet that his principal teacher is Judith Weir..."Le boucle est bouclÃ©" and all of that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I appreciate your standing up for Dennis and I will ask Mary Jane Leach to tell him about it, although I think that he's really convinced that this project is a lost cause, given what he's said in that article. The way living composers are treated should be addressed simply because notority policy does not work with the reality of what they do. I could write pages about this, but you probably already know what I'm talking about.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now I really do have to get to work. I really wish that people would call us first....and it's certainly very annoying when you're working for hard for something that is going to be signed by somebody else...But that's the way the World works sometimes. Thank you for considering all of this. Jean-Thierry Boisseau 11:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

(this was in response to the note on the talk page of the article about the massive "GA review"). If you see anything in that article which is actually controversial, feel free to point it out to me. I don't think there is, which is part of why I didn't originally give it inline citations. Bah. My worry is that the inline citation fetish is not leading to better-referenced/verified articles, but rather messier wikitext, with completely redundant inline citations. There's also a discussion going on on the mailing list, which I've shoved my oar into (I almost never do). <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 18:44, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One problem which I have with inline citations is that I feel like it misrepresents the information cited. When I see an inline citation in RL(tm) I assume that the person cited is the main/only proponent of that point of view. When you add inline citations to generally accepted facts, unless you dig up half a dozen books and find the right pages in each of them, I think you do the accepted scholarship a disservice, and are misrepresenting the fact. I seem not to be able to articulate this very well, though. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 20:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am averaging about 300 measures a day....and luckily Paul Wehage is doing the orchestration as I go along, so this will get done ahead of schedule. However, discussion of gender bias issues continue on the IAWM list and I just wanted to add this information to let all know that, regardless of what the RfA decision is and regardless of whose articles are deleted, this is not just going to be "over soon", as I've seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is from William Osborn, the husband of Abbie Conant (the trombonist ho got fired from the Munich Symphony orchestra because "we can't have women in the trombone section".). He's done this before...and when he does it, the Wall Street Journal talks about it. This is an email sent to Paul Wehage off of the IAWM List (if you want confirmation, email me at oscarlechien AT gmail DOT com and I'll get you his email...)</p>
<p>Quote</p>
<p>I have been in the same position as you are several times -- trying to persuade a group of men that something is wrong with the way women are treated. The men can be much more open and aggressive with a man presenting these ideas. The man standing for the rights of women is generally mobbed. As the men get more into the discussion, the psychological problems that create their sexism often become very apparent. In fact, these psychological impulses help explain why they become so talkative. They have issues to work out. It becomes more and more apparent as they become increasingly insistent in defending the exclusion of women.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for your work.</p>

<p>Is this an accurate picture of what's happening? I don't presume to know, but Mr. Osborn does know about this sort of thing, as a bit of research will prove...In any case, I cannot say that Mr. Osborn's opinion is entirely false...</p>
<p>From another email off of the IAWM list from William - For clarification, he refers to Paul Wehage because Paul is the one here who partipates on this list. He's been a member for more than a decade, on invitation of Sally Reid, a former IAWM president.</p>

<p>The problems with opera are too numerous to count. It is, of course, a good idea to try to find lost works of opera by women composers. At the same time, it is impossible to overlook that oppression kept the vast majority of interested women from writing opera in the first place. It's is a little like looking for great novels written by African-American slaves. It would be an extreme understatement to say that there are conditions of life not conducive to the creation of art. The evil of human brutality knows almost no end.</p>
<p><br />
The portrayal of women in opera is thus created from an almost exclusively masculinist perspective. And it is unquestionably a demeaning portrayal. Women characters in opera tend to be abused and fallen, or simpletons who make their living by embroidering, or heroines sacrificing themselves for the well being of a heroic man. Their identity is often determined by a degrading relationship to men who are portrayed as superior and in command.</p>
<p><br />
How can we be surprised that a list of the top 100 opera composers might be all male, in a genre so misogynistic that men chopped their nuts off so they could sing the soprano parts? And as Paul Wehage's noble efforts on Wiki illustrate, the psychological illnesses that shape hatred for women are alive and well. The discussion the men are having over there about the list is far more valuable and interesting than the list itself.</p>
<p><br />
It would seem that from any self-respecting woman's perspective, an entirely new kind of music theater needs to be created. (For the very few who might be interested, I have written more about this in the program notes for my music theater work "Street Scene for the Last Mad Soprano" at:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.osborne-conant.org/Street.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.osborne-conant.org/Street.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.osborne-conant.org/Street.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
The examples of misogyny in opera are so extensive it is impossible to detail all of them, but this summer I saw "Salome" in Santa Fe. The work is strange, not because of the supposed perversion, which is actually rather staid and Victorian, but because it has so many odd idiosyncrasies. There is almost no character portrayal at all. Even by the standards of opera, there are no real humans, just one-dimensional quasi-Biblical figures. Theatrically speaking, we don't see too much more than caricatures in Roman costumes chromatically bellowing over the Alpine Symphony.</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps the lack of theatrical depth evolved because Strauss focused too strongly on a calculated, psuedo-scandalous effect. Oscar Wilde, whose play forms the basis of the libretto, had very good reasons for studying what he referred to as "poison," his term for unaccepted forms of erotic temptation in Victorian England. He even went to prison for it. Strauss simply did not have such sincere motivations. The Germans, to their credit, have never been particularly puritanical, and even during Strauss's life, most didn't really give a damn about what consenting adults did in their own privacy. Without Wilde's "poison," Salome is empty, an operatic gesture in the worst sense of the word. There is indeed a kind of sado-anal necrophilia in the darker regions of German culture, and it was very much alive in Strauss's time, but Salome doesn't capture it. The work was, and is, a superficially calculated gesture that could only exist in the utterly stodgy world of opera.</p>
<p><br />
I also wonder if it isn't time we begin to think of at least some classical music as actually a form of ethnic music. Why do we think of the Germanic character of classical music as some sort of neutral norm? The score for Salome is so utterly Austro-Bavarian that the piece could only be plausible if she were wearing a Dirndl, though I suspect a clever director like Sellers could figure out some nifty way of not having Herod in Lederhosen. Especially in the climatic (sic) sections, I had no sense of sexuality, but rather programmatic Alpine tableaus: glaciers, raging streams, a stag in a meadow, timber houses with geranium flower boxes, et al. At one point, even an embarrassed Till seems to stumble onto the wrong set. Even allowing for theatrical conventions, Strauss's Salome is far, far too beery for either ancient Israel or conflicts with British Puritanism.</p>
<p><br />
The poor direction in Santa Fe only served to stress the ridiculousness of Salome and opera in general. In his review in the San Francisco Chronicle ["Santa Fe Opera loyal to vision that's lasted 5 decades" (Aug. 7, 2006)], Joshua Kosman described Santa Fe's "Dance of the Seven Veils" as the "dreariest in recent memory."</p>
<p><br />
I couldn't agree more. Forms of transgressive sexuality can be very interesting, and authors such as Artaud gave them a valuable tradition in theater. But how could Strauss's ridiculously calculated spectacle be anything but dreary? And why would any self-respecting woman want to portray such a silly, one-dimensional role? Opera being opera, Salome is almost bound to sound and look like she is 16 going on 38. In many productions of Salome, it is difficult to determine which is more matronly, the singer's voice or her solidly endowed middle-aged body. And this is by no means a one-sided standard exacted only upon women. The pudgy, pasty-white Roman soldiers -- who looked like they had seen neither exercise nor sunshine for at least fifteen years -- seemed like something out of a small church's Easter Pageant in Amarillo, Texas.</p>
<p><br />
The saving grace was that the velcro problems in the veils scene were hilarious. Things just didn't want to come off. Herod literally had a small tug-of-war to get one veil off. When it suddenly popped loose, Salome almost fell over backwards.</p>
<p><br />
After the last veil we saw a brief flash of a rather broad behind in a body sock. Poor thing. I don't mean to be mean-spirited. It's just that sooner or later we might consider music theater that works theatrically. To belt something out over a hundred piece orchestra you generally need some meat on your bones. So why don't we create opera for the beauty, strength, and dignity of those kind of women (and men.) At least to my eyes, the singer who performed Salome in Santa Fe could be very alluring if she had the right role and direction. Enough with psuedo-skinny bimbos and seamstresses with tuberculosis.</p>
<p><br />
Anyway, I know these words will infuriate some, but if we are going to create a new kind of music theater that truly portrays the dignity of women, we are going to have to start almost from scratch.</p>

<p>So, what has this accomplished? Has this been a good action for the wikimedia foundation? Do you actualy think that this has done good for what you're trying to do?</p>
<p>In terms of the project, you're going to be able to do exactly what the "majority" (ie about ten people who care) want because most people can't be bothered. If I may use a metaphor, this is like using a suitcase nuke to take care of the neighbors who you think are making too much noise. Sure, it's effective...but you might end up being with some rather surprising consequences outside of the very small subset of people that are the principles here.</p>
<p>I cannot say what this will mean in the long term (although I could make a few educated guesses), but was it really this important to exclude sources which could have included a representative sample of women in order that the "status quo" be confirmed? What is the problem with including the names of two or three women on this list? Why is this such an issue?</p>
<p>I am extremely sorry that this has worked out as it has. I am especially sorry that certain people who self-identify as "feminists" are going to be seen as being enablers of an anti-feminist agenda (and perhaps in surprising places). A feminist stance is something which needs to be taken automatically, and not as the result of some sort of "nice" agenda, since the issue of gender bias is quite real.</p>
<p>I do not regret bringing this issue to the fore and, indeed, making it an issue. I believe that someone (a woman) is going to come forward to try to resolve some of these issues. I would like to state that this woman, who is a teacher at a major university and a former assistant of a major opera conductor, has no connections to us and should not be treated as being a "Musik Fabrik" agent. If she does choose to enter into this discussion, I would hope that she be treated with respect and with objectivity.</p>
<p>Right now, besides this film score, we're also working on the Marguerite Duras hommage in Trouville next week, so this is not a good time to deal with this and quite frankly, we really have better things to do. I would however like to suggest that this be a matter of reflection and discussion among the "powers that be", as this is not just another spat and will not just "go away. I do not think that you have begun to imagine what has happened here and how far the implications might go... Cordially Jean-Thierry Boisseau 21:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is getting mildly ridiculous. We are not elevating the level of dispute. You are. As far as I am concerned, that list is finished. It has been thoroughly referenced and made NPOV by accepted Wikipedia standards. Of course it will change, as opera changes - in 10 years there will probably be 5 women on the list - in 20, another 5, or 10, or even 15. And doubtless Folantin and myself will still be writing <i>all</i> the annotations and providing <i>all</i> the references, just as we have done here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to take a quote from the e-mails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The problems with opera are too numerous to count. It is, of course, a good idea to try to find lost works of opera by women composers. At the same time, it is impossible to overlook that oppression kept the vast majority of interested women from writing opera in the first place.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This may, in fact, surprise you, but I totally agree. But surely the logical implication of the statement that "At the same time, it is impossible to overlook that oppression kept the vast majority of interested women from writing opera in the first place" is that we cannot change the past. We must promote women opera composers now, and in the future, to make up for the disparity, but the past (regrettably) cannot be changed. And the plain truth is that we just haven't had enough time to see whether operas by contemporary female composers have had sufficient impact for their composers to count as "major".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re the castrati: I know quite a lot about them and Handel <i>et al</i>, and although a young castrato would, as part of his training, play a female role, this was generally not the case as the singer matured. The women were not exactly starved of roles. Please get your facts right.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When this don turns up, I for one will treat her with absolute respect - provided she does not resort to bullying, intimidation, incivility, edit warring, and POV pushing in interacting with other editors, as you have done. If she does, I will have no hesitation in putting her in front of ArbCom as well. Wikipedia does have rules governing editor-to-editor behaviour. Please respect them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And lastly, I would, once again, like to say that I am most definitely not sexist, or misogynist, or even misanthropist. To imply such things is a violation of just about every single rule in the book. ArbCom will be most interested. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 22:20, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Moreschi for the post, and the comment on the quote: it's right to the point. I agree with that as well. The only thing I'd add to "we must promote women opera composers now" is a couple words: "...but not on Wikipedia." But <i>you</i> know that ... it's only some newcomers we need to get this point across to. Mr. Boisseau, in case I haven't mentioned it yet, another page that might clarify what is going on here, is this: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not.</a>.

<dd>Thank you for those marvelous quotations from your mailing list. Exactly how <i>are</i> you representing us there? From the vituperative intensity of the comments you supply, I have to presume you are doing a rotten job of explaining who we are, and what we do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do the people on the mailing list know that you've copied portions of their letters here?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Boisseau, do you really understand the purpose of Wikipedia? Do you understand the point of the project, and the rules that guide it? We are not in the business of canon-formation, or canon-deconstruction, or canon-anything at all, other than canon-explanation, and we explain by repeating information gleaned from reliable sources. That's <i>all we do</i>. Moving beyond this into what "should" be or what we "wish" would be violates Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> prohibition. We are <i>not</i> a front for a crusade for what is right and just and good. Yes, most of us would love it if we lived in a world where operas by women were as often produced as those by men, but we do not. We report the world that exists, using secondary sources, by others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your continued insistence that your conflict here stems from our misogyny and sexism is a complete <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> and I reject it. We are attempting to compile a list of major opera composers. None are women, using the agreed-upon methodology. That's the way it <i>is</i>. It's bad that this is so. It may be so because of widespread misogyny and sexism in the opera world. It may be so because of widespread misogyny and sexism in the culture as a whole. But we still need to report the <i>reality</i> of the situation, not what we <i>want</i> it to be. And if you can think of a methodology for creating the list that allows inclusion of women, and does not violate our core policies, and does not itself introduce "gender bias", then for heaven's sake get over to that article talk page and <i>propose</i> it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Have you <i>read</i> our core policies? Every time you post, it seems you have again dodged the specific issues, and instead flung invective against our supposed motives. <i>Have</i> you read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>?

<dd>Excuse me if this seems sarcastic, but it's a bit much explaining what an encyclopedia is to a French person...I mean, we did invent the idea and I have a very good idea about what writing an encyclopedia is about, at least historically, one of which is the idea of breaking down the secular and sacred hierarchies by neutraling explaining "what is". This list, which creates a hierarchy (what is the word "important"?) and this insistence on "notability" used here is clearly unencyclopedic, at least according to the historical definition. Perhaps this understanding of what the idea of "encyclopedia" means is perhaps part of the problems here?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have read the core polices, and I do understand them. Nothing that I have contributed would constitute original research. And I would like to say that I have made great pains not to "hit people over the head" with my knowledge here, and in other discussions. Perhaps I should have completely taken apart the sources used in this article and made it evident that these were outdated and relics of old thinking. Instead, I thought that it would be more diplomatic to allow the process to happen, giving only suggestions. This was perhaps a miscalculation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of "assuming good faith", I have said repeatedly said that I do not think that any of the people who I have perceived as promoting gender-biased thinking are aware of it (perhaps now they might have at least considered the possibility) and that this is not something which they are doing intentionally. I also feel that I have shown a certain amount of restraint, at least recently. In addition to having a great deal of work, I am intentionally trying to back off a bit here and look at the larger issues involved. I must confess however that this reflection is not completely changing my initial analysis of the situation, nor are others who are outside of the whole system here. I think that the validity of these perceptions should at least be considered before they are dismissed entirely.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On my talk page, you asked that I provide a reputable source for the issue of gender bias in Opera. This source was in my comment here. The reason why I posted the comments by Mr. Osborn is that he is a reputable source who is indeed saying that "the opera repertory or operatic "canon" as being gender-biased" and the link provided above to his website and the description of his music theatre work says exactly that. Mr. Osborn has had a long history of working with gender-bias issues and the selection of articles about his work with the IAWM and with his wife is available on his website.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The main authority concerning this issue that I know is Mrs. Patricia Adkins-Chiti, the head of the Adkins-Chiti Donne in Musica foundation <a href="http://www.donneinmusica.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.donneinmusica.org" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, who has the world's largest library of music by women, who has written books, edited collections of music, produced television series etc. It is difficult for me to bring her into this discussion for several reasons - First of which is that her husband is Gian Paolo Chiti and we publish his music. Patricia is actually kind of upset that her husband has been "nominated for deletion" here, especially with all of the unkind (and unsourced) remarks that were made about him. She's not terribly "pro-wikipedia" at this point...and I don't think that this is going to change.</dd>
<dd>This all goes around in a huge circle. I gave sources which are seen as biased. Then sources which are biased the other way are seen as neutral. I then am seen as having an "agenda" because I publish music by women and by living composers. Because of this "bias", I am then asked not to participate in the discussion. When the discussion is finished, I say that the conclusion is biased because the sources are biased, and then I am accused of "making trouble" and put before this "arbcom" committee. The outside sources (nobody published by us, nor with any direct connection) give indications which would seem to confirm the idea of gender bias here, and they are then called "biased" themselves. And now, you ask me to contribute "sources" which would confirm this idea of "bias".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I fail to see how this can be done at the present time, because every source that I could pull out of my hat right now is either a close friend or a colleague who has worked, works or will work with us. We are not just people who look on from the sidelines and we can't just pretend that we're "unbiased, neutral" onlookers. We have tried to make our contributions "neutral" and to use only sourced materials, but we also can't pretend that we aren't who we are and we don't do what we do.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have toyed with the idea of removing the catalog of works which we added to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germaine_Tailleferre_aaa0.html" title="Germaine Tailleferre">Germaine Tailleferre</a> as well as nominating the category of works by Germaine Tailleferre and all of the attached articles because although there are sources for all of statements made, there is also perhaps a notion of "original research" because of the way the facts are presented...not to mention this notion of "commerical promotion". If fifteen years of research is seen as a glorified advertizing campaign, then perhaps everything that we've added here should be removed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, I really don't mind about the article about my own work being deleted (I didn't write it, just for clarification...and only knew it was here weeks after the fact...but, passons...), but the deletion of Carson Cooman was really not fair. He has written over 650 works, all of which are published (not just by us either), has received commissions from major arts foundations and organizations, generated an important new repertoire for the organ (which was listed and which should have been qualification under WP:Music in my estimation) for which he has won awards, written many articles, have had any number of CDs and his next CD will be an orchestral CD released by Naxos. It looks as if Chiti and Malmasson are going to be spared the ax (it's rather beneath him, but Gian Paolo was very happy having an article here...and he's going to be a bit upset if he's axed for being not notable...nevermind all of those film scores he wrote for Carlo Ponti and the commissions from Vatican Radio etc), but the whole process is causing many people (not me, others) to ask the question "what is Wikipedia about"? And increasingly, the answer is expressed in terms of power and judgements which are not based on any kind of sourced reality. I don't presume to know whether these are fair assumptions, but I do think that these perceptions of what is happening at Wikipedia should be examined seriously, this present situation only being a very small example.</dd>

<p>So, it looks like Grove's "explore" function is less exhaustive in its inclusion of female composers than I had expected. There are a ton of women composers who have articles in Grove that aren't on that list. Now I'm trying to fill it in using the Index from the Norton/Grove anthology of Women composers (online - google book search), but it seems that only composers who are mentioned in an entry other than their own, or in the timeline, so that's not as exhaustive as I first thought... so I guess I'll have to go to the actual library and get the actual book. Then of course compounding the vague irritation that it's not that near done yet, there's the fear that not all those included will be considered notable enough for Wikipedia- which I think they should be, but it still makes me nervous, because it could be a huge pain to sort them out later.</p>

<p>Hi there, just read your userpage and thought I'd point out that we're apparently neighbors with similar interests, as I'm currently a Ph.D. student in music theory at UC Santa Barbara. I don't do much with early music, though (I tend toward 19th-century Germany instead). Just thought it was cool that we live near each other and are both interested in music. See you around. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_L%C3%A4ufer_4730.html" title="User:Heimstern LÃ¤ufer">Heimstern LÃ¤ufer</a> 05:13, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you wouldn't be the first to think I'm German (it's happened several times at <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="hrwiki:Main_Page">HRWiki</a>, my first wiki), nor the last (someone who was angry at my reverts thought I was just yesterday). But it's just my interest in German that made me pick a German name. And yeah, I know the Arts Library quite well, seeing that I more or less lived there for my first year of grad school.

<dd>You're welcome -- and good luck. I'd tell you the trick to getting hired if I knew it, but I chose a different career path. In general, you want to show them on the interview that you will be bringing them value; they want good teachers who will bring them students, and along with the students, tuition, endowments, and eventual generous alumni.

<dd>oh, I didn't realise, I thought I had gushed to you about it back when I was first working on "Concerto delle donne". Pretty cool, huh? I'm not sure when exactly it cuts you off, and I think they purposefully don't tell you. I think it partially has to do with the length of the book, but I'm really not sure. Generally, though, if you're doing something like finding comparisons of, say Perotin and Beethoven, you only need a couple pages per book you find. It's a lot nicer than going up to the public library and waiting half an hour for a book to be retrieved, and then reading the one relevant sentence&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 21:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for informing me of some of the important rules of Wikipedia. But vanity is not the case. When I first wanted to put up a page of Yuriy Leonovich, I didn't know where to start, or how to begin a page. I found some of his compositions online, and I saw great talent. I read his biography, and decided to contact him. I was impressed in how much he has done in such a short amont of time (Carnegie Hall and completion of the Tchaikovsky Cello Concerto). I searched for help, but nothing turned up...I kept on getting useless information. After hours of trying to create an article I figured out how to create a "User Page", even though that was not what I was going after. Hence, I immediately tried to move the page to its proper spot (figuring out what "moving" meant). But Wikipedia didn't let me do it for about a week. Thus, everyone who saw my "user Page" prior to the move could have thought that the article was about me, which was not the case. I hope this answers any questions you might have had.

<dd>Your edit was vandalism. Using your own vandalism to demonstrate how the Wiki is a flawed concept is <i>itself</i> a flawed concept. Why don't you try adding useful and accurate information; you might notice that it <i>stays</i> and the article <i>improves</i>; instead all you learned is that garbage is removed by the other users, and an administrator blocks the vandals and protects the page.

<p>Have you ever had to really intensely concentrate for 15 minutes, without any break or moment to space out? I mean seriously? This Reich piece is soooo hard because you can't just zone out when you don't have to sing, while counting to twenty, you have to be continuosly focusing on counting "1-2 1-2-3 1-2 1-2 1-2-3 1-2-3 1-2" in a seemingly completely random pattern. Argh! So hard! I feel like such an airhead soprano. (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proverb_%28Reich%29_5a04.html" title="Proverb (Reich)">Proverb (Reich)</a>) Apparently "Steve" can't come to this performance because he's accepting an award somewhere. I mean, Steve? These guys are hard core, but it's pretty effing cool.

<dd>One of the hardest performances I've ever done, strangely enough, was not as a performer, but as a <i>page turner</i> for a pianist doing a fast-fast-fast minimalist piece. Keeping my place on the pages as the notes ripped by with minor variation was un-believably-hard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some of those minimalist, and post-minimalist, things are hard in exactly the way you say. If you lose concentration you lose it. I've played John Adams, in the violin section, and that was hard: anybody screws up and you hear it. And someone <i>always</i> screwed up. And these were professionals ...</dd>

<dd>Yeah. It doesn't help that I'm holding a microphone for the first time, the keyboards are crazy (they're period instruments! the exact instruments used in the first performance! which means, of course, that by now they're completely broken). I definitely feel like the slow kid in the class, but I think I'll do fine. The vibraphone players are really good, as are the "tenors" (one of whom is actually a countertenor). The countertenor was saying that he was basically responsible for convincing Reich that countertenors could sing his music, and I'm inclined to believe him. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 16:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heck yeah they're DX-7s. Ten years of being dropped in the parking lot doesn't seem to have done good things to them, though. One of them has a broken key which was basically ciphering until a wad of paper was inserted. I think I've seen that cartoon before, it's pretty good&#160;:) At least we're not using the period tenors, because then I'd be singing with my old voice teacher (well, that might actually be good...

<p>(resets indent) No, the last rehearsal is over, the performance is tomorrow, some time between 2-6. We have to sit in full view of the audience the whole time&#160;:( You know that part? Where it changes key? after the long vibe solo? and the soprano and tenor come in together? My onset was a little out of tune (not the whole note, the onset) and <i>everyone</i> was completely aware.

<dd>I think the whole dress rehearsal thing has to do with focus - if you mess up in the dress rehearsal, you know that you really need to focus in the performance, and if you don't mess up in the dress, you're more likely to think you can coast, and then mess up.

<p>I have to be careful not to let this become an addiction. =) I happened to be writing a short synopsis of Krummel and Sadie's work for a class, and checked those two entries, which I thought were a little paltry. So I went ahead and pasted a chunk of the paper in each entry. Now, of course, that means I have to put a note in the paper, so I don't get accused of plagiarising myself off of Wikipedia! But I can't promise I'll be updating anything systematically; every once in a while, I just get the urge to look something up, and if it's weak, I fix it. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 22:51, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there: I just did a moderate rewrite of the Graffman article, and it got reverted immediately. What did I do wrong? Thanks. --<a href="../../../w/s/p/User%7EWspencer11_8aca.html" title="User:Wspencer11">Wspencer11</a> <a href="../../../w/s/p/User_talk%7EWspencer11_b16d.html" title="User talk:Wspencer11">(talk to me...)</a> 15:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you! P.S.: Am I allowed to ask what Antandrus means?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry you've been spammed, but I hope you'll find for a good reason. I've noticed you are active around the recent changes arena (normally having beaten me to a revert), and I'm currently looking for help with a new project. I would like to harmonise all the warnings and templates we issue, with goal to creating a standard look, format and content to the messages. Even if you use VP, VS or any of the other vandal tools out there, I still feel this is worthwhile. Please visit <b><a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_templates_88ca.html" title="User:Khukri/templates">here</a></b> for further information, and leave me a message if you're interested, or tell me to get lost&#160;;) if you haven't the time. Regards <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b>Khukri</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khukri_f113.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 13:39, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Antandrus, thanks a lot for supporting me in my recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Khoikhoi_2_24dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Khoikhoi 2">RfA</a>.

<p>Thanks for pointing out the errors, I've fixed them (I think). I'm discovering once again just how bad I am at reading sheet music. It's the main reason I wrote the files, I was trying to figure out how the examples sounded. Realized right as I was starting the second one that they'd make a good addition to the article.</p>
<p>I'm trying to pick up enough composing to turn a theme that I've got into a soundtrack for an RPG. ... And discovering just how much there is to learn.</p>

<p>First of all, for some reason this is taking waaaaaay too long. Secondly, what should I do with the lady who refused to disclose her birth year? (which I think is pretty hilarious) I'm tempted to put her with people who are most likely 20 years older than her, just to foil her evil plans.

<p>I have done and will continue to do the utmost to serve the community in this new capacity, wherever it may take me, and to set an example others might wish to follow in. With a little luck and a lot of <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">advice</a></b>, this may be enough. Maybe someday the enwiki admins of the future will look back and say, "Yeah, <b><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">that guy</a></b> was an admin." Hopefully then they don't start talking about the <i>explosive</i> ArbComm case I got tied into and <i>oh what a drama that was</i>, but we'll see, won't we?</p>
<p>Surely some of you have seen me in action by now; with that in mind, I openly invite and welcome any feedback <b><a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">here</a></b> or <b><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_Improve_me_ca5f.html" title="User:Luna Santin/Improve me">here</a></b> -- help me become the best editor and sysop I can be.</p>
