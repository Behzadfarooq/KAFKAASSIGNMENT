<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_contribs_586a.html" title="Edit section: New articles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New articles</span></h4>
<p>Articles I have written from scratch. Some of these I have begun from a substub, or completely rewritten from content pillaged from one of the public domain resources (such as the Catholic Encyclopedia, or the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica)</p>
<p>Most recent first.</p>
<ol>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Missa_L%27homme_arm%C3%A9_super_voces_musicales_2a5f.html" title="Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales">Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales</a></i>, by Josquin des Prez. Fairly early mass, and probably his most famous.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Missa_Pange_lingua_8f11.html" title="Missa Pange lingua">Missa Pange lingua</a></i> by Josquin des Prez. His most brilliant and probably last mass, an amazing contrapuntal fantasia on the hymn, unlike anything anyone had written before, but which was hugely influential on the later Netherlanders.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../r/e/q/Requiem_%28Ockeghem%29_fcea.html" title="Requiem (Ockeghem)">Requiem</a> by Ockeghem, the oldest setting of the Requiem for multiple voices to survive.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelagnolo_Galilei_8adc.html" title="Michelagnolo Galilei">Michelagnolo Galilei</a> Younger brother of Galileo; lutenist and composer.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrus_de_Domarto_bc51.html" title="Petrus de Domarto">Petrus de Domarto</a> Minor contemporary of Ockeghem.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginaldus_Libert_ac61.html" title="Reginaldus Libert">Reginaldus Libert</a> Minor Burgundian composer. Almost through with the big list.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Tapissier_db61.html" title="Johannes Tapissier">Johannes Tapissier</a>, one of the first of the Burgundian School, and he even overlapped with the Avignon guys.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Fontaine_%28composer%29_ab1f.html" title="Pierre Fontaine (composer)">Pierre Fontaine</a>, another fine early 15th century composer, this one of entirely secular music. He worked for Philip the Bold, John the Fearless, and Philip the Good, but fortunately died before the reign of Joe the Tone-Deaf.</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/s/t/Estienne_Grossin_70df.html" title="Estienne Grossin">Estienne Grossin</a>, a French composer of the early 15th century, that obscure time no one likes to try to classify. He wrote something that really wants to be a cyclic mass, but isn't quite.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Missa_Caput_4202.html" title="Missa Caput">Missa Caput</a></i>, the anonymous one. If I ever write article on the Obrecht and Ockeghem, then disambig (Missa Caput (Obrecht)) the others. Crush that serpent.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Antico_e977.html" title="Andrea Antico">Andrea Antico</a>. First of 2007. Starting on the printers after Petrucci.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Missa_La_sol_fa_re_mi_9aa8.html" title="Missa La sol fa re mi">Missa La sol fa re mi</a></i> Gorgeous, stunning, impossibly tightly organised masterpiece by Josquin des Prez. The motivic permutations, transformations and playfulness are more reminiscent of the Second Viennese School than most compositions in the 16th century.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonius_Divitis_8b49.html" title="Antonius Divitis">Antonius Divitis</a>. Another contemporary of Josquin. One at a time, chipping away.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/s/Josquin_des_Prez_a7e1.html" title="Josquin des Prez">Josquin des Prez</a>. Completely rewritten from the version copied from the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Braconnier_b35f.html" title="Jean Braconnier">Jean Braconnier</a>. Contemporary of Josquin. Doing them <i>all</i>, dammit, no reason why we should leave any out. Britannica's coverage of this period is miserable, and ours will be better in all ways. Nyah.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_de_Longueval_c094.html" title="Antoine de Longueval">Antoine de Longueval</a>. Contemporary of Josquin. His home was destroyed in the First Battle of the Somme in 1916. Four hundred years before that, he probably wrote the first influential polyphonic musical setting of the Passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, Prince of Peace, on the same spot torn to clods by artillery shells. So it goes.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/t/Motet-chanson.html" title="Motet-chanson">Motet-chanson</a>. Specialised form of the Sforza chapel in Milan, developed in the 1470s/1480s. Josquin, Compère, Agricola, others.</li>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../o/d/h/Odhecaton.html" title="Odhecaton">Odhecaton</a></i>, the first collection of music ever to be printed.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Ghiselin_1982.html" title="Johannes Ghiselin">Johannes Ghiselin</a> (Verbonnet) "He brought Josquin des Prez with him from Paris, arriving in Ferrara in a splendid carriage." Reminds me of the times I have picked up famous composers at the airport. Yup, it's the same thing. Ghiselin actually wasn't a bad composer, but he's completely overshadowed by his contemporaries.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Miserere_%28Josquin%29_2577.html" title="Miserere (Josquin)">Miserere</a></i> by Josquin des Prez. Profound and humbling, and hugely influential in music of the next hundred years. Probably written for Holy Week Tenebrae service in 1504 in Ferrara, and was probably sung by Duke Ercole d'Este himself.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclic_mass.html" title="Cyclic mass">Cyclic mass</a>. Prior to really rewriting the Mass article, which I may have to do next.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphrase_mass.html" title="Paraphrase mass">Paraphrase mass</a>. Starting in on the types of mass composition; need to do it before finishing Josquin, which ought to be soon.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infelix_ego.html" title="Infelix ego">Infelix ego</a></i>, the great and moving meditation on the <i>Miserere</i> by <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girolamo_Savonarola_1f45.html" title="Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a>, composed with only his right hand (the only part of his body remaining undamaged, after his torture on the rack), the day before he was burned at the stake in 1498. Extremely influential in music history.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/u/p/Lupus_Hellinck_e78b.html" title="Lupus Hellinck">Lupus Hellinck</a> (Lupi and Lupus are what Reese, in one of his extremely rare moments of humor, calls the "wolf pack"). Lupus wrote a setting of <i>In te domine speravi</i> inspired by the prison writings of Savonarola, a reform-minded, puritanical religious fanatic useful to study on this fifth anniversary of 9/11. While one can see something heroic in Savonarola's actions, and worthy of compassion in his appalling suffering in prison and his final grisly martyrdom, he and Osama are cut from the same cloth, though the weave differs somewhat in the 500 years separating them. Some of the finest musicians of the age venerated the fire-eyed monk, and their music written secretly in his praise today gets played as background music to new-age shows, or anthologized in "Devotions by Candlelight" sets. What would he ever have thought. Yet this is interesting stuff.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/s/Massimo_Troiano_a296.html" title="Massimo Troiano">Massimo Troiano</a> Musician under Lassus; described the Munich court in detail, but ran off after killing one of his co-workers. It wasn't legal in those days, just easier to get away with.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Pinos_090f.html" title="Mount Pinos">Mount Pinos</a> Highest peak in Ventura County and the Transverse Ranges; just visited it a couple days ago. Two non-music articles in a row.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/u/Chumash_Wilderness_68ed.html" title="Chumash Wilderness">Chumash Wilderness</a> Place I just visited and photographed; frankly I'm a little shocked there are so many redlinks remaining for US wilderness areas. Maybe most Wikipedians are sedentary.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim_Thibault_de_Courville_6e46.html" title="Joachim Thibault de Courville">Joachim Thibault de Courville</a>, French composer, founder of <i>musique mesurée</i> with Baïf</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Musique_mesur%C3%A9e.html" title="Musique mesurée">Musique mesurée</a></i>, which sounds so utterly fresh after more than four hundred years, because of those delightful irregular meters.</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustache_Du_Caurroy_553e.html" title="Eustache Du Caurroy">Eustache Du Caurroy</a>, late 16th century French composer, appreciated by Marin Mersenne and a couple French kings, but probably not by reality show contestants, hip-hop-shop bin-divers, or Wikipedia vandals.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firminus_Caron_e2b0.html" title="Firminus Caron">Firminus Caron</a>, interesting, if rather minor, composer of the mid-15th century</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Mureau_669b.html" title="Gilles Mureau">Gilles Mureau</a>, another composer listed in Heaven by Eloy d'Amerval: haven't done the ones in the Other Place yet</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Fed%C3%A9_31ed.html" title="Johannes Fedé">Johannes Fedé</a>, one of the ones in Heaven (see next item)</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloy_d%27Amerval_2a86.html" title="Eloy d'Amerval">Eloy d'Amerval</a>: listed all the composers in Heaven. The famous composers that didn't make his list, well, hell.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/i/n/Rinaldo_del_Mel_5f84.html" title="Rinaldo del Mel">Rinaldo del Mel</a>, Roman School member from Flanders, even though he didn't spend all his life in Rome</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/n/Annibale_Zoilo_9ec4.html" title="Annibale Zoilo">Annibale Zoilo</a>, another Roman School composer of the late 16th century: can't figure out why he left Rome for positions in the provinces, after working at St. John Lateran: who did he piss off?</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Dragoni_0e5e.html" title="Giovanni Dragoni">Giovanni Dragoni</a>, minor member of the Roman School, about time I'm writing articles again</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/h/i/Ghiselin_Danckerts_6496.html" title="Ghiselin Danckerts">Ghiselin Danckerts</a>, reactionary theorist in the Sistine Chapel choir, dismissed for being "much given to women and excessively rich" (1565).</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firmin_Lebel_11f1.html" title="Firmin Lebel">Firmin Lebel</a>, probable teacher of Palestrina, Rome, around 1540-1543</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/i/r/Girolamo_Belli_4d4d.html" title="Girolamo Belli">Girolamo Belli</a>, Italian madrigalist, somewhat younger than Luzzaschi and studied with him; spent some time with that group of aristocratic nuts in Ferrara.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hygons_37b3.html" title="Richard Hygons">Richard Hygons</a> English composer represented in the <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_Choirbook_98fa.html" title="Eton Choirbook">Eton Choirbook</a> by that incredible <i><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salve_Regina_f543.html" title="Salve Regina">Salve Regina</a></i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello_Suites_%28Britten%29_24ba.html" title="Cello Suites (Britten)">Cello Suites (Britten)</a> -- was a request at the top of Recent Changes; just a stub for now.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Lupo_fd33.html" title="Thomas Lupo">Thomas Lupo</a> Composer of consort music, Jacobean era mainly.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._4_%28Sibelius%29_0d57.html" title="Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)">Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)</a> -- Ah, love this piece, but I'm notorious for liking "dark" things.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonhard_Kleber_d4b9.html" title="Leonhard Kleber">Leonhard Kleber</a> quickie on a German organist of the early 16th century. Not a lot is known except about his huge tablature.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Gottlieb_Goldberg_fa01.html" title="Johann Gottlieb Goldberg">Johann Gottlieb Goldberg</a> German virtuoso keyboard player and composer; J.S. Bach named his "Goldberg Variations" for him. Not quite happy with it yet; need to clarify what is not certain (if that isn't some kind of oxymoron)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonius_Romanus_781d.html" title="Antonius Romanus">Antonius Romanus</a> Another quattrocento composer; less of his music has survived than da Cividale's, but he may have been a greater influence on Dufay. Not known where or when the two met, or how they knew each other.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_da_Cividale_fa6b.html" title="Antonio da Cividale">Antonio da Cividale</a>, starting on the quattrocento; this is a relatively obscure time for Italian music, until mid-century</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Gervaise_84ca.html" title="Claude Gervaise">Claude Gervaise</a>, French printer, editor and composer, mid 16th century</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/n/Annibale_Stabile_2280.html" title="Annibale Stabile">Annibale Stabile</a>, Roman school composer of the mid-to-late 16th century; died in Kraków. Lots of these guys went to Poland; it's one of the things they don't teach you in Music History.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Matelart_0053.html" title="Johannes Matelart">Johannes Matelart</a>, Roman school, but Flemish, but not really, or sort-of. This is getting seriously obscure. Can't find any info on his style.</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_Waelrant_9386.html" title="Hubert Waelrant">Hubert Waelrant</a>, Flemish composer, a generation senior to Pevernage and Verdonck</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_Pevernage_6905.html" title="Andreas Pevernage">Andreas Pevernage</a>, another late 16th century Flemish composer, who stuck around in the Netherlands during all the massacres and other religious misbehavior that characterized that time and place. Not that that doesn't happen still.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelis_Verdonck_4663.html" title="Cornelis Verdonck">Cornelis Verdonck</a>, late 16th century composer from Flanders. Wrote the only known motet composed for performance on the back of an elephant.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolomeo_degli_Organi_d3f9.html" title="Bartolomeo degli Organi">Bartolomeo degli Organi</a> Composer and organist to Lorenzo de Medici. Teacher of Machiavelli's son. It's a pet peeve of mine that so many people know the artists, writers, statesmen, mass murderers, and sex perverts of the period, but not the musicians.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolomeo_da_Bologna_1932.html" title="Bartolomeo da Bologna">Bartolomeo da Bologna</a> One of just a handful of Italian composers known to be active in the early 15th century, whose music has survived. A shadowy time for written music.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolaus_Zacharie_15ba.html" title="Nicolaus Zacharie">Nicolaus Zacharie</a> Composer from far southeast Italy, early quattrocento.</li>
<li><a href="../../../z/a/c/Zacara_da_Teramo_1172.html" title="Zacara da Teramo">Zacara da Teramo</a> Prolific, mysterious, "Satanic" composer from around 1400. That was hard. Much research is still going on about this guy.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/e/Maestro_Piero_06e9.html" title="Maestro Piero">Maestro Piero</a> 14th century composer; only eight surviving pieces, rather shadowy figure, but probably the oldest named composer of whom polyphonic music survives from Italy. (Is that incautious? I can't think of any others.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Joye_b447.html" title="Gilles Joye">Gilles Joye</a> 15th century wild man. Not known for <i>certain</i>, but he probably wrote two masses based on <i>O rosa belle</i>, which happened to match "Rosabelle", the name of his favorite prostitute in Bruges.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/i/o/Diomedes_Cato_03b2.html" title="Diomedes Cato">Diomedes Cato</a> Italian composer, but really a Polish one, since he lived there from the age of about five; his father fled Italy to escape the Inquisition.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Pullois_116f.html" title="Johannes Pullois">Johannes Pullois</a> yet another 15th century composer; this one didn't pass the Burgundian audition, so went to Rome instead.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfonso_Fontanelli_2cbc.html" title="Alfonso Fontanelli">Alfonso Fontanelli</a> Avant-garde madrigalist of the late 16th century; Ferrarese; like Gesualdo, he murdered his wife's lover--only unlike Gesualdo he spared his wife.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobus_Barbireau_a594.html" title="Jacobus Barbireau">Jacobus Barbireau</a> Excellent composer of the late 15th century</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_de_La_Grotte_add5.html" title="Nicolas de La Grotte">Nicolas de La Grotte</a> another 16th century French composer</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominique_Phinot_aadc.html" title="Dominique Phinot">Dominique Phinot</a> Excellent 16th century composer; executed for homosexuality (Gombert they just sent to the galleys)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_de_Bertrand_4b17.html" title="Antoine de Bertrand">Antoine de Bertrand</a> Microtonal composer, some of the time; otherwise a fine chanson composer killed by Protestants in Toulouse in 1581</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_l%27H%C3%A9ritier_cad4.html" title="Jean l'Héritier">Jean l'Héritier</a>; underrated 16th century French composer, mainly active in Italy.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/h/e/Gherardello_da_Firenze_da18.html" title="Gherardello da Firenze">Gherardello da Firenze</a> Another trecento composer. You'd think I'd know Italian by now, but no ...</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_the_trecento.html" title="Music of the trecento">Music of the trecento</a> Biggest article I have written in a while. Hard one; notoriously hard to explain to non-specialists. I probably should list recordings, and it would be great to have musical examples. Yet more to do.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/s/Rossi_Codex_ec5e.html" title="Rossi Codex">Rossi Codex</a> Oldest source of Italian polyphonic secular music anywhere. And this stuff is secular indeed. Ironically enough, it's in the Vatican.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/i/c/Niccol%C3%B2_da_Perugia_6623.html" title="Niccolò da Perugia">Niccolò da Perugia</a>, one of the fairly conservative composers of the 14th century. Probably he didn't drink as much as Landini and Andrea.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_da_Firenze_088f.html" title="Andrea da Firenze">Andrea da Firenze</a> Underrated contemporary of Landini. These Italians: the drama, the lyricism, the pacing, you can hear Puccini coming 500 years away.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ten_Commandments_%281923_film%29_502f.html" title="The Ten Commandments (1923 film)">The Ten Commandments (1923 film)</a> And now for something completely different. The filming location, or the ruins thereof, is an active archaeological site, which is amusing. They're digging up <i>fake</i> pyramids and sphynxes as archaeological relics.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobus_Vaet_800f.html" title="Jacobus Vaet">Jacobus Vaet</a> Splendid composer of the middle 16th century; not nearly well enough known. Wrote not only one of the early requiems, but a <i>Missa quodlibetica</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodovico_Giustini_970b.html" title="Lodovico Giustini">Lodovico Giustini</a> The first person to write music for the piano.</li>

After the siege of Beauvais, if he was not killed, but remained (anonymously) working at the court of France, it is certainly possible that he was <i>captured</i>--but could not go home again because Charles would have thought him a traitor. Eager to compete with Burgundy as a center of culture, musical and otherwise, the King of France (Louis XI) probably wouldn't have had any trouble hiring him; he was busy bringing scholars and artists and musicians from all over Europe. Hayne's life would make a great historical novel, or even, god forbid, an opera.</li>

<li><a href="../../../1/8/7/1875_in_music.html" title="1875 in music">1875 in music</a> Listing it not because it's super-important, but because working on these is so tedious and time-consuming. Yet when I'm not up to writing expository prose these are a good filler.</li>
