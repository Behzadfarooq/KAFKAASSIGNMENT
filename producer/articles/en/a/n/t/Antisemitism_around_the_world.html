<p>Including <a href="../../../a/d/e/Aden.html" title="Aden">Aden</a>, there were about 63,000 Jews in <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> in 1948. Today, there are about 200 left. In 1947, riots killed at least 80 Jews in Aden. Increasingly hostile conditions led to the Israeli government's <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Magic_Carpet_%28Yemen%29_3de7.html" title="Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)">Operation Magic Carpet</a>, the evacuation of 50,000 Jews from Yemen to Israel in 1949 and 1950. Emigration continued until 1962, when the civil war in Yemen broke out. A small community remained unknown until 1976, but it appears that all infrastructure is lost now.</p>
<p>Jews in Yemen were long subject to a number of restrictions, ranging from attire, hairstyle, home ownership, marriage, etc. Under the "Orphan's Decree", many Jewish orphans below puberty were raised as Muslims. This practice began in the late 18th century, was suspended under Ottoman rule, then was revived in 1918. Most cases occurred in the 1920s, but sporadic cases occurred until the 1940s. In later years, the Yemenite government has taken some steps to protect the Jewish community in their country.</p>

<p>In 1948, there were approximately 150,000 <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. In 2003, there were 100 left, though there are reports that small numbers of Jews are returning in the wake of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>In 1941, following <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Ali_2ec2.html" title="Rashid Ali">Rashid Ali</a>'s pro-<a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis</a> coup, riots known as the <i><a href="../../../f/a/r/Farhud.html" title="Farhud">Farhud</a></i> broke out in <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in which approximately 200 Jews were murdered (some sources put the number higher), and up to 2,000 injured.</p>
<p>Like most <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_League_2a91.html" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> states, Iraq forbade the emigration of its Jews for a few years after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state. However, intense diplomatic pressure brought about a change of mind. At the same time, increasing government oppression of the Jews fueled by anti-Israeli sentiment, together with public expressions of anti-semitism, created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In March 1950, Iraq passed a law of one year duration allowing Jews to emigrate on condition of relinquishing their Iraqi citizenship. Iraq apparently believed it would rid itself of those Jews it regarded as the most troublesome, especially the Zionists, but retain the wealthy minority who played an important part in the Iraqi economy. Israel mounted an operation called "<a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ezra_and_Nehemiah_9ebb.html" title="Operation Ezra and Nehemiah">Ezra and Nehemiah</a>" to bring as many of the Iraqi Jews as possible to Israel, and sent agents to Iraq to urge the Jews to register for immigration as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The initial rate of registration accelerated after a bomb injured three Jews at a café. Two months before the expiry of the law, by which time about 85,000 Jews had registered, a bomb at the Masuda Shemtov <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">Synagogue</a> killed 3 or 5 Jews and injured many. The law expired in March 1951, but was later extended after the Iraqi government froze the assets of departing Jews (including those already left). During the next few months, all but a few thousand of the remaining Jews registered for emigration, spurred on by a sequence of bombings that caused few casualties but had great psychological impact. In total, about 120,000 Jews left Iraq.</p>
<p>In May and June 1951, the arms caches of the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> underground in Iraq, which had been supplied from Palestine/Israel since the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farhud.html" title="Farhud">Farhud</a> of 1942, were discovered. Many Jews were arrested and two Zionist activists, Yusuf Basri and Ibrahim Salih, were tried and hanged for three of the bombings. A secret Israeli inquiry in 1960 reported that most of the witnesses believed that Jews had been responsible for the bombings, but found no evidence that they were ordered by Israel. The issue remains unresolved: Iraqi activists in Israel still regularly charge that Israel used violence to engineer the exodus, while Israeli officials of the time vehemently deny it. According to historian Moshe Gatt, few historians believe that Israel was actually behind the bombing campaign -- based on factors such as records indicating that Israel did not want such a rapid registration rate and that bomb throwing at Jewish targets was common before 1950, making the Istiqlal Party a more likely culprit than the Zionist underground. In any case, the remainder of Iraq's Jews left over the next few decades, and had mostly gone by 1970.</p>

<p>Despite close economic and military ties to Israel, Turkey has experienced a recent surge in anti-Semitic literature, most notably the sale of <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>, the autobiography of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, which has become a bestseller through the country.

<p>While the exact reason for the book's popularity is uncertain, it may reflect anger over the treatment of fellow Muslim in Palestine by Israelis, anti-western sentiments caused by the war in Iraq, or simply backlash caused by Turkey's bid to join the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitic sentiments have also been observed in the Turkish media, such as in the nationalist <i>Ortadogu</i>, where Selcuk Duzgun, in an article titled <i>Here is the Real Jew</i> stated: "We are surrounded. Wherever we look we see traitors. Wherever we turn we see impure, false converts. Whichever stone you turn over, there is a Jew under it.

<p>In 1955, Morocco attained independence. Jews occupied several political positions, including three Members of Parliament and a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.

In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kairouan.html" title="Kairouan">Kairouan</a> and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as <i>hara</i>. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews.

<p>Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> control during World War II, was also the site of anti-Semitic activities such as prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.</p>

<p>However, according to 2005 survey results by the ADL,<sup id="_ref-ADL2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADL2" title="">[19]</a></sup> antisemitic attitudes remain common in Europe. Over 30% of those surveyed indicated that Jews have too much power in business, with responses ranging from lows of 11% in Denmark and 14% in England to highs of 66% in Hungary, and over 40% in Poland and Spain. The results of religious antisemitism also linger and over 20% of European respondents agreed that Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, with France having the lowest percentage at 13% and Poland having the highest number of those agreeing, at 39%.<sup id="_ref-flashmap_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flashmap" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Vienna-based European Union Monitoring Centre (EUMC), for 2002 and 2003, identified France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands as EU member countries with notable increases in incidents. Many of these incidents can be linked to immigrant communities in these countries and result from hightened tensions in the Middle East. As these nations keep reliable and comprehensive statistics on antisemitic acts, and are engaged in combating antisemitism, their data was readily available to the EUMC.</p>
<p>In western Europe, traditional far-right groups still account for a significant proportion of the attacks against Jews and Jewish properties; disadvantaged and disaffected Muslim youths increasingly were responsible for most of the other incidents. In Eastern Europe, with a much smaller Muslim population, neo-Nazis and others members of the radical political fringe were responsible for most antisemitic incidents. Antisemitism remained a serious problem in Russia and Belarus, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, with most incidents carried out by ultra-nationalist and other far-right elements. The stereotype of Jews as manipulators of the global economy continues to provide fertile ground for antisemitic aggression.</p>

The most famous Jewish educational institutions were closed, and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogues</a> everywhere destroyed.</p>

Many Muslims and Jews moved to North Africa rather than submit to forced conversion.

<p>Anti-semitism in Denmark has not been as widespread as in other countries. Initially Jews were banned as in other countries in Europe, but beginning in the 17th century, Jews were allowed to live in Denmark freely, unlike in other European countries where they were forced to live in ghettos.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/1/1813.html" title="1813">1813</a>, Denmark had gone bankrupt and people were looking for a scapegoat. A German anti-Semitic book, translated into Danish, provoked a flood of polemical articles both for and against the Jews.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/1/1819.html" title="1819">1819</a> a series of anti-Jewish riots in Germany spread to several neighboring countries including Denmark, resulting in mob attacks on Jews in Copenhagen and many provincial towns. These riots were known as Hep! Hep! Riots, from the derogatory rallying cry against the Jews in Germany. Riots lasted for five months during which time shop windows were smashed, stores looted, homes attacked, and Jews physically abused.</p>
<p>However, during World War II, Denmark was very uncooperative with the Nazi occupation on Jewish matters. Danish officials repeatedly insisted to the German occupation authorities that there was no "Jewish problem" in Denmark. As a result, even ideologically committed Nazis such as Reich Commissioner <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werner_Best_ab3d.html" title="Werner Best">Werner Best</a> followed a strategy of avoiding and deferring discussion of Denmark's Jews. When Denmark's German occupiers began planning the deportation of the 8,000 or so Jews in Denmark to <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_concentration_camps.html" title="Nazi concentration camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>, many Danes and Swedes took part in a collective effort to evacuate the roughly 8,000 Jews of Denmark by sea to nearby Sweden (see also <a href="../../../r/e/s/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews_ca4b.html" title="Rescue of the Danish Jews">Rescue of the Danish Jews</a>).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>At the onset of the seventeenth century, tolerance began to give way to increased anti-Semitism.

<dl>
<dd>"<i>At the end of the 16th century and thereafter, not one year passed without a blood libel trial against Jews in Poland, trials which always ended with the execution of Jewish victims in a heinous manner..."</i> (ibid., volume 6, chapter 4).</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the 1650s the Swedish invasion of the Commonwealth (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Deluge_%28Polish_history%29_1d9b.html" title="The Deluge (Polish history)">The Deluge</a>) and the <a href="../../../c/h/m/Chmielnicki_Uprising_1b4c.html" title="Chmielnicki Uprising">Chmielnicki Uprising</a> of the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cossack.html" title="Cossack">Cossacks</a> resulted in vast depopulation of the Commonwealth, as over 30% of the ~10 million population has perished or emigrated. In the related 1648-55 pogroms led by the Ukrainian uprising against Polish nobility (<a href="../../../s/z/l/Szlachta.html" title="Szlachta">szlachta</a>), during which approximately 100,000 Jews were slaughtered, Polish and <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenian.html" title="Ruthenian">Ruthenian</a> peasants often participated in killing Jews (<i>The Jews in Poland</i>, Ken Spiro, 2001). The besieged szlachta, who were also decimated in the territories where the uprising happened, typically abandoned the loyal peasantry, townsfolk, and the Jews renting their land, in violation of "rental" contracts.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Deluge and Chmielnicki Uprising, many Jews fled to the less turbulent <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, which had granted the Jews a protective charter in 1619. From then until the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> deportations in 1942, the Netherlands remained a remarkably tolerant haven for Jews in Europe, excedeeing the tolerance extant in all other European countries at the time, and becoming one of the few Jewish havens until nineteenth century social and political reforms throughout much of Europe. Many Jews also fled to England, open to Jews since the mid-seventeenth century, in which Jews were fundamentally ignored and not typically persecuted. Historian Berel Wein notes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>In a reversal of roles that is common in Jewish history, the victorious Poles now vented their wrath upon the hapless Jews of the area, accusing them of collaborating with the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cossack.html" title="Cossack">Cossack</a> invader!... The Jews, reeling from almost five years of constant hell, abandoned their Polish communities and institutions..."</i> (<i>Triumph of Survival</i>, 1990).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Throughout the sixteenth to eighteenth century, many of the szlachta mistreated peasantry, townsfolk and Jews. Threat of mob violence was a specter over the Jewish communities in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> at the time. On one occasion in 1696, a mob threatened to massacre the Jewish community of Posin, <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitebsk.html" title="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>. The mob accused the Jews of murdering a Pole. At the last moment, a peasant woman emerged with the victim's clothes and confessed to the murder. One notable example of actualized riots against Polish Jews is the rioting of 1716, during which many Jews lost their lives. Later, in 1723, the Bishop of <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a> instigated the massacre of hundreds of Jews.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should be noted that despite the mentioned incidents, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> was a relative haven for Jews when compared to the period of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">partitions of Poland</a> and the PLC's destruction in 1795 (see <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html#Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union" title="Anti-Semitism">Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union</a>, below).</p>
<p>Anti-Jewish sentiments continued to be present in Poland, even after the country regained its independence. One notable manifestation of these attitudes includes <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerus_clausus.html#numerus_clausus_in_Poland" title="Numerus clausus">numerus clausus</a> rules imposed, by almost all Polish universities in the 1930s. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_W._Hagen_5055.html" title="William W. Hagen">William W. Hagen</a> in his <i>Before the "Final Solution": Toward a Comparative Analysis of Political Anti-Semitism in Interwar Germany and Poland</i> article in <i>Journal of Modern History (July, 1996): 1-31</i>, details:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>In Poland, the semidictatorial government of <a href="../../../j/%C3%B3/z/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski_6bb6.html" title="Józef Piłsudski">Piłsudski</a> and his successors, pressured by an increasingly vocal opposition on the radical and fascist right, implemented many anti-Semitic policies tending in a similar direction, while still others were on the official and semiofficial agenda when war descended in 1939.... In the 1930s the realm of official and semiofficial discrimination expanded to encompass limits on Jewish export firms... and, increasingly, on university admission itself. In 1921-22 some 25 percent of Polish university students were Jewish, but in 1938-39 their proportion had fallen to 8 percent.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>While there are many examples of Polish support and help for the Jews during World War II and the Holocaust, there are also numerous examples of anti-Semitic incidents, and the Jewish population was certain of the indifference towards their fate from the Christian Poles. The Polish Institute for National Memory identified twenty-four <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogroms.html" title="Pogroms">pogroms</a> against Jews during World War II, the most notable occurring at the village of <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedwabne.html" title="Jedwabne">Jedwabne</a> in 1941 (see <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_in_Jedwabne_cb66.html" title="Massacre in Jedwabne">massacre in Jedwabne</a>).</p>
<p>After the end of World War II the remaining anti-Jewish sentiments were skillfully used at certain moments by Communist party or individual politicians in order to achieve their assumed political goals, which pinnacled in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1968_events.html" title="March 1968 events">March 1968 events</a>. These sentiments started to diminish only with the collapse of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> rule in Poland in 1989, which has resulted in a re-examination of events between Jewish and Christian Poles, with a number of incidents, like the massacre at Jedwabne, being discussed openly for the first time. Violent anti-semitism in Poland in 21st century is marginal<sup id="_ref-major_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-major" title="">[37]</a></sup> compared to elsewhere, but there are very few Jews remaining in Poland. Still, according to recent (June 7, 2005) results of research by <a href="../../../b/27/n/B%27nai_Brith_a3d6.html" title="B'nai Brith">B'nai Briths</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Defamation_League_5083.html" title="Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a>, Poland remains among the European countries (with others being Italy, Spain and Germany) with the largest percentages of people holding anti-Semitic views.</p>

<p>From the early Middle Ages to the 18th century, the Jews in Germany were subject to many persecutions as well as brief times of tolerance. Though the 19th century began with a series of riots and pogroms against the Jews, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_emancipation.html" title="Jewish emancipation">emancipation</a> followed in 1848, so that, by the early 20th century, the Jews of Germany were the most integrated in Europe. The situation changed in the early 1930s with the rise of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> and their explicitly anti-Semitic program. <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">Hate speech</a> which referred to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> citizens as "dirty Jews" became common in anti-Semitic pamphlets and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> such as the <i><a href="../../../v/%C3%B6/l/V%C3%B6lkischer_Beobachter_73fb.html" title="Völkischer Beobachter">Völkischer Beobachter</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_St%C3%BCrmer_17e9.html" title="Der Stürmer">Der Stürmer</a></i>. Additionally, blame was laid on German Jews for having caused Germany's defeat in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> (see <i><a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolchstosslegende.html" title="Dolchstosslegende">Dolchstosslegende</a></i>).</p>
<p>Anti-Jewish propaganda expanded rapidly. Nazi cartoons depicting "dirty Jews" frequently portrayed a dirty, physically unattractive and badly dressed "talmudic" Jew in traditional religious garments similar to those worn by <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Jews</a>. Articles attacking Jewish Germans, while concentrating on commercial and political activities of prominent Jewish individuals, also frequently attacked them based on religious dogmas, such as <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>.</p>
<p>The Nazi antisemitic program quickly expanded beyond mere speech. Starting in 1933, repressive laws were passed against Jews, culminating in the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Laws_6b56.html" title="Nuremberg Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a> which removed most of the rights of citizenship from Jews, using a racial definition based on descent, rather than any religious definition of who was a Jew. Sporadic violence against the Jews became widespread with the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> riots, which targeted Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship, killing hundreds across Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>The antisemitic agenda culminated in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> of the Jews of Europe, known as the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>.</p>

<p>During 1881-1884, 1903-1906 and 1914-1921, waves of antisemitic <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a> swept Russian Jewish communities. At least some pogroms are believed to have been organized or supported by the Russian <a href="../../../o/k/h/Okhranka.html" title="Okhranka">okhranka</a>. Although there is no hard evidence for this, the Russian police and army generally displayed indifference to the pogroms, for instance during the three-day <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kishinev_pogrom.html" title="Kishinev pogrom">First Kishinev pogrom</a> of 1903.</p>
<p>During this period the <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_Laws_5076.html" title="May Laws">May Laws</a> policy was also put into effect, banning Jews from rural areas and towns, and placing strict quotas on the number of Jews allowed into higher education and many professions. The combination of the repressive legislation and pogroms propelled mass Jewish emigration, and by 1920 more than two million Russian Jews had emigrated, most to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> while some made <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliya.html" title="Aliya">aliya</a> to the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most infamous antisemitic tractates was the Russian okhranka literary <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a></i>, created in order to blame the Jews for Russia's problems during the period of revolutionary activity.</p>
<p>Even though many <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Bolsheviks_c332.html" title="Old Bolsheviks">Old Bolsheviks</a> were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot Judaism and Zionism and established the <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevsektsiya.html" title="Yevsektsiya">Yevsektsiya</a> to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s the Communist leadership of the former USSR had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, including Yevsektsiya.</p>

<p>Unofficial antisemitism was also widespread in the first half of the century. For example, to limit the growing number of Jewish students between 1919-1950s a number of private liberal arts universities and medical and dental schools employed <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerus_clausus.html#Numerus_clausus_in_the_United_States" title="Numerus clausus">Numerus clausus</a>.

This was soon copied by other Ivy League and other schools, and admissions of Jews were kept down to 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were for the most part discarded during the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Some <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cults.html" title="Cults">cults</a> also support conspiracy theories regarding Jews as dominating and taking over the world.

<p>In Roman times about 10,000 Jews lived at <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, governed by an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnarch.html" title="Ethnarch">ethnarch</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[49]</a></sup> During the conflicts between the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantines.html" title="Byzantines">Byzantines</a> and the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> the city frequently suffered heavily. When Syria was conquered by the Persians (614), the Jews of Damascus, profiting by the presence of the invaders, joined with their coreligionists of Palestine to take vengeance on the Christians, especially those of <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyre.html" title="Tyre">Tyre</a>. During the Cursades, a large number of Palestinian Jews sought refuge at Damascus from the enormous taxes imposed upon them by the Crusaders, thus increasing the community.</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century the Jews of Damascus were several times made the victims of calumnies, the gravest being those of 1840 and 1860, in the reign of the sultan <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abd%C3%BClmecit.html" title="Abdülmecit">Abdülmecit</a>. That of 1840, commonly known as the <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus_affair.html" title="Damascus affair">Damascus affair</a>, was an accusation of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel_against_Jews_e798.html" title="Blood libel against Jews">ritual murder</a> brought against the Jews in connection with the death of Father Thomas.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[50]</a></sup> A Jewish barber was tortured until he "confessed"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. The second accusation brought against the Jews, in 1860, was that of having taken part in the massacre of the Christians by the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druze.html" title="Druze">Druze</a> and the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>. Five hundred Muslims, who had been involved in the affair, were hanged by the grand vizier <a href="../../../k/e/%C3%A7/Ke%C3%A7ecizade_Mehmet_Fuat_Pasha_124b.html" title="Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha">Fuad Pasha</a>. Two hundred Jews were awaiting the same fate, in spite of their innocence, and the whole Jewish community had been fined 4,000,000 piastres.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[51]</a></sup> The condemned Jews were saved only by the official intervention of Fuad Pasha himself; that of the Prussian consul, Dr. Wetzstein; of Sir <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_Montefiore_2f9b.html" title="Moses Montefiore">Moses Montefiore</a> of London, and of the bankers <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Salomon_Camondo_227c.html" title="Abraham Salomon Camondo">Abraham Salomon Camondo</a> of Constantinople and Shemaya Angel of Damascus. From that time to the end of the nineteenth century, several further blood accusations were brought against the Jews; these, however, never provoked any great excitement.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert179_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilbert179" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

Today, anti-Semitism and belief in Jewish manipulation of Japan and the world remains despite the small size of the Jewish community in Japan. Books about Jewish conspiracies are best sellers. According to a 1988 survey, 8% of Japanese had read one of these books.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
