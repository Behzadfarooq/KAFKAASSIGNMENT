	    <p>About (aka WHY Hate Neopets?!!!11one?!?1)</p>
<p>(written by Mae Noelle)</p>
<p>Why do we hate Neopets, you ask? Well, many reasons... one being that that site used to be one of the coolest on the web, a place where we could go to have fun, but now... now they have become socialistic-near-communistic (literally!) tyrannical oppressive jerks. The site is no fun anymore. *but it's not our site to begin with! It's their site, they can do whatever they want* WRONG! That site is now property of about a million people world wide. They have a company. A millionaire owner. They have clothing lines. That ain't a one-stop little mini-business anymore.</p>
<p>It's NOT FREE?!?!. Guess what? Neopets as we knew it now costs money. FOMG!! Says you, "BUT I JUST SIGNED UP FOR FREE YESTERDAY!!!" .... yes, it's NEOPETS PREMIUM that costs the money. "BUT THATS NOT NEOPETS!!!!!" says you. ... yes, it is. The neopets that you sign up for now is but a shadow of the real neopets, the neopets we used to be able to get for free. They've limited EVERYTHING, neomails, petpages, random events, etc etc etc... and now they're offering it all for MONEY. Real money. That you have to give neopets. So what you're getting for free is like a sample, demo, crap version... And it won't stop there. BELIEVE me. TRUST me, later on, this will get WORSE. Apparently, this new thing is an ISP, (like a window thing, kindof like AOL, but neopet-ized) and that's how you get the neopets mail address and toolbar and neopet portal (a page with all the links on neopets on one page)... but they indeed will offer avatars later, and you supposedly get 2 times the random events, free neopoints, etc etc... AND LOOK AT THIS!</p>
<p>{QUOTE}"Provider may publish User's name and other consumer information in one or more directories that may be accessed by other Internet users. In addition (...) Provider may make such information available to third parties from time to time. User understands further that merchants on the Internet may have access to such information and may make it available to third parties in accordance with their normal practices." {/QUOTE}</p>
<p>This is from their TOS or something, buried deep down, I'll find the link later - but if you don't understand, it means that if you use a credit card, your number will be available out there. Neopets is SELLING your info OUT. That's called unsafe, no privacy, should-be-illegal, etc...</p>
<p>Rules? Why all the rules? What are they playing at? We can't even link out of neopets anymore - like, before, we used to be able to put pictures onto our shops, and link them to the place where the pictures came from. But not anymore! (they say it is because they don't want all the idiots accidentally getting linked to a 'fake' neopets l0g&#160;!n page, where they will unwittingly give the fake-neopets-page-maker their PW - but we know better. It is another form of CONTROL! They only want neopets things, period)</p>
<p>We can't do anything, as we must protect and shelter the 9 year old freaks running around, who also happen to be the ones BREAKING ALL THE RULES. (I've long said Neopets should just have a freaking age limit, or block 13 and under from the chat room if it is so damn (&lt;-- exercising my right to swear) offensive)</p>
<p>FREEZING. Dear GOD! How many of you have been frozen, then? How many don't know why? How many know why, but know you have nothing to do with what they claimed? How many were absolutely asinine reasons? We've all been frozen at least once. If some stranger is reading this, then perhaps you were lucky - do you go on your account a lot? Do you go on the chat at all? Are you a Liberal Democrat? Quiet? If so, most likely you don't have the same target marks on you as the rest of us. REMEMBER - they have the power to freeze you. Yes. They can do whatever they want. They do. But it's not just that - it's that they'll freeze you, and not the other 1000 who did the same thing, too. They can MAKE rules to FIT the situation, if they want you frozen. Almost EVERYTHING is a freezable offense, it's just about if you're seen, and if the mods/TNT are in a good mood, and if they want you gone.</p>
<p>Games. I can't be the only person irritated by them. They are all copies of original games, for one. Most of them $uk. But that's not the reason... they are getting progressively harder and harder to do, and are giving you LESS and LESS and LESS gold, while the price of everything else around you rises drastically. (Just a little odd, I think. Almost like they WANT you to do more to get the same amount of gold, and be more addicted...) They've even limited it, so that if you do find a good game, you can only earn 1000np max, and we all know that's pretty much NOTHING. Sure, some people have things to cheat, but they can be spotted so freaking easily, and frozen. Neopets just likes to take everything out and make it harder for everyone.</p>
<p>Neo-mails. You can't say anything in a 'neo-mail' anymore - If I put an asterisk (*) in a neo-mail, it says that I was trying to swear without swearing, and won't let me do anything. And, of course, anything slightly SOUNDING political, religious, se+ual, or just plain wrong is blocked out of neomails. You can't even send a decent sized one anymore. Not posting some of that stuff all over the chats and site may be slightly reasonable from a socialistic point of view, but not being able to utter it in your own private confines with friends? What's WRONG with them?! We have no liberty! We have nothing! They're taking it all away and making it all butterflies and ugly pets!</p>
<p>Religion. Mentioning God now is worthy of a few official warnings, though talking about satanic rituals is alright (they have to respect everyoneâ€™s culture)... sad, sad truth, people... Just like American high school now... Sure, they stir up conflicts. But this WORLD has conflicts. It's real life. The outside is NOT daisies and rainbows and brightly colored fake looking cute pets. There's even fights on neopets without these topics. Does Neopets really think they can create a perfect utopia? Do they really think they can control everything? They could at the very least make a separate board for it, with warning labels ALL over it saying 'DANGER! DON'T GO IN HERE! YOUR VIEWS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT AND YOUR PERFECT WORLD MIGHT BE SHATTERED BY REALITY!! DANGERDANGERDANGER!!!' ... or just make it so that 13 and under can't get in. Kids will lie and change their age; but at that point it's their fault and their parents problem, not the sites.</p>
<p>Message Boards! (Argh!) What can I say? They're CRAP. You can't post anything, because you SHOULD get frozen for spam/anything inappropriate (Neopets definition of innapropriate changes - no profanity, but damn and hell are ok because they want to say it, no death, birth, blood, etc etc, but promotional games earning them money with trivia on it about Se+ually transmitted diseases and puberty are ok...) or anything else. ... There used to be a General Chat, and most of the n00bs and idiots and spammers posted there. It was deleted, because the TNT are paranoid control freaks who must try to make everything a certain way, and so the n00bs spread EVERYWHERE, and now the ENTIRE chatboard is one big n00b fest, with not a serious post anywhere, filled with '(.)(.)' topics and 'FOMG&#160;:)' topics and 'EVENESENSE RULZ' topics, and neopets does NOTHING. I hate the avatars. It's just for the rich people, another thing to separate the rich from the dead poor. They've already got a million things to collect, neggs, other items, cards, stamps, battle items, neohome, stats, etc etc....</p>
<p>MERCHANDISE. Dear LORD! I hate the merchandise! There's SO much of it, and it's all so crappy and overpriced. (Yes, the plushies are cute... but the clothes? The jewelry? The stickers? The lunchboxes? The sheets? The Card Game? The BoardGame?) ... There's no point! They need to keep this a web community, dammit. They need to improve on the things that are lacking before they make merchandise to exploit it! And they put that stupid 'FOMG SPEND 10$ AND GET 500 NEOPOINTS!!' thing all over them, KNOWING the obsessed Neopians will RUN and buy as much as possible! THAT, my friends, is EXPLOITATION! That, my friends, is WRONG! Yes, they need money to work, but with all those ads and sponsors and items and the movie and everything, there's no WAY they need MORE! I thought this was all about THE FUN? All about THE USERS? Well NO I guess it's NOT, then, is it?! They're USING their users, dammit! And the addicted people can't or don't want to see this. And they are making a NEOPETS MOVIE now too! Dear GOD... I'm terribly afraid.</p>
<p>Ads. Dear god, they're EVERYWHERE! Neopets is one gigantic freaking money machine. There's no way they don't have enough staff to fix things or the money to - they got card games, tshirts and toys that have 'FREE NEOPET ITEM' tags inserted, so EVERYONE will buy them... they got ads GAMES ads in their NEWS ads that are ITEMS... Jeebus.... And what makes it worse is you only get 50-500np for clicking on this stuff. How fair is this? Really, 5000g is practically nothing. I want THAT amount of gold for clicking on stuff that's going to send neopets money.</p>
