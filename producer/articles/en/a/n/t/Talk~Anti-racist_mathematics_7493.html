<p>The anti-RACIST Mathematics phrase gets more attention. But BIAS has probably occurred far more often in the Politics of Mathematics than has racism. This is just a point worth making on Wikipedia - afterall, how does anyone know what mathematics is without knowing how it's really practiced?</p>
<p>Perhaps the site could be renamed with the race part being a subsection, with the usual subsection diverts? It depends upon your position on such matters, of course. <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrASingh_d32e.html" title="User:MrASingh">MrASingh</a> 20:42, 11 Feb 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I just posted a bunch of other criticisms below, but I can't resist one final clarification. Fundamentally, very little of this seems to have anything to do with mathematics, and most of it appears to have to do with the <i>instruction</i> of mathematics. Fair grading, fair instruction, naming theories in non-biased ways--none of this has to do with math. The theory <i>name</i> is not math; the <i>theory</i> is math, and it is either true or not true. As I said earlier (below), it seems inherently very difficult for an encyclopedia--a repository of knowledge--to embrace the notion of subjective truth or relativism (even an encyclopedia that's a wiki), yet that is the only portion of "anti-racist mathematics" that could have anything to do with mathematics. All the rest could quite well be lumped into an article labeled "anti-racist mathematics teaching."</dd>

<p><i>The avoidance of racial stereotypes or cultural bias in classroom materials, textbooks, coursework topics and examination questions.</i> How can classroom materials be culturally biased? 127.0.0.1 00:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The next two paragraphs don't explicitly answer your question&#160;:</p>
<p>Nobody is stating that mathematics is intrinsically racist (so textbook questions don't discriminate on the grounds of race - and often don't if exam marks are anything to go by).</p>
<p>The next point worth making is that, even in the case of exam papers and questions, it is highly likely that machine marked questions will provide a better (ie: more objective) indicator of ability than human marked questions (a good way to determine this is to carry out a study that shows how different rankings are achieved by humans that might mark written scripts, and compare this to how machines generate different rankings).</p>
<p>Now to answer your question. The obvious <i>history of mathematics</i> part (ie: Mr {insert name of white mathematician that we should all grovel before, certainly if we are not white), invented such and such a mathematical function (which is obvious anyhow, but wasn't obvious at the time). This shounds like 'cultural bias'. Of course it may be true (I'm not a revisionist), but is it necessary for study? <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrASingh_d32e.html" title="User:MrASingh">MrASingh</a> 20:42, 11 Feb 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has one great big flaw. It does not give one single example of what it is talking about. Not one of the links (that I have tried) provides any examples. It does not define "anti racist mathematics".</p>
<p>Frankly, it is the kind of fancy footwork wording I use when I use my university education to have fun running verbal circles around my high school granddaughter.</p>

<p>I response to the above individuals (clearly mistaken) banterings, nominating this article for deletion would be wholly inappropriate. It is interesting, however, that a mathematician should complain about “fancy [verbal] footwork” when responding to criticism of racism in mathematics (as a symptom of an inherently racist society – for example, the US or the UK). But, when given even more opportunities to do so, does not complain about the self-same (and, may I add, even more blatant) verbal footwork in the mathematical publications that he/she is all to happy to use as a convenient excuse for their over inflated pay-packets. May I advise that, when someone tells you the truth, you think before you criticise it? Or would a white mathematician be all to happy to say that mathematics (and truth with it) are white? Certainly this is something that the white race is all too happy to do in newspapers and the media - if not society in general.</p>

<p>A NPOV article should not begin with criticism. Therefore, I've taken the pro-anti-racist remarks out of the criticism section and moved them into a new section 1.</p>
<p>We also need some examples of racist mathematics, but I can't think of any, except for the joke about word problems and how they have evolved over the years.</p>
<p>I, for one, found this article very interesting, in its description of a real (if misguided) movement in math ed. When I get out to school, where my references are, I'm going to add some examples from a "multi-cultural" algebra text, which teaches that, for example, people in the South Sea Islands were able to discover facts about the solar system unknown to scientists, but which teaches little or no algebra.</p>
<p>I note that the quote from an anti-racist scholar also uses anti-racist capitalization. (Is Eats, Shoots and Leaves racist?)</p>

<p>I'm rather confused by this. I still have no idea what 'anti-racist' mathematics is or how it differs in practice from ordinary (racist?) mathematics. What are its principles? How does the school in question teach anti-racism in maths? Does this mean that there are history components pointing to the contributionss of Arabs and Indians? Does it mean that 'non-western' traditions or notations are taught? What? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 11 Feb 2005, 14.30, UTC</p>
<p>Yeah what is this? This sounds like the dumbest theory someone's ever come up with has been given its own article. What's the basis for thinking this, for example? Come on- with that many sources cited <i>someone</i> has to have explained it.</p>
<p>Localperson118 22:31, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wait... surely this is a BJAODN. "Critics maintain that science, and especially hard science fields such as physics, biology, and mathematics, reflect scientific universals, as opposed to cultural interpretations, i.e. the laws of gravity are the same independent of which cultural region or background an individual descends from." That can't possibly be real. No one, no matter how PC they are, can possibly believe that the laws of gravity would be different for a black man. Localperson118 22:31, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I edited the article to make it clearer that proponents for this line of thinking, such as Sandra Harding, are not necessarily arguing that gravity itself is socially constructed, only that our conceptions and theories about gravity are socially constructed (and contain biases). That being said, some extreme <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativist.html" title="Relativist">relativists</a> may believe our actual relationship with gravity contains socially constructed features. That would be a view that diverges drastically from scientific theory, but this kind of extreme relativism may be popular in different forms. For example, the popular movie <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What_the_bleep_do_we_know.html" title="What the bleep do we know">What the bleep do we know</a></i> appears to contain relativist views regarding physics that conflict with mainstream scientific opinion. Note that the movie features a number of scientists and academics who, while holding views that conflict significantly with most of the rest of academics in their field, appear to hold normal positions at prominent universities. Finally, keep in mind that anti-racist math's line of thought is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativist.html" title="Relativist">relativist</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructivist.html" title="Constructivist">constructivist</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodern.html" title="Postmodern">postmodern</a> theory. These schools of thought may not have the same relationship with science that the rest of the intellectual tradition has.</dd>

<p>Ok. Anti-racism is one thing, and it is potentially a good thing. Incorporating these views into a mathematics class to such a degree that the mathematics is apparently lost, however, is clearly going too far. If you're going to teach mathematics...teach mathematics! x^2+y^2=1 is the formula for the unit circle, plain and simple. Social studies needs some of this focus, however. <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax_1d8a.html" title="User:Pax">Pax</a> 17:59, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This sort of a concept is real - google returns over a hundred hits. (Many are Wikipedia mirrors or term paper sales sites, but there <i>is</i> actual discussion of this concept outside of Wikipedia.) Some people really do believe that mathematics, the way it is normally taught in schools, is inherantly and subtly racist. There are all sorts of theories as to whether it's straight lines in geometry, for instance, or the substitution of variables in algebra that has a cultural bias. This sounds bizarre to many of you, and I have no doubt that this will turn out to be fruitless area of research. But there it is.</p>
<p>This strange concept is a direct result of rejecting the idea that average intelligence differs between members of different racial groups. (See <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>.) If you take as an article of faith that there is no difference between the average innate mathematical <i>ability</i> among white children and black children, and you notice a difference in average math <i>scores</i>, then you have to attribute that to something. Imagine that you teach math, and you know you're not being subtly prejudiced against the black students, but your white students consistently average 85% and your black students average 75%, even when you only look at kids with the same positive family life and the same socio-economic background. (This is quite typical). You want to know why. There are only two possibilities: either white student are more likely to be good at math, or the entire concept of math, the way you teach it, is subtly and systemically biased toward white kids. Many teachers and researchers in America categorically reject the first possibility, and so we get stuck with the second explanation. There's really not a way around this; until we can accept the first possibility (which is difficult, given our nation's history), we won't have a reasonable way of dealing with the persistant differences in test scores. So you get this sort of thing. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_sleuthing_a075.html" title="Wikipedia:Image sleuthing">sleuth</a>)</sup> 16:37, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I think any attempt to try and present the anti-racist mathematics folks' viewpoints is going to fail. Simply for the reason that they don't understand mathematics and have no idea what they are criticising. I've never found arguments about the inherent racism of "western mathematics" nor arguments that this obstructs learning by members of minority groups convincing at all. I think proponents haven't really focused on arguing this, just accepting it as fact and making political arguments.</p>
<p>Note that I am not against ethnomathematics in general...but those that charge racism are undoubtedly only a part of the ethnomathematics community. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 22:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The book "Science Question in Feminism" by Sandra G. Harding is a sort of precursor to all this. It contains the following explanatory quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If we are not willing to try to see the favored intellectual structures and practices of science as cultural artifacts rather than as sacred commandments handed down to humanity at the birth of modern science, then it will be hard to understand how gender symbolism, the gendered social structure of science, and the masculine identities and behaviors of individual scientists have left their marks on the problematics, concepts, theories, methods, interpretations, ethics, meanings, and goals of science.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That's a chewey sentence to parse, but the gist is that "intellectual structures and practices of science" are "cultural artifacts", not laws of nature, and sexism has affected the "concepts, theories, methods. . . and goals of science."</p>
<p>Anti-racist math is sometimes called ethnomathematics, and proponants sometimes call themselves ethnomathematicians. And here is the <a href="http://www.ethnomath.org/search/browse.asp?type=subject" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnomath.org/search/browse.asp?type=subject" rel="nofollow">Ethnomathematics Digital Library</a>. And <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0435083732/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0435083732/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a book on the topic. It seems to teach a sort of sociology and history of math along with math concepts. You learn addition, but you learn how different indiginous cultures taught addition. It also focuses on visual math (7 X 9 is a rectangle 7 dots wide and 9 dots deep), rather than numerical math.</p>
<dl>
<dd>that last is obviously a good thing. Considering how badly math is taught in the US, maybe a dollop of anti-racist math is just what we need -- if judiciously applied.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's a word from a detractor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The practical effect," Klein says, "has been watered-down math books that overemphasize inductive reasoning (like continuing visual patterns), because this is supposed to be good for women and minorities, and de-emphasizing deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs, which is the heart of mathematics, because that supposedly favors white males. . . ."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's a quote that might help, from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,146684,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,146684,00.html" rel="nofollow">a poorly-written news story</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I think of [multicultural education] as a set of practices that confront the various forms of racism and institutionalized racisms that do exist in schools, as well as the larger society, and thinking of ways of breaking down and deconstructing forms of racism," Christine Sleeter, professor emeritus at California State University at Monterey Bay and co-editor of "Multicultural Education, Critical Pedagogy, and the Politics of Difference," said. "I think that a whole lot of people are fumbling around with, 'what are the issues?'"</dd>
<dd>"One of the ways I would apply anti-racist education to math is to ask, 'why is it that, generally speaking, white kids get better access to upper-level math learning than low-income kids and kids of color?'" Sleeter said. "[And] in what ways might math and science serve as tools for understanding and dealing with various social issues?"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%2C_Massachusetts_3bfc.html" title="Newton, Massachusetts">Newton, Massachusetts</a> got some unwanted publicity when re-writing their math curriculum. They were already in a bit of a bind because black students were failing at a higher rate than white students, and charges of racism were being directed at the school. So the new math curriculum was written to emphasize "Newton's commitment to active anti-racist education". The first priority for the class was listed as "Respect for Human Differences - students will live out the system wide core of 'Respect for Human Differences' by demonstrating anti-racist/anti-bias behaviors. Students will: Consistently analyze their experiences and the curriculum for bias and discrimination; Take effective anti-bias action when bias or discrimination is identified; Work with people of different backgrounds and tell how the experience affected them; Demonstrate how their membership in different groups has advantages and disadvantages that affect how they see the world and the way they are perceived by others..." Priority two was actually teaching math.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the conservative press went into a feeding-frenzy over this. (It's a story that makes Massachusetts liberals look really dumb.) Newton insists that teaching math was always the first priority of math class, despite what the curiculum said, and they chalk it up to an anti-liberal witch-hunt.</p>

<p>We don't get to choose what fields of study choose to call themselves. At Columbia University, studies of homosexuality are called "Queer Studies". That name seems as strange to me as "Anti-racist mathematics" does, but that is how they self-identify, and so their preference needs to be respected.

<p>I reverted Sam Spade's revert as there were several problems with his edit. For one, he cites two sources to backup the statement that anti-racist mathematical curriculum reduces test scores. But only the first gives any info to support the claim. The second, while a very interesting article, stays neutral on many of the discussed topics, including whether reformed curriculum such as TERC is bad, etc. It comments on declining test scores but comments that culture may be most important. It comments briefly on the first cite (and reproduces that article in its entirety) but does not say much additional info beyond an affirmation of it.</p>
<p>But finally and most important, NPOV means we should not accept these commentators' opinions as fact and blanketly assert that something has been "shown" when it is controversial. First, we should get more solid citations than the ones given to support such a claim; actual studies, rather than investigative journalism should be preferred here. And secondly, unless the evidence against is overwhelming (which really doesn't appear to be the case so far, although I agree with the cited articles), such criticism should not be mentioned so prominently in the introduction. There's already a pretty good section on criticism. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:39, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article does not mention which racial groups traditional "Western" math is biased against. It cannot possibly be the view of anti-racist math proponents that it is biased against all "non-Westerners"? It does not seem to be biased against Koreans and Japanese anyway: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/daily/graphics/math_120704.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/daily/graphics/math_120704.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --Fluude 12:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly, you are commenting upon mathematicians *in Korea and Japan*. The article is generally focused on the US and UK as follows : "Anti-racist mathematics is a branch of education reform theory in countries such as the U.S. and the UK, which attempts to form an anti-bias curriculum in mathematics. "</p>
<p>Secondly, the test referred to in the scores given has not been put online (thus, there is the potential that the test is biased, or that it only tests specific problem-solving abilities, etc...). The test also refers to 15 year olds only, so it doesn't show up what is happening to students *after* that time - most fields medalists/nobel prize winners/technologically competent scientists and engineers (in the military, etc....) would probably 'come to fruition' at a later age.</p>
<p>Thirdly, mathematics is probably taught very differently in those countries than in the US (one would hope there's less politics and a more 'socialistic' treatment of mathematicians that relies more on objective mathematical assessment than blagging ability).</p>
<p>These are points straight off the top of my head. There are obviously many more.</p>

<p>I am back at point 7 of this discussion page. (The article was recently translated in French, and I discovered it on the fr Wikipedia).</p>
<p>In this section, I could notice a rough answer by <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectarflowed</a> <i>«The title reflects the name used for the scholarly field.»</i>, sustained by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> : <i>«At Columbia University, studies of homosexuality are called "Queer Studies".»</i>, which seems quite irrelevant.</p>
<p>At least two users, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> have strongly put Nectarflowed's assertion in doubt, but received no proof of it.</p>
<p>Having a look at the bibliography at the end of the article, I notice that at least the first two items don't use "anti-racist mathematics" but "anti-racist mathematics teaching" (where anti-racist may apply to "teaching", which seems much less odd).</p>
<p>If no strong and sourced opposition arises, I shall modify the title of this page to "Anti-racist mathematics teaching" in a few days from now. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a> 19:42, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be better. Mathematics is never racist, so applying "anti-racist" to it seems silly. Teaching can, of couse, convey most sorts of biases. <a href="../../../c/r/g/User%7ECRGreathouse_d93e.html" title="User:CRGreathouse">CRGreathouse</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/g/User_talk%7ECRGreathouse_a2c7.html" title="User talk:CRGreathouse">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CRGreathouse_ecde.html" title="Special:Contributions/CRGreathouse">c</a>)</small> 20:48, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Would a renaming of the article sound better? I don't think that renaming the article is suitable at all. To take CRGreathouse's statement to an extreme - mathematics is one thing that is completely separated from the way that it's taught and socially practiced. Any working mathematicians knows that this is quite untrue (aside from, perhaps, the case of Godel, who locked himself up in a room and starved himself to death due to an extreme paranoia towards all things European - probably including himself...). It is possible for mathematicians to (conceivably) do mathematics without any actual social component (automated theorem proving is a budding area in these regards). However, I don't see how it is that this would in anyway be a suitable method of *teaching* mathematics.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To re-iterate my point, an separating the mathematics from the way that it's practised is a VERY odd thing to do. --AnonymousButSensible 14:33, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first two sentences of the section Context are weird:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anti-racist mathematics is part of a larger social constructivist movement in which traditional Western or scientific world views were developed within the context of a Judeo–Christian Western culture or set of cultures.</li>
<li>Anti-racist educators suggest that these assumptions are dominant because of the abuse of political power.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sentence 1 says that anti-racist mathematics was part of the development of traditional Western views in the context of Judeo–Christian Western culture, or something like that. There are too many "or"s in the sentence to really figure out what the claim is, but in any case, this is almost the opposite of what (presumably) is intended, namely that anti-racist mathematics was developped <i>in opposition to</i> such traditional Western views. Then sentence 2 speaks of "these assumptions". But the first sentence does not refer to any assumptions? So what assumptions are these? There is no antecedent, and lacking further information it could many anything. Also, in the clause "because of the abuse of political power", it is completely unspecified who are abusing this power. Is this writing part of an attempt of opponents of "anti-racist mathematics", whatever that may be (the article is extremely vague and uninformative) to make it appear bad?  --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article needs to do a better job of explaining exactly what anti-racist mathematics is. How is it different from normal ("racist"?) math. I really don't understand how anyone, no matter how liberal they are, could actually believe that math is racist. <a href="../../../p/r/b/User%7EPrb4_b9a7.html" title="User:Prb4">Prb4</a> 6:02:52 February 13 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I (fairly liberal by US standards) wholly agree. There's nothing in here that explains what this actually is in the context of math (the four bullet points explain how one would avoid bias in teaching the history of math (the first bullet) and in coaching and grading students (the latter three), but not how one would avoid bias--or even what form that bias would take--in mathematics itself).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I realize that this article has been voted to be retained, but without a significant cleanup, I recommend at the very least that it be renamed something like "anti-racist math <i>teaching</i>", as that seems to be what this is really about--how to teach math without introducing racism. And why the hell that's notable or encyclopedic beats me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, one particular nitpick, this following line in "Criticism" is totally inappropriate. The Criticism section is not the place for responses <i>to</i> criticism; it's the place to list criticism.
<dl>
<dd>However, critics would have to accept that the methods and means needed to freely study and evaluate mathematics and science are usually politically and socially manipulated in favour of certain groups (as, for example, cars are distributed in a discriminatory way, so are scientific resources that are involved with them).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I, if I can be said to be a critic, would <i>not</i> accept that. It's just not relevant to the preceding criticism. These facts are indeed objective facts, and how the resources to study them were (perhaps unfairly) allocated simply is a non sequitur.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Granted, I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve here--I readily admit that the entire concept strikes me as absurd, and the lack of any substantial <i>mathematical</i> content makes me doubt the qualifications of those complaining here (in that, for instance, no actual alternate names for theorems or constructs are proposed--I couldn't care less if you want to rename them from their Western-mathematician-honoring-names, but without proposing new names that will be universally accepted by mathematicians of all cultures and races, what's the point in talking about it?)--but more to the point, this article seems highly un-encyclopedic; it makes Wikipedia something of a laughingstock (not that I feel beholden to Conservopedia, but some of their criticisms, while perhaps not showing an evil <i>Liberal</i> bias, do show at the very least a lack of good quality entries on some topics); quite simply this article, without a major cleanup, doesn't appear to show anything significant, noteworthy, or useful.</dd>

<p>Reading the article, I found that dividing up the general thread of anti-racist mathematics beneficial. I came up with 4 sub-topics, which might help focus criticism and defence if incorporated into the main article:</p>
<p>(1)anti-racist mathematics as the active removal of bias from within math curricula, particularly, racist or culturally specific word problems.</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>(2)anti-racist mathematics as the effort to balance coverage of historical developments in mathematics across cultures/races. It has been argued that removing all historical / sociological information from math materials would solve this problem of balancing.</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>(3)anti-racist mathematics as a movement to ensure a non-racist or anti-racist classroom environment for learning ma.</p>
<p>and finally</p>
<p>(4)anti-racist mathematics as a movement to do away with, or at least challenge the primacy of, actual mathematical representation and operation systems, and recognizing the current work done in math as racially biased.</p>
<p>I think it would be useful to make these distinctions because, while I agree with 1, with 2 insofar as I think history of math does not improve understanding of math and should be removed from math clas, and with 3, although this is more an issue with inherent racisism within society / school and has very little to do with math, I disagree with 4. It seems that most people on this discussion page also disagree with this 4th category, and, taking it to be the entirety of the arguement, are against anti-racist math.</p>

<dl>
<dd>My confusion is that "anti-racist math" would seem to imply number 4 in your list, while most (all?) of the article appears to be about the first three. The thing is, the first three aren't really mathematics; they could be aptly summed under "anti-racist history" (history of mathematics) or "anti-racist teaching." Both have value, and I suspect most people here agree on that point, but neither have anything to do with <i>mathematics</i>. The article should clearly stay, as it's a term relatively widely used, but as-is, it reads as a bit POV (to say the least!), and devotes a lot of attention to something that appears not to warrant it. <i>Anti-racist mathematics</i> is a <i>term</i> used to refer to the first three, perhaps (at least, this article makes it sound that way); there seems to be no discussion of how the <i>mathematics</i> itself can be <i>anti-racist</i> or <i>racist</i> (which renders the article pretty much useless).</dd>

<p>I just contested a proposal for deletion, but forgot to write why in my edit summary. In brief, I see no reason that the previous AFD verdict was not valid, and there seems to be plenty of talk about this topic around the internet, including a lot of credible sources. I tend to agree that the concept itself is a little flaky, but if that was a valid criterion for deletion I could take out two thirds of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 21:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is really complete nonsense, and not really the normal kind of article we have on Wikipedia. Besides from this article nobody can really know what is meant by racist mathematics? If you decide to keep it why don't you make an article on racist mathematics?</dd>

<dd>I agree that there's some underlying incoherence in the whole philosophy, but I'm not here to defend the philosophy, I'm here to defend the idea that the philosophy is notable enough to deserve a Wikipedia article. In any event, if you want to debate its deletion, here isn't the place - AFD it if you want, bearing in mind that the last AFD on this article resulted in a near-unanimous keep. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 08:10, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
