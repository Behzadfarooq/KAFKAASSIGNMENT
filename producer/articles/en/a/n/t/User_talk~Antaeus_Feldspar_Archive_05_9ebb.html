<p>Hi, sorry to hear you haven't been well. Speedy recovery. In relation to an earlier discussion on the (R)CC page, you may wish to have a look at this <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_dd27.html#More_capitalisation:_.22the_Church.22_vs._.22the_church.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style">MoS comment</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:39, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comment at Talk:Scientology_controversy</span></h2>
<p>Hi: It is my opinion that you are doing good work at the controversial <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology_controversy</a> page. GodHelpWiki is very upset about the contents of the page. It seems that we both disagree with much of what he says. That said, however, I do think that the tone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScientology_controversy&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12755382" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScientology_controversy&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12755382" rel="nofollow">your last response to him</a> was rather harsh in tone. "Well, then, clearly you don't know as much about Wikipedia as you think you do" could be taken as an implication that s/he is stupid (given the anger/hurt s/he already shows). The "clearly" is what makes it seem so pointed. "It seems to be one of many things you still don't understand" is similar; with "many" as the barb. I do not think think that your suggestion that s/he has not read what is being written is likely to make him/her any more amenable. Please would you consider rephrasing your response to soften it and to encourage constructive discussion? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 16:23, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Antaeus, I felt you were a little unfair in the way you responded to <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> regarding <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExplain_significance_fb39.html" title="Template:Explain significance">Template:Explain significance</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AExplain_significance&amp;diff=13768070&amp;oldid=13767092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AExplain_significance&amp;diff=13768070&amp;oldid=13767092" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I share your evident frustration over the amount of rubbish we often have to deal with, and I also know that it's annoying to have templates edited (I've had a couple of mine changed), but on the other hand, Grace Note's edit was quite reasonable and introduced only a subtle (but arguably important) change of tone. Perhaps a compromise text could be worked out. Anyway, I hope you don't mind me expressing my view here. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:04, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but Grace Note's editing made two changes:
<ul>
<li>It removed the completely factual information that articles which make readers say, "So... why is this subject worth reading about, again?" do regularly get nominated for deletion (and as we both know, frequently wind up deleted once there.)</li>
<li>It inserted the suggestion to simply remove the tag "if you feel this ... is not necessary."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Both of those are more than a subtle change of tone. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 11:39, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so. It still asks for extra information on "significance" (without pretending it's anything other than one editor's opinion that it does) and it still mentions that it might be nominated for deletion. I think it's only fair to point out to new users that they can remove a tag if they don't feel it's necessary. You and I know that's the case, because we are bold enough to make changes when we simply differ in opinion, but a newer editor might be intimidated. I'll give you an example: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a> might be a world-leading widget scientist, and the stub might say so. How can you further explain his significance? He's significant because he's a world leader in widgets. That might seem plain to me and not plain to you. So you tag it because you think widget scientists are not "notable" and I remove it because I think they are. Okay? No big deal. We differ in opinion. But I think the template needs to make that freedom to differ in opinion explicit. Otherwise, you get what I've had with other templates: you can't remove it once I've put it there. Well, yes, you can. They're like any other edit. If the subject of a vanity page removes it, or its author, there are other means to keep it there. You can write to the author, explain the use of the template and ask them to leave it. Explain that it's meant to help, not hurt. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:44, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine. I'll still note that it is one of a <i>very</i> small number of tags which invite the reader to completely dismiss the concern that it represents. And based on my experience, new editors generally <i>don't</i> need encouragement to dismiss the concerns raised by more experienced editors -- what they much more often need is encouragement to take such concerns <i>seriously</i>, and realize that maybe some of the assumptions they're under regarding Wikipedia aren't the way Wikipedia actually works.</dd>

<dd>Your example of: John Smith is a world-leading widget scientist; the stub says so; Editor X puts on the tag because he doesn't think that even the world's single most notable widget scientist is notable -- sure, it's easy to follow that example, and it shows why it would be a Good Thing for the tag to suggest "remove me if I'm not necessary and the person who thinks I am is wrong!" But let me offer two counter-examples:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Newcomer Y hears a <i>little</i> bit about Wikipedia, and proving the adage that "a <i>little</i> knowledge is a dangerous thing", decides that this must be the most fabulous idea of all time: if they let <i>anyone</i> edit <i>any</i> page, it's going to be a <i>great</i> place to tell everyone how great and cool his lunchtable gang at his high school is! The tag goes on the article, but it suggests "remove this tag if it's not necessary." Newcomer Y still hasn't gotten the idea that the "-pedia" in Wikipedia means that we are aiming for an open-content encyclopedia, rather than something closer to a graffiti wall, and so the minute he sees "if it's not necessary," the possibility that it <i>might be</i> necessary is already gone from his mind. He chucks the tag, because who is anyone on Wikipedia to judge whether his social clique is "significant" or not? They don't even know his social clique, because they don't go to his high school!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Newcomer Z hears about Wikipedia, and wonders if they have a page about his favorite band, the Mudskippers. When he finds out that they don't, he happily sets to work preparing one, including all sorts of biographical details that will surely be of interest to any true Mudskippers fan, like why Mark always wears that stocking cap on stage and why Kevin, the guitarist, will never use any brand of strings except Champion. Someone puts the tag on the article and when Newcomer Z sees it, he steps back and for the first time sees the article from the perspective of someone who <i>isn't</i> already a Mudskippers fan. "Oh!" he says. "Why are they notable? Uh... well, they're signed to one of the major indie labels, and their music is starting to get used in commercials and TV shows... I should probably put that in the article, shouldn't I?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now between those two sets of examples, which do you find more probable? I can definitely tell you which I think matches up better with what actually happens on Wikipedia, and it's the latter. I can even back this up with an example that just happened: Looking at the category that the tag places the article into, I see "La-Z-Boy". Someone thought La-Z-Boy was important enough to create a stub on, but forgot to mention the reasons why it's important -- in this case, the fact that they happen to be the United States' largest manufacturer of recliners. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:09, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The logic behind putting it in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-cult_terms_and_concepts_67b4.html" title="Category:Anti-cult terms and concepts">Category:Anti-cult terms and concepts</a> was rather informal and simple: It is somehow connected to the other issues in cat, has similar potential for discussion (critical, etc.), and is controversal. That's all, nothing about cult (do the other have anything to do with cult?). I thought it just had to be put in some category. I'll add engineering, too. Maybe neuroscience would be good also.

<p>By "pov and wrong", I meant that the article previously said that Reddy had been able to "keep all of his ill-gotten gains", or something along those lines.

<dd>Right -- what I was trying to say in my hurried edit summary just before I ran for the train (I <i>have</i> to stop doing that) is that the paragraph you replaced did in fact contain POV statements and statements which the reference you also added showed to be factually wrong. However, those statements were only about half of the paragraph. The other statements were not noticeably POV, so I restored them, and what my edit summary was meant to convey was "these might have been removed in too much haste, or they might have been removed because they too were incorrect. I've restored it in case it was the former, but feel free to re-remove them if it was the latter." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:01, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's honestly a surprising question. The usual intent of a merge is to put information that's in two articles and put it all in one article and convert the other to a redirect; one of the frequent cases where this is considered a desirable thing to do is when one of the article subjects really isn't notable except in connection with the other. Samantha Geimer is probably a very very nice person, but unless something's missing from her article, her only notability is through connection with Roman Polanski -- which is why I suggested a merge. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Monty Hall problem</span></h2>
<p>Hi - A previous change I made to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Hall_problem_4d49.html" title="Monty Hall problem">Monty Hall problem</a> article some time ago added a sentence with the critical assumptions in the first paragraph immediately before the question. Because of this addition, the words "the host knows what is behind each door" now appear twice in this paragraph. It is this redundancy I was trying to eliminate. The first occurrence of this phrase (the one I deleted) is in a parenthetical in a compound sentence. Deleting this occurrence seemed (to me) to simplify this sentence without changing the meaning, since the assumption that the host knows is still stated. Is there some reason it doesn't look redundant to you?

<dd>Misreading on my part. Believe me, I looked through that entire paragraph for somewhere else where that prerequisite was mentioned, and I didn't see it.

<p>Antaeus, as always your efforts are appreciated for their apparent sincerity. Your boldness in editing is admirable.

<dd>There wasn't any sarcasm at all in it. At this point there are far more medical professionals who accept the existence of ADHD than who do not. You've been clear about your opinion that ADHD is in fact an invented disease which does not exist, and the drug companies are responsible for somehow creating the general consensus that it does.

<dd>A more collegial tone would be appreciated, Antaeus. With regard to ADD, the 'symptoms' subjectively used to facilitate diagnoses are generally quite real, especially from the point of view of those who may inappropriately seek to enforce overly strict discipline. The <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a> (rather than 'conspiracy', which comes off as sarcastic) is likely to precipitate backlashes on several levels, including the spread of illicit drug use among those without an Rx, and vulnerabilities to substance abuse among those given an Rx. The focus on artificially controlling behavior draws attention away from equally serious symptoms related to overly compliant and deferential behavior (perhaps associated with hyperfocus and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoteny.html" title="Neoteny">neoteny</a>), which are routinely and selectively overlooked. The resulting discrimination tilts heavily against children whose only crime, often, is being slow to grow up. According to one report, half of patients given psychiatric diagnoses at a facility were later found to have underlying non-psychiatric medical conditions which likely contributed to their mental health issues. Psychiatric diagnoses can only be made without identification of any medical pathology, because there are no tests specific to mental illness. The primary problem with most ADD diagnoses is one of discrimination, more so than fabrication of diagnostic criteria. Such discrimination (biased in favor of the sycophant) likely fosters, and culturally ingrains, the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_principle.html" title="Peter principle">Peter principle</a> phenomenon. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 08:21, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the key point (which, I'm afraid, did get lost in trying to make the analysis so complete that no one could misinterpret it) is that if the host <i>doesn't</i> open a door, the chance of winning by switching is the intuitive chance, 1/3: it must be the correct decision to switch (a 2/3 chance) <i>and</i> the player must pick the <i>correct</i> door to switch to (a 1/2 chance); 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3. The "a-ha" of how the host opening a door <i>can</i> raise the chance of winning above its intuitive level is the realization that when the host opens the door, he is eliminating the 1/2 chance that you might correctly decide to switch but choose the wrong door out of those that are left. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 3 July 2005 19:41 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't been able to take a good exhaustive look at the article in some time, so I'll abstain on whether it's ready to be a FAC. As for adding the deleted section back in -- no, not in the form that I wrote it, which wound up far less clear than I wanted it to be. However, I think the central point may be worth explaining, in some form: Many people are blocked from seeing the solution because their intuition misguides them; they don't see how the probability for any door can rise above 1/N where N is the number of doors. They don't realize that the host, by opening a door, is actually <i>removing</i> something that <i>lowered</i> their chance.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Psychosurgery</span></h2>
<p>Glad to have that relatively cleaned up. I still wonder if there is some way to really emphasise that both "psychosurgery" as a term and a practice is now more or less an historical thing. I don't know about other countries, but I'm pretty sure that no procedure related to a lobotomy/cingulotomy is performed in my country (New Zealand, although I think some may be done in Australia).

<dl>
<dd>I think it's probably possible to put that emphasis in in an NPOV fashion. You could point out that the practices collectively referred to as psychosurgery were all based on fairly crude assumptions about how the brain functions, assumptions which have now been discarded by science. (ever see those 19th century charts that showed the brain divided up into neatly delineated regions, each labelled with the area of thinking that brain section concerned itself with?) Any statistics you can find on the actual occurence of such surgeries would probably help support the contention that psychosurgery is primarily a thing of the past, too. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 3 July 2005 22:00 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is the purpose of this "discussion" to annoy me? That's the only thing it's accomplishing, and accordingly, any attempts to continue it will be reverted unread. The purpose of my having a talk page is not for you to badger me in an attempt to divert attention from your own failings. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:20, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Antaeus, your RfC was deleted only because I am new to the RfC process and didn't get it certified in time. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 01:40, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please start the RfC again. I am with you. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 03:05, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Antaeus, what is annoying is your <b>in</b>explained reverts and your bad faith and your rhetoric and your inability to carry on a logical argument in opposition to people who know what they are talking about. This is not a personal attack, this is the beginning of a <i>complaint</i>. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 02:53, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
