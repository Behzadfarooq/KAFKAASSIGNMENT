<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Shaker_65ee.html" title="Edit section: Issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Issues</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps most significant to the hostility towards Shakers concerned their <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millenarianism.html" title="Millenarianism">millenarianism</a>, and views on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a>.</p>
<p>The main current writer on anti-Shakerism compares allegations against them as similar to other celibate religious groups like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> monks and nuns<a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:d73n4wUYVyEJ:www.une.edu/research/pdf/v1n2.pdf+Anti-Shakerism&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:d73n4wUYVyEJ:www.une.edu/research/pdf/v1n2.pdf+Anti-Shakerism&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, although there are also similarities with hostility to Mormons or Masons. People who formerly resided in Shaker communities even wrote anti-Shaker tracts as some former, or allegedly former, nuns did.</p>
<p>Their <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millenarianism.html" title="Millenarianism">millenarian</a> views drew ire that in some respects is more understandable. Under Joseph Meachem, beliefs concerning God coming to destroy the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Christ_9bb9.html" title="Anti-Christ">Anti-Christ</a> and create a better world grew more pronounced. The Shaker convert Frederick W. Evans in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a> wrote an essay, based more on his enthusiasm then mainstream Shakerism, called a "Shaker reconstruction of the American Government."<a href="http://persweb.wabash.edu/facstaff/royaltyr/apocsociety.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://persweb.wabash.edu/facstaff/royaltyr/apocsociety.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> In it he exclaimed such a reconstruction event would cause poverty to disappear. Other individual Shakers proclaimed messages of joy or disaster were given to them by God or spirits. Even if none of this had official acceptance some blamed Shakerism and took these events to mean the Shakers had occult aspects that inspired domination or damnation of the lands they settled.</p>
<p>The Shakers were also among the first group to refer to God as Father/Mother or to alternatively refer to God as Mother sometimes while referring to God as Father at other times. They viewed God as a duality containing God the Father and a feminine Holy Spirit. This dualist and half-feminine view of God put them radically out of the mainstream. Also their tendency toward "petticoat government", a term used by a Shaker named Philemon Stewart, aroused suspicion among local men. In reality Shaker women largely conformed to nineteenth century expectations of domesticated femininity and left much of the financial aspect to Shaker men, but their official equality and leadership roles aroused suspicion. Shakers appeared for the time to be radical on women's issues and the elevation of Mother Ann Lee as a crucial part of the Second Coming outraged mainstream Christians as being blasphemous.</p>
<p>They also tended to believe in racial equality and harmony although in ways that sound vaguely condescending today. For example songs said to be "inspired by American Indian spirits" tended to involve stereotyped pidgin English like "Me love Mother and she love me Quille ose van da wahaw me!"(notebook from their <b>Golden Harvest</b> CD) Still these beliefs caused them the most violence as it encouraged them to harbor fugitive slaves or American Indians.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Shaker_65ee.html" title="Edit section: Apostate literature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Apostate literature</span></h2>
<p>A strong source of literature hostile to a religion or group comes from former members or <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostates.html" title="Apostates">apostates</a>. This is as true of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakerism.html" title="Shakerism">Shakerism</a> as it is of other groups. In the case of apostate Shakers there are strong similarities between their tracts and those written by ex-nuns or ex-Mormons.</p>
<p>The most significant Shaker apostate writer was likely <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Marshall_Dyer_303e.html" title="Mary Marshall Dyer">Mary Marshall Dyer</a> whose anti-Shaker efforts ran from 1815 to 1852. In 1813 she had joined the Shakers of <a href="../../../e/n/f/Enfield%2C_New_Hampshire_c283.html" title="Enfield, New Hampshire">Enfield, New Hampshire</a> with her husband and family. However two years later she left blaming them for alienating her from her children. Despite that her husband and her family decided to stay. After that she did tours and wrote tracts against the Shakers. The main writings she did were <i>A Brief Statement of the Sufferings of Mary Dyer</i> and <i>A Portraiture of Shakerism</i> in 1822. She also got a mob together to storm the Enfield Shaker Community to take her children back, but this effort failed. For one her husband Joseph remained devout to the community and criticized her in strong terms. Only one of her five children ever left the Shakers and he never became close to her. By the 1850s her anti-Shaker views seemed extreme, in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> at least, and she died as a largely forgotten figure in 1867.</p>
<p><a name="Anti-Shakerism_today" id="Anti-Shakerism_today"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Shaker_65ee.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Shakerism today">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Shakerism today</span></h2>
<p>During the twentieth century the Shakers went into significant decline, so hostility to Shakerism did as well. Although never a large <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_denomination.html" title="Religious denomination">denomination</a>, their influence had been disproportionate due to their skills at seed businesses and their general productivity. However technology and culture changed so by the 1970s the faith had been reduced to a scattering of elderly women.</p>
<p>This decline led even ex-Shakers to view them in relatively positive terms. This began in the 1860s as toward the end of her life Mary Dyer had difficulty making friends among apostate Shakers. They viewed her as too harsh and her son never reconnected with her furthering the discomfort with her. As the group declined further most viewed them as being, at worst, as sexually repressed <a href="../../../e/c/c/Eccentricity_%28behavior%29.html" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentrics</a> who at least made nice <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_furniture.html" title="Shaker furniture">furniture</a>. A more common view saw them as quaint or even idyllic.</p>
<p>There remains small elements of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_countercult_movement.html" title="Christian countercult movement">Christian countercult movement</a> that still use the Shakers as an example of a "cult." As a whole this acts more as derision of a religion deemed to be essentially dead, but much of the old rhetoric still exists. Although Reverend Robert S. Liichow links it more to real or perceived New-Age cults. Lastly some indicate the term "Shaker" itself is an abusive one and that the proper term is "The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing," although as with the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quakers</a>, that issue has largely ebbed.</p>
