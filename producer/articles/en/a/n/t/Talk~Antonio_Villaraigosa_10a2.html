<p>Despite repeated corrections there are those who would have you believe Mr. Villaraigosa is a lawyer or attorney. Since he has not been awarded a degree from an accreditted law school, passed any state bar, nor gained admittance to the ABA, he is not a licensed attorney nor can he act as one. Revisions continue to hide truths about his background and allegiances.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) One need not receive a degree from an accredited law school to be admitted to practice law in CA; (2) the ABA is a voluntary organization that has ZERO responsibility for licensing or disciplining attorneys; (3) the licensing body for attorneys in CA is the CALIFORNIA STATE BAR. Gotta love the POST FIRST, CHECK LATER mentality.</dd>

<dd>I have no objection to removing the lawyer assertion. Can we provide a source that says he is closely associated with socialist causes? Or that he is a current supporter of MeCHA?

<dd>No one knows whether Villaraigosa still supports MEChA, because no one in the news media will ask him about it. One of the links provided is to a KNX radio reporter asking him about the MEChA involvement. However, that took place in 2001. He was not asked about MEChA during any of this year's debates. Feel free to label the links, but removing them would be providing a distorted picture of Villaraigosa. As for the paragraph added above the links section, that's a clear statement of fact, not opinion. It also links to several other WP pages, so I don't think there should be a problem with that. I also added a link to Villaraigosa's campaign site for balance.</dd>

It doesn't assume that it's possible to write an article from a single, unbiased, objective point of view. The policy says that we should fairly represent all sides of a dispute, and not make an article state, imply, or insinuate that any one side is correct."

<dd>It is the responsibility of <i>every</i> editor to make NPOV edits. You cannot add a bunch of (supposedly) factual but intentionally denigrating information and then expect other editors to provide the balance. Considering that this derogatory material is being added just days before an election that follows a negative campaign, it appears that the reasons for adding it is not to improve the encyclopedia, but rather to affect the election. If that's not the case, then waiting few days won't make a difference. Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:16, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you look at the history of changes to this article you will see that user Willmcw has consistantly removed the same facts regarding this bio &amp; replaced it with the same white-washing. Given that different editors have repeatedly edited back in the facts shows that the editor Willmcw is an idealogue that believes in the rule of a one person minority. This particular editor would like to note that w/in one day, actually, w/in hours Willmcw has changed the basic facts. Instead of trying to hava a Saloth Sar year 1 mentality what does Willmcw have to hide? Just leave the information but debate it!</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you have verifiable sources for (ungrammatical) assertions like, " was active in chicano gangs" or "through affirmative action quotas was admitted into UCLA where he spent most of his energies in an anti-US/anglo marxist movement called MeCHA" then we can include them. There's no reason to delete the name of his high school or his law school. If you want to <i>add</i> that the law school is unaccredited then I won't object. But since he's not a practicing lawyer his legal credentials are not a key issue, but we should include an NPOV treatment of whatever verifiable sources we have.

<p>what's ungrammatical? would appreciate the enlightenment - regardless any polishing would be welcome given that it's original intent was to dash off a few facts as in this case - re those facts where are the verifiable sources that he was thrown out of school for brawling at a football game? still overall it's a white wash was when the only portrayel to his tarnished past is that he came from an unstable background - struggling folk would be impressed that he overcame truancy, organized deliquency, radicalism, scholastic failure and achieved political/civic successes</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't write the part about his high school career. The L.A. Times ran a big bio on him back in May, it may have come from there. If you think that there is a mistake then point it out. Perhaps the same article has mention about his (supposed) involvement in MeCHA. Check it out.

<p>could i get some help here? what's ungrammatical? the wall street journal ran an article debunking much of his bio and proving his gang/radical past quoting his fbi file and lapd file - Villaraigosa ‘renuncia’ a Mecha</p>
<p>Mientras hablaba Villaraigosa en el interior del restaurante Mort’s Palisades Deli, Andrew Jones, ex alumno de la Universidad de California en Los Ángeles (UCLA), exigía con un cartel que Villaraigosa rechazara los principios “de reconquista” del Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán, al que perteneció el concejal durante sus años universitarios.</p>
<p>“La mayoría de los jóvenes latinos que asistieron a universidades pertenecieron a MECHA”, dijo Villaraigosa. “No estoy de acuerdo con la mayoría de sus preceptos. Pero en la universidad, todos formábamos parte de esa organización. “Por supuesto que renuncio a su filosofía”, indicó.</p>
<p>“Estoy absolutamente anodadado”, respondió Jones. “Cruz Bustamante no lo quiso hacer, y se le persiguió por meses con eso”, agregó, refiriéndose a la campaña de destitución del 2003.</p>
<p>the below is an english translation of La Opinion reporter Jazmin Ortega's ending paragraph of her article in the May 12th edition of the Spanish language newspaper</p>
<p>"Villaraigosa ‘renounces’ MEChA</p>
<p>While Villaraigosa was speaking inside the restaurant, Mort's Palisades Deli, Andrew Jones, alumnus of the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), demanded with a poster that Villaraigosa reject the principles “of reconquista” of the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan [MEChA], that the councilman belonged to during his university years. “Most of the young Latinos who attended universities belonged to MEChA," Villaraigosa said. “I am not in agreement with most of its precepts. But in the university, we were all part of that organization. Of course I renounce its philosophy,” he said. "I am absolutely surprised,” responded Jones. “Cruz Bustamante did not want to do it, and he was attacked for months about it,” he added, referring to the recall campaign of 2003.</p>
<p>It's universally well known and documented he didn't finish high school, was in gangs and UCLA admits they admitted him without finishing high school. Also that, MeCHA, which he admits belonging too, is an anti-American, marxist organization.</p>
<p>What's wrong with showing this? Why do you delete all the above when all we deleted was one of his high school names. You shouldn't be ashamed of him. His is a remarkable achievement story, right?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Universally well known and documented"? Good. How about a link to these sources that say he never graduated high school? How do you happen to have access to his FBI file? Thanks, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:47, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>any chance re the grammar in the first para? - like i said i blasted off the grammer &amp; am probably wrong - could you tell me where to polish it up? re the fbi although i have a ts/3 full scope clearance i was quoting the journal which quoted his files - you asked for it but here are some of our sources bruinalumni.com</p>

<p>I think Villaraigosa is lying when he says that he renounces MECha. I live in Los Angeles County and I have noticed that Villaraigosa is a staunch supporter of illegal immigrants.

<p>a run on! pathetic - agreed re the massive text pasting, just getting the source out in full to help - however his early bio is a complete cut &amp; paste job by others it's plastered all over the net - look the point is that you don't need a clearance or need to confirm the bruin sources villaraigosa admits it - however for you now to ask for the source of the bruin article is absurd because i'm assuming you visited the site by now...there's a picture of him w/ mecha! what's the big deal so the guy was in a nut org. he has renounced them! why aren't you proud of that?</p>
<p>well some of us looked up run-ons (warriners) and found that it's more accurate name, "comma fault", are two complete sentences seperated by a comma instead of a conjunction, semi-colon or period - it was also noted that it's more of a stylistic problem than grammatical -</p>

This creates duplication with the pre-existing information in the "Biography" section. The duplication may be justified as helping to avert confusion, so I've left it in, but I don't feel strongly either way about whether the second reference should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 18:08, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fail to see what's controversial about the Animal Services Controversy (also those titles should be sentence style--I'll fix that). It sounds like he more or less kept to his campaign pledge. Perhaps if there was someone who actually said there was something wrong with his actions... Rereading the section, I guess race was at issue, but was racism actually ever raised anywhere as a cause for concern?

<p>In June 2006, the mayor's reputation took a hit when he stood by and allowed the eviction of the immigrant farmers at the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Central_Farm_a364.html" title="South Central Farm">South Central Farm</a>. It is reported that, "At three a.m. on the morning of June 13, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department arrived at the farm, fully surrounding it by four a.m. At five a.m., the sheriffs entered the farm, giving the occupants 15 minutes to evacuate. At that point, most of the occupants of the land left, with a few verbal skirmishes reported. According to news reports, 39 people were arrested or taken into custody. Actress Daryl Hannah was removed from the walnut tree in which she and another tree-sitter had been protesting the eviction. It was not immediately clear whether or not Hannah was arrested."</p>
<p>From Villaraigosa's press release:</p>
<p>As you know, this morning (6.13.06), Sheriff's deputies began evicting farmers and activists at the South Central Farm. Today's evictions are unfortunate and come at the end of a tumultuous turn of events that at times was not always discussed in public due to the nature of real estate negotiations and the discussions that various parties were having with the property owner. In light of today's events and the fact that it appears that the owner will not accept a proposal that meets his asking price of $16 million - I felt it was important to brief you today. Today's events are unfortunate, disheartening and unnecessary. After years of disagreement over this property we had all hoped for a better outcome. I'd like to be clear about what has transpired. The property owner asked for $16 million * and last week, after 10 months of negotiations and efforts by my staff and others from the Trust for Public Land and the Annenberg Foundation * a proposal for a full-price, $16 million purchase was made by the Annenberg Foundation to the property owner. The foundation expressed a clear, sincere interest and commitment by its trustees to acquire the property for $16 million dollars. This morning, in a conversation with the property owner I reiterated my confidence in and support for the Annenberg purchase. Even after meeting his asking price, Mr. Horowitz told me that he would not sell the property to the Trust for Public Lands and the Annenberg Foundation. Everyone involved who cares about this garden and who cares about the farmers who have built an oasis in a sea of industry and concrete has done everything possible to meet the property owner's demands. First it was about price, well*. we met his price. He set the bar very high and we met it. Now the bar has been moved. I understand a businessman's need to invest and make a profit. I also have a high respect for and will defend property rights. That is the spirit under which we all operated when trying to negotiate and resolve this issue. But I also believe that we are called upon by a sense of community and civic duty to do the just and right thing. I had hoped that the landowner would have heeded that call. For those who say that there is no plot of land for urban farming in South LA, you should know that the City will continue plans to relocate farmers to an alternate 7.8 acre site, which has the capacity to house 200 garden plots. Already, 30 farmers have been allowed to begin cultivating the land located at 111th St &amp; Avalon. We want to make sure the farmers are properly relocated. In addition, there are about 100 more plots located around the City that we have identified for community gardens." End comments.</p>

Who is saying the mayor's reputation is suffering? Maybe we should move the mayor's statement to wikisource? Does it hold press releases?--<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a> 03:13, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

i would not say the reputation is "suffering". Reputation can be good or bad.</p>

<dd>Exactly. To say that his reputation is suffering assumes the point of view that the eviction is "bad" thing. If somebody says his reputation is suffering (like a poll, perhaps, linking a drop in numbers to action at the farm?), then by all means it should be included. But his simple statement about the affair --and he will have many statements about many issues, which is why I suggest moving it to wikisource-- is not necessarily a statement on his reputation.--<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a> 05:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't clear what more the mayor could have done in this matter. Without a poll it's POV/NOR to suggest that public opinion has changed about him. In any case, the press release shouldn't be in the article If we don't think it will be available in the future, and think we'll want to consult it again, then Wikisource would be the place for it. I believe that press releases are automatically public domain (but you'd better check). -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I rephrased and moved the press release to wikisource, where we should begin putting all his press releases. Only thing is, I couldn't find the statement on the mayor's website, and all I could find online were quotes from the statement in the press, not the whole thing. Can anyone identify the original source of the statement?--<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a> 16:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
