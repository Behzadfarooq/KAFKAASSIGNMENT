<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moving to meta</span></h2>
<p>I'm for moving this page to meta. It doesn't actually say anything about an Antimetrification campaign (such as who supports it, when did it start, what were the significant events of its history.) It's just a load of opinions, delivered with quite a bit of bile, and the attempts of several Wikipedians to counterbalance them with NPOV. And the term "Antimetrification" Googles VERY badly: TWO results. "Anti-metrication" does a little bit better, but it's still crackpot sites whining about their rights to measure. Go and campaign for somebody's right to vote. Pick a real issue. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a> 22:31 Oct 1, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, this is a great page! Not only does it highlight the pro vs. con well, it's also a model of table usage.</p>
<p>By the way, on the "precision" thing:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For example, the human body temperature, as expressed in Fahrenheit, always uses a decimal value.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius, which is a round number -- not 37.0 degrees. When it's converted into Fahrenheit (to 98.6 degrees), it acquires a phony accuracy due to the excessive precision. The normal range is around 0.5 Fahrenheit. Sometimes parents worry that their child has a fever if the thermometer reads 99.0, but that's actually a normal body temperature. (Not to mention the variation between under-the-tongue, the inner ear and other bodily orifices. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, this is an awful page! I agree <b>entirely</b> with Tarquin. I continue to find this article surreal -- it is not in any way an article about a "movement" (Such an article might be interesting); it is more like someone took a segment of a list-serve debate and turned it into a table. The "counter arguments" sound less like attempts to render the article NPOV than attempts to humor an idea that was bad to begin with. This page is not at all a great example of listing "pros" and "cons" because the various sides of the argument are so decontextualized and many of them are, frankly, silly. I have no idea who made any of these arguments, when, or why. I am left suspecting that some of these arguments were made by an isolated reactionary with too much time on his or her hands. I realize this may be terribly unfair -- but unless the article provides some context for the debate, it is hard to resist reaching this conclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What is needed is a good article on metrification, one that provides all the historical context, including specific, named, and contextualized conflicts that arose during the process of metrification (e.g. in 18xx the French government reverted for the following reasons; or in 19xx Senator A proposed metrification, senators B and C made the following objections...)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tarquin is right -- the page should be deleted, and the contents transfered to meta or the listserve. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<dd>just popping in to say for the record there is <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">metrication</a>, which gives (IMO) a fairly neutral account. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></dd>

<p>Old version of the article, for the sake of reference:</p>
<p><b>Anti-metrication</b> is the process of rejecting the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metric_system.html" title="Metric system">metric system</a> in favor of a different system of measurement, typically the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._customary_units_c1a4.html" title="U.S. customary units">American</a> or the different UK <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_unit.html" title="Imperial unit">Imperial</a> one.

<td>The definition of the metre changed no fewer than three times since 1790 (the latest being in 1965) and is currently deemed to be 1/299,792,458th of the distance light travels in one second. That's a real handy reference next time you are measuring a room for carpets or wallpaper.</td>
<td>In practice, the speed-of-light definition was codified based on the previous agreed length; nothing has changed except for a few physicists. The precise definition is used only when needed. The definition of the yard, for example, used to change each time the physical "standard yard" was measured. That's why the customary units are now <i>defined</i> in terms of the metric units, to avoid this sort of confusion. Since an inch is defined as 0.0254 metres, the problem applies equally to customary units.</td>

<td colspan="2"><font color="red">The above is a a load of BS. The argument that the meter's length has changes is ONLY BROUGHT UP AS A COUNTER-ARGUMENT to the pro-metric crowd's assertion that the Imperial system is based on arbitrary lengths like "some dead king's arm length".

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font color="red">ARGUMENT 1: <i>"The fact that metric units are base ten in fact has virtually no relevance either to day to day life or to scientific and engineering manipulation."</i> - base 10 is relevant to us because we have 10 fingers. I can think of no other relevance in nature. This is the reason that the metric attempt at 100 degrees in a circle failed like the attempt to make time base-10. Base-10 is also not good for dividing as base 12 is. The real argument of this is that traditional units evolved as they did because they were the most useful to the most people whereas, the metric system is not.<br /></font>
<p><font color="red"><br /></font></p>
<font color="red">ARGUMENT 2: <i>This is because conversion between units of the same dimension (e.g. centimetres to kilometres) is rarely necessary or useful.</i> - As an engineer by trade, carpenter by hobby, average citizen by birth, I can tell you that I design in pounds and spec. in pounds, I measure in inches and cut in inches, and I buy beer in pints and I drink beer in pints. 90% of measurements are done in the same units as they will be used in. It's a fool who measures in one unit and cuts in another.</font></td>

<td>A base-12 measuring system is superior to a base-10 system, as 12 has many more factors than 10. The American system of liquid measurement is actually base-2 (a gallon is 64 fluid ounces), which has other advantages.</td>
<td>Actually American liquid measurements don't form a complete base 2 system, and even for a partially complete system requires the use of the gill, peck, bushel and quart. Not only are these unfamiliar to many people (even in countries where they are traditional units) but they are different from identically named Imperial units. Still, it is a lot easier to divide 12 by 3 than 10; but this is why metric boards come in 120-centimetre lengths, not 100)
<p>The superiority of of base-12 or base-2 systems to base-10 systems is also disputable. Since base-10 systems are used for numbers, the argument of consistency may beat any other argument.</p>
</td>

<td colspan="2"><font color="red"><i>"Actually American liquid measurements don't form a complete base 2 system, and even for a partially complete system requires the use of the gill, peck, bushel and quart."</i> - This argument is the same as the "Imperial system is too hard due to all the units you must learn like rod, stone, and peck" which is an assinine assertion. There is no need for anyone to use the archaic/obscure units (unless they want to). The metric system ALSO has it's own archaic/obscure units (shall we talk about metric time again?).<br />
<i>"The superiority of of base-12 or base-2 systems to base-10 systems is also disputable."</i> REALLY? You find it disputable to have a system that has more even divisors when the purpose of a measuring system is to usually divide? Interesting argument... Stupid but interesting.</font></td>

<td>Because one degree Fahrenheit is smaller than one degree Centigrade, degrees Fahrenheit are more precise.<br />
But of course, there's no need to measure in whole degrees. In practice, meteorologists and other scientists who are concerned about precise temperature often report temperatures in tenths or hundredths of a degree, in either system. For example, the human body temperature, as expressed in Fahrenheit, always uses a decimal value.</td>
<td>Supporters of American units consider them to have a more human scale than metric ones.<br />
<p>This is highly subjective, especially when one is arguing for miles and quarts instead of kilometres and litres. Still, the yard was originally defined as the length of some dead king's arm. The metre's original definition was 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator on a meridian through Paris, France, based upon an inexact measure of the circumference of the Earth. Which one is a more human scale? Given that the two lengths are within 10% of each other, it's your call.</p>

The problem with Chinese being that its lack of systematic repetition means that you can't work out the sound or meaning of a new symbol whereas with an alphabetic system you have a fighting chance. This problem also applies to the measuring systems. Knowing the size of an inch doesn't help you calculate the size of a league without specific knowledge about their relative sizes whereas knowing the size of a decimetre lets you calculate the size of a megametre based on the meanings of the standard prefixes.</td>

Humans find words that are distinct are less subject to mis-intepretation"</b>.

They have to remember which units are multiples of 10, which are multiples of 100, which are multiples of 1000 and etcetera. As far as everything is base-10 in the metric argument... WRONG! Metric time is base 12, 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 60, 365, 366! Metric angular measurement is base 360 or base 2pi! Metric length surface area and volume is base 10, 100, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000, 1000000000000 &amp; 1000000000000000. Metric mass and weight is base 10, 100, 1000, 2000 (metric tonne), 1000000, 1000000000, 1000000000000 &amp; 1000000000000000.

The quintal is no longer legal in France. Furthermore, the existance of units such as quintal, and the "metric pound" of 500 grams (non-legal, but commonly used in France and Germany for example; a U.S. pound is 453 grams) can be taken to show that the metric system allows local flexibility, while retaining ease of conversion.</td>

<td>There is no compelling reason to change the entrenched system that has worked for centuries on its own, and for decades alongside various versions of the metric system. If there was a valid cost benefit for business, all businesses would have changed to metric exclusively years ago. As this has not happened, and as there is no serious effort underway to make it happen, opponents of metrication argue that the minor benefits of metrication are offset by the initial cost and confusion of a large-scale conversion.</td>
<td>Claiming that a system that is more confusing and difficult to use has "worked" ignores the question of what works <i>best</i>. Also, it would be difficult for businesses to switch without "top-down" pressure, because the change needs to happen in a swift and discrete manner.</td>

<td>...but confusion and difficulty are relative, and one could argue that the metric system is confusing because of all the converting between customary units of measurement and the metric system, and that multiplying or dividing by powers of ten to measure things is just as confusing.</td>

<p>Similar arguments are used in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> for retention of imperial units, though the argument that imperial measures are more "stable" is not used. This is probably due to the greater knowledge that there are different <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallon.html" title="Gallon">gallons</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton.html" title="Ton">tons</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound.html" title="Pound">pounds</a> etc. used through the world.</p>

<p>Are you sure a "real article" will not diverge out of control, too, and the same way the table of arguments did&#160;?</p>

<dd><i>An exception to the above rules of thumb is Fahrenheit vs. Celsius, as Fahrenheit was not properly calibrated on its intended scale, and Celsius evenly divides temperature between the freezing and boiling point of water. (The scientific unit of temperature, Kelvin, is calibrated on an absolute scale.) However, Fahrenheit's higher resolution is more useful for describing air temperature.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I don't understand the paragraph on Celsius vs Fahrenheit. Where are "the above rules of thumb"&#160;? What means "Fahrenheit was not properly calibrated on its intended scale"&#160;? What's the intended scale of Fahrenheit&#160;? How did calibration fail&#160;?</p>
<p>The argument <i>However, Fahrenheit's higher resolution is more useful for describing air temperature</i> is totally unsound. As regards to air temperature, Celsius suits me perfectly, no need for decimals, and I know when it's freezing. As regards to body temperature (looks like a better argument), Fahrenheit must use one decimal too, AFAICanGuess.</p>
<p>If we reintroduce arguments and counter-arguments like this, sure it will go out of control. I'm not convinced there is a need for an article on antimetrication when we have <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">metrication</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Metric Time</span></h2>
<p>I'm going to remove the recent comment:</p>
<p><i>Time metrication has also been implemented as the cost of replacing all clocks, watches, and timers would be vastly higher than changing any other unit.</i></p>
<p>because it is non-sensical.</p>
<p>(Aside from the fact it was probably meant to say "<i>not</i> been implemented"), as already explained, the metric system permits the usual set of units (days, hours) for everyday use. The many countries which use the metric system retain these units. Nobody is proposing the kilosecond etc.</p>

<p>I added that sentence, I think it is useful in that it explains why nobody is proposing the kilosecond etc.- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:41, Feb 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there is still a misunderstanding. Use of hour etc is <i>not</i> a sign of incomplete metrication, because the metric system already includes the minute, hour and day (see e.g. <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci525181,00.html" class="external text" title="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci525181,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The economic cost of changing clocks is to some extent a side-issue. As far as I can tell, your reasoning seems to be:
<ul>
<li>Full metrication demands kiloseconds etc</li>
<li>But it costs too much</li>
<li>So supposedly "metric" countries settle for an incomplete metrication which retains hours etc instead</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>whereas I suggest that really it is:
<ul>
<li>The metric system permits choice of e.g. hours or kiloseconds.</li>
<li>Of these, people in fully-metric countries choose hours for everyday use, as more convenient because they divide exactly into a day. (Hence also e.g. measuring speeds in km/h, even though for scientific calculations m/s is generally used.)</li>
<li>(And incidentally, yes, changing clocks to kiloseconds would also be expensive. But there is no reason to do so, anyway.)</li>
</ul>
