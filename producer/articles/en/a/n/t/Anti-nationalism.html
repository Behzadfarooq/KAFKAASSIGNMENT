<p>Some antinationalists are <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarians.html" title="Humanitarians">humanitarians</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanists.html" title="Humanists">humanists</a> who pursue an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealist.html" title="Idealist">idealist</a> form of world community and self-identify as "<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_citizen.html" title="World citizen">world citizens</a>" towards the ultimate goal of having all of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanity.html" title="Humanity">humanity</a> live in <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">peace</a> rather than perpetual conflict. This strain of antinationalism does not necessarily include being against the concept of separate <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countries.html" title="Countries">countries</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation-state.html" title="Nation-state">nation-states</a>, or <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border.html" title="Border">national boundaries</a>.

<p>Most of the antinationalists who believe that eventually the world should be one unified <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community.html" title="Community">community</a> (usually after a worldwide <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_revolution.html" title="Social revolution">social revolution</a> of some type) make a notable exception for the preservation of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> and often also <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_politics.html" title="Identity politics">identity politics</a> by extension. These adherents also do not <i>necessarily</i> repudiate the concept of national boundaries as such. Their argument is that nationalism is unfavourable when it leads to things like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauvinism.html" title="Chauvinism">chauvinism</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingoism.html" title="Jingoism">jingoism</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militarism.html" title="Militarism">militarism</a>, but in some senses can also be constructive when its inherent passion and <a href="../../../d/e/d/Dedication.html" title="Dedication">dedication</a> are applied to anti-<a href="../../../o/p/p/Oppression.html" title="Oppression">oppression</a> contexts, such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Liberation_Front_8701.html" title="National Liberation Front">national liberation</a> movements, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_nationalism.html" title="Ethnic nationalism">ethnic nationalist</a> <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resistance_movements.html" title="Resistance movements">resistance movements</a> (such as the historic <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_Party_31db.html" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>), and other similar contexts. Interestingly, most <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist-Leninist_65ee.html" title="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninists</a> around the world, mostly considered by the politically unaffiliated to be towards the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Left_3086.html" title="Radical Left">left of the mainstream</a>, advocate this position or something close to it, and have historically done so.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-nationalism.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Nationalism That Opposes All Nationalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Nationalism That Opposes All Nationalism</span></h3>
<p>There is a third strain of antinationalism that stands in firm opposition to both of the other strains. Confined almost entirely to the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Left_3086.html" title="Radical Left">Radical Left</a>, this strain argues that <i>all</i> nationalism, even <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_nationalism.html" title="Ethnic nationalism">ethnic nationalism</a> among historically or currently oppressed <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minorities.html" title="Minorities">minorities</a>, is fundamentally <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">reactionary</a>. This strain of antinationalism also typically advocates the physical elimination of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border.html" title="Border">national boundaries</a> and an instatement of what could be termed a single <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> of harmony, cooperation, and free unobstructed movement of people, ideas, and goods and services.</p>
<p>Variations on this theme were historically seen in the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyist.html" title="Trotskyist">Trotskyist</a> movement, where they were regarded by those outside that movement (and some inside as well) as <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitist.html" title="Elitist">elitist</a> and/or "<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armchair_revolutionary.html" title="Armchair revolutionary">armchair</a>," i.e., <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignorant.html" title="Ignorant">ignorant</a> of the struggles going on in the world.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research." style="white-space: nowrap;">original research?</span></a></i>]</sup> However, more recently, certain groups descended from the <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maoist.html" title="Maoist">Maoist</a> tradition of Marxism have moved towards this fiercely anti-nationalist stance in a different way than the Trotskyists, saying that although it may be a painful and unpopular position to hear, ultimately opposing all nationalism strengthens <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletarian_internationalism.html" title="Proletarian internationalism">internationalism</a> and the hoped-for future international <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity.html" title="Solidarity">solidarity</a> culture.</p>
<p>Often, the mainstream-Left antinationalist proponents, including many <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist-Leninist_65ee.html" title="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninists</a>, will criticise these particular anti-nationalists as crypto-<a href="../../../r/a/c/Racists.html" title="Racists">racists</a>, charging that they are intentionally ignorant of separate <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">cultures</a>, the concept of nationalism to be used as part of resistance struggles despite a tendency in other contexts to divide and weaken; etc. But the anti-nationalists opposing all nationalism counter this stance, stating that their position encourages what they term "multi-racial unity" rather than the separate-but-equal approach they say most other <a href="../../../l/e/f/Leftist.html" title="Leftist">leftists</a>, including most other <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist-Leninist_65ee.html" title="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninists</a> advocate.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Because these adherents oppose nationalism so strongly on all levels, in order to retain some practical outlet through which to display their <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-racism.html" title="Anti-racism">anti-racism</a>, most choose to physically attack organised <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racists.html" title="Racists">racists</a> like the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">Neo-Nazi</a> organisations as well as bringing up racism and race's links to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">class</a> in contexts where most other anti-racists would avoid bringing the subject up.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> One group that has explicitly and publicly put forward this third strain of antinationalism for most of its history is the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Labor_Party_13b8.html" title="Progressive Labor Party">Progressive Labor Party</a>, a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnational_political_party.html" title="Transnational political party">transnational</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>-based <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_party.html" title="Communist party">communist party</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There are also <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_Communism_679e.html" title="Left Communism">Left communist</a> groups that appear to advance a similar position, but it is not always clear what those groups' positions are regarding <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_politics.html" title="Identity politics">identity</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Liberation_Front_8701.html" title="National Liberation Front">national liberation</a>, or <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-determination.html" title="Self-determination">self-determination</a> politics.</p>
<p>Certain strains of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> also claim to pursue an anti-nationalist political line similar to this third strain, evidenced in part by their self-proclaimed opposition to any <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_personality.html" title="Cult of personality">cult of personality</a>, and also by their claim to be further to the left than any of the Marxist-Leninist movements. However, in practice, some anarchists have been known to implicitly support <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_politics.html" title="Identity politics">identity politics</a> and national self-determination.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The philosophy of <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> can also be seen as opposing all forms of nationalism, though he opposed virtually every other form of social movement and ideology as well.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Some believe that Islam has traditionally been anti-nationalist. These proponents believe that sexism, racism and nationalism of various segments of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> was abolished and outlawed when <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> took political power with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Later the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliphs</a> ruled, and expanded a form of Islamic <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_equality.html" title="Social equality">equality</a> with the expanding transnational <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">Caliphate</a> state. According to this view, the anti-nationalism did not last throughout the history of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_world.html" title="Muslim world">Muslim world</a>. Instead, many Muslims have warred with each over tribe or nation, which seems to be at odds with Islamic teaching.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The anti-nationalist movements within Islam are based upon dictates of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammads</a> speech (<a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>). According to supporters of this view, Muhammad is known to have made many references to the ills of nationalism such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'People should give up their pride in nations because this is a coal from the coals of hell-fire. If they do not give this up Allah (swt) will consider them lower than a lowly dung worm which pushes itself through feces.' (recorded by Abu-Dawood and al-Tirmidhi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Muslims argue that the roots of nationalism are found in the original sin of pride by the devil <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaytaan.html" title="Shaytaan">shaytaan</a> himself. <a href="http://muttaqun.com/prejudice.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://muttaqun.com/prejudice.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
