	    <p><b>Antyesti</b> or <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral.html" title="Funeral">funeral rites</a>, is an important sacrament of Hindu society. Extensive texts of such rites are available, particularly in the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garuda_Purana_10fb.html" title="Garuda Purana">Garuda Purana</a>. There is wide inconsistency in theory and practice, and the procedures differ from place to place. Further, these rites also differ depending on the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a>, <a href="../../../j/%C4%81/t/J%C4%81ti.html" title="Jāti">jāti</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_group.html" title="Social group">social group</a>, and the status of the deceased person.</p>
<p>About 4000 years before, in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, human bodies were either exposed to the elements of nature, and to the birds, or buried in the earth, in a river, and sometimes a cave or an urn<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Centuries later, cremation became the usual mode of disposal of the dead bodies, with certain exceptions - the exceptions being bodies of infants<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, yogis, sadhus, and a few others. Cremation became popular due to the notion that the soul cannot enter a new body until its former one has totally disappeared, and cremation was considered the fastest way to expeditiously dispose of the dead bodies.</p>
<p>Hindu funeral rites may generally be divided into four stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rituals and rites to be performed when the person is believed to be on the death bed.</li>
<li>Rites which accompany the disposal of the dead body.</li>
<li>Rites which enable the soul of the dead to transit successfully from the stage of a ghost (<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungry_ghost.html" title="Hungry ghost">preta</a>) to the realm of the ancestors, the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitrs.html" title="Pitrs">Pitrs</a>.</li>
<li>Rites performed in honor of the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitrs.html" title="Pitrs">Pitrs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Procedures for cremation vary from place to place. Immediately after the death has the body is placed on the floor with the head pointing towards the south which is the direction of the dead. An oil lamp is light and placed near dead body, this lamp is kept burning continously for the first three days following the death. In Hinduism, the dead body is considered to be symbol of great impurity hence miminal physical contact with the dead body is maintained, perhaps to avoid the spread of infections or germs. Most often the dead body is bathed by purified water, and then dressed in new clothes, if the dead was a male or a widow then generally white clothes are used,whereas if the dead was a married women with her husband still alive or a young unmarried girl, then the body is dressed either in red or yellow. Sacred ash (bhasma) is applied on the forehead of the deceased, especially for the worshippers of Lord Shiva (Saivites), otherwise sandalwood paste is applied on the forehead, if the dead was a worshipper for Lord Vishnu (Vaishnava). Further, few drops of the holy Ganges water may be put into the mouth of the deceased so that the soul may attain liberation, also few leaves of the holy basil (tulsi) are placed on the right side of the dead body. The body then may be adorned with jewels, and placed lying on a stretcher, with the head pointing towards the south, which is the direction of the dead. Sometimes the body may be kept in a sitting position too. The stretcher is adorned with different flowers including roses, jasmine, and marigolds, and the body is almost covered with the flowers. Thereafter, the close relatives of the deceased person carry the stretcher on their shoulders to the cremation ground. If it is located at a distance, the stretcher is placed on a cart pulled by animals like bullocks. Nowadays vehicles are also used.</p>
<p>The cremation ground is called Shmashana (in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>), and traditionally it is located near a river, if not on the river bank itself. There, a pyre is prepared, on which the corpse is laid facing southwards, the jewels, if any, are removed. Thereafter, the chief mourner (generally the eldest son) walks around the pyre three times keeping the body to his left. While walking he sprinkles water and sometimes <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghee.html" title="Ghee">ghee</a> onto the pyre from a vessel. He then sets the pyre alight with a torch of flame. The beginning of the cremation heralds the start of the traditional mourning period, which usually ends on the morning of the 13th day after death. When the fire consumes the body, which may take few hours, the mourners return home. During this mourning period the family of the dead are bounded by many rules and regulations of ritual impurity. Immediately after the cremation the entire family is expected to have a bath. One or two days after the funeral, the chief mourner returns to the cremation ground to collect the mortal remains and put them in an urn. These remains are then immersed in a river. Those who can afford it may go to select places like <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varanasi.html" title="Varanasi">Varanasi</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haridwar.html" title="Haridwar">Haridwar</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allahabad.html" title="Allahabad">Allahabad</a>, <a href="../../../s/r/i/Srirangam.html" title="Srirangam">Srirangam</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanya_Kumari_8880.html" title="Kanya Kumari">Kanya Kumari</a> to perform this rite of immersion of mortal remains.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungry_ghost.html" title="Hungry ghost">preta</a>-<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a> is an important aspect of Hindu funeral rites, and its objective is to facilitate the migration of the soul of the dead person from the status of a preta (which is akin to a ghost or spirit) to the abode of the ancestors (that is, the abode of the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitrs.html" title="Pitrs">Pitrs</a>)<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. It is believed that if this stage of funeral rites is not performed or performed incorrectly, the spirit of the dead person shall become a ghost (<a href="../../../b/h/%C5%AB/Bh%C5%ABta.html" title="Bhūta">bhuta</a>)<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The rites generally last for ten or eleven days, at the end of which the preta is believed to join the abode of the ancestors. Thereafter, they are worshipped during the 'shraddha' ceremonies.</p>
<p>If a person dies in a different country, in a war, or drowns, or in any other manner that his body cannot be retrieved for the antyesti, his funeral rites may be performed without the dead body, and similar procedures are followed had the dead body been available. If such a person appears (that is, he has in fact not died), then “resurrection” rituals are mandatory before his being admitted to the world of the living<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
