<dd>How about: Polish Press Agency reported that Rudi Pawelka the president of the Preußische Treuhand and the Territorial Association of Silesia in his speech made during the society's congress in Nuremberg blamed the outburst of the World War II on, in his opinion, acts of aggression committed by Poles during the period 1918-1938. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 05:14, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>~Please, I want quotes for any alleged sentence he has said. I know the Preußische Treuhand is very unpopular in Poland. And what is not liked may be treated not quite fairly, eg one might make a false statement of fact that injures someone's reputation. Make sure it's credible and not some lie to earn money with<a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">sensationalism</a>. I would quite honestly see another source from a country besides Poland. There are enough news agencies on the net and quotations can be found easily. And I highly doubt that the statement could be real if it is so unpopular. If it was a fact, it would probably have caused a scandal.</dd>

<dd>No, sorry, I've read through it but couldn't discover any grounds for the accusations. In his speech the accused criticises the Eu, the Polish government and the german one for their attitutude towards his <a href="../../../../de/p/r/e/Preu%C3%9Fische_Treuhand_ed4f.html" class="extiw" title="de:Preußische_Treuhand">de:Preußische Treuhand</a> but does not allocate guilt for the war. I'm pretty sure this man is very unpopular by some here and criticising the polish government (or anything related to Poland) alone is considered in the article as anti-polonistic. And criticising the article, like I did, is considered by some as "German POV-pushing". No surprise then, that the propaganda article is "vandalized" so many times. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 16:12, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify. Gazeta Wyborcza is not a nationalistic journal.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>No, he did not write this article. The aim of my remark was just only to underline that this daily treats Polish-German relations in a serious manner and if it presents something as a problem in Polish-German relations then it is really a problem and not a seeking of cheap popularity. From my analysis below, you can clearly see that Pawelka's argument is on the verge of accusing of Poland for the guilt for WW2. <i>Gazeta Wyborcza</i> just took the side of the interpretation that he really said so, because they think he wants to slowly revise the current European order at the cost of Polish citizens. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 13:37, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>One long speech of Pawelka (over 130 sentences) to Silesians shortly commented (5 sentences -&gt; less than 1/25 of the speech) on the Treaty of Versailles and the forcible expulsion of Germans after the first World War in the context of "problems and tensions" before 1933 that "people don't talk about" but which also contributed to a "situation in Europe" that "Hitler" then managed to "explo[de]" when he started the second World War. A journalist of the most popular daily in Poland jumped to the conclusion that Pawelka wanted to completely blame Poland for World War II and although that was not Pawelka's point in the speech, the journalist, who certainly didn't win a prize for the story, succeeded in creating a scandal in Poland. Scandals often increase the rate of sales of the magazines who cause them.</i> That summarizes this entire problem in my opinion. Actually I don't even want to know Molobo's summary because I can see it in the article: <i>Pawelka said Poland, not Germany, is guilty for the second World War! That's why all the organizations in which Pawelka is in must think so too! And the entire CDU and CSU think so too because they were once reported by a Polish source to have met with these organizations!!!</i><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 14:53, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You forgot about Polish "agression" in Upper Silesia, lawlessness of Polish state, whose fingers must be watched, and the fact that he is angry about the fact that when WW2 is mentioned Poland isn&#160;;t remembered for her aggression. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 22:01, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Was the brutal and deadly expulsion after World War II not aggressive? In what context did he accuse Poland of being a lawlessness state? In the context of their rejection of his demands. And that's what the speech is about, his demands, not your Miss Poland. And I've told you three times already that you don't translate word for word but according to its meaning, so there was no claim of "watching hands". How about you learn German before claiming you're better informed about the German language than me, the Collins Dictionary or the Honos dictionary?<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 22:56, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"And the entire CDU and CSU think so too because they were once reported by a Polish source to have met with these organizations!!!"

<p>Yes you are right.Saying that he is angry Nazi Reich is accused of agression when it was Poles that were aggresive doesn't mean he accuses Poles of WW2 or he is antipolish&#160;:)--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 18:01, 17 August 2005 (UTC) And of course GW is a right wing nationalist newspaper&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 18:01, 17 August 2005 (UTC) Sorry? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 18:22, 17 August 2005 (UTC) And of course this part of the text is very propolish also&#160;: Polen ist mit einer solchen Rechtsprechung kein Rechtsstaat.

<dd>But does it mirror an "irrational or malicious histility towards Poland"? Maybe in your opinion. In my opinion he was argueing in favour of his organisation and this sentence, one of hundreds in his speech, is an overstatement he uses as rhetorical device to argue for his cause, not argument why Polish should be detestable. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 18:22, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, giving someone the finger is not a friendly rhetorical device as such. It is a gesture venting anger that has nothing to do with what we are talking of because "auf die Finger schauen" means "to keep an eye on someone", not "give sb a finger". <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 21:41, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't Poland is a thief that needs her hands watched.Also I don't think claiming that the treaty that restored Poland from occupation was "unjust", or diktat, nor do I think liberation of Poles was "aggression", that we need to remember besides Nazi Reich...--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:40, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Allright, do you consider a person an anti-polonist who says, "which hand that has put itself and us in such chains [meaning the Versailler Vertrag] wouldn't whither?" And if that person added, "this treaty is unbearable and unattainable!", would you see him as an anti-polonist or rather a nazi?<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 20:32, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please stick to the topic and aks me personal questions on my talk page.What we are talking is Pawelka speach against Polish state in which he among accusing Poland of aggression, blaming Poland for WW2, insulting remarks that Poland must have her hands watched, also said that liberation movement of Poles was aggression, and treaty that created Poland was injust.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 20:55, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never made an off-topic edit and this was not an attempt to do so either. As for aggression: was the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II_31b3.html" title="Expulsion of Germans after World War II">Expulsion of Germans after World War II</a> not maybe a bit aggressive considering millions of Germans died in an aggressive way? As for your thief theory: you guys personalised Poland by calling it "her", like a woman, now, Molobo, you're complaining that someone applies the personalisation "to keep an eye on someone" to Poland, like Poland were a woman or man. And get over these thief theories. Collins dictionary: 'jdm auf die Finger sehen/schauen='to keep an eye on sb', 'jdm scharf auf die Finger sehen/schauen='to keep a close eye on sb'; the latter is more emphatic ... but Pawelka only said the former thus less emphatic - therefore less inflammatory - one. We translate the meaning of the term, not word for word, or else saying "to let the cat out of the bag" would certainly not mean "to tell a secret carelessly or by mistake" if you translate it to Polish for example - if you translated it word for word it would sound like an accusation of cruelty to cats, whereas a "cat burglar" would not be "a thief who climbs up the outside of a building in order to enter it and steal sth" but translating it word for word you'd have a "burglar that steals cats". If keeping an eye on sth is a crime, then I'm guilty of keeping an eye on the article, and so are you. Do you accuse the article of being a thief? As for your accusation of war guilt: I think I've explained why it is nonsense now (read the comment below starting with "No, that's overstated etc". Even if you still accepted this conspiracy theory, what difference would it make? If you ask Pawelka whether he thinks Poland is responsible for the situation that led to WW2, would he confirm it? No. Has he accused Poland for the situation that led to WW2 in other speeches? Certainly not (unless you could find a source). Even if you didn't change your mind, no source except for one little source thought so too. Politically Pawelka played a relative large role last year and attention from the media was not missing, yet no source thinks he blames Poland for WW2? And a scandal is usually good for a magazine's rate of sales and Pawelka's approving rates were not really high so who should want to gloss over such things? Not even those who'd even care about Prince Charles and other such worthless gossip, right? By the way, are you accusing Prince Harris of being a nazi after he wore a nazi uniform? Certainly not. Because you could guess that he would deny any such accusations, because that would only be speculative, because that person himself is actually irrelevant. So why are you so pedantic about small parts of that long but irrelevant speech? As for the question I asked you about the treaty: what I was trying to point out was that objection to the Treaty of Versailles was dominant in Germany. That statement came from Scheidemann by the way, the important politician who called out the beginning of the Weimar Republic, not some anti-polonist. I argued that he Pawelka used the treaty as argument that injustice doesn't justify injustice. The treaty of Versailles, believe it or not, is known to have been a factor for the Weimar Republic's end and Hitler's success. The treaty intentionally humiliated Germany - for example the place and time of that treaty are those of Bismarck's foundation of Germany. Because the Germans were dazzled by Wilson's 14points, they were all the more shocked about the incredibly high demands of the treaty. Don't forget that WW1 has been a tragedy for Germany too. The treaty meant a shock and decreased Germany's right of self-determination, which Pawelka said too. Sprengler, a historian, summarized the entire treaty with a "continuation of the war with other means" and that's how they were seen in the tragedy of the Weimar Republic. The treaty was a "mortgage for the Weimar Republic" according to my history book. I know the treaty has also to do with the history of Poland, but the territorial changes weren't even the core of the treaty and Poland was just one - Lithuania, France, Belgium and Denmark profitted too and there was also the loss of Saarland and all the German colonies in Africa and elsewhere. These are just details. When Pawelka shortly mentioned the treaty, he wanted to remind of the treaty as a whole. Maybe to Poles the treaty meant a big change for Poland's territory. To Germans this meant just an insignificant detail - there was never much controversy about Poland about the treaty. And Pawelka and the listeners were Germans and most probably didn't even know that the treaty had something to do with Poland too. To them it was a humiliation, a shock, a continuation of the war with other means, a Diktat, anything associated with injustice. And this is what Pawelka is arguing with. Please don't forget that Poland is not the centre of the universe, not saying that Germany is, but when people in Germany hear 'Prussia' or 'Treaty of Versailles', they are not often reminded of Poland. In the history class tests about Bismarck and later about WW1 and the treaty of Versailles, I wrote 0 words about Poland and still I got the best marks in my history course back then (not saying I was so good in others subjects too), I just can't imagine I've missed the point.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 23:15, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"As for your thief theory: you guys personalised Poland by calling it "her", like a woman, now, Molobo, you're complaining that someone applies the personalisation "to keep an eye on someone" to Poland, like Poland were a woman or man."

<dd>If you still come up with that finger, I told you not to translate word for word but according to the meaning.

<dd>Not a tragedy? Millions were killed, millions injured, millions went missing in action, entire landscapes and cities were destroyed. Considering they only wanted a short war, not a world war, like the three previous wars (who did much to unite Germany), something like a war Poland wanted to have when it entered the Iraq war, yes, it was a tragedy. No one wanted a world war. German hegemony? No, not world domination, but a position equal to the world powers Great Britain, the USA and Russia was the aim of the German Empire. The central powers doubtlessly contributed much to the outbreak of the war, but at that time peace was very unimportant to most countries. I remember a nice quote by a historian who said that almost any country involved could have prevented the war ... if they really wanted to. And if you're really so indifferent to German suffering, like Pawelka is or was to Polish suffering or (since you like comparisons to Hitler) like Hitler was to Jewish suffering, just try to avoid indications because as you can see in the paragraph about Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it just forces the conversation off-topic.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a>

<p>The text I mentioned is indeed the text in question. I've checked it thouroghly by now. Let me point out the main problematic passage which sounds most offending for us Poles:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Es erzürnt mich aber auch, wenn alle Untaten von Deutschen ständig benannt, wenn Aggression und Schuld anderer Länder plötzlich nicht mehr zählen und mit dem Verweis auf 1933 oder 1939 weggewischt werden. Die Geschichte des zweiten Weltkrieges fängt aber nicht 1933 an, ungelöste Probleme und Spannungen in Europa waren auch vor 1933 vorhanden. Es bedurfte nur eines Diktators Hitler, der diese Situation zur Explosion brachte.</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>Es ist unredlich, wenn man von dem ungerechten und das Selbstbestimmungsrecht missachtendenden Diktat von Versailles 1919 nicht mehr spricht, das der britische Premierminister Lloyd George als Keim für den nächsten Krieg bezeichnete. Es kann in diesem Zusammenhang nicht verschwiegen werden, welchen Leidensweg die 2,4 Millionen Deutschen in Polen bis 1939 gehen mussten, in der Tschechoslowakei waren es über 3 Millionen, die gegen ihren Willen in den neuen Staat gepresst wurden. Eine große Fluchtwelle und Vertreibungen aus Polen erfasste etwa eine Million Deutsche bis 1939.</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wer 1933 anfängt, geht auch hinweg über polnische Aggressionen gegen seine Nachbarn: 1918 / 19 Einfall in Russland und Annexion großer Gebiete, Mai 1921 Überfall auf das deutsche Oberschlesien verbunden mit unsäglichen Grausamkeiten an der deutschen Bevölkerung, Oktober 1938 Einmarsch in das tschechische Olsagebiet und Annexion des Gebiets.</i>
<dl>
<dd>these are translated into Polish like this:
<dl>
<dd><i>Zloszcze sie jednak takze wtedy, gdy mówi sie stale o przestepstwach Niemców, podczas gdy agresja i wina innych krajów przestaje odgrywac role i jest zamazywana ze wzgledu na lata 1933 lub 1939. Historia drugiej wojny swiatowej nie zaczela sie w 1933 r.; nierozwiazane problemy i napiecia istnialy w Europie juz wczesniej.</i> (the sentence: <i>Es bedurfte nur eines Diktators Hitler, der diese Situation zur Explosion brachte.</i> is not translated)</dd>
<dd>The second paragraph is not translated but related like this: <i>Za jedna z przyczyn wybuchu wojny uznal Traktat Wersalski z 1919 r., który, jak powiedzial, byl niesprawiedliwy i ignorowal prawo narodów do samostanowienia. W tym kontekscie wspomnial o cierpieniach 2,4 mln Niemców, którzy wbrew swej woli zostali "wtloczeni" w granice nowego panstwa polskiego.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Kto zaczyna rokiem 1933, ten pomija polskie agresje przeciwko sasiadom - w 1918/19 wkroczenie do Rosji i aneksje duzych obszarów, w maju 1921 r. napad na Górny Slask i popelnienie niewypowiedzianych okrucienstw na ludnosci niemieckiej, zas w pazdzierniku 1938 r. wkroczenie na czeskie Zaolzie i aneksje tego terenu.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I begin to understand the origin of "Rudi Pawelka [...] blamed the outburst of the war on, in his opinion, acts of aggression committed by Poles during the period 1918-1938.". It must be this sentence: "Die Geschichte des zweiten Weltkrieges fängt aber nicht 1933 an, ungelöste Probleme und Spannungen in Europa waren auch vor 1933 vorhanden." (English: "The history of World War II, however, doesn't begin in 1933, unsolved problems and tensions existed in Europe before 1933") Furthermore he also mentions acts of Polish aggression in the thirties. But did he blame the outburst of the war on Poland? No. Thus "Rudi Pawelka [...] blamed the outburst of the war on, in his opinion, acts of aggression committed by Poles during the period 1918-1938." is a meaningless statement based on opinion. And that led some here to denounce the entire Preußisch Treuhand as 'anti-polonistic'???<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 18:51, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Translation: <i>In the interview with wdr.de, Pawelka counters with his own ideas of reconciliation: "No politician wants to get into the storm of protests which comes from Poland and which is spread in the media here." The Preußische Treuhand had only one aim: "We want the healing for the criminal expulsion." For, Pawelka continues, "every exile must have a right to decide whether he wants to have his property or not". This belonged to the "right of domicile" of the Germans who were driven out of Poland. "On the question of property, we're trying to do all that we still can." Primarily the demand was "Return instead of recompense". Only there "where restitution does not work anymore, because for example a hospital has been built there, we also accept payments of compensation", says Pawelka, who was the leading director of the police in Essen. Today he sits in the city of Leverkusen for the CDU in the city council. "We eventually want to achieve peace under the law for the future and complete human rights in Europe." Pawelka is also the chef of the Silesian national team, which has its headquarters in Königswinter, near by Bonn.</i> Does not justify the accusation either.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 22:54, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Rudi Pawelka and The Preußische Treuhand want to restitute the property that was in German hands before WWII</li>
<li>They intend to use human rights and the European courts to gain this aim</li>
<li>Poles commonly think that this implies coming back to the ethnic situtation from before WWII</li>
<li>Poles are afraid of this because it means coming back to all the problems from before WWII and thus treat such claims as hostile anti-Polonism</li>

<dd>The WDR is part of the German <i>Das Erste</i>, a serious tv channel comparable (albeit worse in my opinion) to the British BBC.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Proposal with stress on Preußische Treuhand and retribution</span></h4>

<dd><i>The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preu%C3%9Fische_Treuhand_ed4f.html" title="Preußische Treuhand">Preußische Treuhand</a> want to restitute whenever possible the property that was in German hands before the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.

<p>I did not mention the PAP source by SylwiaS, because it seems for me a little bit suspicious. I've never seen a signed notice from PAP, and the one pointed out by Sylwia is signed. Maybe the notice is form another medium? I am in favour of adding the source, but after the real origin is sorted out. If this proposal is not acceptable, please, point out what should be improved. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl">Alx-pl</a> 22:33, 20 August 2005 (UTC) Please this is not the article about German revisionist organisations.What is important here is there antipolonistic ideology which they continue to spread.As to other goals, feel free to add them in articles about such organisations.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 19:06, 23 August 2005 (UTC) To be honest, I wouldn't agree fully on this. Apart from the formulation (eg Pawelka doesn't want to use the human rights but he sees the right of property as a human right and he wants to fight for this right), there were absolutely no allusions, simply statements of a speech taken out of their context. Pawelka didn't excuse the Third Reich in the speech (<a href="http://www.schlesien-lm.de/Deutschlandtreffen/rede-pawelka-politische-hauptkundgebung.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.schlesien-lm.de/Deutschlandtreffen/rede-pawelka-politische-hauptkundgebung.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). He said it was the "dictator Hitler", who lead the "situation" in Europe to "explosion". Shortly before (it's written right under the first long line) Pawelka said "I'm embarassed by what a nationalsocialist state has caused. For culturized people, who had given the world so much, it's almost incomprehensible." Four paragraphs below he said, "It's in no way about a weakening or a relativating of the actions of the NS-state, it is about the truth, human rights and the defence against the attempt to hide atrocities behind German atrocities." This is mirrored by a sentence in the sixth paragraph of the speech, which says: ""Concealing one's own atrocities behind the German atrocities is a European norm", this is how the Hungarian writer Esterhàzy put it in the Frankfurter Paulskirche." The entire speech argues in favour of his organization, not who or what was responsible for WW2. This is the context. Those who claim he put the blame for WW2 to Poland only want to bad-mouth him. That's why I cannot agree with you on these alleged allusions because in the context of his speech the allegations look ridiculous. And that's why I was so critical of an inclusion of the whole dispute: his allocation of guilt is just a meaningless allegation to shock some readers and earn money with sensationalism, based on the assumption that next to no one likes the Preußische Treuhand anyway. I'm 100% sure these journalists didn't even believe what they wrote themselves.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 23:57, 20 August 2005 (UTC) Nobody needs to bad mouth them my dear German citizen, he badmouthed himself when ha talked about Poland as thief(we need to look at Polands hands), accused Poland of agression in Upper Silesia, told that the treaty that restored Poland was injust, and that oh he doesn't like Hitler but please remember the Polish aggression.Such blunt revisionistic statements and insults against Poland and Polish people speak for themselfs.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 19:06, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've read the paras several times now. I agree that Pawelka and PT are marginal. The main Pawelka's sin is that he wants the retribution of the property, not that he wants to revert the guilt. And I agree with you, that he does not allude. He simply states that the guilt for the war is partly on the Polish side and in the way Poland handled Germans within its territory. I agree also that he distances himself explicitely from the nazi regime. He even stays that <i>Es geht keineswegs um eine Aufrechnung oder um Relativierung des Handelns des NS-Staates</i> (<i>The intent is not to recalculate or relativize the deeds of nazi state in any way</i>) But in fact he does recalcutates and does relativizes its deeds stating that:
<ul>
<li><i>Es bedurfte nur eines Diktators Hitler, der diese Situation zur Explosion brachte.</i> (<i>A dictator like Hitler was needed only to bring the situation to the explosion point</i>).</li>
<li><i>Wer 1933 anfängt, geht auch hinweg über polnische Aggressionen gegen seine Nachbarn</i> (<i>Who starts with 1933 puts aside the Polish aggressions against their neighbouring nations [in 1918/19/21/38]</i>).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Pawelka just puts aside these two things so he relates them and thus in fact makes their mutual relativisation; he also recalculates the deeds of nazis because he says that there were certain sufferings and they were stopped by the explosion ignited by Hitler (but this is only alluded, of course).</dd>
<dd>I don't say that the situation before WWII should not be analysed and that the sufferings of Germans should be forgotten due to Hitler, of course. (Erich Maria Remarque's books are worth reading to gain more intuition on what was happening in Germany before WWII, by the way).</dd>
<dd>To make the long story short Pawelka states: <i>I feel ashamed of Hitler, but Poland is guilty for the situation that led to WWII</i> And this is one of his ways to make Preußische Treuhand property claims legitimate. Or at least it is one of his ways to be seen as a bold German property rights defender, as far as the properties before WWII are concerned.

<dd>No, that's overstated, in this paragraph he argues that Poland because of its aggressions is not completely without blame in the situation that Hitler managed to explode, like he condemns the Versailler Vertrag (which is historically correct by the way). Of course he doesn't intend to use this argument change a line in a history book that would put more blame for WW2 on Poland, but his argument allows him to say that these injustices against Germany didn't do the world good either. This, in turn, strenghtens his main argument, namely that injustice simply doesn't justify injustice, that atrocities against Germany cannot be justified by Germany's atrocities against other countries. Because of this argument he wants the listener to conclude that the expulsion of Germans after World War II cannot be justified by Germany's injustice, put simply, those exiles have a right to their property they lost. To make this long story short Pawelka states: <i>I know the Third Reich must be condemned and, for consistency, so must be all injustices because injustice never justifies injustice. For this reason the German exiles who had property before WW2, too, must get their property back.</i><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 13:46, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I am very sorry, but I have to be emotional about this issue. Please, don't take it personally. You are doing a very good job and my feelings are purely against Pawelka's programme. Pawelka calls for justice, but he tries to win this justice by means of another injustice. He has a reasonable project for Germans that were expelled from East Prussia and Silesia (and Bohemia), but does he have a reasonable perspective for these people who live in their previous properties now and who have lived there for the last 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years? Will all these Germans be so generous to allow them live in the same place? I doubt. The people who will be forced to leave their properties, will they not feel that they are expelled (even if it would be not justified). What Pawelka prepared to offer for the neighbour of my mother's house? Before WWII she lived in Ukraine. After Germans and Russians invaded Poland in 1939 she and her family were expelled to <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberia.html" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. Her father and mother died there. After the war she returned (or better said was expelled for the second time) to the new Poland within new borders and her original home was left outside the Polish territory. (A good description of a 'journey' of this kind is in <a href="http://www.granta.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=1900" class="external text" title="http://www.granta.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=1900" rel="nofollow">this interview</a>; <a href="http://www.heretical.com/miscella/wattruth.html" class="external text" title="http://www.heretical.com/miscella/wattruth.html" rel="nofollow">excerpt</a>.) What Pawelka can offer her? Does he speak about retribution of her property? Where can he direct her? To Russian courts? To Ukrainian courts? These countries declined the right for this kind of retribution. Suppose they allowed it.

<dd>Please don't get me wrong when I defend such persons as him or the CDU - although it might surprise some persons here I've actually only rarely agreed with the CDU's concepts in general and never voted for the party. I know that he and his organization react with indifference to the other side, in a similar way to lawyers in a judicial dispute. I know it's like at court or in a war, or to put it less inflammatory, in a 1vs1 video game or in a football match: two winners are rare. As the chef of the Silesian football team something like this shouldn't be new to him - he's biased in favour of a team and thus inevitably against the other. But it's often not hatred towards the other party that makes you support "your" team, you're just well-disposed towards your team, that's all. Quite honestly I don't think this Pawelka succeeded in his cause either. If the WDR report is right in guessing, Pawelka banged his head against a legal brick wall, so to speak. True or not, his attempt alone certainly injured Polish-German relations and, unintentional though it probably was, he opened up old sores connected to WW2. When Pawelka was bad-mouthed in the Anti-Polonism article, I don't think it were anti-German feelings but pro-polonism feelings involved (I don't know whether this is still the case but the anti-americanism article once had a similar problem). And in the anti-polonism article we have this football effect again: one side (to which for example I belong) feels it faces injustice in the form of slander and POV-pushing while the other feels it is okay, whereas when the side I'm in undoes what they consider to be injustice, the other side (in which for example Witkacy and Molobo are) feels it faces injustice in the form of POV-pushing or vandalism. Since Wikipedia is luckily supposed to be a mirror of the truth and not who may live in a house or who should be expelled to the advantage of another, any dispute can be shifted to the talk page, where it should be discussed over what and why people are devided, and what the truth is. I know that in the final analysis it almost amounts to the same thing: one party is benefitted at the expense of the other, yet there's a third, albeit passive, party profitting: the readers who use wikipedia for education - those who immediately accept it as truth (Last year my speech on Australian history was based on wikipedia to 50% and, given that my English teacher was really obsessed with Australia and therefore knew a lot of the truth, I was very glad that the article was close to the truth and 14/15 points as mark demonstrated the gladness of that teacher too). I thank you for helping to find out what's true and what's fiction (for example you found Pawelka's speech), Alx-pl, and of course your rather impartial mediation here. My proposal for a sentence related to Pawelka would something like this be "<i>Sometimes anti-polonistic sentiment is suspected of people who discriminate against Poles - for example Rudi Pawelka, of the Preußische Treuhand, caused a shock in Poland after he and the Preußische Treuhand tried to initiate legal proceedings against the expulsion of Germans after WW2 from area that belonged to Germany even before WW2. By demanding that German exiles should get their property back or money of the same value, he hurt Polish-German relations, opened up old sores caused by atrocities by the Third Reich against Poland and argued with indifference to Poles whose property he wants to be given to the exiles.</i>"<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a></dd>

<p>12:28, 23 August 2005 (UTC) The proposed statement doesn't fit what we talk about.What we talk about is Pawelka's attempts to portay Poland as thief, aggressor and treaty creating Poland as injust.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 19:06, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>NightBeAsT, you are doing a very good job. I think your previous reply was very much to the point, and in fact gave rise to much deeper summary of the Pawelka case. I think your proposal is very good. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 13:22, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Molobo, let me cite the definition of anti-Polonism: <i>Anti-Polonism [...] is a term denoting an irrational or malicious hostility toward Poles as a nation or as a cultural community.</i> The case of my mother's neighbour is an illustration of the way Pawelka's action is hostile against Poles. Thus it is definitely to the point. Unfortunately, one cannot exclude that Pawelka is just stupid and that's why the word <i>suspected</i> is used, and of course the text by NightBeAsT should be illustrated by sources which will give the readers a chance to asses their opinion. The propaganda that Pawelka uses in his speach is just and only a tool to achieve his end of property retribution and with this regard it is of minor importance. What's more it is always the case that when one plans an aggression then he wants to portray his opponent in bad light. That's why it can be OK to omit this issue. Of course, if you think it is of importance here, you can add a suitable sentence so that we all could discuss it.</p>
<p>The CDU/CSU and BdV case is of course worth mentioning, but it can be rationally discussed after the formulation for Preußische Treuhand is settled, because its meaning is totally dependant on the PT thing. There is a suitable section below to discuss in. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 20:14, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really don't think Pawelka's IQ is of importance here.He clearly blamed Poland for its aggresion prior IIWW, considered treaty which created Poland injust and described Polish uprising against German state as aggression.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 20:27, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I feel like you are reading in my mind. But note that he is using a very peculiar language. A language which sounds in ears of PT in one way, in ears of Poles in another way and in ears of Europeans in yet another way. This is the point where his treachery lies. I understand that you want to mention something about Pawelka's statement concerning the guilt. Let us analyse it once more:
<ul>
<li>"ungelöste Probleme und Spannungen in Europa waren auch vor 1933 vorhanden" (<i>unsolved problems and tensions in Europe existed before 1933 as well</i>) - and this is perfectly objective statement; after his enumeration of Polish actions before WWII we Poles have no doubt about his intent, but French or English may think he just enumerates some of the problems;</li>
<li>"Es bedurfte nur eines Diktators Hitler, der diese Situation zur Explosion brachte." (<i>It needed only a dictator like Hitler to get into an explosion</i>) - I think this is uncivilized, but hardly to the point in anti-Polonism.</li>
<li>When he refers to the Versaille treaty he cites Lloyd George which makes his statemens sound objective in the ears of (simple minded) "Europeans"; Lloyd George is a respectable politician in their minds.</li>
<li>Then he refers to sufferings of Germans before WWII which are objective, and it sounds really OK in ears of (simple minded) "Europeans", but it is really suspicious in Polish ones, as Poles were also behind the German border and suffered the same or worse.</li>
<li>"polnische Aggressionen gegen seine Nachbarn: ..." (<i>Polish agressions against their neighbouring countries:...</i>) which are and were indeed agressions in eyes of Russians, Czechs and Germans; again this is perfectly all right and objective in the eyes of a (simple minded) "European" (while in Polish ears the interpretation is that it was just a protection of Polish ethnic citizens, since all the Poles who were left behind the borders suffered anti-Polish oppression, as this was the mood in the times between the great wars).</li>
<li>To make this passage less suspicious he concludes: "Es geht keineswegs um eine Aufrechnung oder um Relativierung des Handelns des NS-Staates,..." (<i>The aim is not to recalculate or relativize the deeds of the Nazi state,...</i>) which sounds like he is a man of truth and virtue in ears of a (simple minded) "European", but in Polish ears it is simply a lie (see my analysis above).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Summing up, it is nowhere that he states explicitely that Poland was guilty for WWII. You can atribute him objectively at most a statement that Poland actively took part in injustice after the Versaille treaty and that this injustice should be in the center of the discussion about the reasons for WWII. (This of course is immediately recognized by me and other Poles as a reversal of guilt, especially in the context of the aims of Preußische Treuhand.) And (simple minded) "Europeans" may think that he presented facts.</dd>
<dd>Let's contemplate a bit this analysis and let's try to find a neutral description of the case. I understand that we aim at adding something to the description by NightBeAsT above. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 22:22, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>" A language which sounds in ears of PT in one way, in ears of Poles in another way and in ears of Europeans in yet another way. " There are no "Europeans", they are Portugese,Ukrainians, Fins, Lithuanians etc.Wikipiedia aims of objective and neutral portayal of things, not showing every national stereotype as you propose.So from the begining your proposal is flawed.You may start articles Ukrainian-Polish relations,Portugese-Polish relations.Nothing stops you. However your claim is wrong on other grounds more important-Pawelka address this not to mythical Europeans, but to Germans, who know both German history and German propaganda.He basically repeats the same Nazi slogans used to justify aggresion against Poland.I doubt he doesn't know what he is doing-reinforcing Nazi propaganda by claiming it is true.Any mention about Pawelka should mention fact that he simply repeats propaganda invented and used by Nazis.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note, that this is not a proposal of content, but an analysis that tries to show different points of view. As for Nazi propaganda, please, give suitable citations from Hitler and Pawelka in one place so that everybody (even Mexicans or Canadians who do not care about Poland) could immediately state that it is really the case. And please formulate it so that it is addressed to a potential Mexican or Canadian as you do not need to explain to me what's already obvious. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 06:12, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please bring polls that show Canadians and Mexicans are indifferent to Poland. Molobo.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you know the history of Canadian border? Do you know the history of Mexican border? Do you know the border states of both USA and Canada? Do you know the border states of USA and Mexico? Do you know the country with which Mexico has ist southern border? What are the Mexican states at the border? Maybe you know all these facts (or at least you can read it in 10 minutes from Wikipedia), but they are not commonly taught in the schools in Poland, in Germany or France either. Can you give a poll that shows that in spite of the fact that these people (I mean at least Poles) are not taught those things they somehow acquired the knowledge? <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 13:17, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fear such discussion is irelevant to the article.I am still waiting for polls confirming your POV.Please ask me personal questions on my talk page in the future.However I don't think it is that all important compared to Pawelka using Nazi propaganda, so for now we may leave it.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 17:19, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Pawelka speech and Hitler ones</span></h4>
<p>As to speeches <a href="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html</a> "Versailles was the cradle of a Polish State which had emerged from the untold sacrifice of blood - not of Polish but of German and Russian blood. Poland, who for centuries past had proved herself incapable of existence, was in 1916 artificially begotten and in 1919 no less artificially born by a German government just as incapable of existence.</p>
<p>In utter disregard of almost 500 years of experience, without consideration for the lesson of historical development during many centuries, without appreciation for ethnographic conditions and with no regard for all economic expediencies, a State was constructed at Versailles which, according to its whole nature, was sooner or later bound to become the cause of a most serious crisis.</p>
<p>A man who, I am sorry to say, now ranks among our fiercest enemies, at that time clearly foresaw all this. I mean Mr. Lloyd George. Like so many others he sounded warning, not only at the time of the creation of that structure but also in the course of its subsequent expansion which had taken place in utter disregard of reason and right.</p>
<p>At that time he expressed apprehension that in that State an accumulation of conditions was being created containing the risk of conflicts which sooner or later might lead to great European complications.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, conditions surrounding the structure of this new so-called State, as far as its nationalities were concerned, could not be clarified until now. It requires some knowledge of Polish census methods to realize how utterly alien to truth, and therefore irrelevant, statistics on the national composition of that territory were and are.</p>
<p>In 1919 the Poles laid claims to the territory where they pretended to have a majority of 95 per cent - in East Prussia, for instance - whereas a plebiscite later showed the Poles actually had reached a figure of 2 per cent.</p>
<p>In the State finally created, which contained parts of former Russia, Austria, and Germany, non-Polish elements were so brutally ill-treated, suppressed, tyrannized and tortured that any plebiscite depended entirely on the good will of local administrative officials for producing such results as were desired or demanded. " "Unlimited patience and still greater self-restraint were called for because many of the regional Polish administrative officials took the understanding between Germany and Poland to be merely a license for the persecution and annihilation of the Germans in Poland with even less risk. In the few years up to 1922 more than one-and-a-half million Germans had been forced to leave their homes. "</p>
<p>Almost exact copy of Pawelka's speech.Except of course it was made by Hitler.Both even cite Lloyd George... And another&#160;: <a href="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/09-13-39.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/09-13-39.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hitler.org/speeches/09-13-39.html</a> "The fact that a province was torn from the German Reich and that other German territories were given to the Polish State was explained on the grounds of national necessity. Later, plebiscites everywhere showed that no one wished to become a part of the Polish State - that Polish State which arose out of the blood of countless German regiments. It then expanded at the expense of old settlement areas and above all at the expense of intelligence and economic possibility."</p>
<p>"Poland itself was a 'nationalities State.' That very thing had been created here which had been held against the old Austrian State. At the same time Poland was never a democracy. One very thin anemic upper class here ruled not only foreign nationalities but also its so-called own people.</p>
<p>It was a State built on force and governed by the truncheons of the police and the military. The fate of Germans in this State was horrible"</p>
<p>" The world, which immediately sheds tears when Germany expels a Polish Jew who only a few decades ago came to Germany, remained dumb and deaf toward the misery of those who, numbering not thousands but millions, were forced to leave their home country on account of Versailles - that is, if these unfortunates were Germans. What was for us and also for me most depressing was the fact that we had to suffer all this from a State which was far inferior to us; for, after all, Germany is a Great Power, even though madmen believed the vital rights of a great nation could be wiped out by a crazy treaty or by dictation.</p>
<p>Germany was a big power and had to look on while a far inferior people of a far inferior State maltreated these Germans. There were two especially unbearable conditions: First, this city whose German character nobody could deny was not only prevented from returning to the Reich but in addition an attempt was made to Polonize it by all kinds of devices; second, the province [East Prussia] severed from the German Reich had no direct contact with the Reich, but traffic with this province was dependent upon all kinds of chicanery or upon the good will of this Polish State.</p>
<p>No power on earth would have borne this condition as long as Germany. I do not know what England would have said about a similar peace solution at its expense or how America or France would have accepted it. I attempted to find a solution - a tolerable solution - even for this problem. I submitted this attempt to the Polish rulers in the form of verbal proposals. You know these proposals. They were more than moderate.... "</p>

<dd>Molobo, Alx-pl is less likely to be anti-polonistic than you are because, unlike you, he doesn't make use of the article to slander people or other countries, undermining the article's credibility. And by giving a positive impression of Poles (and yes, if you were German, Molobo, I'd be embarrassed too by your behaviour) Alx-pl and Micha do their best to show us that not all Poles are like you but fair, honest and in possession of a desire to find the truth. A Pole being anti-polonistic would be like a German being anti-German or a Japanese being anti-Japanese, in other words extremely unlikely. So if Alx says that Pawelka must be treated in a civilised manner and knowing that Alx is not anti-polonistic, there might be something wrong with your assertion that Pawelka is such an Anti-Polonist as you call him to be.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 13:58, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Summing up, it is nowhere that he states explicitely that Poland was guilty for WWII."

Es kann in diesem Zusammenhang nicht verschwiegen werden, welchen Leidensweg die 2,4 Millionen Deutschen in Polen bis 1939 gehen mussten, in der Tschechoslowakei waren es über 3 Millionen, die gegen ihren Willen in den neuen Staat gepresst wurden. Eine große Fluchtwelle und Vertreibungen aus Polen erfasste etwa eine Million Deutsche bis 1939." Quite obvious lie and attempt to show Poland as responsible for war.

<p>Good.I quoted above similiar propaganda statements of Hitler.If you wish more examples, I posses a copy of scientific paper published by Wroclaw University describing German propaganda in occupied Poland.

<p>The second item on the program was, therefore, the struggle against Versailles. No one can say that I express this opinion for the first time today.

<dd><b>Comparison Pawelka-Hitler:</b>
<ul>
<li>Pawelka distances himself from Hitler and Nazi state at the beginning: <i>Es beschämt mich zutiefst, was ein nationalsozialistischer Staat angerichtet hat. Für ein Kulturvolk, das der Welt so viel gegeben hat, ist dies kaum fassbar.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><i>Es erzürnt mich aber auch, wenn alle Untaten von Deutschen ständig benannt, wenn Aggression und Schuld anderer Länder plötzlich nicht mehr zählen und mit dem Verweis auf 1933 oder 1939 weggewischt werden. Die Geschichte des zweiten Weltkrieges fängt aber nicht 1933 an,</i> - this sentence has got no direct corresponding one, as it is related to the situation after WW2.</dd>
<dd><i>ungelöste Probleme und Spannungen in Europa waren auch vor 1933 vorhanden.</i> can be related with <i>Unlimited [German] patience and still greater self-restraint were called for</i> from <a href="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html" rel="nofollow">10-06-39</a>; although there is no direct reference to tensions in Europe before 1933.</dd>
<dd><i>Es bedurfte nur eines Diktators Hitler, der diese Situation zur Explosion brachte.</i> - no comparison possible, as it concernes Hitler himself.</dd>
<dd><i>Es ist unredlich, wenn man von dem ungerechten und das Selbstbestimmungsrecht missachtendenden Diktat von Versailles 1919 nicht mehr spricht, das der britische Premierminister Lloyd George als Keim für den nächsten Krieg bezeichnete.</i> - this can be related quite directly to
<dl>
<dd><i>In utter disregard of almost 500 years of experience, without consideration for the lesson of historical development during many centuries, without appreciation for ethnographic conditions and with no regard for all economic expediencies, a State was constructed at Versailles which, according to its whole nature, was sooner or later bound to become the cause of a most serious crisis.</i></dd>
<dd><i>A man who, I am sorry to say, now ranks among our fiercest enemies, at that time clearly foresaw all this. I mean Mr. Lloyd George. Like so many others he sounded warning, not only at the time of the creation of that structure but also in the course of its subsequent expansion which had taken place in utter disregard of reason and right.</i></dd>
<dd><i>At that time he expressed apprehension that in that State an accumulation of conditions was being created containing the risk of conflicts which sooner or later might lead to great European complications.</i></dd>

<dd><i>Es kann in diesem Zusammenhang nicht verschwiegen werden, welchen Leidensweg die 2,4 Millionen Deutschen in Polen bis 1939 gehen mussten,</i> can be related to the sentence <i>Unlimited patience and still greater self-restraint were called for because many of the regional Polish administrative officials took the understanding between Germany and Poland to be merely a license for the persecution and annihilation of the Germans in Poland with even less risk</i> although the Hitler sentence is more harsh.</dd>
<dd><i>in der Tschechoslowakei waren es über 3 Millionen, die gegen ihren Willen in den neuen Staat gepresst wurden.</i> - this concerns Czechoslovakia, and there is no menion of the case in Hitler's speeches presented by Molobo</dd>
<dd><i>Eine große Fluchtwelle und Vertreibungen aus Polen erfasste etwa eine Million Deutsche bis 1939.</i> can be related to the sentence <i>In the few years up to 1922 more than one-and-a-half million Germans had been forced to leave their homes.</i> from <a href="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hitler.org/speeches/10-06-39.html" rel="nofollow">10-06-39</a>, but the sentences concern different periods of time.</dd>

<dd>but the relation is very vague.</dd>
<dd><i>Oktober 1938 Einmarsch in das tschechische Olsagebiet und Annexion des Gebiets.</i> - no direct reference.</dd>
<dd><i>Es geht keineswegs um eine Aufrechnung oder um Relativierung des Handelns des NS-Staates, es geht um Wahrheit, Menschenrechte und um die Abwehr des Versuchs, Untaten hinter deutschen Untaten zu verstecken.</i> Pawleka again distances himself from the Nazi state and mentions that he wants to obtain the truth; this cannot be directly related to Hitler.</dd>
<dd>Summing up, Pawelka presents certain pieces of information that are present in the Hitler's speeches and distances himself from Hitler. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 22:19, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah certain pieces of information.Why not a more precise word Alx "propaganda". And lets compare our two German leaders Pawelka and Hitler&#160;: Adolf Hitler "Versailles was the cradle of a Polish State which had emerged from the untold sacrifice of blood - not of Polish but of German and Russian blood. Poland, who for centuries past had proved herself incapable of existence, was in 1916 artificially begotten and in 1919 no less artificially born by a German government just as incapable of existence." Hitler uses a phrase "Poland, who for centuries past had proved herself incapable of existence" suggesting that Poland can't exist as a country. What does Pawelka use&#160;? "Epigonen des kommunistischen Unrechtsstaates" Hitler-a state incapable of existance. Pawelka-a lawless state Quite similar. Let's see next Hitler:" I mean Mr. Lloyd George. Like so many others he sounded warning, not only at the time of the creation of that structure but also in the course of its subsequent expansion which had taken place in utter disregard of reason and right." Pawelka "Es ist unredlich, wenn man von dem ungerechten und das Selbstbestimmungsrecht missachtendenden Diktat von Versailles 1919 nicht mehr spricht, das der britische Premierminister Lloyd George als Keim für den nächsten Krieg bezeichnete" The same. Let's see next: Hitler</p>
<pre>
not thousands but millions, were forced to leave their home country on account of Versailles - that is, if these unfortunates were Germans.
</pre>
<p>Pawelka Es kann in diesem Zusammenhang nicht verschwiegen werden, welchen Leidensweg die 2,4 Millionen Deutschen in Polen bis 1939 gehen mussten, in der Tschechoslowakei waren es über 3 Millionen, die gegen ihren Willen in den neuen Staat gepresst wurden. Pawelka makes more details then Hitler but it is the same statement.</p>
<p>Next: Hitler In the few years up to 1922 more than one-and-a-half million Germans had been forced to leave their homes. (From me-this is a lie.German government encouraged migration of Germans to Weimar Republic) Pawelka Eine große Fluchtwelle und Vertreibungen aus Polen erfasste etwa eine Million Deutsche bis 1939.</p>
<p>The same.</p>
<p>Next: Hitler: The fate of Germans in this State was horrible. Pawelka: Mai 1921 Überfall auf das deutsche Oberschlesien verbunden mit <b>unsäglichen Grausamkeiten an der deutschen Bevölkerung</b> Again both use the same propaganda. Next: Hitler: In the few years up to 1922 more than one-and-a-half million Germans had been forced to leave their homes. They were hunted out, often without being able to take even their most necessary clothing. Pawelka:</p>
<pre>
Eine große Fluchtwelle und Vertreibungen aus Polen erfasste etwa eine Million Deutsche bis 1939.

<dd>Neither the choice of words nor the grammar coincides except that they both criticise Poland for the same thing and use rhetoric, like any politician does in a speech. Of course you're trying to compare Pawelka to Hitler although you know very well that your assumption is too far-fetched, thus showing us a similar rhetoric because you cherrypicked Hitler's criticism for only one reason: people disapprove of him like of no other and if you can manage to compare Pawelka to Hitler, you'd have done your own little propaganda. Show me a reliable source that too thinks Pawelka copied Hitler's rhetoric, otherwise I'd call it original research if you try to put the idea into article: that's your own theory.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 13:58, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Translated: "It also angers me when all the atrocities of Germans are always named, when aggression and guilt of other countries do not count anymore." So what? The brutal expulsion of Germans after World War II is arguable an atrocity. Does he say Poland is guilty for World War II? No, he said it was the diktator Hitler, who brought the situation in Europe to explosion, not a Miss Poland. Again you're leaping to conclusions.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 23:07, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"The brutal expulsion of Germans after World War II is arguable an atrocity. " Please spare us nationalist revisionism irrelevant to the topic.Population transfer of German and Polish population under Soviet control wasn't an atrocity.</p>
<p>Also Pawelka clearly speaks about Polish guilt: "Wer 1933 anfängt, geht auch hinweg über polnische Aggressionen gegen seine Nachbarn: 1918 / 19 Einfall in Russland und Annexion großer Gebiete, Mai 1921 Überfall auf das deutsche Oberschlesien verbunden mit unsäglichen Grausamkeiten an der deutschen Bevölkerung, Oktober 1938 Einmarsch in das tschechische Olsagebiet und Annexion des Gebiets." In this statement he lies several times, as it was Bolshevik Russia which invaded Poland,Belarus, Balts and Ukraine, and he names Polish uprising in Upper Silesia an attack or invasion, not only that but he accusess Poles of atrocities(like Hitler),he fails to mention that Zaolzie was taken over by Czechs in Polish-Bolshevik war. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 23:12, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No atrocity? Especially not when one or two million Germans "happened" to die? Then it's called a liberation, isn't it? And that's "nationalist revisionism" to say the brutal expulsion of Germans after World War II is not an atrocity? Oh, I too think it was an atrocity and every German government in Germany after World War II thought it was an injustice too. And if you accuse him of lying, you have to prove he was wrong and that he knew he was wrong.

<p>Well perhaps instead of vandalising pages you should read some books&#160;? How about this one&#160;: Rüdiger Overman "Deutsche Militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg" The deaths during flight and expulsion concerned the Germans in the immediate postwar period as much as the fate of the missing soldiers, and similar efforts were made to clarify the fate of the missing civilians or bring families together. A huge scientific project reconstructed the events historiographically, the Federal Statistics Office (Statistisches Bundesamt), the refugees’ associations and the clerical search service did a lot with the financial support of the Federal Government to quantitatively assess the fate of those expelled as accurately as possible. The result can be summarized in the conclusion that about 2 million Germans had been killed during flight and expulsion - not including those from the respective territories who had died during military service.</p>
<p>These casualty figures, however, which for decades have been an integral part of the respective serious literature, are the result not of a counting of death records or similar concrete data, but of a population balance which concluded that the fate of about 2 million inhabitants of the expulsion territories could not be clarified and that it must therefore be assumed that they had lost their lives in the course of these events. In the last years, however, these statements have been increasingly questioned, as the studies about the sum of reported deaths showed that the number of victims can hardly have been higher than 500,000 persons - which is also an unimaginable number of victims, but nevertheless only a quarter of the previous data. In favor of the hitherto assumed numbers it could always be said, however, that the balance didn’t say that the death of these people had been proven, but only that their fate could not be clarified. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 16:19, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In this piece of his long speech that you took out of its context, he never mentioned any liberation of Poland but just an attack on Germany and I've no idea whether or not he is right, nor whether or not you're right. If he is wrong, post a reliable source which says Pawelka was wrong there, because the respected polish newspaper made no mention of it, so they must have found it irrelevant or right too. I know you like to cherrypick and assume bad faith when it comes to Pawelka, so please find a source which criticises Pawelka there and thus suggests that this part of the speech is relevant and wrong to any extent. Please search for an English or German one or, if you translate it at least this time, a Polish one.

<p>He names a Polish uprising an invasion against Germany.Polish papers already said about it. .He named the Polish uprising in Silesia an Polish aggression.</p>
<p><br />
Yes and Scheidemann, that Social democrat who made Germany a Republic and hated the treaty of Versailles to the extent that he threw his political career out of the window with anger, is by far the worst of them all. A history book says his words even mirrored the mood of Germany. All German parties were against the treaty. And let's not forget the "Nazi" Henry Kissinger, who dismissed the treaty as "a brittle compromise agreement between American utopism and European paranoia" and let's not forget the USA, which disillusioned by the fact that it ignored almost all of Wilson's 14 points, didn't even join the League of Nations in protest. The British parlamentarian Philip Snowden called the treaty at that time a "deathblow to all those who had hope the treaty is going to give us more peace. It's not a peace treaty but a declaration of another war." And a caricature was created in Britain (before Hitler came to power) with a man with a spiked helmet crawling out of a rolled-up document which read "Treaty of Versailles" and this man was titled "Hitler party". And yes, according to its definition (see <a href="../../../../de/d/i/k/Diktat.html" class="extiw" title="de:Diktat">de:Diktat</a> ), it was a diktat. What does the Duden say? "Versailler Vertrag: [...] Reverting the treaty of Versailles, which was overwhelmingly seen by the German population as injust diktat by the victors and blamed Germany completely for WW1, had been the main aim of the German foreign politics since 1919." Even my former history teacher called the treaty of Versailles a diktat. Just read <a href="../../../../de/d/i/k/Diktat.html" class="extiw" title="de:Diktat">de:Diktat</a> It was a treaty which "exceeded the worst fears", which was a "Diktatfriede" ("Diktatepeace") for Germany and a "Siegfriede" ("Vicorypeace") for France, the German signatories were insulted as "Novemberverbrecher" ("Novembercriminals") or "Erfüllungspolitker" ("Fulfillment-politicians"), it caused an "Anti-Versailles-trauma" or "Anti-Versailles-complex", it meant "humiliation, disgrace, discrimination, fraud, powerlessness, Diktate, an attack at honour and a reduction of self-determination" to Germans which then wanted "revenge, rage and its revision". My history book writes "Schmach- und Diktatfrieden" ("disgrace and diktatepeace") and "Schanddiktat von Versailles" (disgrace-diktat of Versailles) became effective slogans in Germany. Searching for "Versaillerdiktat" with Google leads to 3 hits, "Versaillesdiktat": 14, "Diktatfriede": 99, ""Diktat of Versailles"": 104, "Schanddiktat": 304, ""Versailler diktat"": 605, "Diktatfrieden": 658, ""Diktat von Versailles"": 701 (that's what Pawelka said), ""Diktat Versailles"": 6.430, ""Versailles diktat"": 8.430, (altogether, without inverted commas) "Versailles Diktat": 13.100 and how many hits are connected to the "Versailler Vertrag" in the German language in general: 47.700 --&gt; of all the 47.700 hits, you can find 13.100 mentions of "Diktat". Why's that? Maybe the Duden's 'Lexikon der Allgemeinbildung' (= encyclopedia of general knowledge) can help: "Versailler Vertrag: [...] Reverting the treaty of Versailles, which was overwhelmingly seen by the German population as an injust diktat by the victors and blamed Germany completely for WW1, had been the main aim of the German foreign politics since 1919." No matter how you see it: from the definition of the word Pawelka was right (check a dictionary) and just because he used a word that even Hitler once said as well as millions of Germans, it doesn't make him a Nazi, I'm afraid, or else anyone who speaks German is a Nazi because Hitler wrote and spoke a lot in German. And stop snatching parts of my speech out of the context, molobo. As well as distracting from the main message and making us lose the overview of the discussion, they are going nowhere. Maybe that's your intention: you've managed to make the entire talk page unreadable.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 01:45, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's merely your illusion that the President of Preußische Treuhand has accused Poland of WW2, it merely your interpretation that this would be anti-polonistic and then it's close to being absolutely irrelevant whether or not Merkel or Stoiber were reported of having visited the organizations. Politically these two politicians belong to the current opposition. Schröder, the political leader of Germany, has expressed disapproval of the organization. Since the organizations are political and have caused much debate and are lead by a CDU politician, yes, why shouldn't the leaders of the CDU, Merkel and Stoiber, not have a look at them? They've surely visited dozends of other organizations even if they have agreed with them, and they've certainly done many things they would later regret, like Stoiber's recent embarrassing statement against East Germans. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a></dd>

<dd>The mentioned article is about a Pole with a German wife living in Germany. The man became violent against the family during the divorce, that’s why he is only aloud to see the children once in a month under the protection of an government institution in Hamburg. This institution says, that he has to talk to the children in German, otherwise they couldn’t understand what they are talking about. The Polish newspaper “Wrpost” brought that story on page one with the headline “Polnisch Verboten”. The story (as always in the newspaper “Wrpost”) was full of Anti- German stereotypes without any information about the background of the story. That’s reason why Poles don’t know about the violence of the Husband against his wife and his children. They even don’t know about the need of this treatment. You can see, that the source being used doesn’t show any evidence for Anti- Polonism. Its completely made up as the other sources. Volker</dd>

<dd>The fear of cheap labour from East Europe which comes to Western Europe is not completely without reasons. In East Europe people work for less money than in France for example people would do and so some Eastern Europeans come to France to earn more money for the same work, but still less than a Frenchman would demand. And if an employer sees an employee who wants less money than another, which employee do you think will get the job? The French? If you insist on defining Anti-Polonism as an <b>irrational</b> fear, it's opinionated to state the fear as example of Anti-Polonism because irrational says the fear is not based on reasons, which may be your POV.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 20:29, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
