	    <p>Rationale:</p>
<p>Since the consensus is that Anarchism generally means anti-state <b>and</b> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalist.html" title="Anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a>, there needs to be a page to describe anti-statism in general. I hope everyone can agree on this page not to use "Anarchism" as a generic synonym for "Anti-statism" so as not to bait the POV warriors. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 30 June 2005 12:48 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, there is no consensus on that --too many POV warriors trying to make up their own definition. Anyway, I don't get this article. The intro says "Anti-statism refers to all philosophies that in some degree reject or oppose the establishment of a state, or territorial national governments.." What does that mean? Either you oppose the establishment of a state or you don't. There are no "degrees." Now, there are varying opinions on how <i>much</i> of a preponderance the state should have, in regard to restraining individual freedom. Is that what's it's trying to say? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:34, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good point. For a philosophy to be anti-statist, it must be against the existence of a state, either immediately or as a programmatic goal. Note that this uses the <i>social science</i> definition of "statism," not the economic one. I'll fix things in the article now. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 16:57, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the article attempts to list the "completely anti-statist" philosophies, but you would have to list every one wouldn't you? That would be identical to what would be listed in the anarchism article. Complete anti-statism is anarchism. This article is bizarre. How about a vote for deletion? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:40, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think there's a valid element to explore here RJII in terms of liberal and marxist partially anti-statist philosophies: ie, council communism, autonomism, etc. They're not "anarchist" in the historical meaning or in the ancient greek meaning, but they're relatively connected. I'd vote against a delete, but someone needs to thematically deal with why political ideologies are anti-state, and the different reasons and historical causes for the specific anti-state stances of those ideologies.<a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 08:06, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RJ, IMO this is not the place to push a definition of anarchism as a generic term for anti-statism. I know it seems patently obvious to you, but it is nowhere near universal usage, esp. with those who are interested in these particular movements. The purpouse of this article is to be a place to actually consolidate the various strains of anti-statist thought in a straightforward NPOV manner. There is no reason to start that POV war here. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 15:37, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not debatable. The usage of <b>anarchism = anti-statism</b> is virtually universal in English dictionaries.<a href="http://www.onelook.com/?w=anarchism&amp;ls=a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onelook.com/?w=anarchism&amp;ls=a" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Then this article should be a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>. If anti-statism = anarchism, there's no point in having two separate articles, is there? The whole reason why this article was created in the first place was because "anti-statism" is a broader term than "anarchism". -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 02:47, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A philosophy is "anti-statist" if it opposes the state. It is possible to oppose the state without calling for an immediate abolition of the state. Thoreau's "evolutionary anarchism" is a good example. But a philosophy which explicitly endorses the state, even that state is eventually to be eliminated, can not be considered anti-statist IMO. Thus Marxism, at least in it's classic form, is not anti-statist since it endorses "the dictatorship of the proletariat." Shouldn't we eliminate all forms of Marxism from the list? (Unless it's a school which disavows the dictatorship of the proles?) <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 18:27, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say it isn't anti-statist. If Marx had advocated minarchism as a means to anarchism, sure, but he advocated big government. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:16, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh. Read Manifesto, then read Gotha Programme. Marx comes out for a minimal workers state comprising the nationalisation of the banks in public hands in Manifesto. This is about as far as Marx himself goes in favour of government in the "first stage of communism". Marx very clearly indicates that the "higher stage of communism", ie, a stateless society, is the goal of communism. Additionally, Marx doesn't advocate the dictatorship of the proletariat in a programmatic way. Its mentioned as a secondary point in a minor work. You're thinking of Lenin. Then again, for Lenin and the dictatorship of the proletariat, read State and Revolution which clearly spells out Lenin's conception of what a State is: armed bodies of people claiming the right to use force. State and Revolution's state during the "first stage of communism" is a very open thing, and its definition is so minimal as to be smaller than that advocated by classical liberals. You might also start by looking up the Autonomism, Council Communism and Left Communist articles, all of which are very clearly anti-statist marxisms. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 22:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Marxism is Statist. Communism and Socialism are scams by which big governments steal the hard-earned wealth of a few citizens to give to a bunch of losers who are too lazy to work. Commies who claim that Marxism isn't statist are either retarded or ignorant. 69.19.14.44 00:20, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't agree with THE definition as being opposition to the existence of a state. One can oppose <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statism.html" title="Statism">statism</a> while still supporting the existence, and continued existence, of a state. Merriam-Webster defines statism as: ":concentration of economic controls and planning in the hands of a highly centralized government." There are two main definitions of statism --one of which is opposition to the very existence of a state. So, it would seem to me that anti-statism can mean two things --anarchism and minarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:06, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, you're right - there are two reasonable definitions. I've always used the adjective "anti-state" to describe a belief that there should be no state, and therefore "anti-statism" to be the name for that belief system. But instead of the root being "anti-state" and the suffix "ism," you see the root as "statism" and the prefix as "anti." Would you like to rewrite the intro to include both definitions, RJII? If you don't care to, I will. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 21:55, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly disagree with declaring libertarian socialism and individualist anarchism as the two main branches of anarchism, and listing all other branches as subgroups of these two. Such a classification is completely unfounded in fact. Instead, we should keep the old idea of dividing the branches of anarchism in two loose "currents". Also, Voluntaryism does not need to be listed separately, since, as its article explains, it is just an older name for anarcho-capitalism. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 03:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
