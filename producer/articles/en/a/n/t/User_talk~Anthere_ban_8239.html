	    <p>I set this page myself. I did so because RK put unnice comments on my talk and user page. I didnot want these comments to stay there, hence I created this page to host them (a sort of raincloud). Apparently, I was not the only one thinking it was wrong to let unnice comments on my user page, since someone felt the need to protect it a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><br />
I gave this title to the page, because RK has several times called for a hard ban on me (for example <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Gaia_philosophy&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Gaia_philosophy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I think he is entitled to his opinion, and thought of providing him a place where he could give and defend arguments. As it appears, he is the only one supporting the idea I am a troll, harassing him, a pathological liar, unable to work with others, mentally disturbed and needing help, pushing my religion and political position on others, with such a poor english I should restrict my contributions to the french wikipedia... Hopefully, RK changed his mind&#160;:-)<br />
I am not offended by this page when so many people supported me. I am much more offended by the leftovers of RK's opinion on me in article talk pages. I hope he will refactor them as he promised to do <a href="../../../g/a/i/Talk%7EGaia_hypothesis_ca5b.html" title="Talk:Gaia hypothesis">here</a>. (<i>Update&#160;: he did not. I moved some of the stuff <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_Archives_Gaia_bbcd.html" title="User:Anthere/Archives/Gaia">there</a>).</i></p>
<p>In the perspective of <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-violence.html" title="Non-violence">non-violence</a>, I will update this page for history, then blank it, and delink it from my user page. It would be wrong of me to keep it so visible when the case appears close. However, in case anyone should later ask for a ban on me again, I think it could be useful for background.</p>

<p>Anthere, stop this harassment and trolling. You may not unilaterally disrupt our Biology articles. I have tried to work with you before, but you refused to discuss anything; you just kept on using reversions. And now you doing this unfriendly activity again? No talk? No discussion? No care about how thousands of other English speakers and scientists use these terms? For shame. We have already explained why these naming changes were being made. In fact, were you a competant English speaker, you already would have known why. English speakers DO NOT use the bizarre terminology that alone use. You can't rewrite every Wikipedia entry on this subject to use a non-existent terminology. This has already been explained to you before by me and by others, but you refuse to even comment on this point. Now you again engage in reversions to force the rest of thr world to go by you? Sorry, lady, but Wikipedia doesn't work that. English speakers do NOT use the terms you use, plain and simple. I have read books on this subject, article on the subject, and did Google searches over hundreds of websites...and your claims are FALSE. No one uses your terminology, and insiting on it only confuses English speaking Wikipedia readers. This isn't the French Wikipedia, its the English one. If you don't like, it go elsewhere. But your disrutpive behaviour, your reversions, and your refusal to even admit that English speakers *might* be misled by your private terminology only proves that you are not a team player.

<p>Let's ban Anthere because she's been in an edit war, and no respectable wikipedian has ever been in an edit war! Yeah! Also, she's using a pseudonym, and no respectable wikipedian uses a pseudonym!

<dl>
<dd>Seconded. I think it only fair to note that her English language skills are less than "perfect". For this offense alone, she should be not only banned but drawn and quartered, and then we should mince the quarters into little bits which should be fed to the Trolls we keep locked up in the dungeon, and then we could...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, on second thought, let's not ban Anthere, because it would be <b>stupid</b> to do so given how she's a valuable contributor and not a vandal or troll. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> 05:03 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a reminder for our gentle readers, no one has said anything about banning Anthere except RK, who has very much harmed any case he may have by such ad-hominem attacks. As long as this is a conflict of personality, it is not solvable except by shouting until one or all participants are booted out to give the rest of Wikipedia some peace. That's why we seek to achieve a state of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">WikiLove</a> -- we (all of us!) need to calm down and look rationally at the situation when the editing gets hot.</dd>

Ask what is <i>right</i> with their approach. Ask what is wrong with <i>your own</i> approach. (It could happen! Even I am wrong sometimes. From time to time.) Remember that <i>no human being</i> really has a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>, and that even our best efforts are only approximations, which to achieve fullness require a give-and-take with others with different points of view. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 06:15 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have tried to work with you before, but you refused to discuss anything; you just kept on using reversions. And now you doing this unfriendly activity again? No talk? No discussion?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I explained my reversion in the talk page. You didnot explain your move. let's keep thing into the right point.</dd>
</dl>
<p>No care about how thousands of other English speakers and scientists use these terms? For shame.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. I care about users. This is precisely why I did the reversion. You are just confusing theory and hypothesis. And just censoring the terminology hypothesis, where it is very obvious it is all over the net. Please type "gaia hypothesis" before doing deletions. Please also acknowledge the fact Lovelock has initially written an hypothesis, not a theory, and than both are different. I also note that you obviously don't know the subject very well, since you change the homeostatic article, indicating the theory was , when in reality the theory is homeorhetic and the hypothesis homeostatic. Please try to keep to stick to the topics you know more.</dd>

<p>We have already explained why these naming changes were being made. In fact, were you a competant English speaker, you already would have known why. English speakers DO NOT use the bizarre terminology that alone use.</p>

<dd>Again, you attack me on my capacity of using english&#160;? You claim "Gaia hypothesis" is a term that doesnot exist and that I invented&#160;? But really, how do you want me to give any credibility in what you say and write&#160;???</dd>

<p>You can't rewrite every Wikipedia entry on this subject to use a non-existent terminology. This has already been explained to you before by me and by others, but you refuse to even comment on this point.</p>

<p>Anthere's English is not fine. It's more than fine.</p>
<p>Yes, she occasionally makes mistakes, but they're easily fixed (and if they're not, by most people, they're probably on their way to become a new dialect!). And is there anybody whose English is perfect? <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a>? (Ok, he's a great guy, but apparently his Harvard years didn't <i>really</i> include one particular course.)</p>
<p>Her able command of English is obviously the result of years of reading English text, formal and informal (hence a solid grasp of the idioms), and probably some speech interaction as well.</p>
<p>Ant, please just ignore that person's comment on your English ability. There's no truth in it at all. He's just picking on you 'cos you're French, like Americans pick on us because we're Canadians, because there's that something nice about our two nations they'll <i>never</i> possess.&#160;:-D</p>
<p>Despite the grand knowledge possessed by the large population of France, we only have two active French contributors: Ant and <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a>. And if Ant subconsciously drifts away because a baseless accusation, we'd be left alone with Tarquin -- who will then bite off our scalps due to solitude.</p>

<p>Hi Anthere, I just read RK's newest comments on your "vandalism", "mental illness" and "pathological lying". Do not take him serious, he has insulted almost everyone on Wikipedia in this way, and now it is you. I hope, that this ban page will go away soon and that you won't be discouraged by this ridiculous person. Keep on the good work -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 14:12 1 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see anyone harassing anyone except this RK character. Anthere responded specifically and verifiably to each baseless accusation. RK responds by ignoring all her well-reasoned replies, and accusing her of harassment??!! RK you are looking worse every minute.</p>

I don't know what is going on here and no nothing about the topic. But from what I have read RK seems to be one in the wrong in his treatment of Anthere. Yes there are problems sometimes with people whose english is not perfect (I can think of 1 person with poor english who made some articles unreadable. But even if that was the case with Anthere (and I don't know of any evidence) I have seen absolutely nothing to justify her being called a troll and not one item to justify the creation of a 'let's ban' page. RK, if you have evidence not rhetoric please show it. In the meantime please show Anthere the respect she so obviously deserves as a genuine wikipedian. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 19:04 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>I am going to list this page on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Votes for Deletion</a> page. It is deeply insulting to a genuine user against which not one shred of evidence has been produced, to have such a page in existence. These pages should be used to deal with extreme cases and I see nothing in Anthere's behaviour, nor does anyone else here, to warrant such a downright insulting thing as a <i>lets ban Anthere</i> page. So please RK, if you have some evidence, show it, if you don't, end the abuse.</p>
<p>You seem to engage constantly in edit wars with people, RK. I have not followed them because they have been on topics I know little about. The first time I didn't form enough to form a judgment. The second time I wasn't sure. But you seem to be in so many with so many people on such a range of topics I have to ask you to consider - is the problem causing all these wars <i>with you</i>?
