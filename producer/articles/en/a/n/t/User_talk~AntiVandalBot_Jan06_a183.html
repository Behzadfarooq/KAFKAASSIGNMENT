<p>My edit to the page Christina Aguilera was reverted because I was adding that the title of her song F.U.S.S. stands for "Fuck You Scott Storch." The page already said that the song was a rebuttal to animosity between Aguilera and Storch. So, yeah. It was legit. Thought I would let y'all know.</p>

<p>Your bot undid the fix that I made to the page: "Mobitelea Ventures Limited"</p>
<p>Look at the page, and you will understand why your bot was incorrect to roll back my change.</p>
<p>BTW, your bot is slightly annoying, even if it does work for the "greater good." I don't like being second-guessed by simple rules like "IF anonymous user blanks page - UNDO," and I'll bet others feel the same way.</p>

<p>It may apear that the edit to "Daniel Easton" was a reposting of a legitimate article, but was just restoring a senseless article after my feeble attempt to delete the article without understanding how to do so. Might want to check that out the cheat 14:22, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is not a controversial subject just a plain fabrication apparently meant to be humorous by the author. If you have any volunteers who understand Urdu, they will tell you the same. Look into it and delete the bogus article. It is a webpage about a fictional donkey rights association. Khota means donkey. Obviously talking about donkey divorces and all is just a joke, not something that should qualify as information. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.81.199.50 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.81.199.50.html" title="User talk:203.81.199.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.81.199.50_d734.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.81.199.50">contribs</a>) 15:56, 27 December 2006.</small></p>

<p>I was directed by a admin to create this page in order to have a page where editors can work on a mass <b>Scheduled for Deletion</b>. She (Zeraeph) put them all in in-line mode, hidden from view, so no one can find them to edit. She did this yesterday morning, they all will be deleted. She brooks no disagreement.</p>

<dd>My apologies for not getting back to you earlier. I apologize for forgetting to sign my submission. And I apologize for not realizing that my memory for how to create a new page was completely wrong. I had no intention whatsover to delete even the tiniest bit of the article - it was just a stupid blunder by a relative newbie.</dd>

<dd>As it is, the entire problem has been made moot by an admin deleting of all that problematic inlining (of a vast amount of mostly brand new edits).

<p>My edit to Coca-Cola was reverted by this bot. It was a good edit and was discussed on the talk page.

<p>I am quite suprised to see your message about the editing of "Solubility chart" since I have NEVER edited a English Wikipedia page including "Solubility chart", though I frequently view the pages here since I find myself too unprofessional compared to the users. I am actutally a Chinese from Hong Kong who is unfamiliar with "Solubility chart" and science. I think one very possible explanation is that I am sharing the same IP address with others, and if my guess is correct, I start to wonder if I need to bear the consequences of the other user(s) of this IP address's actions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 222.166.160.247 (<a href="../../../2/2/2/User_talk%7E222.166.160.247.html" title="User talk:222.166.160.247">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_222.166.160.247_6886.html" title="Special:Contributions/222.166.160.247">contribs</a>).</small></p>

I merely wanted my hard work on the page to show on my contributions and the page's history page, and its history page displayed my IP address, thus motivating me copy my hard work, deleting the page, and pasting my work back onto the page, then saving it in order for the work I have done for hours to show on its history page and my contributions.

<dd>Thank you for undoing it. Sorry I sounded agitated. I'm a big supporter of Wikipedia. I look at vandalism as the electronic equivalent of rape, so when I felt I was unjustly accused of vandalism I was naturally upset. I understand vandalism is a serious problem on Wikipedia. However, I'm not sure a bot is the best approach to reverting vandalism. It has too much opportunity for making a mistake, which is tantamount to accusing an innocent editor of vandalism. Just the accusation can hurt an editor's reputation (even though I choose to edit anonymously.) Also, it takes the "editor" our of editing. Wikipedia is supposed to be self-correcting because <i>editors</i> are reviewing edits. As you state yourself, bots are stupid. Even though it takes more time, the Wikipedia way is for other editors to review edits. I'm also concerned that this puts the burden of proof on the wrong person. The bot doesn't ask before reverting edits. It takes a "guilty until proven innocent" approach. Even though an editor can "appeal" a revert by using this talk page, editors shouldn't have to defend their good faith edits in such a manner. It should be up to the person making the revert to do so only when edits are clearly vandalism. Perhaps a method of automatically flagging pages for review by other editors would be a kinder, gentler approach instead of automatic reverts. A review by a real editor prior to making a revert would improve accuracy and fairness. In the long run, accuracy and fairness are more important than the time saved by using a bot.</dd>

<dd>One of the regular false positives. The bot catches examples where the page is mostly deleted. It is specifically programmed to not trigger if the page is converted to a proper redirect. But the bot is not, and cannot, be programmed to trigger on conversions to mal-formed redirects. It would need to anticipate all the ways that someone could mal-form a redirect, and there are potentially a huge number of those ways. It does, however, look like you got it all straightened out. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 14:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi bot, or whoever operates you.</p>
<p>The bot made an error in reversion on <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guestbook.html" title="Guestbook">Guestbook</a>. The page had been vandalised twice in a row by two different IPs -- the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guestbook&amp;oldid=99195814" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guestbook&amp;oldid=99195814" rel="nofollow">first diff</a> shows some text in Cyrillic and a lot of links, and then the second version deleted all that, but added a new spam link.

<dd>Ah, that might explain the CITATION NEEDED thing too.

<dl>
<dd>Yep. This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism. (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.) There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives. The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism. In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism. In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war. This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page. The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.</dd>
<dd>As for refining, that's tricky. What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism? Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same. If we told it that "CITATION NEEDED" was not vandalism, then the next time they used "NEED CITATION", or "CITATION REQUIRED" or "FACT CHECK", then the bot would not catch it. We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake. The radio station edit is even more tricky. And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations? We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not. And I for one have no idea what we could use. New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference. The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more. It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 17:11, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Are we sure about this, i.e. when an edit matches this pattern it's 99% vandalism? (This pattern and no other pattern, so e.g. FUCK YOU presumably matches something else and so doesn't count towards this statistic.) I don't know much about it, but it seems awfully high, especially since all-caps seems like it's a typical newbie thing, and not just a malicious thing. I would expect that other patterns (like say, FUCK) to really be inappropriate 99.9% of the time.</li>
<li>The point about words is good, but another distinguish characteristic is markup, or attempted markup. Again, not knowing much about it, I might guess that all-caps vandalism edits (again, those that don't match any other pattern) look like NO WAY LINUX ROOOLS!!!! Might it be worthwhile looking for [ or something approximating markup or punctuation like that? (other than&#160;!?).</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that the caps check is just for edits all in caps. There is a separate check for profanity that has it's own occasional false positives. You will need to debate more with the programmers as to the specifics of certain checks. I'm just an observing party myself. AVB also has a whitelisting ability, such that certain editors should never trigger the bot (admins, for instance).</p>
<p>As for the 99% numbers, those really are guestimates. Not really sure how we would get the real figures. The number of times that AVB acted on any specific criteria would likely be easy for the bot to track, if it's not already doing so. But the cooresponding number of false positives... I really don't know. I'm guestimating based on what I have seen of false positive complaints versus the number of vandalisms I can see AVB revert in it's contributions list. But no hard numbers.</p>
<p>As for newbie vs malicious, they are still vandalism. For the bot, either an edit is vandalism, or it is not. There are no shades of grey. Grey comes in a bit in the wording of the first warning message, which is intended to avoid <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITEing</a> newbies, etc. But the bot itself is a stupid computer program, and cannot make such judgements. So it does not even try. Typeing in all caps == vandalism == revert and warning. We would really need much better criteria to make any sort of judgement between newbies and malicious vandalism. And really, I'm not sure what we would gain even if we were able to make that distinction. We still want both reverted. And we still want both warned. It's the truely false positives that are the problem. And again, to improve on those we need to have exact criteria for telling the bot what is and is not vandalism. It's a computer program, and is only as good as the logic that we humans give it.</p>
<p>A lot of all-cap vandalism is random characters. Some of it is profanity. Some of it is just wierd comments. Or "BUSH IS A HORRID PRESIDENT" added to a political page. Or "I LOVE YOU PAUL MCCARTNEY" or other random junk. Any new criteria would really need to catch as much of this stuff as possible, while avoiding the false positives. And I just do not see how such could be done, given the infinite possibilities of vandalistic edits, and similarly infinite possibilities of all-caps, but good intentioned, edits. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 21:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This assumes newbie edits are destructive and should be reverted. Some should, of course, but I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about positive edits that are just badly formatted. (Or even correctly formatted, as in this example.) I suggested looking for markup like brackets to distinguish them from I LOVE YOU PAUL. Without anything concrete, there's not even a way to tell how much of an issue this really is, and so I don't know what more to say. I assume the programmers are looking at this page. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu-Fool_Danyal_ibn_Amir_al-Makhiri_38e8.html" title="User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri">Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri</a> 19:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your bot is increased use in the campaign against vandalism. Given its apparent success, I fully support its use. I am, however, having difficulty with one aspect of it. The bot leaves a notice on the offender's userpage (which is well-written for a first-time vandal but far more polite than the repeat vandal deserves - but better to err on the side of caution). The notice includes a link and timestamp to the vandalized page. That's very helpful when trying to scrub the vandal's recent contributions and to make sure that everything's been cleaned up. The problem is that the notice also includes a header and makes its own section. The header makes it harder to scan the vandal's Talk page to determine if the problem has escalated, if a higher level of warning is appropriate (such as {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} or if the vandal should be blocked.</p>
<ol>
<li>Would you consider removing the header from the notice created by the bot? Leave the same paragraph notice but do it in-line with all the other notices being made on the vandal's page. Don't break up the flow and readability for the admins who have to decide if a block is appropriate.</li>
<li>In future development, could the bot read the level of the last warning and automatically recommend escalation?</li>
</ol>

<p>The vandalism in this case was "mmmmmph".</p>
<p>Not sure what the current heuristics are but perhaps the bot could also watch for edits where a certain percentage of the letters in the edit are consecutive instances of the same letter, espeically from unregistered users. ie I would imagine that "ggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy" and "hhhhhhhhhhsddddddddddjjjjjjjjjjj" etc are quite frequent and this is not something that appears often in legitimate edits, so there would be few false-positives.

<p>Dear 61.30 - you are in error. Liouciou Pingtung is pinyin, the official romanisation system adopted by the People's Republic of China and thus the romanisation of 1.3bn users. Hardly a system no-one uses. Hsiao Liuchiu is Wade Giles, a system of romanisation for Chinese which was created in the era of western imperialism. Few people in the west use this system as it's more difficult to use than Pinyin and is not recognised in the PRC. The island in question, Hsiao Liuchiu, is part of the Republic of China in Taiwan where Wade Giles is still in use. I don't know what wikipedia's view on using Wade Giles over pinyin is, but there must surely be an argument for using WG in this instance as it is the name used by the government which owns the island. <a href="../../../x/u/e/User%7EXue_hanyu_bc96.html" title="User:Xue hanyu">Xue hanyu</a> 16:34, 13 January 2007 (UTC)xue_hanyu</p>

<p>I think I need help. I created a new page entitled David Elliot (he is an established illustrator). This is fine, except there are many other David Elliots or Elliotts listed on Wikipedia. When I searched, it seemed that I should have headed the page David Elliot (Illustrator) to distinguish this David Elliot from the others. I couldn't seem to be able to change the title, so I created a new page. I'm sure this isn't right, but I don't know how to get rid of the duplicate page. If you can help, I'd be most grateful. Also, can you explain why a search on Google for 'David Elliot'wikipedia takes you to David Elliott (with two 't's) and not to David Elliot. This is all getting quite confusing.</p>
<p>My apologies if I have created confusion.</p>

<dd>I have dealt with the issue somewhat by making David Elliott (Illustrator) a redirect. This is probably the best that can be done, perhaps an admin could merge the two edit histories, but it is my present understanding that this can't be done. No content has been lost, the edit history for the srticle is just seperated now. It should probably be fine. --<a href="../../../i/m/j/User%7EImjustmatthew_9344.html" title="User:Imjustmatthew">Matthew</a> 03:17, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I tried to redirect a page (Fareed armaly) as I had made a mistake in the page title (missing capital). I could not find the correct operation to move (could not find the described 'move' page button, even with skin change in preferences).

<p>VandalBot,</p>
<p>My name is Joe Rossi. In late 2005 I arrogently posted an article about myself, thinking one day I may run again for public office. Since then, a former co-worker has taken this opportunity to attack me with slanderous edits. I've asked the wiki help desk to delete the article entirely to save me from checking the article everyday and re-editing it. Can you please help me? My email address is josephprossi@yahoo.com if you need to contact me. Thanks in advance.</p>
