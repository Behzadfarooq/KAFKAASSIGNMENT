<p>Why has this article been listed in clean-up, if there is a good reason I would be willing to fix it, it is a very well written and inormative article that really doesn't deserve to get this kind of negative attention.</p>
<p>I think it's because the number of anti-Barney songs on there has gotten a little out of hand, due to the near limitless potential for variations (I'm more partial to "I hate you / You hate me / Let's get together and kill Barney / With a great big shotgun / Barney's on the floor / no more purple dinosaur"). --<a href="../../../t/o/q/User%7EToquinha_9c53.html" title="User:Toquinha">Toquinha</a> 21:12, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw this article was listed for some verification notices, I got rid of the part with Mario (despite the fact I strongly believe those rumors) and the exact locations of the song orgins. Also got rid of a bit of Vandalism that managed to sneak it's way onto the page. Took down cleanup notice though, I don't see why this has to be listed as a cleanup.</p>

<p>I put up an invisible message not to put anymore new song variations in to the "anti-Barney songs" part of the article, that should keep these people quite for now. Protozoic Waste</p>

<dd>I can understand why this may be a notable social phenomena. But Wikipedia is not a song book and articles shouldn't be kept "just for laughs". <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> are not policies created without reason. If people want to keep an archive of songs they find funny then setup an account at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>. It is free and avoids the whole problem and you will still be able to add more songs if you wish. If something isn't done about this it needs to go back to AfD if nothing else then to reach a final consensus on what should stay and what needs to go. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 20:18, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although perhaps fitting for an article about such a juvenile (I don't mean that word in an insulting way) subject, this article needs better sentence structure. It reads like a 9-year-old's first essay, especially the first few sections.

<p>Ok everyone, filling an encyclopedia article with un-sited, OR children's songs, simply does not work. This entire article is filled un-sourced POV claims, a perfect example would be the Anti-Christ section (and very poorly written at that). Yes, it is well known that Barney has attracted a significant amount hatred, and is frequently mocked and made fun of across the media. That does not mean however, that an article written about the topic should be poor and biased like the jokes themselves are. In other words, this article needs a serious complete re-write, and one that will cover the topic honestly, and not fill 3 pages full of riducules children's jokes. <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvador_1814.html" title="User:Avador">Avador</a> 05:08, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the Barney = Satan thing has been around for a LONG time, almost since the show itself came out. I don't see how you do a "serious" re-write about anti-Barney humor and not include at least one example of what you are talking about. In the case of Barney = Satan, it's certainly not as outlandish as some of the stuff I have seen or heard. I do agree however that the topic can be whittled down somewhat to become more "disciplined"...this is an encyclopedia, not The Laugh Hour.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Indeed. I think the jokes should be reduced to a mention; writing out the jokes in their entirety is not necessary (they can be externally linked for those who are interested).--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleron235_059c.html" title="User:Aleron235">Aleron235</a> 01:45, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Added a References section - it's a start. Not sure why the Anti-Christ item got picked on - it at least had references and probably says more about 666 "proofs" than about Barney. Hopefully the added background there will reduce the number of people taking this part too seriously. Also added background for the Jihad section. There are also issues of legal attempts to shut down Barney parody sites, with <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation_eebe.html" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</a> weighing in on the defence - haven't had time to pull that section together yet. <a href="../../../d/l/2/User%7EDl2000_b92d.html" title="User:Dl2000">Dl2000</a> 04:14, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. The Anti-Barney songs section is basically an invitation for a whole buch of different people to submit their anti-Barney songs.<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHondasaregood_6b30.html" title="User:Hondasaregood">Hondasaregood</a> 20:20, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it should, granted, the List of Newgrounds Groups article gets ressurected as well. I myself am a Barney Bunch member, but I really don't think it's fair that the BB gets to be mentioned on Wikipedia, while the other Newgrounds groups (enspecially the Clock Crew, which was responsable for starting the whole group idea) get deleted or are not to be mentioned.</p>

<dd>I agree. It's not fair that only the Barney Bunch gets to be mentioned on Wikipedia and more well known groups get deleted.

<li>Barney Bunch should not exist as a seperate article. Newgrounds groups have been deleted many times before, check the deletion logs for <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_Crew_9e19.html" title="Clock Crew">Clock Crew</a> and List of Newgrounds groups. I don't mind too much that there's a mention of the Barney Bunch here, but it's an article about anti-barney humour, not Barney-Bunch. So whereas they may enjoy taking the piss out of Drew Pickles, it really doesn't belong here. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:03, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know how an article like this cannot contain a mention of Barkley vs. Barney, a Saturday Night Live sketch where Charles Barkley plays one-on-one basketball with Barney. Barkley plays the game in his usual style complete with elbows, hard fouls, pushing and shoving, and power slam dunks right in Barney's face. This to me is the most memorable "Anti-Barney humor" moment on television. The fact that the article neglects to mention this tells me that it is seriously lacking as an article, in my opinion.</p>
