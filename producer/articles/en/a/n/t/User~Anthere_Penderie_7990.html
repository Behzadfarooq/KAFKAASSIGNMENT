<dd>Excellent about the fr.rhododendron. &#160;:-) "burning the corners" just means you darken the edges of the pictures. I'll upload a comparison with an article once I get a chance--not for awhile--I really must go back to work at school. But to do it in photoshop you'd lasso an area in a circle, invert selection, feather the border (about 30 pixels for a 400pix wide image), hide the lasso, then use curves to make the corners darker so the viewer's eye is less likely to wander off the image. I did that to great extent on the picture at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canna_lily.html" title="Canna lily">canna lily</a>. I'll put the article &amp; example up probably in a day or two. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a></dd>

<p>Hi Anthere. I renamed RIOA for several reasons: because it's not actually an "invasion" (though it's ofen been called that informally) but an infestation; because it's not very grammatical; and because it's a rather POV title. (Mind you, I can't think of a single thing <i>good</i> to say about rabbits here in Oz, but surely someone else will sooner or later. I hate the damn things with a passion.) The main reason though, was because I started reorganising the entries on Australian fauna and flora, and I intend to add some companion pieces on other feral vermin here: in particular the fox and the cat, but perhaps also the Cane Toad the European Carp, and as many others as I (or you, or whoever else) finds time to do. I'm not convinced that &lt;Rabbit (Australia)&gt; is an ideal title, and if you have a better one to suggest I'd be glad to hear it, but at least this way we can (a) use the pipe trick, and (b) have some regularity between the vermin articles: <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit_%28Australia%29_8f0f.html" title="Rabbit (Australia)">Rabbit (Australia)</a> and Fox (Australia) and Cat (Australia), and so on.

<p>Hi Quercus. Since you always write such nice and detailed pages, what do you think should an encyclopedic article be counted on&#160;? Do you think it is ok an encyclopedic article should be considered as such as soon as there is one character in the article, or would it would more correct for you that it includes more words. If so, would you consider adding your vote to m:Article count reform. Currently, the option winning is 0. That means as soon as someone write gimme me a beer in the page, that is an article...Hope all your garden and plants are growing well...a thought...I wrote this under beer influence a while ago m:Listening to our garden what do you think&#160;? User:anthere (beers and bears...)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Ant- thanks for the messsage above and your complements about my articles- I try &amp; do my best but have created my own fair share of stubs as well- some I mean to expand but don't seem to get around to doing&#160;:(</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, I'll have a look at the voting page. My view is stubs should be counted as articles, but not redirect pages, disambig pages etc... How are things counted now? Perhaps I'll be wiser when I've looked at the voting page.</p>
<p>As for the gardening, it was all coming on nicely but now I've pulled a back muscle so I'm laid up at the moment, very frustrating as there is so much needs doing at the moment... cheers <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 11:30 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anthere, we tend to keep article titles as singular instead of plural. Temperate grassland and Tropical savvana would have been the preferred titles. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>I agree that <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Forests_7860.html" title="Mediterranean Forests">Mediterranean Forests</a> is a different thing from Mediterranean forest. But if we were to have an article on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_savanna.html" title="Tropical savanna">Tropical savanna</a>, it can easily be refered to in the plural as [[Tropical savanna]]s. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Seeing how you just added ecoregions to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, I'm thinking it might be better to put those on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Iraq_dcce.html" title="Geography of Iraq">geography of Iraq</a> page; it would be more consistent with the intent of putting most of the info under those sections above. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">JohnOwens</a> 19:59 Mar 22, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>By all means, Anthere. I'm up to my eyeballs in birds right now, but I'm due for a break and a change, as they say, is as good as a rest.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>Anthere, I'm confused! <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Desert_and_East_Sahero-Arabian_xeric_shrublands_5198.html" title="Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands">Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands</a> redirects to a template page. This seems a bit wrong! Is the information in the template a valid Wikipedia article about the Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands? If so, can I move the template to that title? I can then copy and paste the contents back into the template. That way the article will be at its proper title, with the edit history preserved. Does that sound all right to you? I'm afraid that I don't have a clue about the subject matter, so I thought I'd better check with you before I did anything too drastic....&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 20:21 Apr 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your suggestion is good, Anthere. I'm feeling a bit daunted by the ecoregion project - it's quite ambitious - but I'll free up some time over the next few days and at least make a start on it, and then bear it in mind as I'm writing more bird entries. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<p>Bit by bit. Yes. It seems more approachable that way&#160;:) As for threats, I could do a good few of the Australian ones off the top of my head. First though, I'll get some of the fundamentals pencilled in. Guess I'll start with the one I live in: that should be easiest. But not tonight - it's 1:15AM and I have to work tommorow.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>English does not have completely separate words analogous to your <i>adventice</i> and <i>mauvaise herbe</i>. Perhaps the closest we could come is <i>weed</i> and <i>noxious weed</i>.

<p>Hey, Anthere, do we have a list of species status classifications? I'm writing up a whole stack of Australian mammals right now, and many of them are classified extinct, threatened, vulnerable, or endangered. It occurs to me that there should be a page that says what the difference is between "vulnerable" and "endangered", so I can make the words link to it. (Or maybe seperate pages - whatever.) (No hurry about this - I have a million tasks on the go already, but this is one that we should do sooner or later, if it hasn't been done already.)

<p>Anthere, please quit reverting <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Theories_8b3b.html" title="Gaia Theories">Gaia Theories</a>. See the naming conventions that Wikipedia employs.

<p>Unfortunately the naming conventions prefer wrong capitalisation to correct capitalisation.&#160;:-( It does my head in, and the heads in of quite a few others here who find it farcical and semi-literate. When it comes to something that is fundamentally wrong (like Prime minister instead of Prime Minister, or Proportional representation using the single transferable vote, instead of the correct Proportion Representation using the Single Transferable Vote) I usually just get stubborn and refuse to accept the wrong capitalisation, as do quite a few others. If Theory is capitalised, stick to your guns on it. The more people demand proper english capitalisation rather than amateurish miscapitalisation, the greater the likelihood that some day the idiotic semi-literate wiki naming convention on this issue might be changed. This is after all supposed to be a reliable, trustworthy encyclopædia. If it can't even tell the reader the correct name, spelling and capital usage of something, then wiki is worthless as a sourcebook and people would hesitate to trust its reliability. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 23:34 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>does anyone notice there are other articles in this encyclopedia, with the distinction big T small t&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Zoe and I are good wiki friends but on this I think she is wrong. We should be able to stand over everything, from title to article structure. So factual consistency should be the base line. If something is correctly spelt with a capital T, it <i>should</i> be spelt on wiki with a capital T. Too often we treat grammar and spelling as if they were optional extras or unnecessary old fashioned rules. In fact capitalisation was created to allow a reader to distinguish names, proper nouns etc from the rest of the text automatically. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 23:43 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. We can't respect it for the first letter of the first word unfortunately. But at least, we can do it with the second. Why should not we write as the real world does when we can&#160;???</dd>
</dl>
<p>For Anthere, this isn't simply about capitalization practices, it is about maintaining the distinction she sees between the "Gaia Theory" and the "Gaia theory". She uses the former to refer to one specific (and therefore capitalized) interpretation, and the latter to refer to all possible interpretations. My goal is to merge these two articles into one, and to talk about the single specific theory as a subset of the whole. I believe that all spelling and capitalization variants of "gaia theory" should ultimately take the reader to the same place, while Anthere wants you to land at a different article depending on what you capitalize or pluralize. -<a href="../../../%C2%BA/%C2%A1/%C2%BA/User%7E%C2%BA%C2%A1%C2%BA.html" title="User:º¡º">º¡º</a></p>
