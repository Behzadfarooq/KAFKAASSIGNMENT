	    <p>111505 Mrs. Sequeida Language Arts 12 18 January 2007 School Reform: Ask for More Imagine walking through your school. You see broken pipes, holes in the walls, moldy water fountains, and nails sticking out of a storage facility that you could be pushed into. There is water damage in most classrooms, and on the school buildings. You go to the restroom after you eat your lunch to wash off the grease you were served and are shocked. There are no paper towels, toilets are overflowing, there is no soap, and there is never any hot water. Today, however, there is no water at all, so you must wash your hands in the moldy water fountain. The bell rings, and you must fight through the crowds to get to your overcrowded class. You know that your teachers care about giving you the best education possible, but their hands are tied by state standards. The room is hot and stuffy. The teacher cannot control the students. There is chaos. No, this is not the latest high school television drama. More and more public schools in the United States are becoming like this. Public schools need to be reformed in every way. Even though schools have undergone many changes through the years, they are still in desperate need of reform. According to the website projectappleseed.org school reform is not a new trend. “School reform is nothing new. The school system has undergone numerous changes in policy and procedure in the past two centuries although the basic structure of education has changed very little” (“What Does School Reform Mean?”). School reform has been needed for a long time, yet the school system still has not changed enough. School reform is necessary and should be the top priority of all students, teachers, administrators, and parents. Even though school reform has been needed for so long hardly anything has changed. One method that should be used is whole school reform. Whole school reform enhances students’ learning that will surely help students. According to Elizabeth Hertling, whole school reform will help many schools. “Whole school (or comprehensive school) reform is a broad brush that covers a diverse set of nation wide and local programs that are cross-disciplinary efforts that involve home, and community in the intellectual development and personal nurturing of all children” (Hertling). All schools should try to adopt whole school reform. Whole school reform includes all the aspects of a school environment. Curriculum choices, upkeep of facilities, class sizes, qualifications of teachers, standardized testing, and parent involvement are just a few of the areas that would be looked at for reform in a whole school reform model. If whole school reform was implemented perhaps this generation would finally surpass its parents academically. For as long as public education has been in the United States, children have left school more skilled than their parents. The current generation in high school, however, will not be as skilled as their parents. According to the book A Nation at Risk this is a major problem. “Each generation of Americans has outstripped its parents in education, in literacy, and in economic attainment. For the first time in the history of our country, the education skills of one generation will not surpass will not equal will not even approach, those of their parents” (The National Commission on Excellence in Education). If this trend continues, the future generations of Americans will be less educated than the previous. This is a problem because America needs educated citizens to continue scientific research, to vote on laws and leaders responsibly, and to keep the economy thriving. If this problem is to be corrected, whole school reform must take place, and equality in the classroom is one aspect of school that must be reformed.</p>
<pre>
          School reform must include equal learning opportunities for everyone.  Some races are not doing as well as others.  “Achievement gaps between minorities and whites and more and less advantaged students remain large” (Funrman).  This could be because of a language barrier for immigrants who do not speak English, yet are going to a school where their classes are taught in English.  Also, some minorities live in poorer, sometimes dangerous neighborhoods where education is looked down on by the more violent members of the community.  However, schools should provide the best education possible to all students.  If schools are to be truly reformed, then everyone must be treated equally.  Students will only be taught equally if parents get more involved. 
</pre>
<p>A lack of parental involvement is another major problem facing schools that must be reformed. Parents need to get more involved in their student’s education. “In 1990-1991 one out of every four public school teachers cited lack of parental involvement as a serious problem in their schools” (“What Are The Most Serious Problems in Schools?”). Parents need to take the time to help the future of the country by playing a more active role in their children’s education. For example, parents could commit to attending parent-teacher conferences, or communicating with teachers regularly about their child’s progress. Also, parents could verify their children are actually attending classes, and discipline their children when they cause problems in the classroom. Parents also need to be responsible for monitoring the amount of homework their children bring home. Since students do not get enough homework their achievement goes down, even though grades go up. All students are happy that they do not have a lot of homework, but they are not learning as much as they could. “As amount of homework for high school seniors has decreased (two thirds report less than an hour a night) the grades have risen as average student achievement has been declining” (The National Commission on Excellence in Education ). Although grades are going up the achievement is going down due to lack of homework. Another possible reason for achievement going down is methods of teaching, or whole language learning. The practice of whole language learning has damaged education. In whole language students were supposed to learn to read and write better. “Whole language learning is thought to provide a better understanding of the text, and a more interesting and creative approach to reading. However, whole language learning may come at the expense of accuracy and correctness. A child might be awarded high marks for ‘overall language use,’ even if he or she has misspelled many words” (Buckhoff). Teaching students that spelling is not important will hurt them later in life. Due to the effects of whole language learning, the government had to find a way to fix the problem. One failed remedy is NCLB, or the No Child Left Behind Act. Several education experts believe NCLB will damage education. NCLB as currently implemented is more likely to harm than to help most of the students…Theses outcome are likely because the undefended bill layers onto a grossly unequal…inadequately funded-school system a set of unmeetable test score targets that disproportionately penalizes schools serving the neediest students, while creating strong incentives for schools to keep out, push out, the students who are low achieving in order to raise schools average test scores (Hammond-Darling).</p>
<p>No Child Left Behind will not work and will most likely damage education. This is because NCLB concentrates solely on test scores, and takes money away from under-performing and already under-funded schools. Also, this sets national standards about what is being taught, but not every state needs students to know the exact same thing. For example, in rural communities, farming skills might be stressed, but in urban communities, subjects like business or accounting classes might be more relevant to students. Perhaps if schools would adopt ability grouping, No Child Left Behind would not be needed. The facts show that ability grouping is better than grouping by age. Ability grouping benefits students that are more advanced in certain subjects. “Ability grouping clearly benefits gifted students” (“Ability Grouping”). This benefits all students by placing them in courses with peers that match their intellect in that particular subject. Curriculum is created for each groups’ ability, and does not slow higher-achieving students down. Gifted students will benefit, so this system should be implemented in schools. Ability grouping sounds like a completed system, but it is actually easy to implement. Ability grouping sounds hard to implement but it is a relatively easy philosophy. Ability grouping will put students of equal intelligence in the same class. “Education ability grouping is the term used for the practice of putting students into classes based on ability, not by group. For example, if there were two second graders, and one could do complex math and the other was struggling with the basics, the student with the better skills would be placed in a higher math class, while the student with the lesser skills would be placed in a lower math class” (Wikipedia). This policy makes more sense than grouping by age. Problems have arisen since students have been grouped by age. For example, a senior in high school may not be able to meet the requirements of his twelfth grade English class, but because he is seventeen, he is assumed to have those skills. Ability grouping would ensure that students have mastered the material they need. Standardized tests will hurt all students who are of the lower ability groups. Standardized tests do nothing but hurt the educational system. Standardized tests are not needed and damaging. “Despite their biases, inaccuracies, limited ability to measure achievement or ability, and flaws, schools use standardized tests to determine if children are ready for school, track them into instructional groups; diagnose for learning disabilities…” (“What’s Wrong With Standardized Tests?”). There must be a better way to correctly measure students’ ability. For example, a test could be made by individual teachers. This way, students could be tested on what they have learned in class. Even though there is a chance that some teachers might abuse this system, most teachers want the best for their students and want to see that their students have mastered required material. Standardized tests are unreliable and should be taken out of schools. The reliability of standardized tests has come into question. Standardized tests are not an accountable measure of student proficiency. “A test is completely reliable if you would get exactly the same results the second time you administer it. All existing tests have ‘measurement error.’ This means an individual’s score may vary from day to day due to testing conditions or the test-takers mental or emotional state. As a result, many individual scores are frequently wrong” (“What’s Wrong With Standardized Tests?”). Because standardized tests have been proven to be unreliable, they are therefore an unnecessary strain on students. Since standardized tests are unreliable, and even damaging, to education, why are they there in the first place? More people should oppose them. Even though standardized tests are so obviously damaging to education, they still are unopposed by most administrators. Standardized tests are being defended, even though they should not be. “Even more disturbing than someone defending the tough standards movement is someone who agrees that standardized tests are unnecessary and damaging but refuses to do anything about it” (Pollard). These tests are damaging because they waste three full school days that could be better spent learning content. Also, for a month before the state tests, class time is taken away each day for test preparation. What is interesting is that schools do not take time out to prepare for the California High School Exit Exam, which is a test all students need to pass in order to graduate. However, they do use school time to prepare for state tests that do not affect individual students at all. Weapons in schools are another problem that need to be addressed. Recent statistics show that a large number of students have weapons at schools. Students in public schools have weapons readily available to them. “All across the United States in urban and rural districts alike, children are carrying weapons to school at a rate 100,000 per day” (Kopka). It is important for students to understand how dangerous it is to bring weapons to schools. Schools also must work hard to combat this. These students are bringing weapons not simply for protection, but to participate in violent activities such as drug trafficking. Violent activities can provide a valuable income and a sense of friendship for some students. For example, in some cases gang related activities could seem fun to some students. In a study done by Deborah Kopka, the author of the book titled School Violence, this is a common practice in schools today. “With the advent of crack, drug dealing became a well-paid and violent business for many juveniles” (Kopka 14). With violent activities being so well paid, no wonder some students bring weapons to school. Many schools in other countries do not have the same problem that America does. America can learn about school reform from other countries, and can adopt beneficial practices from countries all over the world. Other countries have gone through reform and could be looked at as examples for this country. “Debates about how to reform American education seldom consider the experiences of other nations” (Salisbury). For example, in Japan high school is not mandatory. It is a decision that each person makes for himself. American education leaders do not consider these experiences, however, because they perhaps feel that these different systems would not relate to American students. However, if they never try these practices, they will never know if they would be beneficial. Japan has a different way of educating than America. In America, high school is mandatory, so all students must go, whether they want to or not. This means that a number of students do not care about school on a personal level. However, “high school is not compulsory in Japan, so all students who attend high school pay tuition” (“High School Visit”). In Japan, high school is optional so the students that attend are motivated to learn. Like Japan, the Canadian school system works differently than America as well. In Canada, overcrowding is not a problem. This is because Canada does not condone crowded classrooms. “The government is implementing a real cap of 20 students in junior Kindergarten to grade 3 by the 2007-2008 school year” (“More Than 2000 New Elementary Teachers”). A real cap is when no more than a set number of students may be in a classroom, and does not look at averages. If America would use a real cap, the school system would not be so crowded. Students would get more attention from their teacher. If America does not want to make a real cap, than the country could at least fix school facilities. Many studies have proven that school facilities affect students in more ways than one. Bad facilities could prove as a health risk. “A number of studies have shown that many school systems, particularly those in urban and high-poverty areas, are plagued by decaying buildings that threaten the health, safety, and learning opportunities of students” (“Archived Information”). This could hurt students in a number of health-related ways. For example, a student in decaying buildings may face respitory problems. This is due to installation fibers being breathed in by students. Also, students may catch the flu more frequently and more severely than students in schools with better facilities. This is due to many factors, such as if a classroom is either too hot or too cold. Standing water could attracts mosquitoes, which could carry diseases. The lack of hot water and even soap is also to blame for students getting sick. No wonder students whose schools are in these conditions do not do as well at school. The state of school facilities affects students and teachers both physically and mentally. According to one article on this subject, “In many American schools, students and teachers find themselves in a physical environment that adversely affects their morale . . .Although hard evidence is scanty, a few studies also indicate that when a school building is in disrepair, student achievement suffers” (“Deteriorating School Facilities”). A student’s school environment is very important. Students need to feel safe mentally and psychologically in order to feel relaxed enough to do their assignments well. Students who attend schools where their facilities are in very poor condition may feel that the administration does not care about them or their school. If students have the same horrible conditions year after year, they may finally stop trying academically, because they might feel that if the school environment is dangerous, dirty, and dingy, this reflects the community’s attitude towards them. Students need to feel that a community supports their education, and an appropriate, safe school facility is partly how the community shows its support. While a healthy learning environment will benefit students, other services such as 504 plans can also benefit many students. Section 504 gives regular-ed students who are struggling but do not qualify for an IEP individual services. “So how can Section 504 benefit children in elementary and high schools? It can affect them in a very positive manner” (Houghton). Struggling students who do not qualify for RSP or SDC can get some of the services associated with these programs. If students have someone to talk to them about their class work, and help them in planning their future jobs, than they will be more successful. More students need to be offered 504 plans in order to be the most productive they can be. Career connections will also benefit students and help them in their lives, and need to be a part of whole school reform. Some school systems do have career connections for students to participate in. “Local school systems already implementing career connections have been successful in the areas of improving high school teaching and learning, expanding work-based learning opportunities, and building and sustaining public/private partners to enhance student learning and success after high school” (“Career Connections”). Making students think about their lives after graduation will help them to focus in the present and try harder in school. Career connections will not only help students think about the future while in school they will present them with career opportunities that they might not have heard of otherwise. Public schools need to be reformed in every way. This is due to the many problems facing the school system. Some attempted ways to solve the problems have only served to make schools worse. These have became known as failed remedies. Grouping students based soley on age and not by ability makes little sense and is also partially to blame for current problems. Standardized tests are too unreliable for public schools too rely on. Also, public schools are not safe for students and they must be made safer. America must learn from the experience of other nations when it comes to school policies. Future study in this area is very important, because if schools were reformed, the nation would be more educated and better prepared to face the challenges of the future. Parents, teachers, administrators, and students must do all they can to fix the education system for the future of the country and the world.</p>
