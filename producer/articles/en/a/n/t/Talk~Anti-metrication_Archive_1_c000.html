<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism for requiring actions proved impossible in constructive geometry to mark off stick in fundamental units</span></h2>
<p>According to this criticism, any system that uses units different from basic numbers like 2 or 3 become a problem "in the field". The argument is that we should use a measuring system compatible with geometry, not with the accidents of biology.</p>
<p>However, the problem is that our numeric system is already based on 10 digits. The benfits of the metric system are based in the fact that it is a measuring system compatible with our numeric system, so calculations and conversions are much easier.</p>
<p>So, weighting both circumstances, what is more relevant for the majority of the people? Making measures "in the field", or easing up calculations? I'm inclined to say that easing up calculations is more relevant. Luiscolorado 14:52, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with you and have added a short note to the effect in the section. On a completely different note but regarding the same section. Don't you think the title is rather long winded and thus somewhat difficult to figure out (at least until you've read the section)? I've simplified the title a little by cutting the <i>Criticism for</i> and the <i>to mark off stick in fundamental units</i> (which had been missing an indefinite article anyway) however it remains a little lond winded and unclear.

<dd>Sorry, I forgot to log in before I totally changed this paragraph in the article by arguing against this criticism. As a mathematician and a former carpenter and welder, I feel qualified to comment on both the theoretical and practical sides of the question. I have put the reasons for rejecting the criticism in my edit of the article. To address Luiscolorado's comment above, a carpenter or other worker "in the field" can easily divide a length into 5 equal parts as easily as into 2 or 3 equal parts. And it can be done, if desired, with no more than a pencil and a freely movable straight-edged plank. The fact is, in practice almost any workman will do any division by means of calculations. That is, he/she will measure the length, angle, weight, etc., then divide the number by the desired number of parts, and measure off the resulting fraction. Further, the ease of division of a physical object into some number of parts has very little practical relevance to the ease of use of a system of measurement. If you want to compare, note that it is more work for a carpenter in the field to divide 19 5/8 inches into 3 equal parts than to divide, say, 49.9 cm into 3 equal parts. <a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAftermath_015b.html" title="User:Aftermath">Aftermath</a> 21:38, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Dividing by three is simple in a base-12 system but difficult with a base ten. 
Even taking a quarter in base ten gives a fraction,
whereas in many non-metric systems this too is easy. 
</pre>
<p>Says the article. What nonsense! Dividing by three is simple in base twelve but try dividing by five. Taking a quarter in base ten does not give a fraction. Ten tens are one hundred thus one hundred is base ten. A quarter of one hundred is twenty-five. A quarter of a metre is twenty-five centimetres (closer to the average length of a foot, by the way, than are twelve inches).

<p>In this section there's currently this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Further complicating the matter is that many cities, particularly in the Midwest and Southwest, have been laid out in blocks that are approximately 0.1 mile on a side. For example, the average block size between 15th street and 115th street in Chicago is 0.12 miles (0.2 km). As such, a 10 block journey is about 1.2 miles (2 km). A conversion to kilometres would foil this system.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This makes me wonder why this is not a reason <b>for</b> the metric system, since it seems easier to me to do the math with metres or kilometres than with miles or yards.</p>
<p>I found out that the block size in Chicago is not 0.12 miles, it's in fact exactly one <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furlong.html" title="Furlong">furlong</a>. I doubt that many people in the US measure distances in furlongs or chains (=0.1 furlong), so for the more practical units: One furlog is an 8ths (=0.125) statute mile or 220 yard. In metrical units it's 201.168m. If you calculate with 200m or 0.2km or you make an relative error of less than 0.6%, OK for everydays use IMHO and better than most maps. So the conversions are (at least) as easy with metres (* or /200) and kilometres (/ or * 5) as miles (/ or * 8) and still easier than with distances given in yards (or feet). Maybe the paragraph should be removed, I don't see anything with <i>kilometres foiling this system</i> here for Joe Average. - <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlureiter_d541.html" title="User:Alureiter">Alureiter</a> 16:35, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Large supermarkets in the UK have also attempted to undermine the metrication process. They place small metric price signs on the edges of shelves and use these to claim they are pricing in metric. However, all around the store are very large signs advertising the products purely in Imperial units.

And the 100 metre race? Sure, the old units have centuries of connotations. No-one's saying metrication bans the use of the words.

It would make me feel like I need to grow up and stop investing so much emotion in trivialities. That argument about Roman times hardly applies to the USA, does it? -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>
<p>Well, the American units were adopted from British units more than two centuries ago, and the British units were adopted from Roman units. The ancient systems used body measurements for linear measurements. Weight units were determined by how much a human or animal could carry. In ancient Egypt, about 3000 BC, the cubit was defined. It was calculated from the length from the extended fingertips to the tip of the elbow and was used as a standard of linear measurements. In the first millennium BC the Greek unit of measurement for length was the width of a finger, 16 fingers equaled one foot. Also at that time the Romans divided the foot into 12 unicae. Unicae means twelfth part and is the origin of the word inch.</p>
<p>The Roman system used the libra, or pound, as its unit of weight and the mile as its unit of distance. Liquid weight was based on the pint and dry measure on the quart. That a "pound" is abbreviated to "lb" today reflects its origins ("lb" is a contraction of the word "libra"). Much more recently, in 1830, the US Senate ordered an inspection in the customhouses and uncovered quite a variety of "standard" pounds. In the following years, a new standard pound was dispatched to the customhouses and to the governor of each state and adopted in 1828 as the official Mint reference. In 1959, all countries sharing traditional units adopt a standard pound (see below). (There was actually very little change required.)</p>
<p>The first attempts to standardize the measures in England can be traced to the Magna Carta (1215). At about this time, the "Iron Yard of our Lord the King" was prescribed, subdivided into 3 feet, each 12 inches long. Our yard itself is descended from the derivation of a unit of length based on the human arm.</p>
<p>Sets of standards for length and weight, generally in bronze, were sent from the capital - Winchester originally - to the main cities. In 1496, discrepancies had crept in and, following a Parliamentary inquiry, new standards were made. The same happened again in 1588, under Elizabeth I, and again in 1758. The last one, the Imperial Standard Yard in bronze was manufactured in 1845 after the previous standard had been destroyed in the fire that burned down the House of Parliament in 1834. Copies of this yard were sent to the US.</p>
<p>In England, the mile - derived from the Roman "mille passus" or 1000 double steps - was originally 5000 feet long as in the Roman definition (1 "passus" = 5 feet). Later, it was stretched to 5280 feet to accommodate exactly 8 furlongs, the most popular measure of the time. Furlong comes from the Greek and Roman stadion, which they themselves inherited from even more ancient times. It seems to be the optimal length for the traditional plough. The 1 mile = 5280 feet definition was voted in England by Parliament in 1595.</p>
<p>An early definition of an acre was defined by how much land an oxen could plow in a day.</p>
<p>In the US, in 1830 formal standardization began under the auspices of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures. In 1959, all countries using sharing traditional units such as inches, feet, miles etc. decided that an inch would be defined as 25.4 mm exactly (or 1 cm = 1/2.54 inch). This is why an inch is the same length worldwide. Other traditional units were similar defined (1 pound = 453.59237 g - or 1 kg = 1/0.45359237 pounds exactly). This means that they are as standardized and as accurate as any metric unit. Indeed, they could even be considered as "non-decimal" metric units!</p>
<p>This century, the definitions of these units are every bit as accurate as definitions of metric units. Indeed, this high level of standardization and definition of the units not only mean that they continue to be used to this day but that men were placed on the system was able to get man to the Moon. Indeed, in metricated countries like Canada, the system is still used wherever government bureaucrats have not been able to force it away because it has wide acceptance, is accurate and people are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>The United States legalized the metric system in 1857 (and in 1897 in the UK). Those industries choosing to go metric have done so (and any others wishing to do so in the future may). Clearly, the general public and many professions did not want to and will only be forced to do so by bureaucrats and under legal threats. However, despite the obvious choice of most industries and the vast majority of people to stay with American units, in 1975, the United States Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act to begin a process of "voluntary change". A law calling for voluntary change is a curious thing since laws are meant to be followed. Since then, bureaucrats and government have continued to push to getting rid of American units. The people have never been asked for their opinion, but if they had, they would favor the inch, mile, ounce, gallon, and pound over the respective metric equivalents.</p>

<dd>IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW IT WOULD MAKE ME -- OR YOU -- FEEL. Wikipedia ia an encyclopedia, not a soapbox. Is there really a public debate over whether or not the metric system should be adopted? If so, perhaps there should be an encyclopedia article discussing it. But this is one of the sorriest pages I have seen here. As far as I know, no advocate of the metric system claims that other systems are "inaccurate," so I do not see how claiming that feel and inches are "accurate" is relevant one way or the other. I think the whole article should be deleted. An article on "the metric system" can have a section on debates concerning its adoption. An article on systems of measurement can include some of what is here on the talk page, which is indeed mildly informative. But as an article on a debate or movement, this article seems poorly researched and not at all NPOV.</dd>

<p>In answer to the question posed in the RC log, a peck is a unit of <b>dry</b> measure (yes, that't right folks -- it's a unit of volume that can only be used to measure <i>certain things</i>. That's a little quirk worth preserving, right?). It's equal to 8 quarts or 1/4 of a bushel. Prizes will be awarded to the first person who can find out: (1) what 4 quarts are; (2) how many quarts in a bushel. ;-) -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>

<p><i>an inch would be defined as 25.4 mm exactly</i></p>
<p>You mean an "international inch". Then there's of course also the different "U.S. survey inch", used in parallel, with most people not even aware which one they are using at any given time.</p>
<p><i>the system was able to get man to the Moon</i></p>
<p>Yup, but the Mars observer was not as lucky, crashing because of forgotten unit conversion, to the tune of $750 million.</p>
<p><i>in 1975, the United States Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act</i></p>
<p>Just like the decision of the English parliament to redefine the mile in 1595. Are you against that one too?</p>
