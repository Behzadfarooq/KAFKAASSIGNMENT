<p>Mac Giolla Bhrighde was the oldest son of Frank and Nora <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBride_bdc8.html" title="MacBride">MacBride</a>. He had three brothers, Damian, Oistin and Lughaidh and two sisters, Marie and Patrica.</p>
<p>The MacBride family moved from their County Londonderry home to the Knock Road, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> in 1964. It was then that Mac Giolla Bhrighde was introduced to physical force republicanism by his maternal grandmother, also called Nora, who was involved in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_War_of_Independence_d28c.html" title="Irish War of Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> in the 1920s.</p>
<p>The MacBride family later moved to Killowen Street, which is located in a predominantly <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalist.html" title="Loyalist">Loyalist</a> area of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Belfast_d602.html" title="East Belfast">East Belfast</a>. The family home was subjected to a number of attacks from loyalists. The attacks came in the form of window breaking and an attempted bombing but culminated in 1972 with the shooting of Mac Giolla Bhrighde and his father Frank.</p>
<p>In May 1972, two Loyalist gunman called to the McBrides door and Nora McBride, who was carrying baby Patrica at the time went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. McBride into opening the door by stating that they were looking for work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then a young Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank was hit by 12 bullets, never recovered from the attack and died some 17 months later.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Immediately after the shooting the family moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtownards.html" title="Newtownards">Newtownards</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Down_fa32.html" title="County Down">County Down</a> and in the mid-1970s Mac Giolla Bhrighde left <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> to join the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Army_0071.html" title="Irish Army">Irish Army</a> in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.

<p>Whilst serving in the Irish Army, Mac Giolla Bhrighde also became a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volunteer_%28republican%29.html" title="Volunteer (republican)">volunteer</a> in the South Derry Brigade of the IRA.

<p>In 1979, while on leave from the Irish Army and secretly holding dual membership in the IRA and the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Army_0071.html" title="Irish Army">Irish Army</a>, Mac Giolla Bhrighde was captured by <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary_fcdf.html" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC) officers while attempting to smuggle weapons into Northern Ireland.

<p>Mac Giolla Bhrighde, according to IRA sources quoted by journalist <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Moloney_53c0.html" title="Ed Moloney">Ed Moloney</a> was noted for his hard line militarist republicanism. He is reputed to have backed a plan to form full time guerrilla units or "flying columns" based in the Republic, which would carry out four or five large scale attacks in the north a year.</p>
<p>This approach was espoused by the militant <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_East_Tyrone_Brigade_1031.html" title="Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade">Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade</a> led by <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padraig_McKearney_4981.html" title="Padraig McKearney">Padraig McKearney</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Lynagh_621f.html" title="Jim Lynagh">Jim Lynagh</a>, who wanted an escalation of the conflict to what they termed "total war". They were opposed by <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_McKenna_f8ad.html" title="Kevin McKenna">Kevin McKenna</a>, the IRA Chief of Staff and by the republican leadership based around <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Adams_0812.html" title="Gerry Adams">Gerry Adams</a>, on the grounds that actions of that scale were too big a risk and unsustainable. The IRA leadership wanted a smaller scale campaign of attrition, supplemented by political campaigning by <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_Fein_8f5c.html" title="Sinn Fein">Sinn Fein</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the early hours of Sunday morning on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2.html" title="December 2">2 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, in cold sleety conditions, Mac Giolla Bhrighde and Fleming stole a <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota.html" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> van in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pettigo.html" title="Pettigo">Pettigo</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Donegal_c69a.html" title="County Donegal">County Donegal</a>. The van was then loaded with 9 beer kegs, each containing 100lbs of low explosives. They then crossed the border and travelled to <a href="../../../k/e/s/Kesh%2C_County_Fermanagh_28bb.html" title="Kesh, County Fermanagh">Kesh, County Fermanagh</a>. At the Drumrush Lodge Restaurant just outside of Kesh they then planted a landmine in a lane leading to the restaurant and wired up a device which was connected to an observation point. From there a hoax call was made in order to lure the British Army to the restaurant on the pretence that there was a firebomb planted within the restaurant.</p>
<p>Mac Giolla Bhrighde observed a RUC patrol car approaching the restaurant and gave the detonation code word "one", however, the mine failed to explode. There was another car parked in the car park which Mac Giolla Bhrighde believed to contain civilians, and he got out of the van from which he was observing the scene to warn the civilian car to leave the area.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to the republican sources, when he approached the car, two <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Air_Service_a80c.html" title="Special Air Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) soldiers got out and commanded him to halt and drop his gun. Mac Giolla Bhrighde, who was unarmed, informed the SAS of this and then one of the SAS men stepped forward and shot him on his left side.
