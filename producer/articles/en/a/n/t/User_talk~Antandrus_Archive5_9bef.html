<dd>I bought Maynard Solomon's biography in hope of putting more solid facts into the Mozart article, but alas I don't find it very fun to read--all that morbid psychologizing and POV.

<p>(Yeah, yeah, best ignore the edits of the Cosa Nostra or you might find a horse's head in your bed tonight!) Antandrus, this is amazing, you must be psychic. I was <b>just</b> thinking of messaging you a plea for a little help with the actual music in that article-to-be. OK, so it might be a little strange for a tone-deaf person to be writing about opera to begin with, I know, but, well, if you take a look at the talk page, you'll see me explaining to Geogre about the fun stage directions I stumbled on, only I never seem to actually get to them... and then there's the problem of the music. How do you feel about adding a few, well, slightly more professional-sounding terms than "and then there was an uh, craze for, hmm, music"?

<p>Let us say a kid wants to play in sandbox but is polite and does not break any rules. I expect the kid to grow up eventually in the mean time, he spends his time in almost entirely in the Sandbox.</p>
<p>However he went to far and accidentally destroyed part of it. He doesn't contribute anything though and so the anti-fun bullies (trolls) totally ban him forever from the premises. Is this Ok? Could I ask your comment?</p>

<p><i>Adam, do you understand</i> why <i>vandalism is not good for an encyclopedia? Really? When I read your user page, the e-mail you sent me in July, and go through your contributions--including all the anonymous ones--I'm honestly baffled. You seem to think that your vandalism is all in good fun, and you can just casually change from a vandal into a good editor and back again without consequence. <b>Please stop</b>, because you DO do good work on Star Wars stuff, and we don't <b>want</b> to have to block you.

<dl>
<dd>I understand the effect it has on the encyclopedia. One of the main motivations for me to start this wave of vandalism was my cousin, once again, who got me thinking about vandalism. I gues I just like the idea of maintaining a vigilante-type reputation, so to speak. I have found wikipedia to be an excellent place for all the "unknown" information on subjects such as the star wars pages, and one of the things I speciallize in on here is working on these details. There is a side to me similar to the ones who create viruses and worms and such. I do these things such as vandalism, simply to see what will happen. In the case of July, I was able to cause a discussion among top members and administrators towards changing some of the policies of wikipedia. To be honest, this was my goal. I think I've accomplished it. So I have a mindset of a serious wikipedian (or wikiphile), while at the same time I have a darker side. Ha! I hope this answers your question, and I understand your being baffled at my motives. That was sort of my goal from the beginning. Adamwankenobi 06:02, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks! I don't have the score. I went through the tune in my head, so I may have the wrong note-count. There's another anecdote I like: someone (my memory says Boult, but I realize he would only have been 18 at the time) made a bet with Elgar that he couldn't write an A-flat major symphony whose first subject begins in D minor. He did, of course, if you don't count the intro. History doesn't record whether Elgar collected. Now I'm going to de-stub Music Makers, although Apostles and Kingdom also call. First I have to finish listening to the Seattle Rheingold, which is on radio right now (I think that's the rainbow bridge). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBrooks_470e.html" title="User:DavidBrooks">David Brooks</a> 04:56, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Antandrus. I value your judgement more than somewhat: could you please take a look at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Witold_Lutos%C5%82awski_ed4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Witold Lutos≈Çawski">this</a>? I need some advice (and consolation if you feel it's appropriate). I'm pretty despondent with the response to the FAC so far: it feels like two slaps in the face. Is the article way below FAC status in your view? With the uploader unavailable, should I remove the images until their copyright status can be demonstrated to Carnildo's satisfaction? Should I remove the article from FAC (something I think I may do anyway given the first responses)? Kind regards. --RobertG ‚ô¨ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 20:30, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you, Antandrus, I appreciate it. After sleeping on it I see now that I responded as much to Everyking's manner as his point.

<p>Thanks for adding the very convincing information on <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Horowitz_63a3.html" title="Vladimir Horowitz">Vladimir Horowitz</a>'s birthplace. I'm a little ashamed that I've never read a real biography on Horowitz.
