<p><br />
<b>Tracy Ducar</b> is known as the U.S. National Team back-up goal keeper during the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Tracy Jean Noonan Ducar was born on June 18th, 1973 in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Andover%2C_Massachusetts_2707.html" title="North Andover, Massachusetts">North Andover, Massachusetts</a>.<sup>4</sup> Ducar began her athletic career at North Andover High School. She played both basketball and soccer, however, her sophomore year she injured her back and needed surgery for two vertebrae to be fused together. Ducar was not able to play her junior year of soccer, and <b>Kevin McCarthy</b>, her soccer coach, thought she was never going to be able to play again. However, Ducar proved her coach wrong, and led North Andover’s women’s soccer team to a <b>Cape Ann League Title</b>.<sup>4</sup> After finishing her soccer career at North Andover, Ducar was off to college.<br />
<br />
The determination that inspired Ducar since high school influenced her decision to attempt to walk on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_ee51.html" title="University of North Carolina">University of North Carolina</a>. Friends, teachers, and even counselors that knew Tracy from North Andover were shocked with her decision to attend the University of North Carolina over <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth</a>, however, Ducar wanted a challenge and that is exactly what she got. Ducar played at the University of North Carolina all four years.<sup>2</sup> She graduated in 1995 with a degree in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> and a minor in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. She was also part of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Beta_Kappa_f48c.html" title="Phi Beta Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. Ducar was U.N.C.’s goal keeper. In the 1994 <b>NCSS Tournament</b>, Ducar played every minute in every game, and U.N.C. won the National Championship. Ducar had complete shutouts both in the semifinal and final games. Ducar was named candidate for the 1995 <b>Missouri Athletic Club Player of the Year</b>. Named All-American, captain, Most Valuable Player, (M.V.P.), and led U.N.C. with a record of 23-0-0 in 1995.<sup>4</sup><br />
<br />
Ducar’s first appearance on the U.S. National Team was on January 16th, 1996 vs. <b>Brazil</b> in Campihas, Brazil. Ducar picked up two more <i>caps</i>, (games played against international competition), in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on February 28th, 1996 and in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathurst.html" title="Bathurst">Bathurst</a> on March 3rd, 1996. Ducar managed her first shutout on January 28th, 1996 vs. the Ukraine.<sup>3</sup> Then in 1997, during the <b>Nike Victory Tournament</b>, Ducar split time in every game with <b>Brianna Scurry</b>, (the starting goal keeper for the U.S. National Team), and also in the Women’s World Cup in 1997. One of Ducar’s most shining moments was during the U.S. vs. <b>Salzgitter, Germany</b>. A substitution was made by the U.S., replacing Scurry with Ducar. Ducar had made four big save to keep the shut out. In 1997, Ducar had made twelve overall appearances for the national team, while starting in three of them. In 1998, Ducar played in six matches for the U.S., while starting in each one, had four shutouts, and allowed only two goals. That same year, the U.S. won the <b>Goodwill Games</b>. In 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup, Ducar represented the U.S. as one of the two back-up goal keepers.<sup>4</sup><br />
<br />
From 1999-2000, Ducar was goal keeper coach and recruiting coordinator at the <b>University of North Carolina of Greensboro</b>.<sup>5</sup> In 2000, Ducar was mot invited back to the American Training Camp for the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympics.html" title="Olympics">Olympics</a> and the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cup_64e7.html" title="World Cup">World Cup</a>.<sup>6</sup> The reason was unknown of why she was not invited back. Ducar knew her training habits were good, and she could compete with the other keepers in the camp. The most frustrating part tat Ducar could not accept was not being given the chance to compete. She emphasized her previous experience as being an already established World Cup player. Ducar will display her earrning a spot in the camp through her play.<br />
<br />
Ducar has played also for a semi professional and professional women soccer league. During the summer of 1998, Ducar played for the <b>Boston Raleigh Wings</b>, (a semi-professional women’s soccer team in Boston). In 1999, Ducar played again for the Wings and led the team to a win in the <a href="../../../w/-/l/W-League_3774.html" title="W-League">W-League</a> Championship.<sup>1</sup> In 1990, Ducar became one of the twenty founding players of the Women’s United Soccer Association, (WUSA), the first official professional women’s soccer league. From 1990-1991, Ducar played for the <b>Great Boston Girls Soccer Club</b>, also known as the <b>Boston Breakers</b>, (part of the WUSA League). The Breakers won the state title both in 1990 and in 1991. In 2001, Ducar was awarded the Boston Breaker’s <i>Shield Award</i>.<br />
<br />
In 2005, Ducar has been named the women’s head soccer coach at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro by Pride Athletics’ Director, <b>Kim Strable</b>. Strable shared with the media that Ducar is very excited about her new position, and she is ready to make the women’s soccer program at Greensboro College champions.<sup>5</sup> Ducar and her husband <b>Chris Ducar</b>, (the women’s goal keeper coach at the University of North Carolina), live together in <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham%2C_North_Carolina_32ae.html" title="Durham, North Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a>. In Durham they run soccer camps, clinics, and private teaching sessions together.<sup>5</sup> Ducar is now reaching even further beyond what she had accomplished on the soccer field, and is now teaching and influencing young women at the collagen level and children in the U.S.<br />
