<p><a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicanism.html" title="Republicanism">Republican</a>'s anti-clericalism softened after the First World War, as the Catholic right-wing began to accept <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularism</a>.

<p>Anti-clericalism in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> is connected with reaction against the alleged tyranny of the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_States_4dbf.html" title="Papal States">Papal States</a>, overthrown in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>. For a long time, the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> required Catholics not to participate in the public life of the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> that had invaded the Papal States to complete the unification of Italy, leaving the pope confined in the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_City_edb3.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a>. Some politicians that had played important roles in this process, such as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camillo_Cavour_9700.html" title="Camillo Cavour">Camillo Cavour</a>, were known to be hostile to the temporal and political power of the Church.</p>
<p>The hostility between the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a> and the kingdom was finally settled by <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benito_Mussolini_f411.html" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, who sought an agreement with the Church to gain its support: the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lateran_treaties.html" title="Lateran treaties">Lateran treaties</a> were finalised in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, anti-clericalism was embodied by the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Communist_Party_1828.html" title="Italian Communist Party">communist</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Socialist_Party_b642.html" title="Italian Socialist Party">socialist</a> parties, in opposition to the Vatican-endorsed <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Democracy_%28Italy%29_8ca9.html" title="Christian Democracy (Italy)">Christian Democracy</a>.</p>
<p>The revision of the Lateran treaties in the eighties by the socialist <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister_of_Italy_5139.html" title="Prime minister of Italy">prime minister of Italy</a> <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bettino_Craxi_6fa9.html" title="Bettino Craxi">Bettino Craxi</a>, removed the status of "official religion" of the Catholic Church, but still granted a series of provisions in favour of the Church, such as the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_per_thousand.html" title="Eight per thousand">eight per thousand</a> law, the teaching of religion in schools, and other privileges.</p>
<p>Recently, the Catholic Church has been taking a more aggressive stance in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Italy_f5fb.html" title="Politics of Italy">Italian politics</a>, in particular through <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29_84c0.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camillo_Ruini_054b.html" title="Camillo Ruini">Camillo Ruini</a>, who often makes his voice heard commenting the political debate and indicating the official line of the Church on various matters. This interventionism has increased with the papacy of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_XVI_15c6.html" title="Benedict XVI">Benedict XVI</a>. Anti-clericalism, however, is not the official stance of most parties (with the exception of the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Radicals_0396.html" title="Italian Radicals">Italian Radicals</a>), as most party leaders consider it an electoral disadvantage to openly contradict the Church: since the demise of the Christian Democracy as a single party, Catholic votes are often swinging between the right and the left wing, and are considered to be decisive to win an election.</p>

<p>Following the Revolution of 1860, US-backed President <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benito_Ju%C3%A1rez_0da4.html" title="Benito Juárez">Benito Juárez</a>, issued a decree nationalizing church property, separating church and state, and suppressing religious orders.</p>
<p>Following the revolution of 1910, the new Mexican Constitution of 1917 contained further anti-clerical provisions. Article 3 called for secular education in the schools; Article 5 outlawed monastic orders; Article 24 forbade public worship outside the confines of churches; and Article 27 placed restrictions on the right of religious organizations to hold property. Most obnoxious to Catholics was Article 130, which deprived clergy members of basic political rights. Many of these laws were resisted, leading to the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cristero_War_05fd.html" title="Cristero War">Cristero Rebellion</a> of 1927 - 1929.</p>

<p>Anti-clericalism has been hard to notice in Poland until it became one of the policies of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland_d14b.html" title="People's Republic of Poland">People's Republic of Poland</a>. It was nonetheless not a policy that gained any significant public support, as the Catholic Church became one of the publicly recognized and respected centers of the opposition to the government. Ironicaly, this has been reversed following the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_communism.html" title="Fall of communism">fall of communism</a> in Poland, when the role of Catholic Church in political life increased. Some priests gained much influence in politics (ex. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henryk_Jankowski_775a.html" title="Henryk Jankowski">Henryk Jankowski</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadeusz_Rydzyk_5239.html" title="Tadeusz Rydzyk">Tadeusz Rydzyk</a>) and although their views and actions don't necessarily represent that of the Church, their views are supported by some political parties (ex. <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Polish_Families_66bc.html" title="League of Polish Families">League of Polish Families</a>) and groups (ex. <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Maryja_bc70.html" title="Radio Maryja">Radio Maryja</a>). This has led to the creation of opposition based on anti-clericalism philosophy (ex. <a href="../../../m/o/h/Moherowe_berety.html" title="Moherowe berety">Moherowe berety</a>).</p>

<p>A first wave of anti-clericalism occurred in 1834 when under the government of <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dom_Pedro_cec3.html" title="Dom Pedro">Dom Pedro</a> all convents and monasteries in Portugal were abolished, simultaneously closing some of Portugal's primary educational establishments. The fall of the Monarchy in the Republican revolution of 1910 led to another wave of anti-clerical activity. Most church property was put under State control, and the church was not allowed to inherit property. The wearing of religious garb and religious instruction in schools were abolished, as well as religious oaths and church taxes.</p>

<p>In 1836 following the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Carlist_War_8bb9.html" title="First Carlist War">First Carlist War</a>, the new regime abolished the major Spanish Convents and Monasteries. The Radical <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Lerroux_acbb.html" title="Alejandro Lerroux">Alejandro Lerroux</a> distinguished himself by his inflammatory pieces of opinion. During the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> of the 1930s, many of the Republican forces were violently anti-clerical <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communists</a>, whose assaults included sacking and burning monasteries and churches and killing an estimated 6,000 priests, including 259 Claretians, 226 Franciscans, 204 Piarists, 176 Brothers of Mary, 165 Christian Brothers, 155 Augustinians, 132 Dominicans, and 114 Jesuits. Unfortunately, such occurrences were often exaggerated by the opposing side, the Nationalists, for purposes of propaganda, and the levels of anti-clerical violence are still debated. Despite this, the Catholic Church (mainly <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a>) has seen fit to recognize several martyrs of the Spanish Civil War.</p>

<li id="_note-cathencmason1"><b><a href="#_ref-cathencmason1_0" title="">^</a></b> "From the official documents of French Masonry contained principally in the official "Bulletin" and "Compte-rendu" of the Grand Orient it has been proved that all the anti-clerical measures passed in the French Parliament were decreed beforehand in the Masonic lodges and executed under the direction of the Grand Orient, whose avowed aim is to control everything and everybody in France." From the 1917 Catholic Encyclopedia article <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm" rel="nofollow">Freemasonry</a> citing <i>"Que personne ne bougera plus en France en dehors de nous", "Bull. Gr. Or.", 1890, 500 sq.</i></li>
<li id="_note-cathencmason2"><b><a href="#_ref-cathencmason2_0" title="">^</a></b> "But in spite of the failure of the official transactions, there are a great many German and not a few American Masons, who evidently favour at least the chief anti-clerical aims of the Grand Orient party." From the 1917 Catholic Encyclopedia article <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm" rel="nofollow">Freemasonry</a></li>
<li id="_note-salinas"><b><a href="#_ref-salinas_0" title="">^</a></b> "After the defeat and exile of the dictator in the 1910 revolution, a succession of Presidents who were Masons and strongly anticlerical ruled the country under the 1917 Constitution that maintained substantially the same liberal principles of 1857." From <a href="http://www.yorkrite.com/gcmx/os1999.html" class="external text" title="http://www.yorkrite.com/gcmx/os1999.html" rel="nofollow">Mexican Masonry- Politics &amp; Religion</a> by Oscar Salinas, Senior Grand Warden-York/Mexico</li>
<li id="_note-Venzi"><b><a href="#_ref-Venzi_0" title="">^</a></b> “never before has a Masonic lodge made such a gesture towards the Catholic Church, distancing itself from other irregular Masonic lodges that, with their anti-clericalism, have caused much harm to the image of freemasonry in the world.” Grand Master Fabio Venzi of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Italy quoted in <a href="http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=38910" class="external text" title="http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=38910" rel="nofollow">Catholic priest made chaplain to Italian Masonic lodge</a>, Catholic World News, Auguist 9th 2005</li>
<li id="_note-builder"><b><a href="#_ref-builder_0" title="">^</a></b> "We do not think that it would be accurate or just to describe, even the Grand Orient of France as anti-Christian, though it is undoubtedly very strongly anticlerical." <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/the_builder_1928_august.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/the_builder_1928_august.htm" rel="nofollow">Editorial of the Builder August 1928 - Volume XIV - Number 8</a></li>
