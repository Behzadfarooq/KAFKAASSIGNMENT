	    <p><b>Anti-submarine mortars</b> are artillery pieces deployed on ships for the purpose of sinking <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarines</a> by a direct hit with a small explosive charge. They are often larger versions of the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortar</a> used by <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> and fire a projectile in relatively the same manner. They were created in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">WWII</a> as a development of the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charge</a> and works on the same principle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-submarine_mortar.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings</span></h2>
<p>Anti-submarine warfare did not become an issue of great concern until <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">WWI</a>, when Germany used submarines in an attempt to strangle British shipping in the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and elsewhere. The earliest way to counter a submarine was in the form of depth charges, which were large canisters filled with explosives, rolled off the back of a ship and detonated by a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrostatic.html" title="Hydrostatic">hydrostatic</a> fuse. Depth charges served well throughout WWI but were not without flaws. A ship had to pass directly over a submarine to score an effective hit, because of this depth charges were dropped in lines instead of more effective clusters and could only be carried in ships fast enough to avoid the concussion of the explosion. The depth charges were also not as effective as one might think at sinking a submarine - only a very close detonation would sink a submarine, and the problems of scoring a direct hit meant that a submarine was more often damaged then destroyed by depth charges.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-submarine_mortar.html" title="Edit section: Early Anti-Submarine Mortars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Anti-Submarine Mortars</span></h2>
<p>After WWI depth charge throwers were developed, which could hurl depth charges some 100 feet off the side of a ship. These were a significant improvemnt over the old method, but still required a ship to pass very close to a submarine. Later in the war more effective systems, and the first Anti-submarine mortars, were developed. The first was the famous <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedgehog_%28weapon%29.html" title="Hedgehog (weapon)">"Hedgehog"</a>, which consisted of 24 small mortar rounds, each one 7 inches in diameter and weighing 65 pounds with a 35-pound warhead. Each projectile had a range of about 250 yards and was fired in a circular pattern in front of a ship. While the warhead on a hedgehog was much smaller then that of a depth charge it scored 3 times as many kills then its predecessors. This was due to the use of a contact fuse on the projectile, which would only detonate on impact with a target. Since the projectile would only explode on a hit the long periods of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html" title="Sonar">sonar</a> "blackout" were eliminated. The fact that the Hedgehog could be fired in front of a ship meant that it did not have to pass directly over the target.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-submarine_mortar.html" title="Edit section: Modern Uses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Uses</span></h2>
<p>The homing <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedo</a> has largely replaced the anti-submarine mortar in naval combat, although several examples still exist. The British <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limbo_%28weapon%29.html" title="Limbo (weapon)">Limbo</a> system, with three gyro-stabilized barrels, fires 350-pound projectiles to a range of 1,000 yards. It remained in service with many <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">British</a> and Commonwealth navies until the 1980s. The <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors.html" title="Bofors">Bofors</a> anti-submarine mortar, which uses a rocket motor in place of an explosive charge, is still in use with the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Navy_f056.html" title="Swedish Navy">Swedish Navy</a>. Due to the poor sonar conditions of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_sea.html" title="Baltic sea">Baltic sea</a> the mortar still retains a place next to torpedoes. It has two or four barrels and fires a 550-pound projectile up to 3,800 yards. The former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Navy_e614.html" title="Soviet Navy">Soviet Navy</a> (and by extension, the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Navy_e4eb.html" title="Russian Navy">Russian Navy</a>) is the largest user of anti-submarine mortars. Keeping with the Soviet idea that weapons should be simple and cheap, several versions of anti-submarine mortars were developed. The most common is the <a href="../../../r/b/u/RBU-6000_b8b0.html" title="RBU-6000">RBU-6000</a>, which fires 12 160-pound projectiles in a horseshoe pattern up to 6,500 yards away. There was also a more extreme version, the nuclear SUW-N-1, though this is more technically an anti-submarine rocket. It had anti-surface and land-attack uses as well.</p>
