<dd>Billy's fatalism appears to be grounded in reality <i>(at least that reality which Billy perceives)</i>; after noting that Billy had a copy of the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serenity_Prayer_be08.html" title="Serenity Prayer">Serenity Prayer</a> in his office, the narrator says, "Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present, and the future."</dd>

<p>I disagree with your edit above; in this novel, the universe is completely deterministic. Unless you are perhaps talking about the theory that the Trafalmadorians are in Billy's imagination? <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 18:12, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is exactly what I'm talking about. For some reason a lot of the people who edit the article are under the impression that because Billy is our viewpoint character, that whatever he perceives as happening <i>is</i> literally happening (or will happen), and ignore the fact that <i>because</i> Billy is our viewpoint character, we have no objective verification that things are actually happening as he perceives them. If Billy's Trafalmadorian experiences aren't real, then neither are any of the people who supposedly verify their reality; we don't even know if the porn actress that he sees on Earth really is named Montana Wildhack or if that too is part of the delusion. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:40, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Antaeus, by all means think it over. While Rfa can occassionally be a bit contentious, I don't <i>think</i> you'll have any serious problems. And the rollback button alone is worth the price of admission. Keep in mind as well that accepting the mop does NOT oblige you to necessarily spend more time on "admin" functions. For me, the rollback and ability to do the more complex page moves are 90% of the functionality I actually use. I have blocked the occassional vandal, but I don't think I've ever had call to protect a page except when it was an image going on the main page.

<p>First of all, I would like to thank you for pointing out the mistakes to me. I do not know where I got this idea that H2 headings must be in small letters apart from the first word, and H3 headings onwards should be in title case (ie. capitalize the first letter of each word). I may have read it somewhere, or else some users must have told me that. I have since go back to the MoS and found that all headings should be treated in the same way. Thanks for your advice.</p>
<p>I have spend two days trying to edit this article (outside the website, that is). It seems to me that an integrative approach is necessarily, rather than minor adjustments here and there. In any case, if this is the wrong approach of doing things, I guess it is better for me to spend my time elsewhere. For this article, I felt that while the contents are very well written, the structure (ie. the way the sections were arranged) was kind of disorganized.</p>
<p>As for minor mistakes here and there, there are bound to be, although I did take considerable care. As for non-quotations that have been converted into quotations, it must be because the "apostrophes for italicizing words" look so much like "quotation marks". I will take note of that in future.</p>
<p>In any case, if these mistakes are deemed to outweigh the contributions that I have made, it would be best to revert the article back to its original version. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">PM Poon</a> 18:04, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, please notice that I never asked you to not make changes. What I asked is that you space them out more, so that other people have a chance to check your changes and respond appropriately. This might actually save you some work; if you correct one kind of mistake, another editor may see it and realize that other mistakes of the same kind are still to be found in the article; the job gets done by cooperative effort because everybody takes a little bit of the job to do. As I said, there's practical reasons, as well as civility, behind spacing out your edits. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:16, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have seen your edit, and have greatly learnt from it. As far as I can see, about half the errors come from the subheading style where I had used the title case, as advised by one user earlier on. This is a very minor problem that could easily be corrected without creating a storm in the teacup. As far as I am concerned, sometimes a cooperative style where "everybody takes a little bit of the job to do" is excellent, but there are instances when it is not — for example, when a holistic approach to editing the article is necessary, such as in restructuring an article, after many users have contributed. As in many things in life, there are times when quantum leaps are necessary, and there are times when tiny steps are preferred. Let us not therefore quarrel and let us agree to disagree.</p>
<p>From my short experience here, editing in Wikipedia has not been a very rewarding endeavor, what with the attitudes of some of the administrators. While it is true that you never did ask me not to make changes, you did NOT find anything good in my edit, and merely saw the mistakes. In any case, would you agree that the revised article is now neater, and that the cost in terms of effort to both of us is worth the while? If not, please revert my edit to the original. This will ensure that justice is not only done, but seen to be done. It's no point griping at something, and yet wanting to use it at the same time. -- <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">PM Poon</a> 03:25, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Much of what you remove is useful information. You need to be a little more open minded as to what should be removed and not removed. If it is not false, and not libel, obscene or irrevelent it should stay.</p>
<p>Unfortunetly, you remove what people worked hard to create out of your own arrogance. Try and think that perhaps it may have low value to you, it may be of value to others.</p>

<dd>Oh, I see! I thought it was just another unilateral edit by the same anon (you know the one I mean, of course) just with a different edit summary instead of the same old "spammer and plagiarist". (In fact, looking at the contributions history, it looks like it <i>is</i> the same anon...) I didn't realize that there actually <i>was</i> a consensus decision and this time the anon was acting in accordance with it instead of defying it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">David Bauer (actor)</span></h2>
<p>Well, based on the availble facts, since he would have been in his 30's at the time of the Red Scare of 1948-1953, I made the perhaps unwarranted assumption that he was actor by trade, if perhaps not a film actor before he moved to Britain. He certainly played American roles in Britain. If you want to change the stub back to just plain actor or double stub him as both a US and a UK actor, I wouldn't mind. I don't think stubbing him as just a UK actor would be approriate tho. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 17:56, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Double-stubbing seems to be the way to go. Even based on just the known facts, you can make a good argument for either side -- he was certainly an actor <i>in</i> Britain, but he was best known for playing "an American", so... I don't see what double-stubbing would hurt, so I'll add the British stub. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:00, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About the judges opinion; I meant that whatever the judge may have said, it doesn't have any bearing because Jimbo's words (Jeff's version or otherwise) have no bearing on the deletion request. Hauling in the particular findings of fact feels like the goal was to encite Jeff (who has a short enough fuse as it is) rather than discussing the merits of the deletion request. Posting the quote now has brought Jeff to more posturing again. Sorry that I didn't elaborate that on the deletion page.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Otherkin_a04d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Otherkin">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Otherkin</a>. It's entirely possible that I'm completely misreading <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, as I've only been here a couple months. I agree that some things need more verifiability than others, however to me, Otherkin seems about as verifiable as an article about "Bloggers who hate George W. Bush". Certainly, a quick google reveals that they exist. However, expecting readers to "verify" the article by reading people's blogs doesn't seem quite cricket to me. To me it's a classic example of an article built using only nonreputable sources, which is why I quoted that bit from WP:V in the nomination. It's entirely possible that I have a non-mainstream idea of what verifiability means, tho. Anyway, I welcome any further comments you may have, as I'm trying to get a good handle on what WP:V and WP:NOR really mean. I thought I mostly knew, but from this Afd, it sure looks like most people disagree with me. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:05, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your thoughtful response, Friday. Whatever our points of disagreement may be, I can tell you it's delightful to deal with someone who not only studies Wikipedia's policies but puts thought into why they are there in the first place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The difference I would draw between "Otherkin" and "Bloggers who hate George W. Bush" is that, given basic knowledge of what blogging is, and what bloggers are like, it seems almost a given that no matter who the current U.S. President was, there would be bloggers who hated him or her. Such an article would almost inevitably go one of three ways:
<ul>
<li>Statements that do not need verification but do not say anything interesting or non-obvious. "There are many bloggers who hate George W. Bush."</li>
<li>Statements and claims that are interesting and/or non-obvious but need verification. "Most bloggers who hate George W. Bush are minorities." "Bloggers who hate George W. Bush have on average more education than bloggers who like George W. Bush." These certainly go farther than just saying "these bloggers exist" but who's assuring us that these things are true? To put such statements in the article we would at the very least need to know who makes this claim, and describe it as their claim, rather than as something Wikipedia is stating as fact.</li>
<li>Statements and claims that are interesting and/or non-obvious and may even be verified, but which belong in other articles. For instance, "Bloggers who hate Bush often criticize his invasion of Iraq based on faulty intelligence such as the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowcake_forgery.html" title="Yellowcake forgery">yellowcake forgery</a>." This <i>is</i> a frequent criticism of Bush but it would be more appropriate in a general "Criticism of George W. Bush" article -- unless this was a criticism particularly stressed by bloggers more than other critics, which would probably need verification that this is a blogger-specific criticism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In contrast, the belief system (loose and varying though it may be) that defines Otherkin is not an obvious one by any means. The average person, if not specifically told that these people exist, would probably never guess that these people exist, or what they believe in. This is what makes it possible to write an interesting, non-obvious article on Otherkin just by describing their beliefs, and for the most part (there are exceptions, of course) we can take people's words for what their own belief systems are.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The prohibition of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> really has two purposes. One is to prevent Wikipedia from being seen as an avenue of publication for crackpots; numerous times we've been told that Wikipedia <i>needs</i> to keep the article that so-and-so wrote or otherwise The Truth will never get out because the Phar-Mafia/the CIA/the Einstein Cabal prevents the research from being published elsewhere. Needless to say, that's when we explain that if the peer-reviewed scientific journals passed on it, we will too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other is to keep people from drawing their own suspect conclusions and presenting them in article space -- for instance, if some editor decided that the legends of werewolves in the Middle Ages must have come from Otherkin who were there at that time, <i>that</i> would definitely be original research. The prohibition against disreputable sources is to keep people from presenting dubious facts or conclusions as fact just because <i>someone</i> out there who wasn't a Wikipedia editor claimed it to be so. If the Otherkin article were to state that legends of werewolves in the Middle Ages came from Otherkin, not because an editor decided it but because an Otherkin site claimed it to be so -- <i>then</i> we'd definitely run into problems of verifiability. But as long as we're describing what people <i>believe</i> as what they believe, we <i>can</i> usually take people's word on it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:32, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for taking the time to provide such a detailed response. It all seems reasonable to me. Part of me wishes there was a way of tagging an article as using possibly dubious sources, though. Part of my experience with <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> was that a while back I wanted to merge several of the otherkin-subtype articles into the main article. The problem was, some of the people who were <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elenari.html" title="Elenari">Elenari</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthrope.html" title="Therianthrope">therianthropes</a> or <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire_lifestyle.html" title="Vampire lifestyle">Vampire lifestylers</a> consider Otherkin a seperate group. There wasn't enough consensus to agree on how to categorize and (possibly) merge some of this stuff. I think that'll continue to be a problem, but maybe that's just how it goes with obscure topics. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:45, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings, I am back from my 6 month hiatus and wish to pursue various edits that interest me. Prime among my interests, is Dedham. As you now. we previously locked horns over my not having sufficient information to back up various assertions about the history of that town. However, I did buy and re-read a copy of the book I referred to back then, and as I knew it would be, it's chock full of the kind of facts I'd like to see in the Dedham article. I feel that various aspects of Dedham's history are underwieghted in the article and I'd like to see that corrected. I am going to work up a mock-up of that page, as a scratch page under my user page, which shows the edit's I'd like to include. When it's ready (in a few days), I'd like your feedback about it.
