<p>I was wondering if Anton LaVey ever appeared on the Tonight Show, or any other talk show. If so, is their footage of that interview? I also thought that a list of guests on the Tonight Show would be a good idea for a Wikipedia article.</p>

<p>Some of you may notice that the article on LaVeyan Satanism now redirects to <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanism.html" title="Satanism">Satanism</a>. This is as it should be, and is a long time coming. A serious effort is finally underway to clean up the disorder and subpar editing that has for too long characterized this series of articles. I welcome everyone interested to continue their valued contributions, and to join in the effort to restore sensibility to the representation of Satanism on Wikipedia.

<p>The picture caption says 'Dr.,' yet I can't find any academic credentials in his bio. Can anyone explain?</p>
<ul>
<li>Anton is referred to as Dr. or Doktor by his close friends and associates. He does not have a degree that would give him the title, but the same goes with the title 'Black Pope'. KevinISlaughter</li>
</ul>
<p>I remember reading somewhere that he was involved with Marilyn Monroe. Can anyone confirm?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Photos exist to at least prove that Anton LaVey met both Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, and pretty good documentation exists to confirm his involvement with Mansfield. His relationship with Marilyn Monroe is impossible to prove either way except to say that they met (though the fact that she was photographed with him at all should provide pretty strong evidence of the veracity of his claims; I can think of few other circumstances that would permit him to be photographed with her). The fact that this is always denied or ignored by biographers of either lady only proves that admiring biographers are disturbed that their favorite starlet may have been involved with him, just as most biographers of Benjamin Franklin gloss over his involvement with English Hellfire Clubs. --<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 23:00, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a longstanding rumour --- don't know if it's more than that --- that he had some kind of relationship with <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayne_Mansfield_fc8b.html" title="Jayne Mansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a>, and that Mansfield was a member of the Church of Satan. Never heard about Monroe. Wasn't he in <i><a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary%27s_Baby_61d5.html" title="Rosemary's Baby">Rosemary's Baby</a></i> as well?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anton LaVey appeared in Rosemary's baby very briefly as Satan in the rape scene. He was also an uncredited technical advisor on the film. The Secret Life of a Satanist details his relationship with Monroe.</dd>

<hr />
<p>There is currently a great deal of controversy surrounding the life of Anton LaVey. Many of the stories that have been circulating about his life have been challenged since his death in 1997. These stem primarily from an article written by his estranged daughter Zeena and her husband Nikolas Schreck, both former members of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Satan_20d2.html" title="Church of Satan">Church of Satan</a>. It is attached to this article and is called <a href="http://fcos.us//aslv.html" class="external text" title="http://fcos.us//aslv.html" rel="nofollow">Anton LaVey: Legend and Reality</a>. Few, if any, of the claims put forth in the Schreck's article have been officially refuted to my knowledge by the Church of Satan. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>He never knew either <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayne_Mansfield_fc8b.html" title="Jayne Mansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a> intimately</li>
<li>He had no involvement with <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary%27s_Baby_61d5.html" title="Rosemary's Baby">Rosemary's Baby</a> and was only asked to appear at a screening of the film by a San Francisco theatre.</li>
<li>He didn't ritualistally shave his head on <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walpurgisnacht.html" title="Walpurgisnacht">Walpurgisnacht</a>, 1966 in order to usher in Anno Satanas of the Satanic Empire. He shaved it later that year, on a dare made by his wife.</li>
<li>He essentially lied about every aspect of his past in order to create a legend or Myth about himself. These range from his claim that the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_House_12a2.html" title="Black House">Black House</a> was originally equipped with secret passageways and trap doors. The Schrecks claim that this is pure fabrication and that the house belonged to his parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be kept firmly in mind that the authors of these claims both have personal animus towards Anton LaVey and may have been motivated by personal grudges. The allegations are quite harsh in places and accuse LaVey of beating his second wife Diana repeatedly and trying to strangle her, beating his pets, abetting a friend by idly watching him molest LaVey's grandson, as well as fabricating his fabled job histories as a <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion.html" title="Lion">lion</a> tamer, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">photographer</a>, etc.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Schreck document appears to be a combination of fact and hysterical hyperbole based on a pronounced feeling of loss. Dr. LaVey had not been gone for three months when this report was compiled. Zeena Schreck left the Church in 1990 in order to join The <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Set_2fd1.html" title="Temple of Set">Temple of Set</a>, which was founded in 1975 by ex members of the COS. Prior to that, she denounced her Father and remained estranged from him until his death. All these factors make it difficult to determine what precisely <i>is</i> factual and therefore ought to be included in the Wikipedia biography.</p>
<p>The main problem is that claims have been made to challenge the validity of numerous occurances that are contained within both of LaVey's biographies. Also, loyal followers are loathe to contradict what has long been accepted as the official word on his personal life. Should we just create a disclaimer that states, something to the effect, that "the events proclaimed in this article as fact have been challenged on several fronts by individuals who had unresolved grievances with LaVey"?</p>
<p>I'm going to leave a note about the Schreck's article on the page. I just want to draw people's attention to the relationship between the author(s) and LaVey. _________________________________________________________ I agree completely with your final statement. It's almost amazing how people jump at the chance to denounce somebody after they have passed on and can no longer defend themselves... almost. But you have to keep in mind the dispicable nature of mankind. Everyone was too cowardly to make these accusations while he was alive. Zeena was sore about the divorce between Anton and Diana, and of course Diana would feel the same way. And when you get two women together who want to cause trouble, this sort of thing is bound to occur.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As opposed to when you get two similarly minded <i>men</i> together, right? --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHaruki_4d6c.html" title="User:Haruki">Haruki</a> 10:03, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</pre>
<p>Actually, many of the claims made in Legend and Reality, (minus the personal family business), were also made in the Sept. 1991 Rolling Stone article, "Sympathy for the Devil". The original letter from Zeena to Dr Aquino, (Dec. 1990), was written around the same time as the Lawrence Wright article. Hence his inclusion, "Later I learned that, earlier in the evening, LaVey's younger daughter had chosen this special day to renounce her father.......in a letter to LaVey's archenemy, Michael Aquino." It may also be noted that Dr LaVey did respond to Mr Wright, when he said, "I don't want the legend to disappear. There is a danger you will disenchant a lot of young people who use me as a role model.".</p>

<li>Rolling Stone Magazine interview with LaVey by Lawrence Wright’ - <i>"It’s Not Easy Being Evil in a World That’s Gone to Hell"</i>, Rolling Stone, September 5, 1991 - LaVey reveals his own Jewish heritage and rela name, as does Blanche Barton. LaVey also stated in this interview: <i>"There is a danger you will disenchant a lot of young people who use me as a role model."</i> and <i>"I don't want the legend to disappear"</i></li>

Referring to the influence that Sir Basil Zaharoff had on LaVey, as opposed to “Stanton” being LaVey’s middle birth name, Barton writes, “LaVey’s grandson, born in 1978, was named “Stanton Zaharoff” in his honor.” Barton, The Secret Life of a Satanist, 24. When referring to LaVey’s grandson’s first name, Barton says that he was named after a character in William Lindsay Gresham’s novel Nightmare Alley. Ibid., 42. What Barton fails to mention in both instances is that “Stanton” was Anton LaVey’s middle birth name. Because Barton was LaVey’s live in lover and here the author of his “authorized biography”, the failure to do so is significant because it further goes to prove a deliberate repression of pertinent information for the purposes of advancing LaVey’s self-created “autobiographical” details.</li>

<p>Okay, I cleaned up the article considerably.... there were an excessive number of one-sided "then Anton said this, which was later proven to be a lie" totally NNPOV statements. I removed these and mostly quarantined such drama to the "Criticism" section, which I have expanded greatly. Statements in the biography part that are highly contentious have been softened and tempered with language like "reportedly" and "according to his biography". Pro-Anton supporters may be irked that I've given more space to Zeena's criticisms, but on the other hand, Pro-Zeena supporters will probably be irked that the article reflects Zeena's lack of proof of her claims, aside from mere anecdotal hearsay from Anton's old enemies. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:22, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Satanism tag is misleading. Anton LaVey created Satanism; therefore his definitions and codifications should be the guideline. According to LaVey, there are no denominations or "Types" of Satanism. Keeping this in mind, I think it would be appropriate to remove the tag.

<p>Birth name was reverted by anon, asserting that the Encyclopaedia Britannica is not a reliable source, which stated his birth name as "Howard Levy". We also find on sites like churchofsatan.org that his birth name was "Howard Stanton Levey". There is an entry in the Social Security Death Index at familysearch.org for "Anton LAVEY", with the same birth date and death dates and locations. However, the number was issued in California, that is, not at birth. This could indicate that he changed his name and got a new number therefor. The name change agrees with several sources. Is there a good refutation of the name change somewhere? —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 20:58, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
churchofsatan.org is not a reliable source for this information, not only from a CoS POV but from a Wiki POV. Their own bias is very clearly strong, and should be ignored. Encyclopedia Britannica is a source of unknown information on this, as it is not clear at all where Encyclopedia Britannica got this information; I think it is fair to say that perhaps even such usually reputable sources get lazy when it comes to an issue like Satanism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Montalba.html" class="external free" title="http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Montalba.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Montalba.html</a></p>
<p>This source, as well as Magistra Barton's book, seem to suggest otherwise. According to her, his birth name was Howard Anton LaVey, but also mentions confusion in spelling the last name as it was spelled LeVey by his father but LaVey by his uncle; understandable as it was a name assigned at Ellis Island to his family. She also mentions that even as a child he wrote his name Anton Szandor LaVey, suggesting that it could have been a name his own family used for him (perhaps out of old world sentiment, it does not specify).</p>
<p>While I do not feel like it is a particularly big issue and hence I have never edited it, I have never in all my research heard him referred to as "Howard Levy" {which should throw EB's facts into deep question as no one else mentions this name, among all those who knew him and even his detractors), and no reliable source that his name ever included "Stanton" (actually, looking at the original source of this information the motives for this should be clear).</p>
<p>My suggestion is to simply make no mention of alternate names in the article as they are not relevant to his life (he was never published or known by any other name), at the very least until a truly reliable source of information, namely official court documents, is cited. I don't personally think it's worth my time to request those documents, and probably there would still be constant argument on the issue even if you had proof in hand. --<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 00:26, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not aware of a source that suggests that Dr. LaVey possessed any Ukrainian heritage; the original quote citing his heritage is from Magistra Blanche Barton's book, "The Secret Life of a Satanist," a biography of him by the person who probably knew him best.

<p>For some reason this again seems to be a source of eternal controversy, for unknown reasons. Why anyone feels like it is relevant information that one person with a clear agenda has disputed his ancestry amidst other "discrediting" claims (many of which have been verifiably disproven) is beyond me, except that he is such a controversial figure that any small foothold for criticism is embraced without question. A Rolling Stone interview with a drug addict should not by any standard be given equal credence to a published biography. In any case, criticisms should be restricted to the section devoted to that; a good article should present the bare facts as they are most commonly accepted by the most qualified sources. If we simply must include unverified and unfounded claims in a subsection just to satisfy the critics (mostly anonymous editors, I might add), then at least keep it restricted to that section. --<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 00:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Prevent any furthur misunderstandinds, the editing to say he was for definite Ukrainian was a error on my part, however both Blanche Barton's "The Secret Life of a Satanist" and Zeena LaVey's "Anton LaVey: Legend and Reality" both make claims of his ancestry without any sources. A compromise should be made (if there is an agreement on the lst statement) that being that according to LaVey's biography "The Secret Life of a Satanist", his ancestry can be traced to French, Alsatian, German, Russian, and Romanian stock, and any mention of the dispute from Zeena LaVey will be restricted to the Criticism section. to say that His ancestry could be traced to Romania does not reflect the neutrlity of wikipedia in that no third party has verified such a claim. No further editing on this will be done by me until an agreement can be found. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">AlexanderLevian</a></p>

<dd>Actually this is not exactly a fair statement. Blanche Barton's biography of LaVey was in fact sourced, by LaVey himself. One could attempt to make the "he could have lied" argument, but given the fact that there is no conceivable reason why someone would lie about having widely mixed heritage (especially when his own name supports his claimed origins) and much of her biography is readily supported by available facts and photographs this is a last ditch type of argument that is "unresolvable" but most importantly unproductive. Contrasted to this, Zeena's claims include a great many statements that have been entirely proven false, rendering her flatly an invalid source for any information on his life. If a source has a reputation for honesty, it should be trusted; if a source is proven dishonest, it should be ignored especially when it contradicts an honest source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am at a loss to account for why you think it is a neutrality issue as to whether or not LaVey had Romanian heritage. What "third party" do you want, his entire family tree verified by various European governments? The demands made to "prove" LaVey's claims far, far exceed those made of other historical figures, which if you will pardon me saying so is far more of a neutrality issue. The fact that his accounts of his life, including his very own biography written by a person close to him, is constantly called into question despite the fact that not one of his statements about himself has ever been proven to be an outright lie is a travesty of neutrality. Were we to enforce fair and balanced Wikipedia neutrality upon this article, I would be obliged to immediately delete the entire criticisms section and remove every last one of the critical statements from the articles since not one of them, not a single one, is based upon a reliable source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The very problem with this article and most of the Satanism articles is that every last point made in them is ever under attack by non-neutral parties who want to smear them at worst, and when forced to admit that they do not have good sources want to "compromise" by making their smears in thinly veiled language or leaving half in and taking half out. For the reasons I have named, that Zeena LaVey cannot be considered an honest source of information and that her claims cannot be taken in good faith from a Wikipedia stance of neutrality, every criticism made must be sourced or face removal. If we wish to bring out the neutrality issue, I'm all for doing so and mercilessly putting all these claims on the cutting room floor. LaVey's claims are backed by two biographies (yes, two; Burton Wolfe wrote another that further substantiates many of his claims), photographic evidence, and countless personal accounts from friends and associates. His detractors claims are backed by a document proven to be dishonest published in a pop culture magazine consisting of an interview with a drug addict. The evidence speaks for itself. --<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 18:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not saying to mention the dispute in his wikipedia biography nor to change the claim (your right, it's the critic's duty to present verifiable sourses) but the entire article for him on wikipedia includes the following "according to his biography." before all articles claimed in said biography. If this change will be aloud then the dispute will be irrelevant (there's no dispute that both of his biograhy claims this heritage). Don't misunderstand, I'm not out to tear down LaVey's Name. Just to find an agreeable (and objective) statement. I hope we can reason this out like gentlemen. I'm only asking that the statement be changed as i shall do so, and if this is still opposing wikipedia's nuetral view point, i will allow changing of same. thank you for your time. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">AlexanderLevian</a></p>

<dd>Certainly, I do not mind the input. I agree that in strict neutrality, certain sentences should be rephrased to specify that they are claims made according to him, and neither wholly substantiated nor disproven by outside sources. Certain personal details of his life are literally impossible to verify with outside documentation, and not because he's hiding things but because he was prior to the Church of Satan not a celebrity and therefore not particularly documented. However, many such facts are of considerable interest to the man's life and should not be omitted wholly, but I will agree that in the interest of Wikipedia standards, some of them may be best revised to indicate that they are only sourced by himself and his biographies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I simply find it mildly frustrating that "sources" that for any other public figure would be immediately considered tabloid and entirely unusable as a reliable Wikipedia source are considered valid as it applies to LaVey (I am specifically referring to Zeena's claims). I do strongly support true neutrality with this article and all articles, but it is a long uphill battle to get neutrality when it comes to Satanic subjects. --<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 16:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know, From my own research, none of Zeena's claims are verifiable except a few that were never "lies" in the first place (such as the claim that the satanic bible was plagiarized, when in fact excerpts from "might is right" (not copyrighted, to my knowledge however) were used and some ideas of past occultist and philosophers were reasearched and organized, all to back Lavey's initial ideas. also the rosemary's baby movie to with i still can't find a interview or lititure that anton ever said he was a advisor or satan or anything but a heavy influence) she is unreliable and i as of now delete any sources that i have cited using her. but i still maintain my claim with rosemary's baby based on william castle's (producer/cameo actor of rosemary's baby) biography. And 3 IMDB entries, but to be fair these are internet sources. i'm glad we've come to agreement, and yes it will be a long time before subjects like satanism can be discussed and research in an objective and neutral fashion. thank you. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">AlexanderLevian</a> 19:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recent changes by anonymous editors have led me to start this discussion. I have not read anything in which Dr.Lavey (himself) made any claim of being an actor nor a technical adivisor in the film "Rosemary's Baby". the IMDB website entries mentioned by the editor as sources state no involvement of his with the film. The biography of William Castle (cameo actor and producer of Rosemary's Baby) claims the same. therefore, I have reverted the changes, cited sources, and will continue to do so until proper sources are cited to show Dr.LaVey's involvement as either technical advisor or actor (or atleast actually saying he was, in the case of the IMDB entries). I hope we can maintain nuetrality (as hard as it is with subjects like satanism). thank you. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">AlexanderLevian</a> 07:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't changed anything yet, but this is a counter source. It leads me to believe that possibly the whole thing should be changed to say "disputed" since it would appear that even ignoring any CoS sources, there is in fact public disagreement on whether or not LaVey really did do the role. It's not an issue of great importance to me either way, but it does make me wonder why all this disagreement exists (and watching the movie, I agree that the eyes look pretty similar). -<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 20:44, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would normally agree, but there are two problem. First, the site doesn't name the writer of that article, therefore we don't have credentials of his authority on the movie. second, the site doesn't list any lititure or official interview to show where they would get such information. the site itself is therefore unreliable. I've noticed several similar sites claiming the source of LaVey's involvement is in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_Superstar_3103.html" title="Charles Manson Superstar">Charles Manson Superstar</a>, which is written and directed by Nikolas Schreck (The same man who, along with Zeena Lavey, began spreading the "Anton LaVey: Legend and reality" slander) and on the DVD release of same Schrek changed his position and would even later claimed LaVey "lied to him". So since we consider him (Schrek, that is) discredited, there's no actual ability to say that he was or even (with justifiable reason) claim a dispute. Wikipedia isn't for unqualified disputes (as you showed me on our first encounter, I'm sure you remember). But the point is we can only count sources that were themselves there or of an official interview of Dr.LaVey or someone who officially (and legally) spoke for him saying otherwise. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">AlexanderLevian</a> 01:40, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You may have a point, that this site doesn't specify where it got the information, but rotten tomatoes is certianly not "sympathetic to Satanism" so it led me to wonder where this came from. Perhaps we should further research and find additional sources either way.

<dd>That seems like the best idea. And it would also be wise to see if anyone else in the past looked for information on LaVey making such a claim. I will change the article to include the disposition of rottentomatos and other internet sources. Literature would also be a good source to obtain. the two that I have comes from M. Aquino (who I haven't found anything to (legitimitely) discredit him, but if you find something let me know) and W. Castle (The producer) and I refuse to cited N. Schrek as a source of anything but problems.

<dd>I would have to check on that before I could answer definitively. Incidentally, your recent edits have been mostly quite fine, though I changed the edit "often known as a 'founder of Satanism'" because it is clumsy wording and unclear. A founder? As opposed to which other founders? Besides the fact that a very solid historical argument can be made that he was the first person to use the term "Satanist" as a statement of actual religious affiliation, and of course the fact he certainly founded the first religious body dedicated to Satanism, it simply makes little sense to suggest that he might have been one of many when no other "founders" can be named. If the goal is to suggest that Christians believed there were Satan worshippers (as opposed to Satanists) for centuries before, or that occult movements existed prior to the CoS (Crowley for example, though he strongly disavowed any suggestion that he would be considered a Satanist), then I think maybe this is trying too hard to say an entire mouthful in one phrase. Satanism as it is defined was indeed founded by Anton LaVey, so the present phrasing is entirely accurate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the intended suggestion was that there existed actual Satanic or devil worshipping cults prior to the Church of Satan, the myth of "generational Satanism," then I suggest that this be sourced. LaVey himself researched this exhaustively as he would have liked to have found some evidence of this kind of occult underground, and since then countless occultniks, scholars, and laymen have searched in vain for any solid evidence that such groups ever existed. I'd be delighted if a real source for this is found, but that source should be both accurate (i.e. Catholic Inquisition manuals are...shall we say, unreliable as sources of information on this) and predate 1966 (foundation of the Church of Satan) or else reference sources or evidence predating 1966. Sure, lots of people have claimed those groups existed after the fact, but no proof in either physical evidence or literary reference has ever been unearthed. Until real proof is shown, LaVey will continue to be the sole "founder of Satanism." —<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 12:54, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First I didn't initially write that he was "A founder of Satanism" (a previous editor wrote that in). Second, I agree, as a matter of fact. I (personally) find The founder of satanism proper for the sources we have. All of the older so called "satanic organizations", that i've researched, were almost never devoted to Satan. for examples, Crowley prefered Horus, Hellfire Club prefered Venus and Bacchus, and The so-called "Devil Worshipping Yezidi" prefer Malak Ta’us (whom is considered, by some Judeo-Christian persons, to be the equivilant of Satan but I can't find actual proof). Therefore, no connection to Satanism is found. The article shall not be edited (atleast by me or with my knowledge) without proper sources cited.

<dd>It seems as though the Rosemary's Baby rumor started with misconceptions about LaVey's claiming to be a strong influence on both the Novel and Movie (valid enough). This seems to have been exagerated by third parties. Therefore, until someone can find this claim that Anton Lavey made, this should be considered the current stand point. It's just like Zeena and other Anti-Lavayen Satanist to say that he claimed to be an actor/T.A., and then present the facts supporting that he wasn't, but never cites the source of Dr.Lavey ever claiming it in the first place. This is just a slightly more complex lie that Zeena has piled on top of other (more straight foward) lies. My only question... Is the rumor of such significances that it needs to be mentioned in the Anton Lavey article? I, of course, mean by Wikipedia standards (not our opinion) with policy statements to show the same. Until then I believe we are to refrain from deleting the article due to the relevancy and according to Wikipedia's policy on vandalism. by the way <a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn</a> &amp; <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">Alexander</a> good job changing the so called "criticism" section into a list of trivial facts about LaVey (definitly more positive and organized that way).150.208.140.13 17:36, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would say we do.

The article already explains WHY and gives a source so I think it would be safe to put "Dr" in front of his name.

<p>I've been reading over this biography, amongst the ones of his ex-wife, and supposed seconds wife, and his two daughters. There are a few things I noticed, not all of those 'facts' added up. Date of death seems to shift quite a bit, and the cause of death seems various, also that in one of the articles it says that Diane and Anton had never been married, and suddenly they were man and wife for two decades.</p>
<p>I hope you don't take this as a criticism, it's not that at all. In fact I've always been a fan if you will, of Antons work, read his books as a teenager, and was quite interested in the way he percieved the world around him. And now, a few years later I stumble across these articles and I'd like to know more. Does anyone know anything more detailed than "supposed this and that", on the matters that I mentioned above?</p>

The reasons I don't think these are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> is below. It would be best to find a primary source that can prove or disprove that he was in the film...or if this isn't possible to state the uncertainty. Good primary sources outweigh a large number of contradictory yet unreliable sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary source (the gold standard for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>)</li>

<p>Film insider denies LaVey's involvement: Gene Gutowski; William Castle, Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America, New York: Pharos Books, 1992; Diane LaVey, Michael A. Aquino (COS, page #17).</p>

<li>However, The following sources have either the credential or primary sources to make such a claim, but they deny his involvement:

<li>Gene Gutowski; William Castle, Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America, New York: Pharos Books, 1992 (William Castle was the producer of the film)</li>
<li>Michael A. Aquino (COS, page #17) <a href="http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/COS.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/COS.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (Michael A. Aquino was a member of the Church of Satan and therefore has an undisputed (to my knowledge) connection to LaVey)</li>
</ul>

<li>The following have only those mentioned above as sources:

<p>I realize that we could pile on many websites that back up his involvement, but none of these mention any sources at all! We do however have info from primary sources claiming he was not. In fairness to Wikipedia policy and NPOV, we must leave the information as is (maybe mentioning that there is a rumor, but nothing more) Thank You. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderLevian_ba8b.html" title="User:AlexanderLevian">AlexanderLevian</a> 17:47, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess I wasn't clear. I agree that the cites don't support the claim. I'm adding them because I think this is a fair characterization of the cites I see linked to the claim (e.g. see the 'filmography' claim that I just removed). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 03:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
