<p>the pictured ant has a stinger on it's posterior, to the best of my knowledge this is not right. they bite then squirt acid at the scratch i think, it's not really a proper stinger like that of a wasp or bee.

</dl>
<p>He is completely correct. It is a picture, not like he added a stinger on its "posterior"! Duh dude.</p>

<dd>Many ants have completely functional stingers, it is not "vestigial" at all.

<p>If a man could run as fast for his size as an ant can, he could run as fast as a racehorse. Ants can lift 20 times their own body weight. An ant brain has about 250,000 brain cells and a human brain has 10,000 million so a colony of 40,000 ants has collectively the same size brain as a human. Interesting because humans are about 7.5 billion times as large as ants, yet are brains are only 40 thousand times as big.</p>

<p>Stuff like "an ant can lift many times its own body weight" or "if a man could run as fast for his size as an ant can, he could run as fast as a racehorse" is in some senses a hoax. All this can easily be explained by using the laws of physics, and an ant the size of a dog would be so weak it would have problems just to walk (but it would die from the lack of oxygen long before that point). 217.68.114.116 12:12, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One of my updates, that the combined mass of all ants on earth is greater than the combined mass of all humans on earth, was deleted as "nonsense" and "vandalism" by fisherqueen. However, this is a sure fact, I just don't have the citations for it. Does anyone have a reference? -wazawak</p>

I'm not a biologist, but it appears that the ant-eating caterpillars are in a predatory relationship with the ants, not a symbiotic one. Is there an appropriate technical title for this section? <a href="../../../c/z/y/User%7ECzyl_1e5c.html" title="User:Czyl">Czyl</a></p>
<p>Im not a biologist eather, but i beleave it would depend on the region. ( Now im speculating ) such as a city witch might have smaller ants and smaller, fewer caterpillars might be a symbotic. whare as in a suburb whare everything is placed togather the ants might be more preditory.

<dd>I assume it would be because the high calcium content of the chalk absorbs the ants' communication pheromones, thereby making a chalk-line an "void space" in the pheromone trail that ants leave when foraging. capnmidnight 11:49, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As we know, the ants evolved from some wasp ancestor. But what kind of wasp? What we know about ants; their colonies were probably primary made by burrow in the soil, they evolved from a predatory species that did not built comb cells and they evolved from a solitary wasp. Just a theory; a parasitic wasp with a sting to paralyze its victims (like many ants are still doing) made burrows in the ground where the paralyzed victim was dragged into, and laid egg there. To make sure the offspring had something to feed on. In the end, this ancestor used a single burrow only (instead of making a new each time), where all the prey was brought to her and her eggs/larvae. Because she lived in the same hole as her offspring, overlapping generations was a result. After she had mated and made her burrow, she eventually lost her wings. The reason for this was probably because she had specialized on capturing ground living prey. And because she lived under and often on the ground herself, she sacrified her wings to become a more effective hunter in the nivhe she was living, hunting on other small arthropods near her burrow. To do this, she used her eyes, since that's how flying wasps often find their prey, and like bulldog ants still do (and where there is very little difference between the workers and the queen). As more advanced species evolved and they became truly social, many started to use chemical senses instead and the mother stopped hunting and took the role as an egg layer only, while her offspring took care of the food collection. And since then, they are continued to explore the ground, the trees and other niches.</p>

<p>In the article it says that ants follow pathways of strong scents and that they teach each other new routes by following..</p>
<p>I've observed an ant nest, and I've noticed that when a new, strong and strange scent is dropped in the middle of a main pathway on a rock, there will appear in 5 mins a nest maintainter or two with a speficic task to clean up obstacles in the vicinity of my object. The object cause every passing ant to stop and it disrupted the traffic. The maintainers will drag small stones 5 cm away from the pathway until they have found my object. The object was sticky and hard to move (slime), and after the first maintainer failed to move it, though I didn't watch the whole time, the object had been turned so that it no longer blocked the pathway. How can the ants form spesific sub-tasks under the general division of castes? How can they put the info forward about a location of an obstacle? How can they communicate the nature of tasks? <a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeemu_Ruskeep%C3%A4%C3%A4_d03d.html" title="User:Teemu RuskeepÃ¤Ã¤">Teemu RuskeepÃ¤Ã¤</a> 16:59, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I removed it because the information on tending of aphids is already mentioned. <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestication.html" title="Domestication">Domestication</a> generally involves selective breeding and control of reproduction. Aphids live and breed quite independently and can fly around. The scientific term for a win-win situation is mutualism/commensalism or symbiosis.

<p>These things are small black colored ants that invade the house. They're about the size of the letter "l" presented here. Had them once. Raid works well on them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 00:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The graphic says 'Polymesia.' There's no such thing as Polymesia. Polymesia does not exist. There is no wiki article on it. There is no article on it anywhere. Polymesia is a fiction; get over it. GET OVER IT, IT'S POLYNESIA!!!</p>

<dd>Yes, I also think it should be 'Polynesia'.

<p>I only have a highschool education, but Iâm pretty sure thereâs no such thing as "cookie crisp ants" or "fatass ants". (70.181.188.194 08:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Really nice to see critical reading. The fatass ant appears to be true though, citation added. Not sure about the other but the fact remains that ants are eaten. :) <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 03:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
