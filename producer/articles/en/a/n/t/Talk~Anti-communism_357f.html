<p>That list needs some clarification. Suharto is called a dictator, which he is of course, but then Fulgencia Batista is simply called a "president" (of Cuba). I decided to call all dictators by what they are. <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Star_8693.html" title="Red Star">Red Star</a></p>

<p>I feel this strongly biased! There was a comparision between Nazism and Communism. That is not correct at all. So I am removing it.</p>
<p>Tell me if i'm wrong, but this article is to describe what anti-communism is, not to spread anti-communism bull****. Please, respect other people's principles. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Oliveira_631a.html" title="User:Luis Oliveira">Luis Oliveira</a></p>

<dd>Sure, the Nazis murdered 11 million in the holocaust, but the Communists in their holocausts: The Ukrainian famine, Russian Civil War, Stalin's Purges, The Great Leap Forward, Hundred Flowers Program, The Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot, etc., murdered close to 100 million people. Not bad for a</dd>

<p>I agree. We should be explaining what anti-communism is, not endorsing it. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>
<hr />
<p>And it's getting much more balanced, congrats to the wikipedia! --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Oliveira_631a.html" title="User:Luis Oliveira">Luis Oliveira</a></p>
<hr />
<p>There is no bias in <b>reporting</b> that anti-communists oppose communism or that they feel it is similar to fascism. The article does not <b>state</b> that communism is fascist; rather, that <b>in the opinion of anti-communists</b> there is a similarity.</p>
<p>Although it is "obvious" to me that Communism is the worst evil the world has known, I realize that many if not most people do not share this view. Nonetheless, anti-communism does exist and should be examined by the Wikipedia. Mistakes in anti-communism or critiques of anti-communism should also be included. -- <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry then. Perhaps it is because english is not my first language but the way you said it initially didn't look like a report... -- <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Oliveira_631a.html" title="User:Luis Oliveira">Luis Oliveira</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Ed, Communists usually linked everything they don't like to fascism too. Should that be mentioned in every article? <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">szopen</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, not <b>every</b> article. But if there are historical instances of Communist exponents, parties, or governments labeling as "fascist" things they merely dislike, perhaps one or two examples may be provided. Sort of as an example of Communist propaganda. But let us carefully distinguish between accurate (if hypocritical) Communist criticism of Hitler and Mussolini's fascism and the use of the label "fascist" merely as a slur.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the term "fascist" was indeed used by Communists to mean "any system or person they dislike" we ought to note this. Nonetheless, anti-communists have pointed out similarities between communism and fascism: state socialism, ruthless suppression of opposition, concentration camps . . .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, if these comparisons are exaggerated or contrived, surely supporters of Communism (or critics of anti-communism) have objected to these comparisons and given reasons for their objections. <b>These objections should be included in the article.</b> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>The better issue must be indicating the huge differences between Communism and Stalinism. As it is Stalinism that was the government system in Russia for 70 or so years not Communism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you mean between ideal communism or ideal Communistic practice and Stalinism -- as it was, Stalinism was Stalin's version of Communism. A major part of anti-communism is its criticism of Communism as practiced by Stalin, Mao and so on. Those leaders (dictators?) showed any signs of ever relinquishing power, which would seem to retard the predicted "withering away" of the socialist state into (true) communisim.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Correction: Stalinism was Stalin's version of <i>Socialism</i>, not Communism. And the socialist state is not supposed to be a dictatorship that withers away when the dictator decides to relinquish power. The socialist state is supposed to be democratic in the first place, and it is supposed to "wither away" as representative democracy slowly turns into direct democracy.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have removed the following, until they can be reworked:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Communism's theoretical basis is <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectical_materialism.html" title="Dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a>, which is predicated on the assumption that there is no God and that spirit is generated by matter. For religious believers, communism's atheism is anathema.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other central part of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s communist theory is <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>, which states that human society is evolving, and that the next step after <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> is <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, and in the end <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>. Anti-communists reject the entire concept of historical materialism, or at least do not belive that socialism and communism must follow after capitalism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is why I removed them: they were under the section "theoretical criticisms" yet they are neither criticisms nor are they theoretical. The sum effect of these two points is to say that "Some people disagree with claim a, others disagree with claim b." But disagreement is not the same thing as critique -- I mean, simply to say "I do not agree with you" is not very meaningful. Why do you disagree with me? Why do you think I am wrong?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there were some "theoretical criticisms" that tried to do this (like, poor people do get richer). I happen to disagree with that criticism because I think it misrepresents communist analysis, but at least it is recognizable as a theoretical critique.</p>
<p>I would have no objection to these points being returned to the article, if they were posed not merely as saying "here are things communists claim that some people do not accept" but rather as truly theorized critiques. I would expect an argument that explains and accounts for the logical and empirical problems with the communist claims, and that present real logical or empirical arguments for the counter claims. SR</p>
<hr />
<p>I would add that these definitions of dialectical materialism and historical materialism are simply inaccurate. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoisture_90d9.html" title="User:Moisture">DH</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The two paragraphs are rather "critisisms of communist theory" than "theoretical critisms of communism". (Heh, _almost_ beyond my level of English comprehension here.) The point is, if you disagree with one of these foundations for communism, the whole communist theory falls apart (for you). There should be a place for these paragraphs in the article, with some careful rewording. --<a href="../../../g/u/p/User%7EGuppie_bc0a.html" title="User:Guppie">Guppie</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The details of meaty philosophical objections to communism should go in an appropriately-named article--not in an article titled "anti-communism"--<i>unless</i> we plan to have them in both places. Certainly we shouldn't plan to present the many critiques of communism under this title, because many of them are not part and parcel of the <i>attitude</i> and <i>historical movement,</i> "anti-communism," but are very important critiques nonetheless. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry_Sanger</a>, stating the obvious as usual&#160;:-(</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>Such levels of repression are of course not unique to communist regimes, and western powers have their own record of denial of political or labour rights, racism, colonial oppression and violence, support for governments which presided over mass killings, torture and detention of political opponents, or engagement with regimes (usually on the basis of their shared anti-communism) which practised genocide or racial segregation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's bullshit. Such level of represion IS unique to communist regimes. No other regime made such a horrible democides in own countries as Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, North Corea and other communist countries. Even Nazis, which are often said to be "as bad" as Communists did little killing of own citizens. That was at least an order of magnitude of difference. --<a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">User:Taw</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, thank you for reminding me about Cambodia, where the west backed the <i>Khmer Rouge</i> after they'd been booted out by the Vietnamese. I'm glad to hear you find the Nazis so preferable. These little clarifications do so jolly things along. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Parker_bf5d.html" title="User:David Parker">User:David Parker</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you accept the premise that the Jews in Germany were not entitled to German citizenship, Taw may be technicaly correct. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></p>
<p>I think that I exorcised the "bullshit" from the paragraph. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<p>If you classify democides according to the percentage of deaths out of the total population (as opposed to the raw body counts), then you will be surprised to see that only 2 communist regimes score in the top 25. Namely those of Stalin and Pol Pot (see this article and scroll down to the second statistic: <a href="http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm" class="external free" title="http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm</a>). Furthermore, I could point out that the only people who accepted Pol Pot's regime as "communist" were his followers (keep in mind that he was overthrown by the Vietnamese Communists), so his crimes cannot be reasonably attributed to Communism. In the end, we are left with Stalin as the only communist in the top 25. But if we accept Trotskyist objections to Stalinism, then Stalin also flies out the window... In conclusion, be more careful when you blame various crimes on various ideas, principles or ideologies. Unless the person who commited the crimes was also the person who created the ideology (as in the case of Hitler and his Mein Kampf), it is unjust to blame the actions of one madman on a group consisting of millions of people (especially when many of those people actually opposed him). -- Mihnea Tudoreanu</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of this material belongs into <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>, under a heading 'criticsm and objections' (or into a new article "criticism of communism"). If I go to an encyclopedia article about anti-communism, I expect to find McCarthyism, Reagan's political philososphy, the domino theory leading to the Vietnam war, Western support of the Contras in Nicaragua and Savimbi in Angola etc. etc.</p>
<p>"Anti-communism", in common usage, is not a philosophical criticsm of communism. It denotes a special set of policies of the Western countries in the second half of the 20th century directed against socialist countries and the spread of communism in general. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I agree. Anti-communists will often go to great lengths to prove that understanding communism is not a pre-requisite to being anti-communist. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></li>
<li>Me, too. Otherwise, there will be too much duplication. My favorite anti-communist textbook, "Communism: Critque and Counterproposal" by Sung Han Lee, devotes nearly half its space to <b>explaining</b> Marxist-Leninist theory. Once a person has a clear understanding of a typical communist point, it's generally pretty easy for them to see what's wrong with it. But criticizing what one does not understand leads nowhere. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed Poor</a></li>
<li>This is absolutely correct. This article could really use a total reworking to make it an article about anticommunism and that only, with everything else moved to more appropriate articles or deleted (I think there's a significant amount of garbage in the article). DH</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>So, what did Moon say in November 1987, when it became clear that Soviet communism had lasted more than 70 years? (You're giving him credit for a prediction, while glossing over the specifics he got wrong). <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a></p>

<li>Does it help the cause of anti-communists to be associated with the Moonies? <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that in 1985, 2 years before the precise "deadline" you seem to have poisited, he told <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morton_Kaplan_a1c1.html" title="Morton Kaplan">Morton Kaplan</a> to declare the End of Communism (which he reluctantly did). And I think that during the three or four year period from Nov 1987 to Dec 1990 (or Dec 1991) Soviet Communism pretty much disintegrated, right on schedule. I myself was a staff member of a workshop teaching Unificationist religious ideas in the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Lithuania in June 1992. Give me a break, his prediction was pretty close! <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a> 11:32 Jul 24, 2002 (PDT)</p>
<hr />
<p>"Many anti-communists also regard the lack of property rights and economic freedom under communism as taking away fundamental human rights": calling it "economic freedom" as if it were a given that everyone would accept that "economic freedom" is part of the capitalist system is hardly NPOV. This should be worked somehow to say that the anti-communists <i>believe</i> that capitalism gives "economic freedom" and one of the reasons the anti-communists oppose communism is that communism represses this economic freedom. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a></p>

<p>" Another one is <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Lem_1bd3.html" title="Stanislaw Lem">Stanislaw Lem</a>, who, being once very bored, took book with statistics about Soviet Union, some course about Basic Economy, put correct numbers into few equation and decided that <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> would fall some in late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>."</p>

<p>i was researching for an essay and strolled upon this site and i have something to say: all u poor commies out there...GIVE IT UP!!!!!! any commy country that has ever succeeded has done so by scaring its population out of ever disagreeing with the state. the only commy gov'ts alive today are that of brutal dictatorships. does a person living in a commy country enjoy amounting to nothing??? if communism is so good then how come the whole world isnt communist?? oh thats right, because communism is load of sh*t. hell, im from canada and my gov't is too far left for my liking. so as far as this anti-commy stuff goes, i would really like to see it spread and tell the whole world just how bad of an idea it is. now, i should get back to my essay. the topic?? "should gov'ts today play a greater role in the operation of their economies?" my answer?? HELLS NO!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you also believe that the peoples of Europe should have "given up" on the ideals of Democracy after Napoleon perverted the principles of the French Revolution? If not, then why do you believe that the peoples of the world should give up on the ideals of Communism after Stalin perverted the principles of the Russian Revolution? Communism is only an extension of Democracy (or, as Marx would say, "Communism is the logical conclusion of Democracy").</dd>
<dd>And the system used in the countries you're talking about is not Communism - no communist leader ever claimed to have actually <b>reached</b> Communism. They claim to be <b>on the way</b> towards Communism, and they claim that their current system is Socialism. But then again, they also claim that their countries are wonderful democratic paradises. So if you believe that the Soviet Union (for example) was truly "communist" or "socialist", then you'd better also believe that the People's Democratic Republic of Korea is "democratic".</dd>
<dd>-- Mihnea Tudoreanu</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Communism is only an extension of Democracy"? I guess that's why pretty much every Communist revolution has resulted in the complete opposite of a democracy. Just bad luck. Wrong guys in charge. Stalinist, not Communist. Nothin' to do with it. Nada. They all misread Marx. Mmmhmm.</p>
<p>I have noted a double standard in regards to criticism of communism and criticism of religion. When someone says "Christians in the Crusades murdered <i>x</i> number of people", the anticommunist rushes to defend Christianity, saying "but they weren't true Christians!

<p>It is true that certain interpretations of religion can lead one to believe that doing fanatical things is OK in the eyes of their god. However, (generally) for Christianity this no longer happens, and most agree that Jesus' messages do not call for bloody conversion.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Communist countries, which have always been dictatorships. In addition, people may conclude that while Marx may have had noble intentions, they are impossible to realistically achieve. So while all the historical Communist states may not have been "truly" communist, there's debate about whether it's even possible to have a classless, peaceful communist democracy (I'm not even sure if Marx wanted a democracy -- he talks about the government eventually losing all form, and I don't really get what he means,) and whether the results of various Communist revolutions are just logical, human outcomes.</p>
<p>It's proven that Christianity doesn't necessarily lead to war and conflict, but so far we haven't seen the wonderful communist society Marx predicted. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">Trey Stone</a> 05:32, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the sentence:</p>
<p><i>[C]ommunist governments have been accused of creating a new ruling class (called by Russians the nomenklatura) with privileges parallel to those in the overthrown "capitalist" societies.</i></p>
<p>I changed "privileges parallel to those in the overthrown 'capitalist' societies" to "powers and privileges far greater than those previously enjoyed by the upper classess in the pre-revolutionary regimes.". I am aware that some might find this claim <i>per se</i> disputable, however it is not stated as a fact, but as a statement of one side in the dispute (to which most, if not all anti-communists will certainly subscribe).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the following very controversial statment was listed as an undisputed fact:</p>
<p><i>Also, they often point to cases such as Cuba, whose economic performance is actually better than that of similar neighboring countries (Cuba is ahead of most of its Latin American neighbors, but far behind the United States.)</i></p>
<p>This might have been true in the Cold War years, thanks to the rich Soviet subsidies, but it is definitely not true today (not undisputedly true, at any case). I've changed this statement to a more neutral form and somewhat expanded the anti-communist argument in this case.</p>
<p>Other changes I made are adding some further anti-communist arguments. While some of them are controversial, I was careful to present them only as beliefs held by anti-communists, not as undisputed truth.</p>
<p>I also moved the sentence about the alternative meaning of the term "anti-communism" to the first paragraph in the page. There is not much point in placing such a piece of information after an in-depth article about the primary meaning.</p>

<p>It's quite ashtonish to notice that there is nothing in this page about one of the worst anticommunist repression: 1.000.000 people killed (alleged communists) by Suharto in Indonesia. This is a fact that no serious historician denies. A page about anticommunism is not NPOV without this. I think that it should be stressed more strongly the difference between critics at communists regimes in the name of liberalism, democracy or anarchism and the oppurtunistic usage of anticommunism for power struggles between the West and the East (or, for example in my country, Italy, for internal power struggles) or, worst of all, for the repression of political enemies. There is a huge difference between, for example, George Orwell crititics of the Soviet Union and senator Macarthy. I even think that some critics of the SU wouldn't like to be called anticommunists, because this world often implies a cold-war approach or an hobstility against socialism in general! Furthermore, I would like to remember that talking of <i>communism</i> in general is not very productive, as it's not productive to consider Marx ideas necessarly related to communism (in fact, most of the socialist parties of europe where in the first period marxist, reformists included). Communism in democratic countries often does not opposes democracy (see <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurocommunism.html" title="Eurocommunism">eurocommunism</a>). Russia and China where of course countries in which communists have perpetrated large crimes, but do not forget that both of them have never been democratic countries before (and don't tell me that Putin now is a democrat!), they have a long tradiction of authoritarism. I see absurd to compare communism to nazism, the second was a particular european regime which lasted for a period relatively short, communism is a large and complex phaenoman. juliet.p from Italy</p>

<p>I propose the following introduction with section headings:</p>
<p>Opposition to communism arises from a number of sources. As a system which proposes to overthrow the social and political order by means of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, communism is opposed by those who are in power, both in <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> and other vulnerable political and economic systems, as well as those who simply enjoy the benefits of the existing system such as religious believers. After a successful communist revolution such as the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a> which resulted in the establishment of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> a new breed of opposition arose, those who are dispossessed of their property, power and privilege, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">reactionaries</a>. This came to include opposition political parties, religious believers and supporters of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> as those elements were suppressed by the new state. Later, as the situation developed and independent farmers, hostile ethnic groups, writers and artists and other elements were suppressed, opposition widened. As information spread regarding conditions within the Soviet Union opposition grew among elements analogous to those suppressed within the Soviet Union. This was exacerbated by political organizing carried on by communist parties allied with the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comintern.html" title="Comintern">Comintern</a> which impacted <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist political parties</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_unions.html" title="Labor unions">labor unions</a>. Following the Soviet victory in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the occupation of Eastern Europe anti-communism became, under <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman.html" title="Truman">Truman</a>, the policy of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. During the second half of the Twentieth Century within the Soviet bloc, especially in Eastern Europe and among ethnic groups other then Russian within the Soviet Union opposition grew strong and culminated in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This opposition continues to be strong both in Eastern Europe, former parts of the Soviet Union and in Russia itself.</p>
<p>==Opposition by capitalists== ==Opposition by feudal and other backward elements== ==Opposition by reactionaries and other displaced elements== ==External opposition== ==Cold war opposition== ==Democratic and intellectual opposition== ==Post-Soviet opposition==</p>

<dd>(4) You assume that the only opponents of communism are the "class enemies", people who fear for the unjust privileges that they (supposedly) enjoy under the capitalist system. You completely ignore the intellectual opposition to communism, from the classical liberals and anarchists of Marx's own day, who already at that time clearly saw the totalitarian nature of his ideas, to the neoclassical and Austrian economists, who later demolished Marxist economics, to the countless anti-communist intelectuals of the 20th century.</dd>

Also, look at the Carter Administration's foreign policy, which saw the fall of several anticommunists (Smith, Somoza, the Shah). Can you really claim Brzezinski was an anticommunist?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You read "Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of Communism in the Twentieth Century", "Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy", "The Permanent Purge: Politics in Soviet Totalitarianism", and "Game Plan: A Geostrategic Framework for the Conduct of the U.S.-Soviet Contest." The man was one of the foremost Cold-War hawks. He certainly did advocate aid to Eastern European countries, not to help the Soviets, but to wean the populations away from the Soviets--we consolidated Western Europe with Marshall Plan aid, and we might have done the same with Eastern Europe. Just because you don't understand his reasoning, or may disagree with his reasoning, does not make him pro-communism. Carter lost Iran, Brzezinski didn't. Read "Power and Principle"--Brzezinski was willing to send the U.S. army to back the Shah, Carter countermanded his own order to deploy U.S. troops to Iran. —thames 19:20, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For this last reason the word is sometimes used with a negative meaning to define an opposition to communism schematic and excessive, which doesn't take in consideration the differences between various communist regimes and movements and it is instrumentally used as a political weapon in the clash between West and East. This bias against anticommunism is even due to the opportunistic use of anticommunism made by some authoritarian regimes to persecute dissidents of any political colour.</p>

<p>What I've done is to eliminate the declaration that "a large segment of American society has seen wages decline in real terms" since 1980. I don't think the facts bear that out: certainly no <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h01h.html" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h01h.html" rel="nofollow">income quintile</a> has seen any period of steady decline since then. The need to make such an edit highlights this article's fundamental problem: that it is essentially a nebulous debate on the merit of the Communist system. It seems laughably disorganized to saturate the "Objections to Communist Theory" section with phrases like "Communists reply" and "Communists also argue," when whole sections are devoted to the Communist response later on.<br />
In the end, a defense (or even criticism) of Communism hardly seems appropriate to this article at all. I agree with AxelBoldt's assertion that an article on anti-Communism should have largely historical content: the Whites of Russia and counterrevolutionaries in other Communist countries; the Red Scare; McCarthy, Nixon and HUAC, and Whittaker Chambers; Lech Walesa and Ronald Reagan; and Communism's struggle with Fascism and anarchism. If the article were thus rearranged, the list of notable anti-Communists might be integrated rather than slapped on as an afterthought. Anti-Communist philosophy could then be presented as it existed in the minds of its great exponents - eliminating the need for an uncertain debate between Communists and anti-Communists on the Wikipedia staff.<br />
I'd be happy to work on any reorganization. But since I'm a relatively new and infrequent editor, it seems appropriate to wait for the community's opinion. Let me know what you guys think.<br />

<p>The article seems to take the point of view that anti-communism is simply opposition to communism. While linguistically that makes sense, I think that's not how the term has historically been used in the United States, where almost everyone is opposed to communism, but many would be hesitant to describe themselves as anti-communist, given the association of that term with the McCarthy era.

<p>Whilst George Orwell did criticise the Stalinist dictatorship of the USSR I would not say that he was an anti-communist. If you read his anti-Stalinist book, "Animal Farm," you'll find that in many ways he romanticises the characters that are meant to represent Lenin, Trotsky and the Russian communist people. My personal interpretation of George Orwell's views are that he was opposed to Stalinism and not Communism. For me his criticism of the way Communism was supposedly 'put into action' by those such as Stalin is not an opposition to Communism itself. Leon Trotsky too was vehemently anti-Stalinist, is he too Anti-Communist?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, he's not an anti-communist. I've removed it. Orwell was very much a Communist who opposed Totalitarianism. I think someone just got the wrong impression from his books. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinst_dd2f.html" title="User:Kinst">Kinst</a> 21:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe anticommunism should not be hyphenated. A hyphen is appropriate after the prefix anti- in two occasions, neither of them present here: before a word that begins with the letter "i" (e.g., anti-influenza) and before a proper noun (e.g., anti-Soviet).</p>
<p>This is a grammatical point that has some substance as well. Without the hyphen, the term "anticommunism" has the connotation of an ideology or movement with an identity that has a coherence and internal logic that goes beyond mere opposition to communism. That is an accurate connotation. One aspect of this, for instance, is that the ideology of anticommunism includes support for capitalism. If anticommunism were defined exclusively by opposition to communism, it would be equally appropriate to use the term to refer to socialist opponents of communism and capitalist opponents of communism. That seems pretty clearly not to be the case.</p>
<p>So I propose retitling the article "Anticommunism" and replacing all instances of "anti-communism" with "anticommunism."</p>

<p>The 228 Massacre in Taiwan, is given as an example of an "anti-Communist massacre" though the wikipedia article about it shows that it had nothing to do with Communism per se.

<p>Why is the Anti-Comintern pact (between Italy, Germany, and Japan) mentioned only once? Hitler and Mussolini are mentioned as being anti-communists, but where are their Japanese counterparts? Japan was extremely anti-communist, and most of South Korea's anti-communist government was made up of those who collaborated with Japan during WWII, who were educated in Japan (the first president of Korea, for example), and who were Korean officers in the Japanese army. Japanese anti-communism can also go far to explain Taiwan anti-communism, Taiwan being a Japanese colony from 1895 until the end of WWII. Tojo was just as anti-communist as Hitler and Mussolini, and can be seen as one of their Japanese counterparts. Yet he is not mentioned once here.</p>

<p>The main problem I feel with this article is that it doesn't distinguish between ideological communism spelt with a small c (as it is an adjective) and party Communism spelt with a large C (as it is a pronoun of the various Communist parties.)

I think its important to show differences by those who opposed the Soviet Union, or now oppose PRC or North Korea. This does not make them anti communists. The same applies for George Orwell and to some degree Albert Camus amoung others mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Yes. Trotsky was an anti-Communist, but definately not and anticommunist.</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, I'm finding it hard to follow the reasoning here. Trotsky was neither 'anti-Communist' nor 'anti-communist.' If he was anything he was anti-Stalinist, but remained a committed Communist (and communist) until his death, founding his own International. George Orwell, in contrast, was both anti-Communist and anti-communist ( I hope people can follow this!), defining himself as a 'democratic socialist', something quite different from Communism or communism.

<p>This section is written from a perspective that would be described as left-wing "anarchism." Ignoring the dispute about their self-appellation of the anarchist label, it is most certainly not the case that anarchists "anarchists traditionally agree with Communists that capitalism is a tool for oppression, that it is unjust and that it should be destroyed, one way or another." That would be categorically rejected by anarchists that support free society and freedom of the individual. "Anarchists initially rejoiced over the 1917 revolution as an example of workers taking power for themselves, and indeed played a part in the revolution" is uncited and suspect. "Anarchists often cite the crushing of the Kronstadt Rebellion, in which the Red Army defeated an embryonic anarchist commune" would be indicative of anarcho-communism, not anarchism as a whole. This section is written as sympathetic to the idea of an "anarchist," collectivist, non-individualist concept of society. It is most certainly not representative of anarchism as a whole, only one small segment of the schools of thought that declare themselves to be "anarchist." - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 05:58, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was an anarchist movement in Russia in 1917, which is well-documented (e.g. texts by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Avrich_0e30.html" title="Paul Avrich">Paul Avrich</a> or <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voline.html" title="Voline">Voline</a>. This movement was dominated by anarchist communists, syndicalists and what would later be known as the Platformist tradition. It is well documented that these anarchists played an active part in the 1917 revolution and were anti-capitalist. This anarchist movement was suppressed by the Bolsheviks, most significantly in the defeat of the Kronstadt Rebellion. Other currents of anarchism in that historical period were the "small segments". I personally don't think this article needs to give much more in the way of bibliographical citations, as the more specialist articles <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt_rebellion.html" title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestor_Makhno_b249.html" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor Makhno</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_anarchism.html" title="Russian anarchism">Russian anarchism</a> give lots of references. Anyway, I've added a couple of links where it said citation needed. I don't think the section should be flagged as totally disputed.</dd>
<dd>However, is it right to call <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Serge_8b0c.html" title="Victor Serge">Victor Serge</a> an anarchist? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 09:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to see some criticism from individualist anarchism, and not solely taken from collectivist "anarchist" movements. Um, I don't know much about Victor Serge, but if Wikipedia is accurate on his article (did you hear about the Essjay scandal on /.?), I'd say he wasn't an anarchist. - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 19:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
