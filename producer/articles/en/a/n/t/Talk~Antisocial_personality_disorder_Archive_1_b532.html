<h2><span class="mw-headline">This page is completely wrong!</span></h2>
<p>Psychopathy is not "antisocial personality disorder." Psychopathy needs its own separate page, since it is a well defined and objectively measured condition (likely the only such phenomenon in all of psychology, see books by Dr. Robert Hare, and his PCL-R posted by someone below). This is URGENT because normal people are being punished as 'psychopaths 'or 'sociopaths' after an APD 'diagnosis' while dangerous true psychopaths are free to cause mayhem. Please correct it all who can, since it is truly urgent.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you suggesting that the definition of APB on this page does not reflect the accepted definition, or that the accepted definition is wrong? If the latter, this isn't the place to try to change psychiatric practice. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_NoNick_36fa.html" title="User:Geoff NoNick">Geoff NoNick</a> 15:06, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, I suggest neither option: the page is wrong because it claims over and over again that the definitions of APD and psychopathy are equivalent, which they most definitely are not. Even worse, the APD page claims that APD is measured by (Dr. Robert Hare's) PCL-R. Worst of all, disastrously so, the page asserts this equivalence with such force that users looking for the article on psychopathy get redirected to the APD article. Since psychopathy is a clear-cut construct with enormous life-saving potential and supported through many different lines of evidence (neurological, physiological, behavioral, psychometric, etc), the APD page as it stands is a tremendous error and disservice. Thus, psychopathy needs its own page. 10:45, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have restored the Psychopathy page to the last version, in the hope that all those commenting here on it's merging will have plenty to add to the article, and plenty to say in discussion? --82.195.137.125 17:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is also my feeling that all commentary specific to Psychopathy should be removed from this page and placed there, with cross references on both where relevant but I would rather seek a concensus before doing anything so drastic. However, may I point out that the entry for <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infectious_Disease_6aac.html" title="Infectious Disease">Infectious Disease</a> does not contain all the information on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">Malaria</a>, nor does the entry for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">Malaria</a> redirect there. I respectfully suggest that this is a similar case. --82.195.137.125 18:05, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>The decision was made long ago to merge the article on psychopathy with the article on antisocial personality disorder. Wikipedia seems to prefer to use DSM-IV-TR terminology for the psychiatric disorders, and antisocial personality disorder is the DSM's conception of psychopathy although you are correct in that it does not completely capture all the traits of a psychopathic personality as described in the tradition of Hervey Cleckley, Robert Hare, and others. The American Psychiatric Association broke from the theoretical tradition on psychopathy beginning with its DSM-III version of antisocial personality disorder, which was a long list of specific behaviors much like the DSM-IV-TR's conduct disorder. The DSM-IV simplified the criteria into somewhat more general traits, but it tends to approximate the impulsive antisociality of Factor 2 (in the two factor model) better than the sleak and deceptive narcissism of Factor 1. Antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy are not precisely equivalent, but the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder <b>is</b> an operationalization of the theoretical construct of psychopathy, of which the PCL-R is another.</p>
<p>Psychopathy, as measured by the PCL and PCL-R, tends to be better researched than the DSM's version simply because the experts on psychopathy prefer the fuller and more accurate definition of the disorder that the PCL-R gives them than the DSM's APD.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it would seem to have just been merged and re-directed by a private individual, not unlike myself, who has just undone that, thus far the sky has shown no signs of falling in. This seems to be a big part of what Wikipedia is about. Thus ensuring that while nothing here can ever be wholly accurate, let alone ideal or perfect, nothing ever needs to be inaccurate or misrepresented for long unless we let it be? --82.195.137.125 18:12, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being a psychopath I would have to tell you all to shut the fuck up and understand that a sociopath is different than an aggressive sociopath. not only that, but antisocial personality disorder doesn't exactly mean someone has an aggressive, or psychotic behavior towards others. They could perhaps have austistic attributes because of their failure of socialization with others. The other interesting thing about the book of Psychiatry is that if sociopaths don't plan ahead, how can they mimick people around them? Yes, there is a flaw in that big o' DSMV book.- <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberman_3feb.html" title="User:Cyberman">Cyberman</a></p>

"Gay, Honorable Air Force Pilot Using Electronic Countermeasures". All psychopaths. The pilot uses "swarm" tactics, because he enters into territory that may contain the enemy, then shoots the enemy instinctively while calling in reinforcements, trying to survive. He never has to make much of a plan, "failing" to do so. His use of electronic countermeasures amounts to deceitfulness. He suffers from homosexuality, a mental illness, according to the World Health Organization (pre 1992).</p>
<p>The snipers have made a home for themselves underground, waiting patiently and justifiably months or even years for the target. The climate (both meteorologically and tactically) is extremely hostile. They work in shifts, and in a futile response to the boredom they wear "conventional" drag while not at the periscope, and then at the periscope, they wear preposterous pink, purple, and orange ghille. They cannot act on any plan they might make, so they "fail" to make one. Deceitfully, fake periscope lenses were airdropped all over the countryside.</p>
<p>Failure to conform to social norms or lawful behaviors: Homosexuality, transvestism.</p>
<p>Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure: Electronic countermeasures, underground chamber, airdropping periscope lenses.</p>
<p>Irresponsibility, impulsivity or failure to plan ahead: Never having to make much of a plan, "failing" to do so.</p>
<p>Irritability and “aggression” (meaning violence), as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults: Just war. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others: Just war with courage. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt or stolen from another: Just war.</p>

<dd>Whoa. Does the text above strike anyone else as <i>slightly strange</i>? -- Anon 09:41, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that the above is an argument for the natural evolution of APD as a survival strategy. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaral_b8e9.html" title="User:Taral">Taral</a> 18:19, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Well, first of all, I am Anonymonster; I made the comment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, why is "slightly strange" in quotation marks in Anon's comment? My views do need lots of imagination to listen to, if that’s what you mean. Then there's nothing "slightly" strange about it. If you mean literal, specific logical fallacy, then please say what and where it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And to respond to Taral’s comment, the text should have been clearer. The text was not meant to say that APD is natural nor simply a survival strategy. It was meant to say that the way that the intuitive and literal concepts of “psychopath” relate is so … “hypocritical”, perhaps, that the relation is stretched beyond imagination. Wikipedia is not a soapbox of course. But if the concept is nonsensical beyond the point that it can be said to exist, there should at least be a Diagnostic Issues section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Involuntary commitment with diagnostic issues like these ... now that is strange. Let’s see … maybe “psychopath” is just someone that a psychiatrist wants treated. Or maybe it’s something else. Remember, however far fetched, that propaganda lies never really make sense when used to cover something neither actually justified nor easily falsely justified. FET 05:08, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think Anonymonster makes an interesting point, but I disagree with his/her analysis. The key concept here is the social frame of reference: a diagnosis of APD is fundamentally dependent on social context. If the behaviour of a person with APD is not transgressing social norms, it can hardly be called anti-"social"&#160;!</p>
<p>In combat, behaviours that could lead to a diagnosis of APD in civil society might well be lauded, even after the individual returns from the battlefield. Indeed, warriors who lie, cheat, kill and maim with gusto (assuming they successfully do this to the "enemy") have traditionally been held in high social regard, both during and after the conflict. Meanwhile, contemporaneous civilian murderers have been pursued to the full extent of the law (viz. WWII experience in London).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, higher-functioning individuals with APD can sometimes sublimate their drives in a commercial environment ("the corporate psychopath") to win great esteem and financial reward.</p>
<p>In neither of the above cases would a diagnosis of APD be "wrong", just irrelevant.</p>

<p>Diagnostic criteria (PCL-R test)</p>
<p>In contemporary research and clinical practice, APD is most commonly assessed with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist- Revised (PCL-R), which is a clinical rating scale with 20 items. Each of the items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale according to specific criteria through file information and a semi-structured interview. The items are as follows:</p>
<p>Interpersonal dimension</p>
<pre>
   * Glibness/superficial charm
   * Grandiose sense of self-worth
   * Pathological lying
   * Conning/manipulative
   * Lack of remorse or guilt
   * Shallow affect
   * Callous/lack of empathy
   * Failure to accept responsibility for own actions
</pre>
<p>Affective dimension</p>
<pre>
   * Need for stimulation/-proneness to boredom
   * Parasitic lifestyle
   * Poor behavioral controls
   * Early behavioral problems
   * Lack of realistic, long-term goals
   * Impulsivity
   * Irresponsibility

<dd>Yes, it's correct, but what you consider to be impulsivity (for example) is not necessarily what a diagnostician is going to consider it to be (difference between impulsively buying a box of candy and impulsively buying a Lamborghini/big-screen TV when you need to borrow to do so) (IANADiag.). <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.22.227.53.html" title="User:24.22.227.53">24.22.227.53</a> 04:38, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wouldn't classify Tom Ripley as a psychopath...although he has some traits, he fails on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of remorse or guilt</li>
<li>Shallow affect</li>
<li>Callous/lack of empathy</li>

<p>Just curious why Kane has been removed from the list of fictional psychopaths. In addition to being referred to as a psychopath on WWE Raw by many other characters, including the commentators, he seems to meet most of the PCL-R criteria (in fact, the only one he doesn't exhibit at all is "glibness/superficial charm").

<dd>Kane has fond memories of being happy in a loveful childhood environment, this is incongruent to the usual interpretation of the mentality of the psychopath, who has no understanding of love as it is.

<p>Gaz isn't a sociopath so I removed her. And why do you people keep talking about how intelligent and disciplined sociopaths are, when that isn't the case. They're disorganized and possess a deficient ability to plan or perceive the future. I don't think that many of those names really fit, but I'm not familiar enough with the works they came from so I can't remove them.</p>
<p>One other thing, all the headings that say "Psychopath" should probably be rewritten "Sociopath," and rewritten to fit that definition.</p>

<dd>From the article:</dd>
<dd><i>Psychopaths in popular fiction and movies generally possess a number of standard characteristics <b>which are not necessarily as common amongst real-life psychopaths</b>... <b>an individual with APD is much more likely to be impulsive, disorganized and short-tempered</b> rather than the smooth-talking, self-disciplined character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins or Kiefer Sutherland.</i></dd>
<dd>In other words, you're absolutely right, sociopaths aren't disciplined, and the article already states it. But the general Hollywood portrayal of a sociopath <b>is</b> disciplined, and the article mentions that as well, since it is a heading on <i>Fictional</i> sociopaths, after all. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartBurn_Kid_1f88.html" title="User:HeartBurn Kid">HBK</a> 15:20, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lists of fictional and famous sociopaths: Original research?</span></h2>
<p>The article contains lists of people and fictional characters who are allegedly sociopaths. The lists appear to be based on the opinions of contributors. I think this is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, which doesn't belong in Wikipedia. Classifying people as sociopath is pretty subjective if the criteria are vague, especially in the case of fictional characters. For example, whether Patrick Bateman (in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psycho_ba56.html" title="American Psycho">American Psycho</a>) is a sociopath depends, among other things, on the accuracy of his own descriptions: has he really committed the murders he describes or is it just fantasy? Both interpretations are compatible with the novel, so whether the text indicates that Bateman is (potentially) a sociopath or not is a matter of opinion.</p>
<p>I think both lists are inherently POV, unless we change it to something like <i>People diagnosed with ASPD</i> and then provide references for all entries to a source that mentions the diagnosis by a psychologist/psychiatrist. I would like to hear what other people think about this. If no one objects, I'll remove the lists in a week or so. <a href="../../../s/i/e/User%7ESietse_Snel_e2d7.html" title="User:Sietse Snel">Sietse</a> 10:43, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">comments on the intro</span></h2>
<p>Article begins "Antisocial personality disorder (APD), or dissocial personality disorder, is a personality disorder which is <i>often characterized</i> by antisocial and impulsive behaviour." Considering that the DSM has specific criteria for the definition of antisocial personality disorder, it would be better state this instead of using a vague "often characterized by" construction. This definition of APD also refutes another criticism offered in the intro. ("Both of these tests depend upon the person in question being a criminal or having participated in criminal activities.") No such requirement is stated in the diagnostic criteria, although repeatedly "performing acts that are grounds for arrest" is one of the several possible criteria (of which three must met) for the diagnosis.</p>
<p>I think beginning the article with the concise DSM criteria would work fine: "...defines antisocial personality disorder as a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following...." From there it would be logical to move to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist- Revised (PCL-R). --<a href="../../../b/a/w/User%7EBAW_ec1f.html" title="User:BAW">BAW</a> 11:47, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does the the word 'antisocial' redirect to the psychiatric diagnosis? Wikipedia isn't a medical or psychiatric journal; the common term 'antisocial' doesn't refer to psychopathy, sociopathy, or 'social anxiety disorder'. For instance, I might choose not to be social with specific people or groups, or at specific places (with that mean bastard next door; with neoconservatives; at the local bar), and hence be antisocial towards them. But that does not mean I have 'social anxiety' towards those situations. I might be perfectly confident about going to a party where I know some mean bastard will be present; but choose not go there because of the mean bastard. On the other hand, why should my disinclination to socialize (for example) with mean bastards, neoconservatives, or, at the local bar, imply that I have a disorder? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneismany_9c9b.html" title="User:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 16:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps I have perfectly good reasons for being antisocial which doesn't involve any disorder. My self-respect might prohibit me from talking to, or having drinks with, that asshole who was flicking me in the ear during high school. My sense of social justice might prohibit me from joining any clubs or organizations that advocate invading foreign countries. My taste in alcohol, or my level of income, might prohibit me from having beers at the local bar (or pub). Or perhaps I regard 'polite society' with dismay because the conversation is very dull. Now, what about that makes me 'disordered'? Personally I would rather regard mean bastards as having Mean Bastard Disorder; neocons as having Political Chauvanism Disorder; that dingy local bar as having Dingy Local Bar Disorder. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneismany_9c9b.html" title="User:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 16:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Shouldn't a term that uses the word 'social', somewhere define what 'social' means? I realize this would be asking much from psychiatry, which engages in the practice of diagnosing 'disorders' without mentioning what is 'ordered' or 'normal.' But here on Wikipedia, we can conveniently ignore the authoritative definitions of things in favor of consensual definitions. In ordinary language 'social' and 'antisocial' refer to habits of conduct, which might be natural variations of personal preference and not symptoms of personality deficiencies. Please restrict the article on 'ADP' to the topic of the psychiatric diagnosis, and permit topics on the variations of personal preference to have their own articles. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneismany_9c9b.html" title="User:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 16:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

you are confusing the word social and sociable. Not associating with someone because you don't like then does not mean you have antisocial personality disorder. You are just not being sociable with them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But the reverse of <i>sociable</i> is <i>unsociable</i>, not <i>antisociable.</i> Perhaps 'unsociable' is a better term than 'antisocial' for the inclination against socializing, but 'antisociable' or 'asociable' also sound like better terms for pathological unsociability. 'Social' is a vague term, but 'sociability' is much better defined, or so it seems to me. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneismany_9c9b.html" title="User:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 09:02, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Antisocial vs asocial</span></h2>
<p>I think there's confusion here between the concept of antisocial, which means a person acts against society, and asocial, where the person is more of a loner. Also if the link from this page to the social anxiety page is because of the confusion between antisocial and asocial, then wouldn't schizoid be a better example of a asocial type of disorder. An antisocial person lacks things such as empathy or morals, and a schizoid lacks the need for socialization. Someone with social anxiety disorder may very well have a "normal" need and desire for human interaction, but has trouble in interacting with people as others "normally" do. Their isolation isn't so much a extention of their personality as it is an unusually powerful emotion, or line of though infringing on their perceptions. An antisocial person seemingly has no struggle with themselves to behave antisocially, it is thought to come much more naturally. It's not that some recurent though or mood makes moral action difficult, it's that they the desire to act so isn't even present. They act so because it is an extention of their personality. At least I think that's how it might work172.190.214.17 18:30, 9 December 2005 (UTC)SDF</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marriage to an APD... Any Questions?</span></h2>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Paul Hruza and I have written this short note to express myself as one who was married to a woman with Antisocial Personality Disorder. I tried desperately for 6 years of marriage, and now 3 years after the divorce to get inside this person's mind and heart and understand her, but to no avail. She lied and cheated on her first husband with me (with whom she had two children) after 5 years (and boy do I REGRET it!), lied and cheated on me after 6 years of marriage (with her latest husband), and has now left him TEN TIMES in their brief 3 year marriage to travel from Yokota AFB, Japan, back to Panama City, Florida. The first time she returned was 45 days after their "marriage". She even went as far as denying she was married to him at all, to her family members, children and I...</p>
<p>When she finally divorced me I decided I needed to make sure I was "OK" mentally and spent many hours with a good psychologist. Discussions of my relationship with this person revealed a diagnosis of APD. The psychologist told me I should be awarded a medal for having lasted as long as I did with this person. I refused to believe it at first but after spending a few hours on the internet studing this disorder I saw the truth. I sat there with tears running down my face reading my exwife's "diary"! She fills all the squares for this disorder except for two. She has never been in trouble with the law, being much to cunning for that (not so much as a speeding ticket), nor does she do drugs. She will have the occasional alcoholic beverage. Two at most in any setting. Beyond this, she fills all the squares.</p>
<p>My relationship with her was "fairly stable" until the decision was made (by her) to send the children to live with their father in Utah. Once the responsibility of raising the kids was gone that was it, "All Hell Broke Loose". It was as though she fell off a cliff and was free to manipulate anyone and anything in her way.</p>
<p>I guess I am amazed by the amount of lies she is capable of without so much as a blink of the eye. There have been hundreds of them, more likely thousands. She has lied to all her husbands, friends, family, even her own children! Her sense of cunning and deceitfulness is unbelieveable. I have only actually witnessed her shed a tear three times in 13 years of knowing her. She truely has no heart whatsoever... As of today's date (02/15/06) she is 40 years old, $7000 in debt, has no career (she has quit 7 jobs in Japan to run back here to Florida), and currently owns six boxes of clothes that have been shipped back and forth. I think her current husband must fall into the "Codependent" category since he has taken her back each and every time.</p>
<p>Each time she leaves she will contact me one way or the other and evetually decide that she does not want to be with this "husband" of hers and promises to get a divorce and remain with me... And, after a few weeks or months, "disappears into the night" when I am not at home. She will not face him nor I when it comes time to leave, she prefers sneaking out when you aren't looking (more deceitfullness). I could go on and on about the situation but would rather end this discussion here and offer my experiences to anyone would may have the need to discuss what it's like to have someone like this in your life for such a long period of time. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to learn more. My email is paul.hruza61@knology.net I hope this helps someone, somewhere.... Thanks!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marriage to an APD Answer...</span></h2>
<p>I do not consider speaking the truth an "attack", nor is my purpose here to slander anyone in any way. Yes, the diagnosis was via third party. If you study this disorder thoroughly you will find that almost all APDs are diagnosed this way since they never feel there is anything wrong with them (part of the disorder) so they rarely seek treatment on their own. I would also gladly give my psychologist' name and the permission to review my personal records to anyone who asked. I am quite sure she would stand by her diagnosis!! I have, however, removed her latest husband's name... Thanks!
