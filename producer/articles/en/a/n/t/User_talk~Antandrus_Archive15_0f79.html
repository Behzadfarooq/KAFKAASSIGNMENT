<p>It is getting amusing, latest Ray Lopez meat puppet is now accusing me of being Ray, and flinging personal attacks. The individual in question is also harrassing me at my home phone number.

<p>Hi: Thanks for your response the other day. The IT sexctor has provided a living of sorts but it has been neither terribly remunerative nor (increasingly) fun. But as you say it's definitely better than the usual track for us terminal degree holders. I keep my hand in as best I can, both here and at home (where I sing in the choir at church and conduct there when needed--nice to be married to the organist, and fool increasingly with composing and arranging, which I can do more or less independently of other people).</p>
<p>Tell me about your involvement with M. I have been completely uninvolved so far (joined in early 2004), largely because their events and my schedule have not aligned until recently. I am hoping to get to an introductory event sometime soon. The events also often seem to involve buying meals and sometimes lodging, and our finances have not been such that I feel I can do that, though I was told that I could always attend an event but not buy anything. What's your take on the whole thing? Thanks! --<a href="../../../w/s/p/User%7EWspencer11_8aca.html" title="User:Wspencer11">Wspencer11</a> <a href="../../../w/s/p/User_talk%7EWspencer11_b16d.html" title="User talk:Wspencer11">(talk to me...)</a> 15:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>From Whitman's A Passage to India, lines that I love (both on their own and the way RVW sets them in A Sea Symphony) and that could sum up one's approach to Wikipedia:</p>
<p><i>Sail forth! steer for the deep waters only!</i></p>
<p><i>Reckless, O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me;</i></p>
<p><i>For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,</i></p>
<p><i>And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>O my brave soul!</i></p>
<p><i>O farther, farther sail!</i></p>
<p><i>O daring joy, but safe! Are they not all the seas of God?</i></p>
<p><i>O farther, farther, farther sail!</i></p>

<dd>I have never heard the Hindemith setting but would love to sometime, though my experience of his music written after the early 40s or so is that it's clearly Hindemith but not generally very interesting--he just seems to go through the motions. (One buddy of mine from Aspen days decades ago always described Hindemith's music as "Looks like Bach, sounds like hell.") I believe I read somewhere once that someone (apparently with muchos cojones) asked him once why he wrote so much music when only 20% of it was worthwhile. He responded by saying that without the 80% there would not have been the 20%. (What a great reply!) So the Requiem is high-quality? --<a href="../../../w/s/p/User%7EWspencer11_8aca.html" title="User:Wspencer11">Wspencer11</a> <a href="../../../w/s/p/User_talk%7EWspencer11_b16d.html" title="User talk:Wspencer11">(talk to me...)</a> 15:50, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Antandrus, I'm wondering if you could explain why you've been removing other users attempts to communicate with me from my talkpage?

<li>I had a long talk with the user over IM (he contacted me), and I believe he's going to stop the problem behaviour. I've taken the liberty of unblocking -- I hope you don't mind. Your judgement was sound in blocking, I believe, and sometimes long talks are worthwhile in changing things. If I'm wrong about his intent, feel free to block again -- I don't have a stake in the unblocking.

<p>Hi there! I know we haven't talked much (or indeed at all, from what I can remember), but you have a lot of barnstars from people I admire, and as such, I trust you by proxy&#160;:-P.

<dd>Thanks. Well, all I've seen him do is redirect the home pages of newspaper services to their Yahoo! feed, and he likes to mention on the talk pages of news channels (MSNBC, Fox, etc.) that he's found a live stream of them at a certain IP address. I really have no idea why he's doing it, either. I mean, some of his earlier sock puppets didn't shy from the standard "replace the page with a curse word" vandalism on other pages, but that's all I've seen him do on newspaper and news channel pages. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Aquila_9d4c.html" title="User:Stephen Aquila">Stephen Aquila</a> 22:08, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I noticed that that was the vandal's <i>modus operandi</i>. When we were fixing them the other night I tended to delete all his image reversions, so it wouldn't look like he was doing the vandalism reverting, and so that I wouldn't have to check all the images. Most of my <i>Concerto</i> stuff used Newcomb as their main source, so if you find stuff that doesn't, I'd be happy to hear about it and see if I can get it from NY Public. I didn't find much in Einstein, but I might not have looked in the right places. Even though <i>Concerto</i> is an FA now (woo!) I think it still needs some clarity in terms of the musical style, and better structure. But I'm feeling a little worn out on those aspects of it at the moment&#160;:) Oh well, maybe I'll write some articles on Lully operas. ...dinner party now, perhaps I'll see you in the recent changes later&#160;:P Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 22:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is something I have wondered. First note I am the NCV, but I have given p vandalism. This is unrelated to my vandalism.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I have wondered is whether Stirling is the same as the users harassing him? Maybe he'd actually just a troll. I'd like to request a checkuser on the matter. The things which make me think this are</p>
<p>1:<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERay_Lopez_e4d3.html" title="User:Ray Lopez">User:Ray Lopez</a> made an edit to his talk page around the time that Stirling came back from his wikibreak.</p>
<p>2:The harassers can't be watching him 24/7, but both Stirling and the harassers seem to be editing at around the same time. Maybe he's just switching his accounts from one to another and trying to fake a harssment going on between users.</p>
<p>Although this may not be true, I would like to see a checkuser to find out whether these are the same person. This includes Ray Lopez, T Turner, and the others. Shminh 16:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually they have been checkusered; look in the block log. There's a long history of abuse coming from the person behind the "Ray Lopez" account, but beyond about a year ago I can't tell who is who. I've known Stirling for a couple of years, and I don't see any reason why he would make sockpuppets to attack himself; I know that was a charge Ray made, but it just doesn't make any sense.</dd>

<p>Hi Antandrus. It's been a long time since we've caught up with each other. I see you're still a keen editor of music articles. I'm now approaching you in that capacity, and in your role as an admin. There have been continuing difficulties at <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonata_form.html" title="Sonata form">Sonata form</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_sonata_form.html" title="History of sonata form">History of sonata form</a>, along with other articles addressing sonata (of which there are far too many, but that's another matter). I would be very grateful if you would review the situation, looking at those two articles and also at their talk pages. A useful conspectus of some of the issues is to be found at <a href="../../../r/a/i/User_talk%7ERainwarrior_ec65.html#Sonata" title="User talk:Rainwarrior">User_talk:Rainwarrior#Sonata</a>. As you know, I am a serious editor in these areas, and I have been patient (well, I also call a spade a spade in edit summaries). But I now need some advice from you about the best way forward. If things can't be put on a better footing, I fear that the suite of articles on musical form, in which Wikipedia has a genuine opportunity to excel, will be jeopardised.

<dd>Thanks for your prompt reply to this at my talk page, Antandrus. Yes, Stirling and I do overreact to each other. For that reason I do not get into direct discussion with him: from my point of view, we are so different that it would be futile to attempt to engage him in dispassionate dialogue aimed at improving articles. I used to try; it didn't work. As I say, I can only claim this as <i>my point of view</i>! My style is to be meticulous in editing, and to declare my hand in edit summaries. If that can't work to make certain articles better, I'll probably stay away from those articles. (We must make what we can of the possible, as an ancient friend of ours reminds us!) Thanks, once more. We'll see what others have to say, and do. – <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoetica_c76e.html" title="User:Noetica">Noetica</a> 02:28, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, the problem was that there were actually two edits close together by different people. Perhaps I should have left the infobox, but frankly I kind of hate them, so if the people adding them can't do it right, I'm not going to bother to fix it. That other guy has inserted the "banal" comment a couple of times, so I've left another comment on his talk page about NPOV and WP:V. Hopefully it will help, but more likely I'll get a long rant about how his music <i>is</i> banal, and how dare I deny people the truth. Oh well.

<dd>Well, I make no comment on my true feelings about Glass' music. I just think accusing an artist of banality is just about the harshest thing you can do, and if you're going to do it you really have to do it right. If the guy got some good sources, a supporting paragraph, a couple other major composers/critics/conductors calling him banal, that'd be fine. <small>ps I do really like a lot of minimalist music. Just not Glass.

<p>First, I admit to creation of attack accounts on September 9, 2006. however This is not vadnalism. It is not exactly at least. It can be considered "trolling" or "disruption", but this is not "vandalism".</p>
<p>I will promise to neither vandalize articles nor create attack accounts again, although this will not always hold true. Do not revert hhis edit, as it is meant in good faith.</p>
<p>Anyway, a way in which I will surely stop vandalizing is if you restore an edit to <a href="../../../h/a/a/Haathi_Mere_Saathi_677f.html" title="Haathi Mere Saathi">Haathi Mere Saathi</a> back in to the hsitroy. It was made on April 9, 2006, and includes some important content I have needed for months. i will surely stop my vandalism if you restore that to the history. Although i9twas vandalism, it was made back in April and the edits since then will overwrite it.Woivazhoinzuz 00:31, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm quite new to editing articles on here, which is why I removed the 1980 Grove reference from the article on Nicolas Gombert which you then restored. Obviously if it's your source that's fair enough, but I wouldn't recommend that article in general as it has quite a lot of errors. Is there a way of separating sources for the article from further reading?</p>
