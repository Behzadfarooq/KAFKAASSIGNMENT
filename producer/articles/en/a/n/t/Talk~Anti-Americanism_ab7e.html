<p>Just one minor complaint, in the opinion poll on middle east attitudes I don't see what relevance opinions on Jews have to anti-Americanism. I can understand the Christian statistics perhaps being relevant, but the Jewish statistics, whilst interesting, have no direct relevance to anti-Americanism. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfrackis_911b.html" title="User:Blankfrackis">blankfrackis</a> 15:35, 05 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The French Revolution, seen by some as influenced by the American Revolution,..." Can we get any sources on this?~~LtDoc~~</p>
<p><br />
A number of assertions throughout are lacking citations and furthermore loaded, such as concerning perceived causes of Anti-Americanism. Citations might relieve the loading, but also sentence structure such as: "This exposed previously isolated countries to the spread of the English language and American popular culture. A process that some have labeled Cultural imperialism despite the fact it is driven by consumer choice." I have edited that paragraph to read: "This exposed previously isolated countries to the spread of the English language and American popular culture, a process that some have labelled Cultural Imperialism despite the role played by consumer choice." Even this is not ideal but as I don't have sources I won't mess any more. I have flooded the paragraph and a couple of others with <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags. --Dom</p>

<p>I'm curious whether the most recent edit to the 'Middle East' section is based on the survey the article was citing or not:</p>
<p>The change was <b>from</b>, "Hatred of the US is strong in some foreign countries, especially those that are strongly Islamic. In such countries, the anti-Americanism is often paired with broad support and admiration for <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a>."</p>
<p><b>to</b>, "However most of these countries showed a marked distinction between negative perceptions of the United States, and much less negative of Americans."</p>
<p>I read the Pew Research survey and number one, it is a survey about Muslim attitudes towards <b>Westeners,</b> not specifically Americans, (and vice versa of Westerners towards Muslims) and number two, it states support for Osama bin Laden in muslim countries is from 24% to 60%, so I don't know why the author edited out everything about support for OBL.</p>
<p>It <b>also states</b>, "large percentages in nearly every Muslim country attribute several negative traits to Westerners - including violence, immorality and selfishness," so that is about the people and not the country, as opposed to what the edit states.</p>

<p>Absolutely ridiculous! Anti-Americanism. You should never be anti any country, ethnic grouup, religion and so on! By the way, a lot of the media (not all) that us folks in Canada watch is American. Some people who hate Americans like to listen to American music or watch American movies. There are girls that love Brad Pitt and George Clooney or some other good looking guy, yet they hate Americans?! Ridiculous. I have met many nice people in that country and how dare a country like Canada, who supposedly is a tolerant and accepting country, say things against other countries. Who's going to be there when there is an attack on us? Our army is certainly not powerful enough to fight on their own. The USA will be there at our side. Also to any Canadians out there, our governments in the past have not always been the best either, so who are we to say anything? Go America!</p>

<p>Yes and no. The USA did some very deplorable things, or was accused of. It's very ok to dislike if you have good reasons. It's not ok to hold things against a people (generaly), but you can toward a governement.</p>
<p>And that is no excuse to be uncritical of the USA under the weasel pretext that bad guys are out to get us. Do we have to close our eyes on the evil done by somes americans? Evil is evil, no matters the reason given for.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok first not all Canadians are anti american, which is what it seems like your saying (guy up top) and secondly Anti American doesnt necessarily mean you hate anything american made or anyone american born. I'm canadian, and well, on American television and movies canadians are made fun of a lot. Whilst on canadian programming....nothing discerning the USA. Unless the show frequently does this. You also make yourself sound to be an american trying to make the USA sound better.

<p>Yeah and the USA has good bands that's why someone who is anti-american may listen. I mean take the project called "Rock against Bush" this included many bands such as NOFX(American), Rise Against(American), The Offspring(American). Many people consider themselves "Anti American" because they disagree with the war, and George Bush, etc. That is why if you're anti american you would listen to american music. Shazaam info!

<p>Sorry guys, this is not a soapbox. There is such a thing as anti-americanism, so an encyclopedia has to describe it. That's the only purpose here. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 17:36, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, wikipedia is not a soap box, although the talk page can be... I just want to point out though, that while the existence of the concept of anti-americanism is undoubtedly true, the existence itself is more questionable. 204.52.215.68 16:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm not canadian and have little idea about anti-americanism in Canada. But, for sure, anti-americanism exist in Latin America, where I'm from. Talking from this point, as latin and sociologist, I can understand the mention of an institutional concept of antiamericanism as a sentiment about all-northamerican-people... But this, simply, its just a relatively minor and less relevant phenomena. There isn't in Wikipedia an article about prejudices of chilean over bolivian people, nor about prejudices bolivian over chilean people, and both FOR SURE exists. Particular expressions of nationalist prejudices doesn't require an own article. Antiamericanism does... Why? because isn't about northamerican people, but about US foreign policy. In latinamerica during the 70's, nearly every one famous speech against US state clearly that latinamericans doesn't hate US people, but his government, his great firms, etc. In many cases, this was accompanied with support messages to workers, or black, or indians, or other social movements in the USA.</dd>
<dd>Other phenomena clearly distinguish antiamericanism from nationalist prejudices. In modern history, nationalist prejudices are strongly correlated with right wing politics, with argueable but minor exceptions dued to specific historic contingencies (such spanish republican anti-moor sentiment encouraged against auxiliar nationalist forces). At least in latin america (I'm tryng to keep my affirmations here, but I truly believe they apply widely) antiamericanism isn't only widespread, but's absolutely transversal to politic identification (and to not politic identification).</dd>
<dd>So, I doesn't see antiamericanism as a so "ridiculous" problem, and I think in the article is depicted like a phenomena about irrational attitudes who is not. Also think the "americas" section it's highly euphemistic. Antiamericanism in Latinamerica it's, (and I'm referring to clearly established facts) related to; sistematic support to state terrorism and sistematic intromission in domestic affairs during cold war and after it. Just in Chile (my country) are many terrorist acts and direct interventions who where perpetrated, according to CIA files, by the US. Saying "US support for dictators such as Augusto Pinochet" or "Support for the 1973 Chilean coup d'état" sounds like diplomatic decissions, and are obviously euphemistic.

<p>The anti American article is perfect. I understand why other countries hate the USA. The USA is bias, and does anything in the name of freedom and democracy whilst having other motives. It is just like the United States article, completely staged and at such a slant as to make any propaganda look fair. - --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargrave1206_6f70.html" title="User:Margrave1206">Margrave1206</a> 18:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know this isn't the right place for this, but I'd like to say one thing: I am American, and I completely agree with you Margrave. Too often, the United States acts in its own self-interest while championing "freedom and democracy". <b>In our defense, though,</b> I'd like to point out, that most of these policies are instituted by our <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_Administration_21a1.html" title="George W.

<dd>So Rotten seems to be very concerned with how America is being treated on Wikipedia. He constantly brings up something about an "inferiority complex" or something like that. Yet he goes on to mock and belittle other users based on their spelling and grammer. Wikipedia exists internationally in case you didn't know. Also in case you didn't know, those people are entitled to their own opinions, and those opinions are worth just as much as yours. You attacking them based on their grammitical shortcomings gives people reason alone to be anti-american based on your actions. Lead by example my friend. It is clear you regard the US as the greatest nation in the world, so just remember you represent it and others might judge you based on things you say. You go on to say that you(and several others) are greatly intelligent, and you must keep an eye these fabled, "Little Bastards" to see if they write anything you don't approve of. What you are saying here is that you are inherently smarter than others on this issue, and anyone else is poison to what is otherwise good. What is good? You cited "the US page" as being good. Typical of the attitudes people who dislike America often cite, in my opinion.</dd>
<dd>I am not anti american. I am pro-open mind, and anti-jerk. Open mind doesn't mean accept everything regardless of anything. It means think for yourself, and come to your own conclusions. I do not agree with some things the U.S government is currently doing and I don't agree with many things they've done in the past. All the same, I understanding hatred against a nation is unjust based on those things. You are the only one who's talking about an inferiority complex, and it seems to be your general rebuttle to anything anti-american. I am not saying all anti american sentiments are just, but many of them are founded in something. By immediately treating every anti-US sentiment as inferiority complex, you only come off as being arrogant and unable to think. All things considered it looks more to me(I could be wrong) like you have a superiority complex. You love your country and that is fantastic(this is not sarcastic). Just keep an open mind, and don't be a dick.

<dd>On some level sure, but it definitely isn't the only (or even necessarily the primary) motivation.

<dd>I would personally say that jealousy usually has an object over-and-above the parties involved; if I'm jealous of somebody, I'm actually jealous of <i>something they have that I don't</i>. But then consider that the average European has a better quality of life than the average American. What's to be jealous of? Inferior American health care? The average non-Western doesn't have a better quality of life, of course, but then the jealousy of the non-Westerner is directed at the West in general, and not at America particularly.</dd>

<dd>I think that within wealthy nations, there exists some jealousy that exhibits itself as anti-Americanism... although they might not be resentful of our wealth, they are jealous of our power, visibility, influence, and achievements. Some anti-ism might go back the other way and it may be due to jealous on American's part... but not as much.

<dd>I'm not certain if it is mentioned in the article or not, but it is definately worth mentioning as a potential factor. Keep in mind there are many anti-american sentiments all over the planet, and jealousy could in several places be feasable. I don't think its possible to prove, but worth mentioning...</dd>

<p>(resert indent) Sure, jealousy is definitely one of the causes of Anti-Americanism. It's not just America, people envy the EU, Japan and Australia as well. All wealthy nations are envied and the US is the highest profile 1st world nation. Jealousy should definitely be mentioned in this article-it does need to be referenced of course. <b><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 00:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think it has anything to do with jealousy. I think it has to do with being the 'Big Dog' and what they've learned in their culture.

<dd>The severe reaction of non-American's to the suggestion that a portion of anti-Americanism might be due to jealousy leads me to believe that it probably has something to do with jealousy, at least in part.--<a href="../../../r/o/t/User%7ERotten_cd21.html" title="User:Rotten">Rotten</a> 20:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just going to repeat that resentment is a much better word (and probably far easier to source) than jealousy. There is, for instance, a tremendous amount of resentment in the Mid. East (where I live) re: favouritism to Israel; the Iraq war; perceived American arrogance; a general sense that the reputation of Islam is taking a drubbing (many blame Al Queda <i>and</i> America, on that score).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I have yet to meet the Gulf Arab who is jealous of America or Americans in the typical sense of the word. The development of an indigenous service sector is low (e.g., they travel abroad for much health care) but this aside, the quality of life in much of the Arabian Gulf (the supposed hottest of hotbeds regarding AA) is also equal to or better than the American; no need to be jealous of a swimming pool in an American backyard if you have your own.</dd>

<dd>Your loud protests on the subject speak volumes. I said nothing about quality of life and I don't think it's even quantifiable. One person's high quality of life is another person's low quality of life. I feel that while some AA is warranted, I think that resentment and jealousy both play a factor. I'm not going to add it though, I feel that it should be documented that their was dissension on this topic (although dissension isn't well tolerated on Wikipedia).--<a href="../../../r/o/t/User%7ERotten_cd21.html" title="User:Rotten">Rotten</a> 17:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This thread started with a very general talking point and you received very general responses. Of course, resentment and jealousy go hand-in-hand; I was just teasing out the difference. The search doesn't prove anything; it suggests that resentment is more often discussed in relation to AA than is jealousy in scholarly works. And it's not a meaningless function if you actually want to scrounge up sources. Some of the sources on the page now were pulled from such searches. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 20:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, this discussion is much more interesting than the actual article (which is utterly useless in my opinion). I am inclined to believe that anti-Americanism is probably more resentment than jealousy (though there are almost certainly many who are envious of America's military and economic power).</p>
<p>I think some people are Anti American because tehy dont think American power and influence are a good thing, which isnt jealousy or resentment but political opinion, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To call "jealous" a social phenomena so widely extended as antiamericanism it's and obvious psychologization of social problems, who fail to reach any methodological value. You can't understand social phenomena like a summatory of personal feelings. Resentmen, for same reasons, isn't a better option. I think many things in the article, and specially many opinions in this talk, try to imagine antiamericanism as an irrational sentiment, who's not. See my com in section "Ridiculous", please, about antimaericanism in latinamerica. I think I should have it placed here.IsmaelPR 17:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's probably the only thing on this planet that myself and <i>squeakbox</i> would agree on, that this article is completely useless. It's a dumping ground for every anti-American person that stops by and wants to show, "Look at this, this is why we hate you!" and then editors try desperately to weave the snippits of nonsense these people added into something cohesive. It's too long, it jumps from one small subject to the next. It has a ridiculous amount of peer-reviewed articles that no one is actually going to click on. And mostly, some regular editors seem to think everything anti-American needs to be justified.</dd>

No. That's the difference, those who want to glorify their hatred and those who don't. 68.229.201.181 18:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is hardly a useless article - the following is a typical example of how "anti-american" is used in news reports (its from the washingtonpost march 5 2007): A weeping man in eastern Afghanistan shouts anti-American slogans after violence that followed a bomb attack on a U.S. convoy. Notice that his grief and anger is characterized pejoratively as anti-american. Notice also how the the newspaper writer expertly left the "violence" abstract and disconnected from the people responsible for it. In fact the "violence" that the man suffered was due to american serviceman killing nearby civilians after they were car bombed. Now if an American were to be killed by an Iraqi and her friends or relatives screamed in bloody rage at Iraquis her screams would never be labelled anti-iraqui. This word "anti-american" is the product of the psychotic dream of america. Words don't always refer to things that exist - there is such a thing as phantasm or illusion. "Anti-americanism" is the alibi for americans who are to cowardly to look at the suffering that they create in others and instead magically transform it into the abstract "irrational" violence of "anti-americans".Canuckistani 04:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are confused. There is no doubt that many on this planet hate or dislike the usa - that doesn't mean that "anti-americanism" refers to anything. The word undoubtedly exists but the question is whether its referent does. For example we have the words "unicorn" or "darth vader" etc... "Anti-americanism" has a similar status except its domain is political. Hating the american policy of world domination through military intervention, capalistic exploitation etc... is not the same as "anti-americanism"; "anti-americanism" is an ideological term that short-circuits any criticism of the usa IN ADVANCE. So if I hate the usa because the usa has a history of continuously invading or otherwise interfering in the affairs of sovereign countries or enslaves my fellow humans through its corporate proxies, etc... (pick your poison here) then it's a reasonable hatred. Anti-americanism, on the other hand, is a word that wants to explain all hatred or violence towards the united states as if it were abstract or unreasonable, as if any ill-will toward the U.S. happened without taking into account the actions of the US in world. It is also a cheap self-serving word - the reason for "anti-americanism" is often supposed to be jealousy - by which supporters of america imagine that everyone on the planet wants their pile of junk. Supporters of america see "anti-americanism" everywhere even in the anguish of the people they torture: it is screen word, a lying word, a cowardly word that is used by those who will not look at the crimes they commit on or towards others.Canuckistani 15:08, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
