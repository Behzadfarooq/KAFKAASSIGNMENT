<p><b>Anti-aircraft warfare</b>, or <b>air defense</b>, is any method of engaging military <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> in combat from the ground. Various guns and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannons.html" title="Cannons">cannons</a> have been used in this role since the first military aircraft were used in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, growing in power and accuracy over the years. Starting in the post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> era the guns were joined by the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guided_missile.html" title="Guided missile">guided missile</a>, specifically the "<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface-to-air_missile.html" title="Surface-to-air missile">surface-to-air missile</a>", and today both are used in combination in most roles.</p>
<p>Adaptations of standard <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">systems</a> were commonly used for most long-range anti-aircraft artillery, starting with standard pieces on new mountings, and evolving to custom guns with much higher performance prior to World War II. Their <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_%28projectile%29.html" title="Shell (projectile)">shells</a> are usually fitted with different types of <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fuse_%28explosives%29.html" title="Fuse (explosives)">fuses</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barometric_pressure.html" title="Barometric pressure">barometric</a>, time-delay, or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proximity_fuze.html" title="Proximity fuze">proximity</a>) to send <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel.html" title="Shrapnel">exploding metal fragments</a> into the area of the target. The classic example of a large calibre, long-range anti-aircraft gun is the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../8/8/_/88_mm_gun.html" title="88 mm gun">88 mm gun</a>. Long-range weapons of this sort have for the most part been superseded by the effective anti-air <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> systems that were introduced in the 1950s; however, because they are relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture compared to more modern systems, they are still employed in large numbers by many nations.</p>
<p>For shorter-range work, a lighter weapon with a higher <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rate_of_fire.html" title="Rate of fire">rate of fire</a> is required, to guarantee a hit on a quickly traversing target. Weapons of <a href="../../../2/0/_/20_mm_caliber.html" title="20 mm caliber">20 mm</a>, 37 mm, and 40 mm have been widely used in this role. Unlike the heavier guns, these smaller weapons are still in widespread use today for the same reasons as they were originally introduced: the ability to quickly follow the target. Modern systems often use weapons generally known as <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocannon.html" title="Autocannon">autocannon</a>, that were originally intended for air-to-ground use. However, developments in the latest short-range missiles means that these appear to be able to replace guns even in this role.</p>
<p>Nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include <b>AAA</b> or <b>triple-A</b>, an <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbreviation.html" title="Abbreviation">abbreviation</a> for <i><b>a</b>nti-<b>a</b>ircraft <b>a</b>rtillery</i>, <b>ack-ack</b> (from the <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_phonetic_alphabet_dd57.html" title="RAF phonetic alphabet">World War I phonetic alphabet</a> for AA), <b>archie</b> (a WWI British term believed to derive via the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> from the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music-hall.html" title="Music-hall">music-hall</a> comedian <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Robey_6067.html" title="George Robey">George Robey</a>'s line "Archibald, certainly not!"), and <b>flak</b> (from the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> <i><b>Fl</b>ug<b>a</b>bwehr<b>k</b>anone</i>, aircraft defense cannon). An <b>anti-aircraft missile</b> is another name for a <b>surface-to-air missile</b>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> uses the term <b>Anti-Air Warfare</b> (AAW); most groups of ships have a designated AAW <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander.html" title="Commander">commander</a> among them. The <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Anti-Air_Defense_97d4.html" title="Soviet Anti-Air Defense">Soviet Anti-Air Defense</a> was a separate <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_forces.html" title="Armed forces">armed service</a>, but in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> has been subordinated to the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Air_Force_7f62.html" title="Russian Air Force">Air Force</a>. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> has generally been able to count on air superiority to reduce the threat from air attack on its ground units, and settles for a two-tier structure: the man-portable <a href="../../../f/i/m/FIM-92_Stinger_28b2.html" title="FIM-92 Stinger">Stinger</a> missile (fired by troops or from vehicles) and the anti-aircraft/anti-missile <a href="../../../m/i/m/MIM-104_Patriot_0702.html" title="MIM-104 Patriot">Patriot</a> system. Countries less assured of air superiority have more tiers. Russia, for example, has a system consisting of battalion-level <a href="../../../m/a/n/MANPADS_5a96.html" title="MANPADS">MANPADS</a>, regimental <a href="../../../s/h/o/SHORAD_5e0b.html" title="SHORAD">SHORAD</a> (typically autocannon and <a href="../../../i/r/_/IR_4f74.html" title="IR">IR</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/c/SACLOS_3cbf.html" title="SACLOS">SACLOS</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/SAM_9f1b.html" title="SAM">SAMs</a>), divisional <a href="../../../s/h/o/SHORAD_5e0b.html" title="SHORAD">SHORAD</a> (typically short-ranged radar guided <a href="../../../s/a/m/SAM_9f1b.html" title="SAM">SAMs</a>), medium range Army level (<a href="../../../s/a/-/SA-11_995c.html" title="SA-11">SA-11</a>) and long range Front level (<a href="../../../s/a/-/SA-12_e5f1.html" title="SA-12">SA-12</a>) systems.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Given this early history, it is perhaps not surprising that it was only in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> that development of anti-aircraft guns continued. In 1909 a number of Krupp's designs were shown, including adaptations of their 65 mm 9-pounder, a 75 mm 12-pounder, and even a 105 mm gun. By the start of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> the 75 mm had become the standard German weapon, and came mounted on a large traverse that could be easily picked up on a wagon for movement.</p>
<p>Other countries seem to have largely ignored the possibility of aircraft being an important part of hostilities, but this soon changed when German spotter aircraft started calling down increasingly accurate <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> fire. All armies soon deployed a number of guns based on their smaller field pieces, notably the French 75 mm and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> 76.2 mm, typically simply propped up on some sort of embankment to get the muzzle pointed skyward. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> decided on an entirely new weapon, and deployed a 3 inch (76 mm) gun that was perhaps the best of the bunch. The German army also adapted a revolving-cannon solution that came to be known to Allied fliers as the "flaming onion." This gun had five barrels and could launch a 37mm artillery shell about five thousand feet up. Because most other rounds were fired slowly due to the nature of anti-aircraft artillery at the time, this gun's rapid rate of fire left many fliers thinking that the rounds were attached to a string and they feared being shredded by it. <a href="http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-9836.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-9836.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In general these ad-hoc solutions proved largely useless. With little experience in the role, and no ability to spot the "fall" of their rounds with any accuracy, gunners proved unable to get the altitude correct and most rounds fell well below their targets. The exception to this rule were the guns protecting spotting balloons, in which case the altitude could be accurately measured from the length of the cable holding the balloon. The Krupp 75 mm guns were later supplied with an optical sighting system that improved their capabilities, but these sorts of systems were not deployed by other forces.</p>
<p>As aircraft started to be used in tactical roles against ground targets, these larger weapons proved too ponderous to aim at the quickly traversing targets. Soon the forces were adding various <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a> based weapons mounted on poles. The British introduced a heavier weapon — their 1-pounder "pom-pom" (a 37 mm version of the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim_Gun_868e.html" title="Maxim Gun">Maxim Gun</a>) on an elevated mounting. These short-range weapons proved more deadly, and the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manfred_von_Richthofen_71a1.html" title="Manfred von Richthofen">Red Baron</a> arguably fell victim to an anti-aircraft <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vickers_machine_gun.html" title="Vickers machine gun">Vickers machine gun</a>.</p>
<p>When the war ended it was clear that the increasing capabilities of aircraft would require a much more serious attempt at downing them. Nevertheless the pattern had been set: anti-aircraft weapons would be based around heavy weapons attacking high-altitude targets and lighter weapons for use when they came to lower altitudes.</p>
<p><a name="World_War_II" id="World_War_II"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft_warfare.html" title="Edit section: World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
<p>World War I had proven that the aircraft was an important part of the battlefield. As the capabilities of aircraft improved, and more specificially their engines, it was clear that their role in future combat would be even more critical as their warload grew. Many felt that the higher speeds and altitudes would render anti-aircraft systems useless, so little effort was put into improving systems.</p>
<p>Once again, it was only Germany that seriously considered what to do about this. They developed a number of new anti-aircraft weapons in the late 1920s and early 1930s, often in collaboration with Swiss and Swedish companies, including a new rapid-fire <a href="../../../2/_/c/2_cm_FlaK_30_49a7.html" title="2 cm FlaK 30">20 mm gun</a> for low-altitude work, and a <a href="../../../3/2E/7/3.7_cm_FlaK_43_63a5.html" title="3.7 cm FlaK 43">37 mm gun</a> for low and medium altitudes. By the mid-1930s the 20 mm was considered to be too low power against the increasingly fast planes, but instead of introducing a new gun, Krupp managed to squeeze four of the existing 20 mm guns onto a single carriage of about the same weight. This improved firepower enough to make a wholescale switch to a larger gun unattractive in comparison. By the end of the war Germany had essentially given up on the 20 mm as it lacked punch. It was never cleanly replaced however; the 37 mm was available in limited numbers, and a new dual-30 mm system based on the <a href="../../../m/k/_/MK_108_cannon_ebaf.html" title="MK 108 cannon">MK 108</a> aircraft gun was never put into widespread use.</p>
<p>Their high-altitude needs were originally going to be filled by a 75 mm gun from Krupp, designed in collaboration with their Swedish counterpart <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors.html" title="Bofors">Bofors</a>, but the specifications were later amended to require much higher performance. In response Krupp's engineers presented a new 88 mm design, the <a href="../../../8/8/_/88_mm_gun.html" title="88 mm gun">FLaK 88</a>. The <b>eighty-eight</b> would go on to become one of the most famous <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> pieces in history. First used in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the gun proved to be one of the best anti-aircraft guns in the world, as well as particularly deadly against tanks. It is in this later role that it became most widely known, the bane of Allied tank crews wherever it appeared.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Chastise_df9d.html" title="Operation Chastise">Dambusters</a> raid in 1943 an entirely new system was developed that was required to knock down any low-flying aircraft with a single hit. The first attempt to produce such a system used a 50 mm gun, but this proved inaccurate and a new 55 mm gun replaced it. The system used a centralized control system including both search and targeting <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a>, which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics, and then sent electrical commands to the guns which used <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulic.html" title="Hydraulic">hydraulics</a> to point themselves at high speeds. Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets. This system, modern even by today's standards, was in late development when the war ended.</p>

<p>In the late 1920s the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Navy_f056.html" title="Swedish Navy">Swedish Navy</a> had ordered the development of a 40-mm naval anti-aircraft gun from the <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors.html" title="Bofors">Bofors</a> company. The new gun proved to be light, fast and reliable, and a mobile version on a four wheel carriage was soon developed. Known simply as the <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors_40_mm_gun.html" title="Bofors 40 mm gun">40 mm</a>, it was adopted by some 17 different nations just before WWII and is still in use today in some applications such as on coast guard frigates.</p>
<p>At the start of the war Britain had started a slow upgrade to their own systems, including a new <a href="../../../q/f/_/QF_3.75_inch_AA_e294.html" title="QF 3.75 inch AA">QF 3.75 inch</a> (94 mm) gun in addition to their existing WWI-era 3 inch guns. Both were delivered with optical sighting systems for ranging. At the small-end of the scale a number of 20-mm designs were used, but testing showed, as Germany had discovered, that these weapons were of little use against modern aircraft.</p>
<p>They had already arranged license building of the 40 mm Bofors gun, and introduced these into service. These had the power to knock down aircraft of any size, yet were light enough to be mobile and easily swung. The gun became so important to the British war effort that they even produced a movie, <i>The Gun</i>, in order to make workers on the assembly line work harder. The Imperial measurement production drawings the British had developed were supplied to the Americans who produced their own (unlicensed) copy of the 40 mm at the start of the war—moving to licensed production in mid-1941.</p>

<p>Service trials demonstrated another problem however, that the problem of ranging and tracking the new high-speed targets was almost impossible—at shorter ranges the "lead" required (aiming in front of the target because it is moving) is so small that it can be done manually, and at very long ranges the apparent speed is so slow that simple mechanical slide rules could be used. For the ranges and speeds that the Bofors worked at, neither solution was good enough.</p>
<p>The solution was <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automation.html" title="Automation">automation</a>, in the form of a mechanical computer, the <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerrison_Predictor_aecc.html" title="Kerrison Predictor">Kerrison Predictor</a>. Operators kept it pointed at the target, and the Predictor then calculated the proper aim point automatically and displayed it as a pointer mounted on the gun. The gun operators simply followed the pointer and loaded the shells. The Kerrison was fairly simple, but it pointed the way to future generations which incorporated radar for ranging, and then tracking. Similar systems were introduced by Germany during the war, which also added radar ranging as the war progressed.</p>
<p>Although they receive little attention, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">US Army</a> anti-aircraft systems were actually quite competent. Their smaller tactical needs were filled with four <a href="../../../m/2/_/M2_Browning_machine_gun_1bc2.html" title="M2 Browning machine gun">M2</a> <a href="../../../2E/5/0/.50_BMG_0f0a.html" title=".50 BMG">.50 caliber</a> machine guns linked together (known as the “Quad Fifty”), which were often mounted on the back of a <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-track.html" title="Half-track">half-track</a> to form the <b>Half Track, M16 GMC, Anti-Aircraft</b>. Although of even less power than Germany's 20 mm systems, they were at least widely available. Their larger <a href="../../../9/0/_/90_mm_M3_gun_801d.html" title="90 mm M3 gun">90 mm M3 gun</a> would prove, as did the eighty-eight, to make an excellent anti-tank gun as well, and was widely used late in the war in this role. Finally just as the war was ending the new <a href="../../../1/2/0/120_mm_M1_gun_6ae6.html" title="120 mm M1 gun">120 mm M1 gun</a> <i>stratosphere gun</i> with an impressive 60,000 ft altitude capability was introduced. The 90 mm and 120 mm guns would continue to be used into the 1950s.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">US Navy</a> had also put some thought into the problem, and came up with the <a href="../../../1/2E/1/1.1__75_%2828mm%29_gun_1255.html" title="1.1&quot;/75 (28mm) gun">1.1"/75 (28mm) gun</a> to replace the inadequate <a href="../../../2E/5/0/.50_BMG_0f0a.html" title=".50 BMG">.50 caliber</a>.

The <a href="../../../5/22/2F/5__38_caliber_gun_82f2.html" title="5&quot;/38 caliber gun">5"/38 caliber gun</a> turned out to be an excellent anti-aircraft weapon, once the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proximity_fuze.html" title="Proximity fuze">Proximity fuze</a> had been perfected.</p>

Those which were in cities attacked by the Allied land forces became fortresses. Several in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> were some of the last buildings to fall to the Soviets during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Berlin_88d7.html" title="Battle of Berlin">Battle of Berlin</a> in 1945. The British built structures in the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Estuary_0901.html" title="Thames Estuary">Thames Estuary</a> and other tidal areas on which they based guns. After the war most were left to rot. Some were outside territorial waters, and had a second life in the 1960s as platforms for <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_Radio_in_Europe_7dea.html#England_.28From_International_Waters.29" title="Pirate Radio in Europe">pirate radio</a> stations.</p>
<p>During the war the first ventures into the use of rocket-powered missiles for shooting down aircraft began. The British started with unguided missiles, the 2 inch RP, fired in large numbers from <i>Z batteries</i>. The firing of one of these devices during an air raid is suspected to have caused the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethnal_Green_tube_station_d351.html#The_Bethnal_Green_disaster" title="Bethnal Green tube station">Bethnal Green Disaster</a> in 1943. By the end of the war the British had developed a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface-to-air_missile.html" title="Surface-to-air missile">surface-to-air missile</a>, Stooge, which would have been launched from <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships against the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">Kamikaze</a> attacks. The Germans invested heavily in various anti-aircraft missile projects as well, but none of these was ready for service before the war ended. In particular, the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasserfall_missile.html" title="Wasserfall missile">Wasserfall missile</a>, based on a scaled-down <a href="../../../v/-/2/V-2_rocket.html" title="V-2 rocket">V-2</a>, was particularly powerful and would have been a deadly weapon had the electronics ever matured.</p>
<p>One aspect of anti-aircraft defence was the use of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrage_balloon.html" title="Barrage balloon">barrage balloons</a> to act as physical obstacle initially to bomber aircraft over cities and later for ground attack aircraft over the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy invasion</a> fleets. The balloon, a simple blimp tethered to the ground, worked in two ways. Firstly it and the steel cable were a danger to any aircraft that tried to fly among them. Secondly, in avoiding the balloons, the bombers were forced up to a higher level which was more favourable for the guns. The barrage balloon was limited in application and direct success at bringing down aircraft—being largely immobile and passive weapons.</p>

A modern <a href="../../../s/a/-/SA-11_Gadfly_ecd2.html" title="SA-11 Gadfly">BUK M1 (NATO: SA-11 Gadfly)</a> anti-aircraft missile system</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Post-war analysis demonstrated that even with newer anti-aircraft systems employed by both sides, the vast majority of bombers reached their targets successfully, on the order of 90%. This was bad enough during the war, but the introduction of the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_bomb.html" title="Nuclear bomb">nuclear bomb</a> upset things considerably. Now even a single bomber reaching the target would be unacceptable.</p>
<p>The developments during WWII continued for a short time into the post-war period as well. In particular the US Army set up a huge air defense network around its larger cities based on radar-guided 90 mm and 120 mm guns. But given the general lack of success of guns against even propeller bombers, it was clear that any defense was going to have to rely almost entirely on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interceptor_aircraft.html" title="Interceptor aircraft">interceptor aircraft</a>. Despite this US efforts continued into the 1950s with the 75 mm <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skysweeper.html" title="Skysweeper">Skysweeper</a> system, an almost fully-automated system including the radar, computers, power, and auto-loading gun on a single powered platform. The Skysweeper replaced all smaller guns then in use in the Army, notably the 40 mm Bofors.</p>
<p>Things changed with the introduction of the guided missile. Although Germany had been desperate to introduce them during the war, none were ready for service, and British countermeasures were likely to defeat them even if they were. With a few years of development however, these systems started to mature into practical weapons. The US started an upgrade of their defenses using the <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike_Ajax_4da6.html" title="Nike Ajax">Nike Ajax</a> missile (based on the German Wasserfall), and soon the larger anti-aircraft guns disappeared. The same thing occurred in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> after the introduction of their <a href="../../../s/a/-/SA-2_Guideline_de50.html" title="SA-2 Guideline">SA-2 Guideline</a> systems.</p>
<p>As this process continued, the missile found itself being used for more and more of the roles formerly filled by guns. First to go were the large weapons, replaced by equally large missile systems of much higher performance. Smaller missiles soon followed, eventually becoming small enough to be mounted on armored cars and tank chassis. These started replacing, or at least supplanting, similar gun-based <a href="../../../s/p/a/SPAAG_2cc3.html" title="SPAAG">SPAAG</a> systems in the 1960s, and by the 1990s had replaced almost all such systems in modern armies. Even at the smallest scale, man-portable missiles, <a href="../../../m/a/n/MANPAD_8ec2.html" title="MANPAD">MANPADs</a> as they are known today, were introduced in the 1960s.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Future developments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Future developments</span></h3>
<p>If current trends continue, missiles will replace gun systems completely in "first line" service. Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles, such as the Dutch <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goalkeeper_CIWS_b8cb.html" title="Goalkeeper CIWS">Goalkeeper CIWS</a>, or the US <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_CIWS_ca8f.html" title="Phalanx CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a> which uses a 20 mm <a href="../../../m/6/1/M61_Vulcan_523f.html" title="M61 Vulcan">M61 Vulcan</a> gun firing at over 4,500 rounds per minute for last ditch anti-missile and anti-aircraft fighting. Even this formerly first-rate weapon is currently being replaced by a new missile system, the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Airframe_Missile_4bc3.html" title="Rolling Airframe Missile">Rolling Airframe Missile</a>, which is smaller, faster, and allows for mid-flight course correction (guidance) to ensure a hit.</p>
<p>Upsetting this development to all-missile systems is the current move to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stealth_aircraft.html" title="Stealth aircraft">stealth aircraft</a>. Long range missiles depend on long-range detection in order to provide significant lead. Stealth designs cut detection ranges so much that the aircraft is often never even seen, and when it is, often too late for an intercept. Systems for detection and tracking of stealthy aircraft are a major problem for anti-aircraft development.</p>
<p>Another potential weapon system for anti-aircraft use is the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a>. Although originally intended to be used in this role since the late 1960s, the most modern laser systems are currently reaching what could be considered "experimental usefulness". In particular the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_High_Energy_Laser_9808.html" title="Tactical High Energy Laser">Tactical High Energy Laser</a> can be used in the anti-aircraft and anti-missile role. If current developments continue, it is reasonable to suggest that lasers will play a major role in air defense starting in the next ten years.</p>

Often, the high-altitude long-range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level, where anti-aircraft guns can bring them down.

<p>Most modern air defence systems are fairly mobile. Even the larger systems tend to be mounted on trailers and are designed to be fairly quickly broken down or set up. In the past, this was not always the case. Early missile systems were cumbersome and required much infrastructure—many could not be moved at all. With the diversification of air defence there has been much more emphasis on mobility. Most modern systems are usually either self-propelled (i.e. guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis) or easily towed. Even systems which consist of many components (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Transporter_erector_launcher.html" title="Transporter erector launcher">transporter/erector/launchers</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radars</a>, command posts etc.) benefit from being mounted on a fleet of vehicles. In general, a fixed system can be identified, attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in places where it is not expected. Soviet systems especially concentrate on mobility, after the lessons learnt in the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam proxy war</a> between the USA and USSR. For more information on this part of the conflict, see <a href="../../../s/a/-/SA-2_Guideline_de50.html" title="SA-2 Guideline">SA-2 Guideline</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> (officially the DPRK) has inherited a lot of older Soviet equipment.

As tensions still exist on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK is so heavily militarised, their air-defence network is amongst the strongest of a non-superpower.

<p>The U.S. Air Force, in conjunction with the members of <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>, has developed significant tactics for air defence suppression. Dedicated weapons such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-radiation_missile.html" title="Anti-radiation missile">anti-radiation missiles</a> and advanced <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics_intelligence.html" title="Electronics intelligence">electronics intelligence</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_countermeasures.html" title="Electronic countermeasures">electronic countermeasures</a> platforms seek to suppress or negate the effectiveness of an opposing air-defence system. It is an arms race; as better jamming, countermeasures and anti-radiation weapons are developed, so are better SAM systems with <a href="../../../e/c/c/ECCM_ce39.html" title="ECCM">ECCM</a> capabilities and the ability to shoot down anti-radiation missiles and other munitions aimed at them or the targets they are defending. Now that Russia is beginning to offer top quality SAM systems for export, it is possible that the U.S. and NATO forces could face serious challenges in maintaining air superiority in future conflicts. This will mainly be determined by the effectiveness of these devices and tactics.</p>
