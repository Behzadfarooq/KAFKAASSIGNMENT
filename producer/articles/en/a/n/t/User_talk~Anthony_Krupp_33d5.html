<p>You're welcome. I would like to say I'm sorry for my butting in on an issue totally unrelated to myself or my own edits, as some might consider it bench-modding, but since I often try to do casual mediation on my own as a non-administrator, I feel an acute sympathy for people like Brenneman. In your case, you seem to be trying to be neutral, but the sheer number of cases where an admin attempts dispute resolution only to get blasted for their supposed POV on a subject they literally know nothing about is frightening. Brenneman is simply trying to follow established practice, but it only works if everyone cooperates. Otherwise, you start getting into Requests for Comment, mediation cabal, the Arbitration committee, harsh feelings on all sides and sometimes even bans... all over the ethnic identity of some West Asian religious group the average editor probably neither knows nor cares about.</p>
<p>Also, glad to see you have a sense a humour about this. If you liked that, you should probably read <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a> as well, it's a list of the dumbest edit wars ever and a great example of how not to act.

<dd>I'd like to second the appreciation for your input. A small thing: Try not to put your comment in the <i>midst</i> of someone else's, but instead right after. Otherwise, is someone responds to your response and so on, the initial bit can be set adrift from their signature.<br />

<p>Hello, I see you're adding references from MacMillan - which is great - but you shouldn't use the &lt;!-- CITATION --&gt; since no one can see them. Instead use &lt;ref&gt;CITATION HERE&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. I already cleaned up most of your previous citations. Anyway, happy editing. Keep up the excellent work!<a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENon-vandal_a155.html" title="User:Non-vandal">Non-vandal</a> 18:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the note, and for following after me and cleaning up my mess! We're actually not a bad team for editing this list, are we?<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 18:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would also like to let you know I've switched the citation method (see the talk page's history). Instead of &lt;ref&gt;CITATION HERE&lt;/ref&gt; use {{fn|M}} for 2nd ed of 2006 and {{fn|a}} for the one published in 1973 for all MacMillan references you find for names. This should make citing all the easier since you don't have to provide so much information and do a whole lot of typing.<a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENon-vandal_a155.html" title="User:Non-vandal">Non-vandal</a> 19:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings, regarding your cut of the word persian from the infobox. Why would we cut away thousands of years of persian history the Parsis had, because a user like fullstop think so. My friend like i mentioned in the parsi talk the encyclopedia Britannnica article about the parsis which fullstop himself provided says this: <i>The Parsis, whose name means “Persians,” are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims.</i> Of cource they are related to the Persians, the word itself means Persian, i also think you should change the head of the article from: <i>the people who emigrated to india</i> to: <i>the persians who emigrated to india</i>. I know you don't want it to get more messed up than it is, but he can't argue with facts and sources, if he refuses to cooperate he will be blocked. We don't have to satisfy his needs to change the article as he wants it. --<b><a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpahbod_8cce.html" title="User:Spahbod"><font color="Gold">S</font><font color="Gold">p</font><font color="yellow">a</font><font color="yellow">h</font><font color="yellow">b</font><font color="gold">o</font><font color="Gold">d</font></a></b> <b><font color="gold">☼</font></b> 18:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Request granted; see below section struck through.</p>
<p><s>On <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EList_guideline_70f2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:List guideline">Wikipedia_talk:List_guideline</a> (section 10), you state that I have done four things: (1) "You are skipping the most important step of the process of creating guidelines: that of building consensus." (2) "You are trying to apply the process in reverse: requiring the building of consensus to remove the changes you've made to the guideline page." (3) "...you keep going straight to the guideline page with your changes" and (4) "you keep violating WP:POV." You also claim that "[y]our actions will not survive the scrutiny of several administrators." Given that I have made one edit to the guideline page, I am especially unsure what to do with your third claim that I "keep going straight to the guideline page." And I am sure that several administrators might also have that question.</s></p>
<p><s>Please refer to evidence for your claims, so that I may better understand them. You may do so here, on my talk page, or if you wish, on the List guideline talk page. I have replied to you here, rather than on the List guideline talk page, because this issue is not relevant to the work of discussing list guidelines. I am still willing to assume good faith in your case, but am perplexed by your accusations.

<p>I noticed you removed one of the paragraphs in question on the list guideline page. My question is, knowing that consensus has yet to be reached concerning any of them, why did you not remove the others? I too am willing to assume good faith in your actions, but I am perplexed by your failure to fully support the concensus-building process in this circumstance. The appropriate thing to have done was to remove the items and let the consensus-building process proceed entirely on the talk page. I am curious why you did not feel it was your responsibility to do so.

<dd>I left the other paragraphs for two reasons. One, although you had removed them, another user reverted, pointing out that they can stay if disputed. I don't know if that's proper or not, but didn't want to act boldly not knowing the best thing to do. And two, since I regard the section in question as useful, I would certainly not be inclined to remove them anyway. Of course I would do so, if I were sure of the procedure. But looking over the talk page and rereading the sections, I noticed two things: (1) the identitarian paragraph was awful for several reasons, including ones you had articulated, and therefore I felt justified in removing it entirely (though it is still legible on the Talk page, in case anyone wants to plea for its existence), and (2) the remaining paragraphs seemed to me still a good idea in principle, but perhaps in need of trimming. Hence the proposals for new wording on the Talk page.</dd>
<dd>In short, then, I removed one contested paragraph, and made positive suggestions to improve two others. I hope that clarifies things. Best,--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 05:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Indeed, a fourth voice would be quite welcome. Li3crmp 20:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point of the initial request is 'does the third paragraph of Popular misconceptions state that it is a popular misconception that Kant was unreadable" and is this verifiable? Support for the claim that he is unreadable references Herder and Hamann's reference to the German text. Support for the popular misconception is that it common among students that he isn't (talk page). In my experience this is quite the contrary of the opinion of students and professors. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 20:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will try to reduce the level of attacks you find personal and mysogynist, Anthony, but please note that these responses were exclusively directed at one specific attack from one specific user. The "mysogyny" you decry was at least in part an attempt to defuse through humor, so I do request that you not get your pantyhose in too much of a tangle, while I will look to my own nylons and try, like Caliban, to seek for grace hereafter.</dd>
<dd>My goal in Influence is simple: to avoid confusing the tyro who reads repeatedly about the way in which, in philosophy, tweedledum boldly went where no man had ever gone before and awoke Humanity from its dogmatic slumber...only to find that tweedledee totally "refuted" him thereafter.</dd>
<dd>We need to be specific, in Influence, about the way in which Kant changed philosophy.</dd>
<dd>It is a mistake to characterise any epoch of philosophy as an age of dogmatism characterised by an absence of self-criticism. Such ages existed (Merovingian France comes to mind) but they are characterized by an absence of people we call philosophers.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 03:15, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dr. Krupp, with all due respect, I think you're making a common mistake I see in academia: to assume that individual phrases, taken out of context and tone, can be used to make conclusions about something so complicated as a mysogynistic personality. Here, academia, in a laudable desire to be politically correct, coupled with an equally laudable desire to be procedurally fair, becomes in a less laudable fashion a bureaucratic machine, and the bureaucratic machine can't be sensitive to context and tone, such as in the attack on an individual for using the adjective "niggardly" because of an accident in sound.</dd>
<dd>I was confronted by a difficult individual who as usual was airing what seemed to be a cold anger, and I have many years of experience in dealing with such online situations. Here my strategy was humorously using the very idea that a user, probably male, might be wearing pantyhouse or in menopause and by so doing I invited him into the men's hut of men confident enough in themselves to use such "mysogynist" language. I assumed to his credit that he could parse the tone, as it were, assuming not the worst but the best about an individual.</dd>
<dd>In fine, I am not a jerk and I don't like speaking to the jerk in others. I was instead concerned that, first of all, Kant's style isn't addressed and secondly that it is jejune to say that before any philosopher in the canon except perhaps Heraclitus there were no philosophers (criticism and self-criticism being definitional of philosophy as opposed to haruspication).</dd>
<dd>This as I have said leads to the false perception of philosophy as being as useful in the so-called real world as one left tit, if you'll forgive the simile.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 04:19, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dude, stop going through all my pages and editing them just because I wrote them. I am not a vandal. On the Foucault page, you deleted stuff that IS sourced--had you read the talk page, you would have seen that, and that that was why it stayed. The problem is that you don't question the morals of the philosophers you study--so one claim might be true, another might not be. I am not a vandal. I am a conservative, and I intend to edit these pages trying to represent a neutral POV--i.e., not a liberal or a Marxist one. What I am is pesky, and I acknowledge that--but I only want people to read the verifiable truth--not just any truth, but objective truth. Everybody's truth. Now, the fact there was an investigation into Foucault's life--they should be told of Chomsky's claim too, that F. was completely amoral. When you present the glossy theory, people don't get that. Please don't cherry pick my pages--you aren't going to find any system of misconduct.

<p>I would value your input on a topic I have raised at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cff4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons</a>. Specifically, I have frequently encountered a set of issues on biographies of academics that are somewhat narrower and more specific than for generic "biographies of living persons". I am thinking that it might be time to propose a guideline about this, or maybe just an essay on the topic. But before I try to float that, I'm interested in what you think.</p>
<p>P.S. I reverted <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> to Jossi's last version that contained the comments about criteria. I think your proposal on the talk page is perfectly good, and I would not have any broad problem with a change in wording. But I think it is important to retain <i>something</i> on the guideline in the meanwhile. Leaving the issue entirely blank potentially lets (or encourages) readers to miss an important area of concern in the interregnum between versions of the wording. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 05:21, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally hear you about the guideline. There's a recent history on the page that explains why that particular guideline is missing from the article: it hadn't reached consensus, so I'm told. That's why I've been trying desperately, recently, to build a better version that will reach consensus, because I think the business about criteria was the best thing on the guideline. I definitely want some version of it back. Will definitely look into your proposal within a day or two. (Real life beckons meanwhile.)

<dd>I haven't seen the discussion you mention, but I can bet in advance that the not-cosensus means "Francis Schonken doesn't like it". He's been enormously hostile to the idea of cautioning editors about using criteria for lists since Jossi and I first started <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTV_bd6b.html" title="WP:LISTV">WP:LISTV</a>. I haven't the foggiest idea why, and none of his stated concerns make the slightest sense to me.

<dd>Ah, I see. Well, from my own experience, users Francis Schonken and PolarDeluge have been the most conservative regarding what they perceive to be listcreep. In my experience, I've found that their objections -- when I've understood them; I know that Schonken is Swiss, so there may be a language barrier with which I can greatly empathize, having tried to edit some on the German wikipedia myself -- contained some good cautionary points. Actually, my current proposal on <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> takes several of their concerns into consideration, and I do think it's a much better guideline than what is currently in place, due to my thinking about their objections. So I suppose I remain cautiously optimistic. But I hear what you're saying, and it sounds like you have more battle scars than I do. Complete empathy. All of this said, I will be prepared for arbitration, should it prove necessary. That is, if it appears to me (it does not yet) that a particular user is being an obstructionist for no good reason, then of course I'll regard them as uninterested in <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> and not worth talking to.

<p>Against all intention, Kmaguir1 has had a very positive effect with his AfD's. I had only barely heard of Raphael Samuel before today; Danny Yee I was obviously familiar with having created the article. But in response to what I think were mean-spirited AfD nominations, I was pushed to greatly expand and improve both articles. In fact, I sort of feel guilty now that I hadn't known more about Samuel, who seems really quite interesting, and not merely "sort-of like E.P.Thompson". <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 06:39, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

That is, an adversary, one who creates obstacles. Such that the good people can show their strength, and be better than before. Something like that. Examples in Job, of course, and more recently in Goethe's Faust. Mephistophiles refers to himself as the spirit who wills evil and always does good.

<p>This line was, of course, hilarious: <i>Still not seeing notability. There are tons of people who have 13 books out no one's every heard of who do not belong on wikipedia, and tons of people who started an academic journal who are not on here.-Kmaguir1</i> Though I suppose if you think sufficiently literally, it might be true. An American ton is 2000 lbs. A moderately heavy man might weight 200 lbs, a light woman 100 lbs (not that gender bimorphism is <i>that</i> huge in humans). Let's split the difference, and say one academic weighs 150 lbs. So Kmaguir1 is purporting that we've failed to cover 13 highly-published academics on the English Wikipedia... well, that's one ton, for "tons" I guess it would be 26+ writers. Still, that sounds plausible enough... there are certainly gaps. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 06:46, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The creator is starting to get a little hostile, attacking me for proposing the article be deleted for its' lack of citation. He repeatedly refuses to cite where he obtained the information for the article and is starting to insinuate I'm trying to be disruptive or that I'm persecuting another religion (The Pillar of Fire Church is a Christian Church and I too am a Christian, so this is very absurd.)

<p>Thanks for your note. I had noticed the rfc on Kmaguir1, and was careful to keep my changes to those that I thought would almost unambiguously improve the bell hooks article. Kmaguirl, whatever his or her failings, is probably right that the article should mention public criticisms of hooks. It took only 30 seconds of literature searches to see that material criticisms have been published and, frankly, given the microscopic circulation of most academic journals and the rather wide exposure given to somebody like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a>, I would not be surprised if more people have heard criticisms of hooks than have ever heard her praised.</p>
<p>I have no interest in the political or ad hominem part of the debate -- are her defenders ideologues? Is kmaguir1 a nutcase?

<p>I am a Christian, I am not a relativist or universalist by any means. I firmly believe the Christian view concerning the Bible is right, thus what you purport about Satan or (a) satan is an alternate view in my eyes, not the <i>correct</i> view. I mean no insult when I say this, and I do understand what you mean and are comming from, I just don't accept it in the least.

<dd>I know you're a Calvinist, but thanks for adding this note. What I mean to say is that even if you disagree with the function of the satan in Job, you should be capable of understanding that this was my frame of reference in using the term. That is, you should not misunderstand me to have ever said that Kmaguir1 was Lucifer, i.e. Satan with a capital S. Of course you can believe that the satan in Job is identical to the Satan of the NT. I'm simply saying that you can disagree about my understanding of the identity or non-identity of the two, but should not assume that I insulted Kmaguir1 according to your and his understanding of this identity. That's all. Actually, I'm pretty sure you 'get it.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I really did have this in mind: in Hebrew, I'm told, the term satan is always accompanied with an indefinite or definite article, since the term is the name for a job, that of prosecutor or adversary, much like Christ was once the name for another job, that of redeemer. In early Christianity, both job names became the <i>proper names</i> Satan and Christ.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, as long as we're not derailing from the RfC page, I'd be interested in your take on one thing. As far as I can make sense of such things, the orthodox Christian view (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist) of Satan is that he fell early on and has been in Hell ever since. Is this right? If so, I was wondering how you make sense of the book of Job, where we learn that the satan waltzed into Heaven along with the other sons of light, and had a fairly friendly debate with God about Job, before they both bet on his faith. I'm not trying to convince you of anything: I'm legitimately interested in knowing how a Calvinist would explain this. I've been writing a bit about 17th and 18th century Calvinists and Jansenists in the book I'm completing, and have been more interested in discussions of infant baptism than anything else, but questions of heaven and hell are of course central to these discussions. Anyway, I'd appreciate any light you can throw on this. Best,--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 22:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Need for namecalling? Editing vs. vandalizing <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Hurricanes_football_fb36.html" title="Miami Hurricanes football">Miami Hurricanes football</a></b>: Removing what looks to me like a peacock phrase ("all-time") is called editing, not vandalizing. I explained the change and have yet to receive a civil counter-reply. Instead, you resort to name-calling and threats. Of course the score is 29-21. My question is why you are calling this "the all-time advantage." It sounds like boosterism. Is there some other reason? Explain that, and I'll drop that particular edit. And you can use the article talk page to do so, which is how editing on wikipedia works. You might familiarize yourself with wikipedia policies on assuming good faith, as well as on peacock terms. Have a nice day. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 13:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe you should take a look at the definition of "namecalling," as I have yet to call you a name. It also wouldn't be a bad idea if you familiarized yourself with the concept of peacock terms. Referring to a 29-21 advantage in the all-time series between Miami and Florida State is hardly a peacock phrase. Perhaps you're new to the sports world, but the historical series between two teams is typically called the all-time series, and the team that holds the edge holds the "all-time advantage" <a href="http://seminoles.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/042705aac.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seminoles.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/042705aac.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://utahstateaggies.cstv.com/genrel/020303aaa.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://utahstateaggies.cstv.com/genrel/020303aaa.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&amp;change_well_id=2&amp;url_article_id=6119" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&amp;change_well_id=2&amp;url_article_id=6119" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=23188&amp;pid=1288" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=23188&amp;pid=1288" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.d3football.com/pressreleases.php?release=1471" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.d3football.com/pressreleases.php?release=1471" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> You've been warned.

<dd>You used a verb (vandalizing) rather than a noun (vandal), but you still failed to assume good faith. Your explanation that a historical series is typically called the all-time series completely satisfies me. Thanks for (finally) explaining that. Your rude statement ("You've been warned") is uncalled for, given that I specifically asked you to please explain the term. Your threat is empty, since I have never vandalized that page. People who throw around terms as loosely as you do tend not to fare well here. Good luck with that. -<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 18:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyone reasonable who bothers to look at the edits will realize I made a good faith but mistaken attempt to edit the page. That reasonable person will also see that I asked for information about the edit, and after receiving it, left it alone. And my editing history speaks for itself. I have lost interest in your chest-thumping, and will no longer respond to your overtures. I trust we'll both go back to just working to improve wikipedia.
