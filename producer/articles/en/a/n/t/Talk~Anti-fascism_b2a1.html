This article is seriously biased. Article says "Although many moderate right-wing people are anti-racist and oppose fascism, they are not considered "antifascists" as they do not organize themselves in specific groups dedicated to the antifascist struggle."</p>
<p>I just finished an article about one armed antifascist organization <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Lithuanian_Detachment_bfa8.html" title="Local Lithuanian Detachment">Local Lithuanian Detachment</a> which was not socialist but was actively resisting fascists during the WW2. Lithuanian nonsocialist self government during the ww2 successfully sabotaged Fascist mobilization.</p>
<p>References are biased as well. "fascism will always be an element of capitalism, especially in times of economical crisis, and destruction of fascism is impossible without destruction of capitalism"? Come on - Fascists are socialists. "To be a socialist", said Goebbels, "is to submit the I to the thou; socialism is sacrificing the individual to the whole." <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 17:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article can surely be improved, but taking part in the Resistance movements against the Nazis during WWII is not necessarily an antifascist act. As the article points out, it may be just because of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_d%27Astier_de_la_Vigerie_3d8b.html" title="Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie">Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie</a>, member of the <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Fran%C3%A7aise_3eef.html" title="Action Française">Action Française</a></i> far right and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterrevolutionary.html" title="Counterrevolutionary">counterrevolutionary</a> movement, who may have taken part in the <i><a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Cagoule_038e.html" title="La Cagoule">La Cagoule</a></i> terrorist fascist group, participated in the Resistance. That's a fascist fighting for his country against the German invaders. I wouldn't precisely considered him "antifascism". Antifascism is an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>, and it has historically been associated with the socialist movement in the most broad sense of the way, and in particular with the anarchists (the social-democrats, while sharing antifascist values, like any left-wing person, are rarely considered to be "antifascists", although they may be "antiracists": but being "antiracist" is not an ideology, it doesn't ask for specific <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a>; most of the communists were antifascists, although they've had some troubles with Staline's directives, when he was fighting trotskyism...) <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 18:00, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To cite the odd right winger in the French resistance is to miss the point. the French far right by and large sided with Vichy, thus making them be seen as collaborationists by most French people. The Resistance was preodominantly leftist orientated, with the communists forming the largest single group. For them, the resistance was defined an antifascist, meaning not only anti-German, but also anti-Vichy and anti the far right Leagues, which they had fought against in the Popular Front era before the war.</p>
<p>I am not impressed with this article. It should be discussing the historical importance of anti-facism and not trying to define not very important modern antifa ideology. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorney_3c50.html" title="User:Jdorney">Jdorney</a> 21:09, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article says: "In a broader sense of the term, anti-fascism as shared by many left-wing people also includes opposing homophobia, sexism, racism and the restriction of civil liberties" yet later article glorifies Soviet army as antifascist and attacks people who were fighting against Soviet imperialism and soviet totalitarism. Do you really think Soviets were not racist, did not restrict civil liberties or were not militarist? <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 17:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Legionas I understand your strong feelings against the Soviets; however, it is difficult claiming that Soviets = fascists.

<dd>According to the definition at the start of article Soviets were not antifascists, so this link on Estonian monument should go. Link to atrocities in USSR should also go as this site describes soviet -german war as antifascist, which is again incorrect according to definition that antifascism is against "racism and the restriction of civil liberties". Soviet Union was not paradise of civil liberties. If non-socialists are not regarded as antifascists despite their opposition to fascists, communists should not be regarded as antifascists as well. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 18:23, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Armia Krajowa wasn't socialist or anarchist. I would say it would be more correct to call "antifascists" all people and movements (socialists or not) opposing fascism, this would obviously exclude fascists themselves like that guy Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie.</p>

<p>The line that says that anti-fascists are mostly anarchists is ridiculous. This is only true to any degree in Spain during the first year of the civil war. The reality is that the most active and militant anti-fascists in the 30s and 40s were communists.</p>
<p>This is not to say that they respected democracy inherently, or that the Soviet Union was a democracy or anything like that, but the simple answer to the question, "who opposed fascism through force of arms and politically in the 30 and 40s"? is the communists. See Germany, Spain, France Italy, Yugoslavia and elsewhere for examples.</p>
<p>Maybe the modern antifa groups are predominantly anarchist, though I would suspect there are many different leftists in them, but when anti-fascism was a burning question, it was the communists that were to the forefront in it.</p>
<p>In fact, it has been argued that anti-fascist Popular Fronts o the 30s and 40s were basically means for communist infiltration of mass political movements, but that is another argument.</p>

<p>I agree that it seems a bit broad to categorise antifascists as <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchists.html" title="Anarchists">anarchists</a>. I think that this arises from a definitional problem. The article needs to make clearer that there is a qualitative difference between "a member of the antifascist movement" and "someone who opposes <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>". Most mainstream political groups in all Western countries are opposed to fascism, but they could not all be categorised as antifascist. In the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (where I live), it's true that there's no clear definition of "antifascist" as opposed to "someone who doesn't support fascism", but on my visits to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> I've encountered a political movement, popular among students and other young people, that categorises itself as "antifascist". This movement is a <a href="../../../l/e/f/Leftist.html" title="Leftist">leftist</a> movement (in the broad sense) and many of its members have connections to socialist or left-wing political parties. As such, the article introduction needs to spell out the fact that there are two possible definitions of the word "antifascist".</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) The broad definition: someone who is opposed to fascism. This would include all those groups, whether leftist or rightist, that were involved in anti-<a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> resistance during WWII.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) The specific definition: a member of an antifascist movement, i.e. a movement that specifically exists to combat fascism and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultranationalism.html" title="Ultranationalism">ultranationalism</a>. Such movements are left-wing in character.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no one objects, I will rewrite parts of the article to reflect this distinction. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 11:23, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but even in the "Antifascist movement" the most important players in the 30s and 40s were communists, not anarchists. Even in modern antifa circles anarchists are probably not a majority. Btw, there is also an antifascist movement in the UK, albeit small, see <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Action_a02b.html" title="Red Action">Red Action</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Fascist_Action_b419.html" title="Anti-Fascist Action">Anti-Fascist Action</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Anti-Nazi League">Anti-Nazi League</a> etc.</dd>

<li>I made several improvements. There was a huge amount of repetitive sentences, bad English translations, and content that was largely irrelevant to the main topic. I deleted any name on the lists that didn't have a link to a Wikipedia article, because there's no way to verify who the group or person is. I also deleted the list of books and songs, because there was only one entry in the first, and two entries in the second. Either they should be full lists, or not be included at all.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 22:09, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Spylab</li>

<p>Much as I love most of those bands, this seems like a rather long list, including some pretty obscure bands.

<ul>
<li>I agree that the list should only include the most notable bands, meaning most famous, influential, or most involved in anti-fascist causes. Some of those bands, while having anti-fascist beliefs, don't make anti-fascism a defining factor of their band (such as having many songs against fascism, speaking out against fascism in interviews and at concerts, playing at anti-fascist festivals and having songs on anti-facist compilation albums). Some of the bands are more focussed on anarchism or another ideology, with anti-fascism just as a by-product.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 23:07, 8 August 2006 (UTC)Spylab</li>

<dd>That's understandable. I do think Leftover Crack (and by extention, possibly Choking Victim) should stay on though, since they are pretty notable (at least from what I can tell, but my idea of music notability is all screwed up from listening to too much underground stuff). Anyway, the back cover of "Fuck World Trade" specifically says "Leftover Crack is an Anti-Racist, Anti-Sexist, Anti-Homophobic and Anti-Fascist organization". If we have to remove one to balance it out, I'd say get rid of Naked Aggression. Even though I <i>love</i> them, they probably aren't as notable as Leftover Crack. Also, UK Subs are also really notable IMO, and they do have the song "Nazi Cunts". Subhumans are also very notable (my mom has even heard of them, which shocked me). I'm not sure if they have any specifically anti-fascist songs, but there are lots of anti-fascist themes (Subvert City being a good example). Another band that might be removed is Blaggers ITA, since I don't think they're very well known. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 05:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Ok. If you (or anyone else) think certain musicians on the list should be added or deleted, and have a good reason, go ahead. I just wanted to get the ball rolling. However, Blaggers ITA should stay for sure. They may not be well-known in The USA, but they were one of the most militant anti-fascist bands I can think of, in word and in action. They were involved with the group Anti-Fascist Action in Britain; band members have been in direct confrontations with neo-Nazis; they spoke out against fascists in interviews; have played benefit concerts for anti-fascist causes; and have had songs on many anti-fascist compilations. Things like that are way more relevant than just a few token lyrics against racism. That gets back to the whole definition of an anti-fascist vs someone who is just personally against racism or fascism. I don't know a lot about every single band that is, or was, on the list, so that's where a group effort comes into play. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a>Spylab</li>

<p>The categories "individuals" and "musicians" do not provide a clear, meaningful distinction. (By the way, can't individuals be musicians?) The TRUE distinction that I want to bring to the attention of the editors of this section separates, on the one hand, those who actually devoted their lives to anti-fascism, sometimes dying for their cause, and, on the other hand, those who made anti-fascist statements at one time or another. Whether or not they are an individual, a musician, or an individual musician, is irrelevant to this question. The criteria that should apply for inclusion are: 1) how important was the person to the anti-fascist movement? 2) how important was anti-fascism to the life and work of the person? I would weigh the first question to be more important than the second. As far as whether or not to categorize the list by profession or nationality, I tend to think that the latter is of greater importance for your purposes, but that really matters less to me than the merits of those listed.</p>
<p>I make this suggestion not to disparage your work, but to point out that there is significant room for improvement here.</p>

<dd>I completely understand Adam's point. I think there is indeed room for improvement, and I welcome other views on the musicians list. I do think, though, that music has been extremely important in the anti-fascist movement. The Clash, for example, were important in creating the anti-fascist popular culture movement that helped end the late 1970s rise of the National Front in the UK. Perhaps only a small list of bands/musicians should be given here, based on Adam's question 1 criterion (perhaps merged with list of "individuals" and maybe a seperate page can be created for a longer list of anti-fascist bands/musicians, whether or not they were quite so important to the movement? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 11:52, 2 January 2007 (UTC) (And, as per Spylab above, Blaggers ITA should certainly stay! <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 11:53, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- Thus, antifascism as a distinct theory and practice is historically limited to the socialist movement, although with the emergence of new, alternative political movements (the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greens.html" title="Greens">Greens</a> being only one of them), the antifascism tradition of the socialist movement may expands itself to other left-wing people. Although many moderate <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a> people are <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-racist.html" title="Anti-racist">anti-racist</a> and oppose fascism, they are not considered "antifascists" as they do not organize themselves in specific groups dedicated to the antifascist struggle. - - While violent or <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant.html" title="Militant">militant</a> anti-fascism does occur, the movement may also be <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-violent.html" title="Non-violent">non-violent</a>; being an anti-fascist is not necessarily to "fight" fascism with violence, although violence did play an important role in the 1920s and the 1930s, when antifascists were confronted to aggressive <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">far right</a> leagues, such as the <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Fran%C3%A7aise_3eef.html" title="Action Française">Action Française</a></i> royalist movement in France, which dominated the <i><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartier_latin.html" title="Quartier latin">Quartier latin</a></i> students' neighborhood (although royalist, the Action Française counted members such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georges_Valois_88c9.html" title="Georges Valois">Georges Valois</a> who would later found the <i><a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisceau.html" title="Faisceau">Faisceau</a></i> fascist movement, created on the model of the Italian <i><a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascio.html" title="Fascio">Fascio</a></i>). In Italy in the 1920s, antifascists had to struggle against the violent <i><a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadristi.html" title="Squadristi">squadristi</a></i>, while in Germany they were confronted to the <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freikorps.html" title="Freikorps">Freikorps</a></i>.

Thus, pre-World War II history explains why anti-fascism has been associated with violence. - - However, many <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifa.html" title="Antifa">antifa</a> activists consider today that violence is not justified, since fascists don't represent, in most countries, a massive physical threat. They argue that they should be fought intellectually. However, others disagree, and point out that <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinheads.html" title="Skinheads">skinheads</a> pose a real threat in some neighborhoods, and have sometimes killed people. These antifascists claim that <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-defense.html" title="Self-defense">self-defense</a> is necessary, because they observe that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a> doesn't defends equally the population of specific neighborhoods.

<li>One of the major problems (besides the poor writing quality) is that it repeats a lot of content that is already in the article, but with different wording. The section above even repeats itself a few times. I'm pretty sure this section is an old version of the article before it was copy edited. Also, the list of groups at the end of the section are already in the links section, and there is nothing in the section above that gives any information about the groups beyond their names. Finally, the last sentence is inaccurate. The original skinheads weren't very political, and it would be a stretch to generalize them as all being anti-fascist (in terms of being politically active against fascism). Also, I dispute the statement that the majority of skinheads now are neo-Nazis. Maybe they have been in certain times and places (perhaps 1980s London and present-day Russia for example), but not when you look at the worldwide picture. There will never be any accurate statistics on that, and it would be nearly impossible to verify the numbers either way.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 12:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
