<p>1,411 Words Michael Kendall 8-3 Anthrax</p>
<pre>
       Anthrax, a disease that has been used in biological warfare before, and very recently, in 2001, is much more than a weapon, but a very deadly disease that has many different forms.
</pre>
<p>Anthrax has been in existent for a very long time, but it was first shown as a disease in 1877, by Robert Koch who grew anthrax in a pure culture. He also demonstrated anthrax’s ability to produce endospores. Anthrax is endemic in only certain parts of the world, South America, Central America, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. It is really in agricultural areas, and undeveloped regions. The first major documented outbreak of anthrax took place in the 1300’s in Germany, then there was another outbreak of anthrax in the 1600’s in Russia. Bacillus anthracis was described in 1850 by a French parasitologist named Davaine. He recognized the repeated epidemics in Europe and Asia. Because anthrax travels in spores, it could kill of a farm of animals, then the farm would be abandoned. The spores can stay affective for many decades. Then, more than seventy years later a farmer would plow the field, forgetting that it was a grave site of animals killed by anthrax. The spores would then kill the new animals repeating the epidemic. This cycle could repeat many times. Anthrax was the first ever bacteria to be shown to cause a disease, which turned out to be a fatal disease. It was proved to be the first bacteria to cause a disease in 1877 by Robert Koch. In May of 1881, Louis Pasteur performed a public demonstration showing his vaccine he had made for anthrax, showing it on sheep. The vaccine worked. There are a few ways to get anthrax, one is to have contact with and infected animal, or an animal product from an infected animal. You can also get anthrax from inhaling anthrax spores, swallowing spores, or if the spores infect a sore or cut in your skin. If unopened skin gets in contact with anthrax spores all you have to do is wash the spores off with soap and water. There are 89 different strains of anthrax that humans no about, in other words there are 89 different known types of anthrax that humans have discovered. The disease is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The three main forms of anthrax that humans can get are called inhalational, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal or intestinal. Inhalational is caused by breathing in spores. Cutaneous is caused by the spores infecting a humans skin. Gastrointestinal or intestinal anthrax is caused by swallowing the spores, or eating meat that contains spores or is infected with anthrax. If you get inhalational or pulmonary anthrax the first symptom will probably be getting the common cold. After a few days the cold will probably progress into severe breathing problems and shock. Inhalational anthrax is usually deadly. So if a common cold turns into a severe condition it could be anthrax, although it would be very rare. The mortality rate for inhalational anthrax or pulmonary anthrax is nearly 100%. A lethal case would result from inhaling 10,000-20,000 spores. This form of anthrax is also known as Woolsorters’ disease. It is also known as Woolsorters’ disease because when sorting wool it is the most common way to get anthrax. If you get cutaneous (skin) anthrax the first sign would be a raised, itchy bump that looks like a bug bite. Within 1 or 2 days the bump will turn into a vesicle, and then an ulcer that doesn’t hurt. The middle of the ulcer has a black necrotic, or dead area. Most cases of anthrax in humans are cutaneous anthrax and only about 20% of the cases are fatal, and when treated it is rarely fatal. Gastrointestinal or intestinal anthrax is a form of anthrax that is in a human’s intestines or stomach. Some symptoms are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and fever. After those symptoms it causes vomiting blood, and sever bloody diarrhea. You get gastrointestinal or intestinal anthrax by eating infected food. Everything goes by very rapidly and if untreated it is usually fatal. The treatment for someone who has inhalational anthrax is usually not very effective. It is usually very effective only if it is initiated in less that a day since the encounter with anthrax and before any symptoms appear. The antibiotic is called antibiotic prophylaxis, and it is very crucial to save lives in cases of inhalational anthrax. Other treatments for anthrax infections contain large amounts of antibiotics including: penicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, doxycycline, and vancomycin. Anthrax can be prevented in a few ways. A simple way is to try to avoid contact with herds of animals and with livestock. You should also try to avoid eating undercooked meat, and meat that hasn’t been properly cooked and slaughtered. It is also possible to prevent anthrax by vaccinating animals. The anthrax vaccine has been cleared for use on humans, too. It is reportedly 93% successful. Recently there have been many attempts to form new drugs against anthrax. The antibiotics people are trying to form would not only attack the bacillus bacteria, it would also attack the toxic protein that anthrax releases into the bloodstream of an infected person. Anthrax infections mostly take place in just herbivores, mostly in cattle, chickens, sheep, goats, antelopes, and camels. People, who spend lots of time with chickens, have been known to get anthrax from an infected chicken. When anthrax is inside of an animal’s body it can’t make new spores, because there is no oxygen, which it need to form more spores. The spores can survive very harsh winters, surviving many decades. Animals usually get anthrax by eating spores, or organisms that are infected with a form of anthrax, inhaling spores, or if spores get in contact with a cut or an opening in the skin. Anthrax is not known to be able to spread from person to person. The reason that anthrax is very known in the world is because it has been used in biological warfare. In 1979, some anthrax spores were accidentally released from a military facility in the Soviet Union. It caused the deaths of 68 people. In the 1990’s Russia announced it would stop its biological weapons program. The most known use of anthrax as a biological weapon happened in 2001. On September 18, 2001, one week after the attacks on the World Trade Centers in New York City, it is believed that five letters were sent to NBC News, CBS News, the New York Post, and ABC News, all in New York and one letter to the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. at West Palm Beach, in Florida. The only letters that were found were the ones sent to the New York Post and to NBC News. They were all postmarked from Trenton, N.J. There were two more anthrax letters that were also postmarked from Trenton, N.J., they were dated October 9, 2001. October 9 was three weeks after the first letters. This time they were sent to two Democratic Senators. Patrick Leahy, from Vermont, and Tom Daschle from South Dakota. The anthrax spores in these letters were more pure, and much more like powder. It was described as “weaponized” or “weapon grade” anthrax. The letter sent to Daschle was opened on October 15, by an aide, and the government mail service was shut down. The letter sent to Leahy was misdirected because of the Zip code being misread, and mailed to Sterling, Virginia. The anthrax letters infected twenty-two people. Eleven of the cases were the deadly inhalation type of anthrax. Five people died from inhalation anthrax. One person, Robert Stevens, from the letter sent to the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. at West Palm Beach, Florida. Two mail men died, Thomas Morris Jr. and Joseph Curseen, who were employees at the Brentwood post office in Washington, D.C. There were two more deaths that died from anthrax from and unknown source. Kathy Nguyen, from New York City, and Ottilie Lundren, who was 94 years old from Oxford, Connecticut. Still they don’t know who was doing the anthrax attacks in 2001, but we do know that it was terrorists using biological warfare. B. anthracis, the first bacteria ever to cause a disease would probably have been better off never being discovered, after all the horrible things it can do, including biological warfare.</p>

<p><br />
If everything was destroyed in 1969 then where did the supplies for Iraq come from? Was Nixon ignored by some group - or was he lying to the public? Wasn't anthrax discontinued because it makes a very poor weapon?</p>
<p>Anthrax made up a small portion of the US stockpile by 1969, and was destroyed as scheduled. It was never standardized because its lethal dose was extracted from animal data without certainty, and laboratory/plant expereince did not favor a reputation as an effective agent.</p>
<p>Iraq obtained their seed stock of anthrax from public sources. Not only is anthrax readily available from natural out breaks with cattle, but it is also available to researchers (even internationally) through microbial collection establisments. Iraq also constructed plants to mass produce the biological from the seed stock quantities into high capacity.</p>

<p>I'm going to try to find a copy of my old NBCD lesson plans: I remember that anthrax is one of those bacteria not destroyed by boiling; as a matter of fact, if anthrax is introducede to a water supply, boiling the water <i>increases</i> its lethalness: it becomes an aerosol and is inhaled rather than ingested. I'll try to find the reference, but if anyone can beat me to the punch, I won't cry. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">SigPig</a> 03:31, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnthrax_92f3.html" title="Edit section: Four episodes of Anthrax use 1918-2000">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Four episodes of Anthrax use 1918-2000</span></h2>
<p>I've read about four episodes of Anthrax use (in 1918, in 1952-53, 1981 and 2000), before the 2001 anthrax letters. Even thou I can't find back to these articles now. I remember them fairly well thou.</p>
<p><b>1918</b> The first one was at the very end of WW1 in 1918, when the german army sent a spy via Sweden into Finnmark, Norway to conduct a gruesome experiment. To poison several thousand rheindeers with anthrax spores. Partly because they feared that UK or Russia could use them as transport if invading Norway, but mostly as to find out what damage anthrax could make if introduced to a far-away, unprepared location and authorities actions against such an disase. The spy, Baron Otto von ??? was arrested in Kautokeino, Finnmark and the anthrax was then stored at a storage room in Oslo. More than 70 years later the ampulles was checked and the anthrax was still alive. Previously secret, this story was sent on norwegian TV a few years back on the programme Schrödingers Katt so I guess it must be true.</p>
<p><b>1952-1953</b> During the last year of the Korea war, USA was bombing North Korea like hell and is said to have used bacteriological weapons such as anthrax. I read a newspaper article about this by some former communist here in Norway. Not sure this is true, but worth checking out nevertheless.</p>
<p><b>1981</b> The world's first terrorist attack with bacteriological weapons was conducted in Blackpool, England in 1981. Anthrax-contaminated soil dug up at the scottish isle of the WW2 experiments had been collected in a trashbag and put in front of some party conference (Tory?). It had a warning note attatched to it that it was containing anthrax and routinely checked. And it was confirmed that it did so. Not much, :but it did. A group called Dark Harvest Command took responibility. Police suspect either ultra-extreme enviromentalists or the scene around Adam Busby, an extreme scottish nationalist which started a small-scale terror wave the following year calling themselves Scottish National Liberation Army, to be behind.</p>
<p><b>2000</b> SNLA brags also to be behind the false anthrax treats against british interests in USA and Canada in late 2000, one year before the world famous letters was sent around in USA.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that rightwing extremists was possibly behind the amateurish 2001 anthrax letters. Trying to capitalise on fear of islam, immigration etc., provoke tougher immigration laws etc. This is at least the main theory. Al-Quada is not though to be behind, as they would have approached the tast 100 times more professional and 100 times more deadly.</p>
<p>As I don't have the sources in front of me, I wouldn't start to change the article. But I do hope that you could check out the information above and include the things that you can verify. Because it's not worthless information as such. Think you can double check with some of the information already on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I'd like to see blood spiting person with severe diarrhea who has appettite.</p>
<p>Now what I acctualy want to know - if I get it right there are three subtypes of anthrax (Pulmonary, Gastrointestinal and Cutaneous), can one have them all at once ? -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXil_3879.html" title="User:Xil">Xil</a>/<a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXil_b170.html" title="User talk:Xil">talk</a> 15:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>–--Theoretically yes, if you somehow managed to inhale it, consume it, and expose it to a cut. <a href="../../../j/p/k/User%7EJpKllA_9d31.html" title="User:JpKllA">JpKllA</a> 22:45, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>After looking at the individual stubs for cutaneous anthrax and woolsorter's disease and seeing that they are minimal in content, I believe these articles should be merged &amp; replaced with a re-direct to the main anthrax article. Does anyone else here have opinions otherwise before I try to get those ugly merge tags off the main article?<a href="../../../2/1/1/User%7E2112_rush.html" title="User:2112 rush">2112 rush</a> 23:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page says "[Anthrax] was the first bacterium ever to be shown to cause disease, by Robert Koch in 1877.", while the entry for leprosy says "Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, was discovered by G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in man." I don't think these can both be right... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.12.17.131_a360.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.12.17.131">128.12.17.131</a> (talk) 03:49, 9 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
