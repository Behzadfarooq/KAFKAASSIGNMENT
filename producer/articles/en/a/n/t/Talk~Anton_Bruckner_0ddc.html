<dd><i>Symphony No. 6 in A major, written in 1879-1881, is an oft-neglected work. Whereas the Bruckner rhythm (3+2) is completely absent from the previous Symphony, in this one it permeates everything, appearing both horizontally and vertically.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know Bruckner as well as I should - what is this "Bruckner rhythm"? The (3+2) makes it sound like it might be three triplet quavers (or crotchets, or whatever) followed by two straight quavers (crotchets, whatever) - is this right? Isn't two straight notes followed by a triplet actually more common Brucker (ie, 2+3)? Also, how can a rhythm appear vertically? --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p>Yes, that's what the Bruckner rhythm is, and you're probably right that 2+3 is more common in Bruckner, or at least that's the form more common on prominent themes. As to how can a rhythm appear vertically? Perhaps there is a better way of expressing this. Sometimes, Bruckner might give the first violins to play 3+2 and in the same bar give the second violins 2+3. This isn't so bad for performers if it's all, say, in crotchets or in quavers, making a bar look more or less like this:</p>
<p>1--2--,1-2-3-</p>
<p>1-2-3-,1--2--</p>
<p>But when Bruckner uses the 2+3 or 3+2 in quavers in one part and in crotchets in another part in the same bar, such as is often the case in Sym. 6, performers start complaining. But then again, performers who don't like Bruckner's music will complain about anything ("He expects us to play tremolo pianisimo? He must be crazy!"). -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDel_arte_df03.html" title="User:Del arte">Del_arte</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a> is quite right. Bruckner rhythm started long before the 6th symphony (which might well be regarded as a fantasia on Bruckner rhythm). In its original form it was 2+3 (not 3+2, which is a later variant). One only has to listen to the 4th symphony to capture the true essence of Bruckner rhythm. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuckHG_e510.html" title="User:ChuckHG">Chuck</a> 17:05, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Whereas the Bruckner rhythm (3+2) is completely absent from the previous [i.e. the 5th] Symphony, in this one it permeates everything, appearing both horizontally and vertically</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Isn't the Bruckner rhythm present "vertically" in the slow movement of the 5th symphony? The main theme has duplets in the oboe against triplets in the pizzicato string accompaniment. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 17:37, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, but I don't think that Bruckner's (biographical) article is the place to discuss specific instances of it. I think we should work on the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruckner_rhythm.html" title="Bruckner rhythm">Bruckner rhythm</a> article and list notable instances there, of which this would be one. Also, we could probably make mention of the Bruckner rhythm in each of the symphonies' movements' notes. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewski_2dcf.html" title="User:Andrewski">Andrewski</a> 21:25, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Disregard below comment.. whoops.. I apparently cannot read. I have no info nor any other source but am glad that there is some source for them aside from the website I mentioned. (Well, aside from 4 which is <i>Romantic</i> always and 3 which because of the Wagner-quotations in the first version- many of them excised in the 2nd vers.- and the dedication, is likewise, etc.) 9 I have heard referred to as <i>Laus Deo</i> - this may be an inscription? Yes, I have seen 8 referred to as <i>Apocalyptic</i> before; the other nickname may refer to the main theme of the scherzo. The nicknames of 6 and 7 I have not seen though they make some sense&#160;;) ... <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchissel_dfe5.html" title="User talk:Schissel"><i>bowl listen</i></a> 04:53, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is Bruckner 1 indeed nicknamed "The Saucy Maid" (in any of its versions)? I know the Web is not the be-all and end-all of references, still less a search engine and still less google, but google turns up only various varieties of Amazon sites as sources for this... <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchissel_dfe5.html" title="User talk:Schissel"><i>bowl listen</i></a> 04:49, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I too have not heard much about this, and when I asked on a discussion board that included many people who know a lot about bruckner, they all had no idea what I was talking about.

<p>I'm greatly surprised to see that Herbert von Karajan is listed as a famous interpreter of Bruckner while Bruno Walter is not. I suspect that von Karajan was really riding the CD wave, while Bruno Walter has been largely ignored for his taught, dramatic interpretations of Bruckner because his recordings were largely made at or before the dawn of the Hi-Fi era. Additionally, Walter (having had to relocate to the States) never had the opportunity to enjoy a long tenure with a top-flight orchestra - in contrast to von Karajan's affiliation with the Berlin Philharmonic. The Walter recording of the Bruckner 9th is still a gold standard for interpretation. Simply compare the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_von_Karajan_296a.html" title="Herbert von Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> page (which makes no mention of his Bruckner conducting at all) with the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Walter_6bd8.html" title="Bruno Walter">Bruno Walter</a> page. While I admire much in von Karajan's Bruckner discography, I absolutely treasure my Bruno Walter recordings of Bruckner, even though most are on well-worn LP's. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuckHG_e510.html" title="User:ChuckHG">Chuck</a> 17:05, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I meant to reply to this. I agree; having started to amass my collection of recordings, my favorite of the 9th is still Walter's with Columbia (available on Sony), even though it's not the "tightest" performance ever.

<p>I'm thinking that the second paragraph of the introduction (i.e. before the TOC) should be moved further down in the article; the issue of revisions isn't exactly central to Anton Bruckner himself. What do you think? And if we move it, what should we say in its place? The intro seems rather short in general. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewski_2dcf.html" title="User:Andrewski">Andrewski</a> 20:50, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree the intro seems kinda short with only one paragraph. I added some "overview"-type stuff about Bruckner's historical reputation as a second paragraph. This, hopefully, will give a reader some feel for all the connotations and associations that Bruckner's name calls up. --Jamiemeyer 01:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about the crossed edits, Makemi. I left my browser open for too long and wasn't paying attention to the history.

<p>There are some weasel words I'm trying to get rid of, but I could use some help. The following need citation:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>His [organ] improvisation sessions sometimes yielded ideas for the Symphonies.</i></li>
<li><i>There's also a legend that Bruckner wrote the climactic cymbal clash in this movement at the precise moment that Wagner died; research has since revealed that Bruckner eventually decided against the cymbal clash, though the piece is often performed with it.</i></li>
<li><i>Biographer Derek Watson characterizes the pieces for men's choir as being "of little concern to the non-German listener".</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I took the following sentences out as they have no citation and seem more like opinion. I would agree with most&#160;:), but I think we'd need something factual and cited to reinclude them:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The scherzo especially seems to have a raw power which sometimes seems missing in later works which underwent more revisions.</i></li>
<li><i>The</i> <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._2_%28Bruckner%29_baab.html" title="Symphony No. 2 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 2 in C minor</a> <i>(apparently one of Bruckner's favourite keys)...</i></li>
<li><i>Perhaps the rhythmic difficulties of [Symphony No. 6], especially in the first movement, are part of the reason why this work is so seldom played.</i></li>
<li><i>[His early] Masses seem to be of interest only to music historians and ethnomusicologists.</i></li>
<li><i>It has been referred to "as the most monumental finale in symphonic literature".</i></li>

<p>I'm thinking that the section on symphonies is a bit long-winded according to the Wikipedia guideline on <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a>. Since separate articles exist for each symphony and this article is about Bruckner himself, could we shorten that section?</p>
<p>Barring any objections in the short-term, I'll take the initiative on my last few thoughts; we can always revert if they're really terrible.&#160;;) I won't proceed until I've finished some other work I'd like to do. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewski_2dcf.html" title="User:Andrewski">Andrewski</a> 03:47, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Bruckner suggested using his Te Deum as a Finale, which would complete the homage to Beethoven's Ninth symphony (also in D minor).</i></p>
<p>This is in the Symphonies section under Works. On the contrary, Derek Watson in his biography <i>Bruckner</i> (ISBN 0-19-81617-6) writes:</p>
<p><i>Later on a more assertive chorale theme appears which becomes fused with a motif from the Te Deum. This appearance of the opening figuration of the Te Deum is entirely in keeping with Bruckner's habit of quotation from his sacred choral works (as seen in Symphonies 0, 2, 3, 7 and the Adagio of No.9). It has been quite erroneously assumed, however, that he was at: this point writing a transition to lead into the earlier work, thus providing the symphony with a choral finale. Such a view is untenable as the dying composer can only have suggested the substitution of the Te Deum as a finale as a very desperate solution. The unrelated keys of the two works, and the fact that the appearance of the Te Deum motif can be viewed as an entirely characteristic and symbolic programmatic quotation put the idea of appending the Te Deum to this symphony beyond the bounds of likelihood. This unjustifiable coupling of the two works was in fact perpetrated by Ferdinand Ldwe at the first performance on 11 February 1903, allegedly in accordance with the wishes of the late composer, and others followed his example. Indeed the very existence of an independent finale was tacitly ignored for about three decades until Alfred Orel's publication of Bruckner's incomplete `song of praise to our Lord'.</i></p>
<p>I think this point in the Wikipedia biography should be clarified, which implies that it certainly was Bruckner's plan to finish the ninth off with the Te Deum, which seems to not be the case. Chris67.81.100.79 09:19, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This Japanese Conductor (recently passed) devoted the majority of his life to conducting Bruckner (in Japan). He has established somewhat of a cult status in Japan from what I've heard.</p>
<p>He has a wikipedia article that states:</p>
<p><i>Inspired by a meeting with Wilhelm Furtwängler in the 1950s, he began a lifelong attachment to the music of Anton Bruckner, recording the complete Bruckner symphonies several times.</i></p>
<p>Surely he should be mentioned along with Jochum and Wand, if not at least added to the other list of composers of Bruckner.</p>

<p>Most people think of the Bruckner, the composer, when the name is mentioned, not one of those other options. The same applies with Mahler, Bach, or Beethoven. Either change that setting so this can occur, or show me how to do it myself!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, so I just changed it. Simply go to the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruckner.html" title="Bruckner">Bruckner</a> article (which means you'll have to click on the "Redirected from <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruckner.html" title="Bruckner">Bruckner</a>" link at the top, and edit the page to redirect to the correct page. —<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewski_2dcf.html" title="User:Andrewski">Andrewski</a> 06:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it really so important, that Hitler abused Bruckner's music? Is it neccessary to fill nearly the whole paragraph "Reception in the 20th Century" with Nazi-Stuff? I don't think so...</p>
