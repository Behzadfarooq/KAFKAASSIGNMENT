<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant%C3%B4nio_Conselheiro_1608.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Antônio Maciel was the son of Maria Joaquina de Jesus and Vicente Mendes Maciel, a rugged family of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a> breeders in the backlands ("sertão") of the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-arid.html" title="Semi-arid">semi-arid</a> zone of the Brazilian Northeast. His infancy was marked by a bloody feud with the powerful family of the Araújos, causing many deaths in both families, following the tragic cycle of <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vengeance.html" title="Vengeance">vengeance</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honour.html" title="Honour">honour</a> which were so common in these regions. After the death of his mother in 1834, his father married again, and Antônio and his two sisters suffered with the father's <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and maltreatment by their stepmother. Antônio went to study with his grandfather, Manoel Antônio Ferreira Nobre, who was a teacher in Quixeramobim. He developed well as a serious, quiet and hard-working pupil, studying <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetics.html" title="Arithmetics">arithmetics</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>. In 1855 his father died and he assumed the family's business, striving to get his sisters married. In 1857, Antônio himself married Brasilina Laurentina de Lima and began working as a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salesman.html" title="Salesman">salesman</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">teacher</a> and lay counselor (poorman's <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a>). Already with two children, he was betrayed by his wife in 1861, and disillusioned and depressed, he separated from them and retired to a farm, working as a rural teacher, and devoting himself more and more to Christian <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a>. Moving again to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Quit%C3%A9ria_8e37.html" title="Santa Quitéria">Santa Quitéria</a>, Ceará, he had a third child, a son named Joaquim Aprígio, after a brief affair with a local artist named Joana Imaginária. He was restless, however, and started to wander around the country, from 1865 to 1869, and then from 1871 and afterwards.</p>

<p>He was tall and thin, with long black hair and beard, always dressed in a rough blue tunic, a straw hat and leather sandals, carrying a necklace with a wooden cross, Antônio Maciel cut an impressive figure, reminding people of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. Gradually he became a <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrim.html" title="Pilgrim">pilgrim</a>, an itinerant benefactor and counselor of the poor, as well a pious <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preacher.html" title="Preacher">preacher</a> and religious leader. He was called alternatively by the simple people of the region as <i>Antônio Conselheiro</i>, <i>Santo Antônio dos Mares</i>, <i>Santo Antônio Aparecido</i> or <i>Bom Jesus Conselheiro</i>, and began to attract not only admirers, but fanatical followers, who begin travelling with him.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, Antônio Conselheiro began to attract the attention of authorities and the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, due to his preaching to the oppressed and poor <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasant.html" title="Peasant">peasants</a> and common folk of small villages and <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farms</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> he was arrested by the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> in Itapicuru, Bahia, under the suspicion of being a sought criminal. After being identified, he was sent by ship to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortaleza.html" title="Fortaleza">Fortaleza</a>. He was severely beaten, his hair and beard were cut and he was sent back for trial to his city of origin, Quixeramobim. The local judge, however, released Antônio Conselheiro due to the absence of any criminal charges against him. Antônio returned immediately to Bahia and restarted his wandering and preaching. He vowed to construct 21 <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">churches</a> and proceeded to do so in 12 cities in the backlands of the provinces of Bahia and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergipe.html" title="Sergipe">Sergipe</a>, as well as <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemeteries.html" title="Cemeteries">cemeteries</a> and small <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dam.html" title="Dam">dams</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, one of the periodical catastrophic <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drought.html" title="Drought">droughts</a> began in the Northeast. It would be two years long and kill more than 300,000 peasants of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunger.html" title="Hunger">hunger</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirst.html" title="Thirst">thirst</a>, creating havoc with the predominantly semi-arid agrarian economy of the region. Many villages were entirely abandoned and even instances of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibalism.html" title="Cannibalism">cannibalism</a> occurred. Antônio Conselheiro and his followers did what they could to alleviate the extreme suffering of the poor people, adding more and more admirers and followers to his group. The sense of an impending end of the world and that the only salvation could come through religion were strong incentives to the surging of religious <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanaticism.html" title="Fanaticism">fanaticism</a>. Conselheiro was widely regarded as a <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a> and a <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>. Due to his increasing criticism of the official Church and of his open preachings in the small churches of the backlands, in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> the Archbishop of Bahia issued an order forbidding priests to allow him access to the flocks and characterising Antônio Conselheiro as an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostate.html" title="Apostate">apostate</a> and as a madman.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, Brazil went through the most revolutionary and far-reaching social, economic and political changes of its history since the Discovery, in <a href="../../../1/5/0/1500.html" title="1500">1500</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> was abolished by the ruling Emperor, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_II_of_Brazil_877d.html" title="Pedro II of Brazil">Dom Pedro II</a>, by an act signed by his daughter, Princess Isabel. More than five million black people went suddenly out of work, abandoned the farms and swelled enormously the rural and urban ranks of extremely poor inhabitants. Tens of thousands of farmers went broke and <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> almost stopped for a while, particularly in the cash crops which required intensive labour, such as <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton.html" title="Cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugarcane.html" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, the mainstays of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Brazil_44a0.html" title="Economy of Brazil">Brazilian economy</a> at the time. Second, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, the Emperor was deposed by a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_coup.html" title="Military coup">military coup</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a> was proclaimed, further adding unstability and strife to the already torn-up country.</p>
<p>All this was important to the make-up of Canudos. Antônio Conselheiro was strongly against slavery and had preached and written about it, incurring in the wrath of farmers and authorities. The number of his flocks increased dramatically, and it is estimated that more than 80% were constituted by former slaves. In addition, he considered that monarchy was a <a href="../../../b/y/_/By_the_grace_of_God_3a44.html" title="By the grace of God">grant of God</a>, and that the Republic, with its <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church-state_separation.html" title="Church-state separation">separation</a> between Church and state, was morally wrong and would wreck the country and family; a kind of new <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist.html" title="Antichrist">antichrist</a>. Again he stepped up public criticisms and rallied the social movement around these flags. General nervousness of farmers, priests and government increased to histerical fear.</p>
<p>Finally, in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>, violence erupted. Protesting against taxes levied by the new Republican government in Masseté, state of <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahia.html" title="Bahia">Bahia</a>, "Conselhistas" (as Antônio Conselheiro's organized following was named) were attacked by a small police force and reacted with weapons.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant%C3%B4nio_Conselheiro_1608.html" title="Edit section: Canudos">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Canudos</span></h2>
<p>Antônio Conselheiro decided then to retreat and to establish in 1893 a permanent place for his growing band of now quasi-insurrects. Near the city of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Santo_6d7d.html" title="Monte Santo">Monte Santo</a>, in the Northeast tip of Bahia, he founded the village of Bello Monte (<i>Beautiful Mount</i>), in an area named Canudos. It was set in an abandoned farm amid several mountain ranges, near the <a href="../../../v/a/z/Vaza-Barris_River_ad99.html" title="Vaza-Barris River">Vaza-Barris River</a>.</p>
<p>In Canudos, Antônio Conselheiro, aided by a local government by committee, composed by 12 "apostles", or elders, established a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a>-like social system, with <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_labour.html" title="Division of labour">division of labour</a> and produce, common property, abolition of civil <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> and of the official currency, prohibition of taverns, <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquor.html" title="Liquor">liquor</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, rigid control over <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crimes</a> and mandatory religious activities. He also gave a measure of personal freedom of injustice and oppression by landlords and governmental authorities. The fame of Canudos spread rapidly throughout the Northeast, as being a promised land of "honey and milk". Former black slaves, uprooted <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_people_of_Brazil_f2ca.html" title="Indigenous people of Brazil">indigenous people</a> and impoverished and landless mestizos started to come in droves to Canudos. One year later Canudos had already 8,000 new residents; by 1895 its population had blown up to more than 30,000 and more than 5,000 dwellings. Two churches and one school were also built and commerce and agriculture became more organised.</p>
<p>The massive presence of such kind of people started to cause much fear and trouble in the region, since many of the new residents were not-so-peaceful "<a href="../../../j/a/g/Jagun%C3%A7o.html" title="Jagunço">jagunços</a>" (hired armed men who worked for farmers), leading to appeals to the government for repression and control. Fearing an invasion of the city of <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juazeiro.html" title="Juazeiro">Juazeiro</a> by the "Conselhistas", who had a dispute with a <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumber.html" title="Lumber">lumber</a> merchant, its mayor appealed histerically to the provincial government. A visit by two <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capuchin_friars.html" title="Capuchin friars">Capuchin friars</a> to Canudos was insufficient to calm the population and one of them mistakingly accused Antônio Conselheiro of trying to raise a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchist</a> <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedition.html" title="Sedition">sedition</a>.</p>
<p>All was set for the start a military aggression against the largely pacific settlement. See <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_Canudos_64ad.html" title="War of Canudos">War of Canudos</a> for further detail.</p>
<p>During the military <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a> that ensued, Antônio Conselheiro, anguished with the death, hunger and suffering of his followers, went into a period of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praying.html" title="Praying">praying</a> and severe <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fasting.html" title="Fasting">fasting</a>. He was no military leader. In consequence, with 67 years of age, he died on September 22, 1897, probably of <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysentery.html" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a>. His death was the beginning of Canudo's defeat, which eventually brought about the brutal death of probably more than 50% of the city's inhabitants under the military operations and ensuing <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrocity.html" title="Atrocity">atrocities</a> committed against civilians by the victors.</p>
<p>The cadaver of Antônio Conselheiro was located, disinterred and identified by military surgeons, his head was cut off and sent to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador%2C_Brazil_9efc.html" title="Salvador, Brazil">Salvador</a>, both as a proof and as a war spoil. It was examined by the noted forensic medicine expert, Dr. Nina Rodrigues and placed in permanent exhibition in the museum of the Escola Bahiana de Medicina (Medical School of Bahia), where it was destroyed in a fire in May <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>.</p>

<p>Besides his written preachings, Antônio Conselheiro was survived by only a religious tract, written in May 1895, titled <i>"Apontamentos dos Preceitos da Divina Lei de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo, para a Salvação dos Homens"</i> (Annotations on the Precepts of Our Lord Jesus Christ's Divine Law for the Salvation of Men).</p>
<p>The story of Antônio Conselheiro and the War of Canudos has been dramatized in <a href="../../../e/u/c/Euclides_da_Cunha_b328.html" title="Euclides da Cunha">Euclides da Cunha</a>'s brilliant classic <i>Rebellion in the Backlands</i> (<i><a href="../../../o/s/_/Os_Sert%C3%B5es_5cc2.html" title="Os Sertões">Os Sertões</a></i>).
