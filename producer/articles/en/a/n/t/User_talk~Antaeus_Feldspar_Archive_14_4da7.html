<dd>Antaeus, I bet you'd rise to it as admin--you'd be able to restrain yourself from abusing the cloak of authority (you'd want to recuse yourself from scientology-related decisions, I'd guess, for starters). Anyway, I'd endorse Glen's nomination--you've shown yourself to be clear-headed and articulate, valuable attributes around here. And by the way, a personal kudo for your recent witticism--"DevTpedia" caused me to burst out laughing. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 17:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Antaeus, I've reverted the votes in your RfA, as it isn't in progress yet. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 22:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's moot now, as I've declined the nomination, but I doubt very much that there is anything in policy which supports removing all votes that have been cast, including that of the nominator, if the RfA is not "in progress yet". You'd think that if Wikipedia had policy dictating "the nominator may not cast a vote until the candidate has accepted the nomination" -- and took this policy seriously enough to authorize removing all votes that were cast outside that period -- that the policy would instead entirely prohibit initiating an RfA before the candidate has accepted. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:03, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for causing any troubles. Besides my impression (I can't vouch for it being policy), that no votes outside the actual candidacy period are valid, I've acted primarily because any votes tend to attract more votes. I'd very much doubt, that you'd have lost your nominator's vote. If he hadn't noticed himself, someone (e.g. me) would have notfied him. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 01:40, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Scientology mediation case</span></h2>
<p>Greetings Antaeus: I'm currently mediating the Scientology case down at the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a>, which focuses on the argument surrounding the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Special_Affairs_41d7.html" title="Office of Special Affairs">Office of Special Affairs</a> article over whether particular quotes by <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory_Christman_c912.html" title="Tory Christman">Tory Christman</a> are acceptable for inclusion. User:Nikitchenko has recently requested your involvement in the mediation case, which is located here:</p>

<p>I would like to invite you to participate in this particular mediation case, if you feel it is relevant and that you are indeed involved in this case. However, it seems unclear to me whether you are involved in this particular dispute or not, so I would be most grateful for your input. Of course, the Mediation Cabal is entirely informal, and if you don't want to get involved, that's fine. It might, perhaps, help to bring this dispute to some sort of amicable resolution if you did enter as a party to the case, since I should expect you would have greatly valuable input to the proceedings. Thank you very much.

<dd>Thank you, Nicholas. I do feel that it is very relevant -- after all, if Nikitchenko is going to make trumped-up reports to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> about me based on that article, then he's pretty much ensured that I'm "involved", eh?

<p>Antaeus, I've just read some of your recent contribs, specifically those involving your RfA. I just want you to know that I truly meant it as a mark of respect on my behalf towards you: I've never nominated anyone for adminship before (truth is I rarely even vote) and I honestly meant it to be a badge of honor for you. If I had known for a second that it would cause you undue stress or even that you weren't interested please know I never, ever would have lodged it. As I said I saw your post for adminship training at Esperanza and presumed (ignorantly) that you were interested. I apologise once again, and truly regret having filed it. In you hope you know the intent which I had, apologies once again, - <i><b><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">Gl</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery"><font color="red">n</font></a></b></i> <i><small><sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStollery_0895.html" title="User talk:Stollery">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stollery_ef7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stollery">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">(Stollery)</a></small></i> 17:21, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Whoa I am totally confused</span></h2>
<p>Hello. Aparently I have offended you? On my (former) article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_Protective_Services_dd08.html" title="Child Protective Services">Child Protective Services</a>; After sepnding hours writing and editing it, (and alas yes also using other sources, AND noting them AND referencing them as well as I read how in the user guide) I see that you have totally deleted my <b>entire article</b> - not just marked it or any one part, where I may have made a mistake knowing HOW to use material in an article! I did a LOT of research and work on that article, and I work in the field (hence my username) and while I AM new at wiki, working at trying to learn and do things right, the articles I DID use were written by my MOTHER (her research at Princeton for this very article WE are very proud of) and I very much have her permission. How do I show that any more than with a direct reference in the article? While SHE is not UP on what a wiki is, she was delighted in having SOME of her work featured here last time I asked her. She would tell you the same, and that was only SOME of the article as well so why is it ALL deleted? MOST of that article I either wrote on my own, using many sources and my own knowledge, and assimilated that way. WHY delete the ENTIRE article and not just mark or work with the parts that you felt were not right or tell me? How is someone supposed to contrib if they are just wholeheartedly deleted when they try?? NOt even a NOTE on the talk page! Geez. I was out of town for the Memorial Day and I get back to this. Help! Please advise/explain. I NEVER meant to do anything wrong HERE! I love wiki and spent HOURS working on that and hardly ALL of it was a copyright issue even IF you didn't know that or I didn't reference it right. How am I to learn?? I am totally lost on this one. I await your respose eagerly. <a href="../../../c/p/s/User%7ECpswarrior_4205.html" title="User:Cpswarrior">cpswarrior</a> 16:41, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, please calm down.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, please note that "your" article (please consult <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> if you don't know why I put the possessive in quotes) was not "deleted". Deletion is a different procedure, and if the article had been deleted, you would not be able to go back into the edit history and see the complete text of what was in the article after every edit. The procedure that was followed was Wikipedia's established procedure for dealing with possible copyright violations; if you had read the notice that was placed on the page as part of the procedure, you would note that it shows you the steps you should take if you hold the copyright to the material or have permission to use the material. You have not taken those steps.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, and importantly, please realize that "does the contributor have copyright to the material or permission to use it otherwise" is <i>not</i> the sole question at issue. There is also the question of whether material that was written for some other venue will be appropriate without modification for Wikipedia, and it may surprise you to learn that for the average academic paper the answer is <i>NO</i>. Why? Because the purpose of an academic paper is to put forward and support with evidence a <i>thesis</i> -- a hypothesis or opinion such as "Child Protective Services is good" or "Child Protective Services is bad" or "Child Protective Services started from the best motives but has lost sight of its original purpose" or the like. Wikipedia articles, by contrast, must be written from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_Point_of_View_9960.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View">Neutral Point of View</a> (NPOV), which means that it may <i>describe</i> hypotheses or opinions on the subject but should not be trying to convince the reader of the rightness of any thesis -- neither by coming out and directly advocating that thesis nor by giving undue space and attention to that thesis.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This means that just having permission from the American Family Rights Association to use their highly opinionated essay "<a href="http://www.familyrightsassociation.com/THE_PROBLEM/problem_statement.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.familyrightsassociation.com/THE_PROBLEM/problem_statement.htm" rel="nofollow">Problem Statement</a>" nearly word-for-word -- and even if that essay was a peer-reviewed work, which I can find no evidence that it is -- doesn't mean that you <i>should</i> be including it nearly word-for-word on Wikipedia. As for your statement that you wrote the majority of the article on your own, merely assimilating observations from others, I must respectfully question whether you took as much care with adapting the work for Wikipedia as you claim you did, seeing as there are not one but two places in the text of the article where you neglected to remove a parenthetical note to "(See the article by Courtney in this journal issue.)" -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay I understand, agree. I can go back and work slowly to try and clear up the copyright and rewirte the parts of the article to make sure it is nutral and not POV. I do understand what you mean. I am used to others editing and then speedy deleting things before I even get past the first edit. I can't see the need to write EVERYTHING in the sandbox simply because of speedy deleting editors. I feel they are as hasty as anonymous contributors sometimes in viewing deletes, talks and edits over the years. I have contributed other articles for scientific matters without the issues at hand. I understand this is a highly charged and opinionated issue. As for the parenthetical notes, I HAD editied, re-written and corrected most of them, but worked until too tired one night and reverted to an earlier edit in clipboard, and missed those at that time. In so doing I lost a lot of work and edits, but I see what you mean and how it looks the way it was left. Note: My collegues in the field agree with it (the articles) and they have reviewed them. How is that to be stated if it is fact and still can be considered POV? In my work, most agree that 'cps' has become (is becoming/always was) a big governmental industry, and I felt that readers should know the truth and not what some government pamphlet would have you believe that they are "there to help families" as they state it. It is sickning. How do I write this kind of information without avoiding the truth and still satisfy NPOV rules? I can see that writing "Big oil is a monopoly and makes huge profits at the expense of consumers" would be POV, but if it is TRUE that oil companies are monopolies, are making huge profits, and that it IS at the expense of consumers, where do you state that without the nutrality replacing truth, without simply sounding like Sean Hanity stating another guised opinion? "Some poeple feel that big oil companies are making huge profits" sounds so weak and right-leaning. I do appreciate your answer. I will continue to read and edit this and I will try my best to correct it in a way that meets all the rules. I would like there to be a CPS article that explains more than what the GOV wants you to read/think. I hope you will review it and agree at some stage. Thanks for taking time to answer so thoroughly. I will do better. On one last note, in reading what you suggested I do, I understand I do not "own" my work here. I will share one from <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> that struck me about this edit though:</li>

<dd>Well, the problem is that an NPOV article on the subject <i>must</i> include what "some government pamphlet would have you believe" -- correctly attributed to its proponents, of course, and not just "some government pamphlet". If you think the facts of the matter would convince anyone otherwise, then what you want to do is to <i>show</i> the reader those facts, and make sure they're well-sourced so that the reader knows <i>why</i> they should believe that those facts <i>are</i> factually true. To give an example, if you found <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> for two of the figures mentioned in the "Problem Statement" essay, that "Federal statistics say that there are approximately 3 million reports of suspected child abuse and neglect each year" but "The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services documents 900,000 as 'substantiated'", readers can see why those who believe CPS oversteps its bounds believe that. Another source is the 2000 <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> article mentioned: what facts does that article provide? That's the direction I'd encourage you to look in. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:38, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>That's not really a nice thing to say to a scientologist, is it? I'm familiar with the jargon, sadly.</p>
<p>I realise that is a pretty old comment, but I'd just like to ask you to please resist the urge to goad Terryeo, whose own comment was pretty civil. I'm not taking action against Terryeo because I feel that he was deliberately goaded in this instance. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 16:12, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, looking at Terryeo's comments of "Those people whom you refuse to address are observing you, too", which I am just seeing now, it seems what you really mean is "I feel that <i>you</i> deliberately goaded him in this instance." Don't you think there's a bit of victim-blaming in that? I mean, do you realize that Terryeo <b>has never stopped</b> his own incivility of declaring that other editors are deliberately trying to keep Dianetics and Scientology from being presented in an NPOV fashion? He has even <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_subpage1_3d00.html" title="User:Terryeo/subpage1">dedicated a page</a> to such accusations; it's only recently (and at the prompting of NicholasTurnbull, who also made it clear to Terryeo that it would be done for him if he didn't do it himself) that Terryeo stopped calling us <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppressive_person.html" title="Suppressive person">suppressive persons</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Terryeo/subpage1&amp;diff=56587062&amp;oldid=54114290" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Terryeo/subpage1&amp;diff=56587062&amp;oldid=54114290" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Skeptics society</span></h2>
<p>Hi Antaeus. I have noticed some strange and odd things on the NLP article. Most of the HKU skeptics society has been banned from editing on the basis of they are suspected sockpuppetry. I am a member, and I am worried about myself being banned if I make any objection to the NLP advocates removing verified information. I know at least some of them are not sockpuppets. I met Alice, Headley (Wei Qing), Hans, and Bookmain (Jim) a few months back, and Camridge (Liz) is also really nice. They are all therapists and academics. Do you think they will ban the whole of Hong Kong and China from editing that article? Also, I notice you have a grounding in editing pseudoscience subjects. I can send you some soft copy papers on NLP that the group gave me if you like. The article at presently seems to be going under some kind of censorship campaign. Some of it refers to scientology and other pseudosciences so I thought it may be helpful and "synergetic" for you. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelen_Wu_719c.html" title="User:Helen Wu">Helen Wu</a> helenkitlingwu@yahoo.com 07:41, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dt>Reason for bans</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hi to both <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelen_Wu_719c.html" title="User:Helen Wu">User:Helen Wu</a>. I doubt much I say will make any difference. However, here to clarify is why the HK sockfarm / sceptics place was banned:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia has rules and policies. Those rules govern, <i>inter alia</i> all personal conduct, and approaches to articles. Because of the nature of the internet, they also govern when and how a user may be removed for suspected accounts, or for multiple editors working together in a manner that blocks proper functioning of Wikipedia, even if by chance they are different individuals sharing computers. You may not like this, but each place has its rules, and those were spelled out over a very long period of time, and at many levels. They were spelled out by numerous individuals, personally and on the article, by mediation, by arbitration, by mentorship, and ultimately, by removal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The users named have been blocked not because of a sudden desire by a number of editors and mediators (most of whom had no prior interest in NLP) to take a side. In fact they were not formally removed until the mediators tired of their knowing improper conduct, after many months of work by 3rd parties who feel their time was wasted. That's how life goes: - in a communal work, no individual is indispensible, and those who do not learn, tend to ultimately discover this. I'm told it's a bit of a shock. They were removed because, simply put, they did not learn how to write in accordance with an encyclopedic style. they were removed for "warfare", vandalism, invention of false facts, deletion of valid sourced material, persistent cognitive inability to comprehend <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and a dozen other standards, breaches of sockpuppet policy first notified to them over 8 months ago and not rectified in that time, running of one of the largest sockpuppet/meatpuppet groups of 2005 (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> refers), and virulent personal attacks. Most of these things had little to do with the content they were writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(Incidentally, several of them were the same individual, not just the same computer. That's been confirmed a number of ways. No I don't plan to clarify, just to say, "do you think this is the first time it's happened here"? Again, ask Headley)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, it's done. This is written, on the off chance there are genuine individuals who wonder why the bans happened. Now you know. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> (<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a>) 13:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just to clarify my position on this: I have experience and interest in some fields that may be similar to NLP or may in some way relate to it; however, I don't have any real grounding in the debates over NLP. I've only edited NLP articles occasionally, and only to the extent where I felt that knowledge of Wikipedia policy, or subjects that I am more familiar with than NLP, pointed clearly to a particular change. Accordingly, I've declined requests/suggestions that I get more involved with the debates over the NLP articles. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
