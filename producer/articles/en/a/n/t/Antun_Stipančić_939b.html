<p>Antun was born on 18th May 1949 in an industrial little town of <a href="../../../d/u/g/Duga_Resa_a572.html" title="Duga Resa">Duga Resa</a> (former <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, now <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>). He was the oldest of three brothers, the middle one Marijan, and the youngest one Ivica. His father Ivan, the janitor at the football club and his mother Franca, the housekeeper, had a hard time trying to provide with food their 5 members family. They could hardly put it through, living very modestly in a flat full of dampness in the football playground where was ... the table tennis hall of the TTC "Duga Resa".</p>
<p>At the end of 1950s, a group of sport enthusiasts led by Josip Trupković, the "unavoidable" Josip Stojković and Dragutin Vrana contaminated the little town of Duga Resa and its kids with a new sport - table tennis. The TTC "Pamučna industrija" was born and the priority was to coach the youngest.</p>
<p>At this time, many curious persons used to visit the table tennis halls to see with their own eyes the little Duga Resa kid, called "the wonder kid".</p>
<p>Antun won his first tournament in 1961. In the cadet category in The Karlovac league, and a few months later he was the best at Ribnjak, Zagreb.</p>

Antun Stipančić at the start of his career</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The crucial year for Stipančić was 1965. In that year a famous Japanese expert Ichiro Ogimura visited Duga Resa, leading a strong selection which enraptured the overcrowded table tennis hall. "Ogimura impressed me with his easy way of moving around and attacking although at that time he passed his best days in table tennis." And then still another direct contact with a great player - it happened in The World championships in Ljubljana in which Tova played for the first time. As the lot wanted or by accident, he had to play against the world champion Chuang Tse Tung! Later he confessed his knees could not hold him, but nevertheless he played some very good points, which brought him the compliments from the Chinese champion. He tapped Tova on his shoulder, they were photographed together and who can remember the result (8:21, 11:21, 14:21). And what a coincidence - only 5 years later at the very same Tivoli hall, Stipančić played back in the same manner, defeating thoroughly the legendary Chuang Tse Tung.'</p>
<p>Tova is 16. He is not a kid any more. On the contrary, he grew a few centimeters and became stronger for a few points. At The Open Championships of Poland in Krakow he won his first important International match — in the second round he defeated the European champion Swede Kjell Johanson 24:22 in the fifth set, winning Johanson's two match balls. And as Antun Stipančić firmly stepped forward onto the world table tennis scene, the highest world authorities agreed that he would have a brilliant career.In the year 1966 Tova is a member of the national team to the European Championships in Wembley. That year Stipančić won two medals on The Youth European Championships in Sombathely; gold playing mixed doubles with Mirjana Resler and silver playing doubles with Zlatko Čordaš.</p>

<p>Now, Tova pays all his attention to studying and finishing The Textile High school. He succeeds. And then with all his effort he turns to sport and excitements that sport brings.</p>
<p>With a great deal of enthusiasm he plays at the Championat de Europe 1968. at Lyon Sport Hall. He was very good in the team events and still better in a completely unplanned double. That is, The Association at that time made a new combination Korpa - Šurbek which was triumphant in Europe, while Antun, they decided, should play with Edvard Vecko, although they never trained or played before. "Unburdened, without high pretensions we played you can say for our pleasure. In the final "round" we played against Swedish experts Johanson and Alser who did not lose a single match in two last world championships. We played the whole match offensively, well, firmly. The result went like this 21:17, 20:22, 22:20 and 21:14! A big applause from the objective spectators in Palais des Sportes was a great reward. What an unforgettable reception at the Pleso airport and again in Duga Resa! I had to make speech at the improvised platform, everyone was there...." '</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antun_Stipan%C4%8Di%C4%87_939b.html" title="Edit section: Professional Playing and Top of Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional Playing and Top of Career</span></h2>
<p>During the summer of 1970 the unexpected decision, although not so unexpected among the table tennis officials: Tova leaves his club "Pamučna industrija" and becomes the member of The TTC "Vjesnik"; from smaller club to the bigger one. The basic reason was the need for the adequately strong sparring partner (and none was more suitable than <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragutin_%C5%A0urbek_2d49.html" title="Dragutin Šurbek">Šurbek</a> and Čordaš), as well as the great challenge of taking part in The European Cup. With the new dress he put on, there was still another major event: not long after that Stipančić got married... In the beginning of 1971 he moved to Zagreb. The new surrounding, new habits. The days of great changes. The time for thinking. '</p>
<p>And then toward the end of the year a glamorous famishing: Stipančić celebrating the first class victory at The International Tournament in Zagreb's "Box of Matches" hall. The journalists were lavish with the headlines - "Tova"s Sculping Chinese", "Stipančić over the Chinese Great Wall", "..The ball caught fire.." Stipančić smashed Chinese Chon Lan Sun, Li Fu Jung and in the semi-finals he defeated Šurbek and in the finals the famous Chuang Tse Tung, 16:21, 21:12, 21:12, experiencing real ovations from the overjoyed Zagreb spectators.</p>
<p>In the year 1972 Zagreb played a host to a tournament on which the European top table tennis players gathered. It was complete success in organization and results. Top show, "Europe's Top Twelve" in the Trešnjevka sport hall.... and Tova in the leading role! Stipančić broke down all the barriers and won the trophy Reno Vinek, the editor of the "Sportske Novosti", presented him.</p>
<p>In the year 1975 Hindoos built specially for The World Championships at The Garden of Eden "Netaji" in Calcuta a dome for 12.000 spectators. At that place Tova, undoubtedly played the matches of his life... At the quarter-finals - a match for the "gourmet" - Hsi En Ting the title defender left the arena totally defeated by Tova in a rarely seen match, 3:2. In the next game - and it was the semi-final, Antun played against the excellent Japanese defender Takashima. Superior Antun's play and victory in 5 sets&#160;!</p>
<p>And then the finals so long waited for. In the crowded hall, "the war" between 25 year old Antun Stipančić and a year younger Istvan Jonyer. Excellent opportunity for our expert, could he win? Tova defeated the robust Hungarian Hussar only a few days earlier in the team events, so he had a certain psychological advantage. Would he use it? In the first set Jonyer started nervously and "hard", and Stipančić collected points from semi distance, 4:2, 9:5, 13:7, 18:15 and 21:17. Happiness on Stipančić's bench. Hungarian is somehow nervous and playing shackled, while Stipančić was winning his points "by blocking and controlling the situation firmly" winning the second set 21:12. 2:0! But Jonyer succeeded in catching up with Stipančić. 2:2&#160;! Real drama. The fifth set was to decide!Zagreb player from Duga Resa is closer to a victory, he leads 16:15, 18:17... but Istvan plays well, take risks, returns the undependable balls, comes to 18:20, and then misses one counter ball, 19:20. Silence in the hall. Again a strong top spin attack, Tova's ball hits the net.... Jonyer wins. Tova is silver medalist.</p>
<p>In the year 1979 Tova flew to <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyongyang.html" title="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> with his national team to The World Championship. "Why not try again&#160;? I always fought more with my hand and heart than with my legs" and the medal hunters, the experienced double <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragutin_%C5%A0urbek_2d49.html" title="Dragutin Šurbek">Šurbek</a> – Stipančić were off to win the table tennis Mount Everest! The finals of the men doubles. Tova and <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragutin_%C5%A0urbek_2d49.html" title="Dragutin Šurbek">Šurba</a> on one side and on the other side of the net very well known competitors, Hungarian aces Klampar and Jonyer. A European finals on the Asian grounds. Excellent victory 3 sets to 0, and their names were written down on the list of the table tennis immortals for ever. Our boys thrilled with joy hardly succeeded to say something after that great triumph. Tova with raised voice: "Men, I finally experienced U, we are the real champions. Nobody could take us a set." '</p>
<p>Far more satisfactory was a detail from the European Championships in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bern.html" title="Bern">Bern</a> in 1980. (by the way let us mention his two medals playing doubles) were Antun showed his sport greatness. In the fifth set. at 19:19 he confessed the ball in favor of the English player Paul Day, although the referee decided the opposite. For that sport gesture he got "The Fair Play Trophy R. Bergmann".</p>

<p>Antun Stipančić Tova belonged to the world. Generations of the table tennis players from all continents remember him; generations of the table tennis players that played against him or enjoyed in his brilliant actions at the green table. With his individuality and outstanding sport results Antun Tova Stipančić left behind an indelible trace and became the part of the sport history, of the world, of Croatia and of his Duga Resa.</p>
<p>And at the end let us remind that he won 27 medals, 11 medals from the world championships; 1 gold, 4 silver, 6 bronze; and 16 medals from the European championships (4,3,9). Beside that he won 48 medals at the international tournaments in all categories. Success worth of admiration&#160;!</p>
