<dd>Wikipedia does not decide what a word's definition is, or what it "should" be; <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> requires that we only list what other noteworthy sources (like dictionaries) have defined terms as, and not that we try to decide everything for ourselves. Wikipedia reports and organizes information, it does not generate entirely new conclusions. As for "taking cognizance if the poison that is religion" (incidentally, I'm delighted that you used the word <i>cognizance</i> while also spelling "you" as "u" and "why" as "y"; beautiful), that sounds closer to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antireligion.html" title="Antireligion">antireligion</a>, which is opposition to religion, than to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitheism.html" title="Antitheism">antitheism</a>, which is opposition to theism. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 09:53, 27 February 2006</dd>

<p>"Some sources, particularly religious ones, have defined antitheism as opposition to God, holiness or the divine rather than simply as opposition to belief in God, theism." You can't be opposed to something you don't think exists. We should not be taking information about antitheism from theists.</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to that definition, an antitheist couldn't be an atheist because, as you said, they would have to hold belief in one or more gods in order to oppose them. <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>, for example, would fit that definition because it is opposed to God in Abrahamic mythologies. And all views can be presented, but you must say who holds those views. We can't say "the world is flat" or "creationism/intelligent design is true," but we can and are supposed to say, "some Christians believe the world to be flat and creationism/intelligent design to be true."

<dd>Read the article. Antitheism has more than one possible meaning: it can either refer to opposition to the "actual" God, or opposition to <i>belief</i> in god (i.e., "anti-theism", opposition to theism). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does it make any sense to devote such a large part of the article to Robert Flint's views, given that they do not refer to either of the modern meanings of the term? Judging from the quoted section, he clearly uses the word "anti-theist" to mean "non-Christian". <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">mglg</a><sub>(<a href="../../../m/g/l/User_talk%7EMglg_4d0a.html" title="User talk:Mglg">talk</a>)</sub> 19:54, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Incorrect. He uses it as an umbrella term for all opposition to monotheism, not to Christianity. Originally I think the Flint section was in a different place in the structure of the page. The word "antitheism" has no generally agreed meaning, so it is useful to account for its historical usage by influential 19th C. contributors such as Flint, as well as "modern" usages such as that by Hitchens. But perhaps the quoted extract needn't be so long. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyno_cd04.html" title="User:Dannyno">Dannyno</a> 20:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He does not refer to opposition to anything; he considers polytheists and pantheists to be anti-theists, not because they are actively opposed to anything, but merely because they hold different views. I did overstate it when I put the word Christianity into his mouth, but he certainly does not refer to monotheism in any broad sense, but to a restricted class of monotheisms that believe in a <i>"supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created".</i> In any case, this is not the anti-monotheism page. <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">mglg</a><sub>(<a href="../../../m/g/l/User_talk%7EMglg_4d0a.html" title="User talk:Mglg">talk</a>)</sub> 22:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He refers to "antagonism" which certainly qualifies as opposition, I would have thought. Also the word "opposed" is clearly there in the quote. However, Flint's definition does not capture the sense of "opposition" or "antagonism" that you find in Hitchens. My point, though, is that Hitchens' definition of antitheism is as idiosyncratic as, and no more privileged than, anyone else's. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyno_cd04.html" title="User:Dannyno">Dannyno</a> 08:11, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was thinking. This article places too much emphasis on Atheism. Anti-theism merely implies by it's definition, an opposition to "theism". Atheism is not the only philosophy that does this.</p>
<p>Deism{and it's offshoots; PanDeism/PanenDeism}, as well as Agnosticism, and others; have many adherents that are adamantly opposed to Theism{and revealed religion,etc}. Some of us{I myself am deistic} consider ourselves very Anti-Theistic. But the impression given is that Anti-Theism is simply a synonym STRONG Atheism{or as I like to call it, "Adeism"}, which is not true.</p>
<p>Now, this article does'nt say OUTRIGHT that Anti-theism is a form of Atheism, but it still seems to imply it; and non Athiest ideologies{except perhaps Agnosticism} seem to be ignored. People reading this article will not easily get the impression or knowledge that one could be say a "Deist" and be also Anti-Theistic.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was wondering if someone{myself, or anyone here} could make that distiction in the article. Mention Deism and Agnosticism as beeing compatible with Anti-Theism, and poit out that Anti-Theism is NOT a synonym for "Strong Atheism". Also, perhaps the article could mention that Anti-Theism can act as an umbrella and uniter for all non-theists that are opposed to "Theism". I have allready done this in fact, and within a few hours it was deleted.</p>
<p>I was also thinking that the "Militant Atheism" section should be perhaps delated, or at least mentioned as one form of anti-theism. Because the article as awhole seems to point back to the "militant atheism", as if Strong or Militant Atheists have a monopoly on the term "Anti-theism", frankly- they don't and should not. The term belongs to ALL non-theists whom oppose theism{including agnostics and deists}. Atheists can be simply Adeists{opposed to all concepts of "god"-whether as first cause and impersonal,etc; or whether as a theistic,anthropomorphic sky-parent} and be simultaneously "Anti-Theists". I am a deist, but also proudly a Anti-Thiest, I would like to see the term "anti-theist" be shared in the public domain as something that any non-theist can be, not JUST Militant Atheists.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<dd>Just a note that theists can be antitheists, while theists can't be atheists. I can be against theism, while still being a theist, just as I can be against sexism, but still be sexist. I agree that the article talks about atheism too much, as antitheism isn't inherently atheistic, but the reason for this is most likely because people often equate atheism with antitheism. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 02:24, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I vote against merging these two articles, although maybe we should merge both with atheism. The antitheism article may need independent merging with atheism (which is a better article) but since theistic religions are a subset of all religions, these clearly are not the same thing. It may be the antirelgion article should also be merged with the atheism article but then broken back out under a different name, since it is essentially a list of professed strong atheists, not really much of an explanation of antireligion (whatever that is!)--<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 14:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I too suggest that they not be merged. To my understanding, in the simplest of terms, Atheism, Antitheism, and Antireligion mean the following:</p>
<p>Atheism: a personal disbelief in the existence of god or a divine entity.</p>
<p>Antitheism: a strong opposition to the belief in any god as well as to those who do believe.</p>
<p>Antireligion: a view that religion, especially organized religions, can be dangerous, separative, and/or destructive.</p>
<p>Assuming these simple definitions are correct, someone who is an Antitheist must also be, by definition, an Atheist. However, you would not have to be an Atheist or Antitheist to be an Antireligionist, although one could also assume that most Antireligionists probably are, at the very least, Atheists.</p>
<p>They seem quite different to me and therefore I think they should not be merged. (Some more Antireligion wikinfo would be nice.) --Formadmirer 02:56, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Merging the two different concepts would cause problems. Many believers of non-theistic religions are antitheistic but not antireligion. I will take down the tag now unless an argument is made for merging. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 02:19, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
