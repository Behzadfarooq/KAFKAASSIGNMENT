<p>Wright's current model of the mechanism contains more than 70 gears. However, this is because this model includes the motions of all the inferior and superior planets known to the Ancient Greeks. Wright included these into his model to demonstrate how easy it would have been to build such a mechanism.</p>
<p>However, there isn't any remaining physical evidence in the Antikythera mechanism that supports the proposal that it modelled the motion of all these planets.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Martin and I have been closely involved with the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project as part of the X-Tek team. The Project is trying to publish its findings as quickly as possible, but there is so much to do. We have just published some FAQ's on the <a href="http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;task=cat&amp;catid=32&amp;Itemid=33" class="external text" title="http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;task=cat&amp;catid=32&amp;Itemid=33" rel="nofollow">Project website</a>. Hopefully these will clarify some issues. The Project is aware that while the Wikipedia entry for the Mechanism has a lot of useful and detailed information, it also has some mistakes, and is a little chaotic. With your patience I will attempt to tidy up this entry, and correct those mistakes we are aware of. In the first instance I want to tidy up the References section and add a number more. I can then use these to start to tidy up the general content. I anticipate that it is going to take some time to complete this, and from the number of previous comments, and the level of general interest, I anticipate plenty of discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_Allen_f4f7.html" title="User:Martin Allen">Martin Allen</a> 17:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect the author of that bit based it on the general notion that a lot of classical knowledge was lost to the West and only brought back there after being found, translated, preserved and developed by those in the Islamic world (which is what I assume you're saying "scarcely existed" - the Arab world was of course rather densely populated, having served as the seat of civilisation in the region - though it must have been difficult in those times with "no culture", whatever that means.). That route of information transmission is pretty well documented in general and doesn't need specific evidence here. The bit about the possible (re)provenance of clockmaking technology via that Arabic route can thus be restated and possibly reinserted, or it could go in an expanded <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clockwork.html" title="Clockwork">clockwork</a> article, which links here. - <a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7EToh_d97d.html" title="User:Toh">toh</a> 04:54, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is today the "Arab World" was densely populated, but Mesopotamia and the Levant were not "Arab" until after 900 AD. The Arabs were a nomadic tribal people sparsely populating the fringes of the Arabian peninsula. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Delong1974 (<a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelong1974_5c4b.html" title="User talk:Delong1974">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delong1974_c1f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delong1974">contribs</a>) 16:10, 21 October 2005.</small></dd>

<dd>Your statement is absolutely unfounded and rediculous. Assyro-Babylonian culture that existed in a highly complex form in the third millennium BCE gave birth to an incredible chain of cultures that carried on its heritage. Sumerian and Uruk in what we would now identify as the Arab World were in close contact with later Hittite and Syrian cultures, as well as the Canaanites who were known to the Greeks, and thus to the Romans, as Phoenicians (meaning something close to "the purple people" for the brilliant purple dye they extracted from sea-dwelling crustaceans and stained their clothes with). Walter Burkert, for one, has shown through high-quality and extensive scholarship that much of the vaccuum left by the destruction of pre-Greek cultures in Greece during the late second millennium BCE was filled via contact with the Phoenicians; the Greek alphabet, for instance, is derivative of Phoenician. Greek, as Burkert writes, had the good fortune to be adopted and maintained by later cultures, namely the Romans. You may be right to question the authenticity of the claim that this technology was transmitted FROM what you call the Arab World, but as for the rest of your post, you are misinformed at best. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_iarwain_308d.html" title="User:Ben iarwain">Ben iarwain</a> 03:23, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously the original statement is absurd; the "Arab world" in the article obviously refers to the preservation and extension of Greek and Roman learning by the Islamic world during the European Dark Ages. But it's almost as absurd to use of "Arab world" to refer to areas outside Arabia in pre-Islamic Roman times (I'm referring to the "we would now identify as the Arab World"); these cultures were Semitic but not Arab. Callng pre-Islamic Syria or Mesopotamia "Arab" makes as much sense as calling Phoenician Carthage or Celtic Britain "Roman". --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 05:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right. An edit rather than a removal might have been in order, then, in the first place. Anyway, I understand what you mean much better now, and had been taken aback at first, getting the sense that you meant something altogether different.

This is a really informative, well written article with a solid refrence and link section.

<dd>The information in the Price paragraph you extracted is needed in the portion which remains—splatting half of it in the intro and leaving the rest dangling in a section halfway down a long page was poor placement indeed.

<dd>In any case the omission of Derek Price from the introduction raises a problem, in that the subsequent section talks about "Price's X-ray analysis" without telling us about this mysterious "Price" person, or about his X-ray analysis.

<dd>To be fair, the terms <i>are</i> confusing. By modern standards "analog computers" are not computers at all, since <i>computer</i> has evolved to mean a more-or-less "universal machine" that can run "any" program (with some caveats), regardless of the nature of its construction. In modern parlance, an analog computer could be considered a physical implementation of a single program; more like an advanced calculator than a computer.</dd>
<dd>All this notwithstanding, "analog computer" means what it means, and by that meaning the Antikythera mechanism is definitely an analog computer. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 22:17, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anti-European rants aside, the difference is obvious: a mechanism for calculation has a different purpose from a mechanism for marking time. Calling something a computer has nothing to do with modern electronic computers - in the past the term "computer" was even used for people who did calculations. It's arguable that a mechanical computer needs to be programmable to be a computer rather than a calculator, but to some extent this is just sematics of modern interpretation.</p>

<p>The main page describes this as possibly the first analog computer; I think it is better described as possibly the oldest extant, or oldest remains of one.

<dd>That is true, the antikythera device certainly was not the first of its kind since such complex device, much more complex than any other similar devices made in the next 17 centuries, could not come out of nowhere.

<p>Please read the article <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_pointing_chariot.html" title="South pointing chariot">South pointing chariot</a>. That device also used a differential gear - it computed the result of subtracting the number of revolutions made by one wheel of the chariot from the number made by the other - and multiplied the result by a constant to drive the output shaft. It is a geared device - it has a differential and it was around a clear 2500 years before Antikythera. The very best claim for "first" anything has to be that Antikythera is the oldest SURVIVING example of all of those things. We need to tone down the wilder claims here (either that or fix <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_pointing_chariot.html" title="South pointing chariot">South pointing chariot</a> because they can't both be right - and that's a bad thing for an encyclopedia). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the problem here is that there is but vague information on the origin and original design of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_pointing_chariot.html" title="South pointing chariot">South pointing chariot</a>.It could have been first designed in 2634 BC by <a href="../../../h/u/a/Huang_Di_a97a.html" title="Huang Di">Huang Di</a> (The Yellow Emperor), but that man is a quasi-mythical figure whose very existance is disputed, not to mention that he is credited with creating pretty much every element of ancient chinese culture(see <a href="../../../h/u/a/Huang_Di_a97a.html" title="Huang Di">Huang Di</a> ), or that it is claimed he achieved immortality after "physical" death at the age of 111.The article <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_pointing_chariot.html" title="South pointing chariot">South pointing chariot</a> thne lists many different dates when the south pointing chariot is said to be reinvented, but without any details or citations.I think we should research the chariot further before making any comparisons. --<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsone_ca26.html" title="User:Jsone">Jsone</a> 11:54, 13 June 2006 (UTC) first extant/surviving, wld be correct as the BBC article explicitely states there must have been other&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 10:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC) I agree that the 2634 BC date for the SPC is open to doubt - but there is a second report at 1115 BC that suggests it was well-known at that time. I agree that the Wikipedia article on SPC is poorly cited - but I've read about this device in a number of other places (which I should really take the time to look up and cite!) - this isn't just the figment of some Wikipedian's imagination. The thing that seems believable about the chariot is that it's NOT magic - it's a very achievable technology for the time. You only need four gear wheels to implement it (five if you aren't careful about your choice of wheel diameters and the length of the axles), I've built one out of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Lego</a> in about 10 minutes flat. It's a remarkable thing to watch - even when you know how it works it seems almost magical. If the inner workings were hidden the people of the time would have been totally amazed by it. You drag the thing around on a reasonably flat surface and no matter how much you twist and turn, the figure of the emperor continually points in the exact same direction. It's not a PRACTICAL device because wheel slippage would cause it to lose accuracy alarmingly quickly on the roads of the time - and the 'algorithm' it uses fails on hilly terrain. But it would have been a seemingly magical device for an emperor to use to impress people with his god-like powers. It has a strong ring of truth to it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 13:55, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This topic is not about the discussion if it was the first diferential gear, but if it was the first analog computer.--201.34.90.199 22:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK - but what is your definition of "an analog computer"&#160;? The <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_computer.html" title="Analog computer">Analog computer</a> article says: "An analog computer is a form of computer that uses electrical or mechanical phenomena to model the problem being solved by using one kind of physical quantity to represent another." - and a differential gear uses a mechanical phenomena to compute the function (A-B)*C - where C is a constant. So anything that has a differential gear (such at the SPC) is a minimal analog computer. The Antikythera device has more gears and evaluates a much more complex function - but it's not different in principle. Of course one can find other examples of analog (or even digital) devices that could be said to meet the criteria. When the first human added up the number of bananas they just picked using his or her fingers, they were using a mechanical phenomenon to model the problem of the total number of bananas collected...so I guess that's an analog computer by this definition. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:53, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The south pointing chariot was problably invented in the first millenium and even if it was not, we do not have any surviving examples of it so it can be concluded that this device is the most ancient preserved analog computer.--201.66.131.235 18:09, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Preserved complete at the Museum of History of Science at Oxford is a 13th-century Islamic geared calendar-computer that has various periods built into it, so that it shows on dials the various cycles of the sun and moon. This design can be traced back, with slightly different periods but a similar arrangement of gears, to a manuscript written by the astronomer al-Biruni about 1000 A.D. Such instruments am much simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, but they show so many points of agreement in technical detail that it seems clear they came from a common tradition. The same 60-degree gear teeth are used; wheels are mounted on square-shanked axles; the geometrical layout of the gear assembly appears comparable. It was just at this time that Islam was drawing on Greek knowledge and rediscovering ancient Greek texts. It seems likely that the Antikythera tradition was part of a large corpus of knowledge that has since been lost to us but was known to the Arabs.

<p>first extant/surviving, wld be correct as the BBC article explicitly states there must have been other devices previously made by the same people, as they knew what they were doing. which is a minor point in that they might have been say a year before, but this (me hypothesising here, not the BBC) surely this also implies a long 'development period' of similar tho less complex devices. also, more importantly this device is not a computer because its single purpose. doesn't use stored program concept. this is not quibbling, it's <i>in principle</i> a different kind of machine than even a simple anolog computer. hvaen't read it properly but the analog computer article doesn't seem to explain this very well.&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 10:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking this case.</p>
<p>We have a problem with the Greek version of the name of the <i>Antikythera mechanism</i>. Let me provide some background:</p>
<p>Users contributed to the Greek name such as: (I copy and paste some examples from the History page of the article for your convenience):</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/j/g/User%7ECJGB_4c70.html" title="User:CJGB">user:CJGB</a> m (tweak transliteration) <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETasoskessaris_38af.html" title="User:Tasoskessaris">user:Tasoskessaris</a> (added Greek version again. The Greek version is important a) Because the mechanism is Greek b) It is wikipedia article policy to include the version of the native language the article item comes from.)</p>
<p><b>but</b> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">user:Mikkalai</a> keeps reverting these edits with the following comments:</p>
<p>Mikkalai (greek translation of the title is irrelevant: it is neither a propoer name nor a historical term)</p>
<p>to which I replied: Tasoskessaris (It does not have to be proper name or term. If you go to the Athens museum you must know its Greek name. Knowledge is never bad.)</p>
<p>And he reverted back with the comment: Mikkalai (title translation in greek: wikipedia is not dictionary. There are thousands of things in Greek museum)</p>
<p>My position is:</p>
<p>a) It is Wikipedia tradition to provide the version of the title of an article in the language of the country the item originated from as well as a transliteration of the foreign terms. In fact in many articles about Greek topics such as <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athena.html" title="Athena">Athena</a> words are often translated in Greek to enhance the experience of the reader, for example: <i>virgin (parthenos);</i> (pasted from the Athena article).</p>
<p>b) Even though this term: <i>Antikythera mechanism</i> might not be the original Greek term, this is how it is called today in Greece by the Greek people and <i>therefore it does have a valid, unique and recognizable name in its country of origin</i>, therefore in observing the Wikipedia tradition and because this item is Greek and has a valid Greek name that is used and recognized with in its country of origin and, through its exact translation, abroad, we must include the Greek name version and a transliteration of it in the article, based on Wikipedia tradition and practice, that in itself is based on knowledge and cultural enhancement reasons.</p>
<p><a name="Supporting_Evidence:" id="Supporting_Evidence:"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAntikythera_mechanism_71b8.html" title="Edit section: Supporting Evidence:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Supporting Evidence:</span></h4>
<p>Providing local language terms for article items originating in foreign countries is widespread in Wikipedia so I am only going to include a few representative cases.</p>
<p>Please look at a similar article link: <a href="../../../z/y/t/Zytglogge.html" title="Zytglogge">Zytglogge</a>, the local German term is provided.</p>
<p>In the section: <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomical_clock.html#Lund" title="Astronomical clock">Astronomical_clock#Lund</a> that has a name provided in Latin <i>Horologium mirabile Lundense</i> that simply means the <i>marvelous Lund clock</i> and I am sure even though the natives don't call it that because they don't speak Latin, it is still in the article because of <i>knowlegdge</i> enhancement reasons.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Further evidence:</b></p>
<p>This item isn't even named and despite that it has a translation in Russian: <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin_towers.html#First_Unnamed" title="Kremlin towers">Kremlin_towers#First_Unnamed</a>. But it doesn't end there: There is a second unnamed item with a full Russian translation: <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin_towers.html#Second_Unnamed" title="Kremlin towers">Kremlin_towers#Second_Unnamed</a>.</p>
<p>Notice also that the Russian terms in the above examples come without transliteration. So why are they there? For the average English speaker the Cyrillic alphabet is incomprehensible yet Wikipedia icludes them in the article even without transliteration. Why? Clearly for <i>cultural enhancement reasons</i>. Also the item described therein is Russian and if you go to Russia you might recognize the foreign alphabet pattern and thank Wikipedia for it. That's what Wikipedia is all about in my opinion: <i>Promoting knowledge through cultural boundaries</i>.</p>
<p><i>In conclusion: Whenever there is a local term describing an object originating in a foreign country this object's article on Wikipedia should include the local term.</i></p>
<p>I could go on and on but I will leave this to your judgement. However if you require further evidence please do let me know.</p>

<dd>I mentioned the word judgement as it refers to your arbitration decision.

<p>As I wrote in edit summaries, this is not a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_name.html" title="Proper name">proper name</a> neither it is a specifically Greek term. Yes, there are thousands of articles that include locan names of places, persons, institutions, etc. But it would be ridiculous to translate every artice about Greece in Greek.

And by the way, <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin_towers.html#First_Unnamed" title="Kremlin towers">First Unnamed tower</a> is actually the <b>name</b> of the tower (and I know several Russian streets and rivers named Unnamed Street, Unnamed River, also persons, volcanoes mountain peaks and many other. In some cases they are transliterated, in others translated). I our case the word is "mechanism" (found near Antikythera), just like <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_de_Milo_d280.html" title="Venus de Milo">Venus de Milo</a> is statue of <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus.html" title="Venus">Venus</a> found in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milos.html" title="Milos">Milos</a>.

<p>A side note: I understand a special position of Greek language in European civilization and the corresponding enthusiam in this respect. But sometimes it goes a bit too much.

<dd>Hi Mikka, thanks for your remarks. I'll try to make my case.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's analyze why is the Cyrillic version given for the <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin_towers.html#First_Unnamed" title="Kremlin towers">First Unnamed tower</a>&#160;? How can a non Russian understand Cyrillic? It is given because part of Wikipedia culture is to promote transboundary cultural exchange and information where warranted. The Greek articles you suggested are also eligible for including the Greek name versions. In fact I just added the Greek names in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Civil_War_e2ef.html" title="Greek Civil War">Greek Civil War</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Hellenic_Navy_02f1.html" title="History of the Hellenic Navy">History of the Hellenic Navy</a> articles. Thanks for the suggestion&#160;:). For the mechanism of the present article, the word Antikythera and mechanism combined form its name. No different than the <i>no name towers</i> in Russia. It may lack imagination but it is a name. Its name in Greek is well accepted, established and part of the Greek culture. Again there is ample precedent in Wikipedia to include foreign language name versions where applicable. This tradition should be followed in the Antikythera mechanism article as well.

<p>May I ask why this mechanism is considered to be of Greek origin? I understand it was found on a Roman vessel, and is only DESCRIBED in Greek sources, but it's construction is neither described, nor applied in Greece. According to this article <a href="http://users.otenet.gr/~garof/hoc.html" class="external free" title="http://users.otenet.gr/~garof/hoc.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.otenet.gr/~garof/hoc.html</a> Ancient Greek city states did not use the calendar as depicted by the mechanism. It seems to me that to find the place of manufacture, one needs to look for a culture that used all possible calculations which can be achieved by the mechanism. The fact that the mechanism has Greek inscriptions does not make it Greek either. If I purchase a laptop made in France, I don't expect to have to learn French to operate it, or to even read instructions on its use! It seem there is an important clue to the origin of the mechanism in its calculation of the Metonic cycle. Which cultuure around the Eastern Mediterranean used this cycle c.300 BCE? --Mrg3105 21:56, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the Metonic cycle is named after the Athenian Greek astronomer <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meton.html" title="Meton">Meton</a>. Therefore, Greek influence on some level may be assumed. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunSw0rd_22e3.html" title="User:SunSw0rd">SunSw0rd</a> 19:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, this is obvious, but it was not named Metonic because Meton invented the cycle. Did Greeks use the 'metonic' cycle? Did anyone else use/continue to use this cycle?--Mrg3105 21:17, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tasoskessaris is mistaken when he asserts that it's common practice to "provide the version of the title of an article in the language of the country the item originated from as well as a transliteration of the foreign terms". If you look at the articles listed under <a href="../../../a/r/c/Category%7EArchaeological_artefacts_9530.html" title="Category:Archaeological artefacts">Category:Archaeological artefacts</a> you'll see that this is simply not the case, even for other ancient Greek artefacts such as the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_of_Agamemnon_310a.html" title="Mask of Agamemnon">Mask of Agamemnon</a> or the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pella_katadesmos.html" title="Pella katadesmos">Pella katadesmos</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phaistos_Disc_3d6c.html" title="Phaistos Disc">Phaistos Disc</a> is the only comparable example I can find. One example is not a "tradition".</p>
<p>Furthermore, I honestly don't know what is gained by including a local name that is a direct equivalent of the English name. There might be some point in including the name if it was something radically different from the English equivalent (e.g. if the Antikythera mechanism was called the "West Aegean Wonder" or something else in Greek). But what is the benefit to the reader of knowing that the Greeks call the Antikythera mechanism the Antikythera mechanism? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 18:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, and most importantly - we don't know the original Greek name for the device. If we did then giving its greek name would be useful - indeed essential. Some scholar of the greek language might understand some subtlety in the original name that might be absent from its translated form because translation is an inexact matter - so information would be lost by omitting it. However we don't know the real name given to it. The device is currently named after the place nearest to where it was found by the guys who found it. That's a completely arbitary thing - it tells you <i>nothing</i> about the device whatever. So knowing the greek name for that place doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. We don't generally translate place names when they are just mentioned in passing (That's why there are 15,867 references to 'Belgium' and only 22, 299 and 39 references to Belgie, Belgique and Belgien (respectively)). So I would <i>not</i> have bothered to find out the greek name and stick it into the article. However, I don't see any harm in leaving it there either (so long as the information is correct). 99.99% of readers will simply gloss over it and the 0.01% that don't will (by definition) have found it useful in some mysterious way. It costs Wikipedia about a millionth of a US cent to store and transmit it - and we've just blown that by writing all of this debate. However, this edit war is a waste of everyone's time and the argument needs to end here and now so that the protagonists can spend their precious Wiki-hours doing something more productive. IMHO: Leave it in there...it's not actually hurting our readership or the guy who doesn't want it there. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:57, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>I agree</b> with SteveBaker's final conclusion even though I disagree with his points. Overall his conclusion is very useful and pragmatic. It would save us time if we reached an agreement and dedicated more of our time to Wikipedia. In the examples cited by ChrisO, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_of_Agamemnon_310a.html" title="Mask of Agamemnon">Mask of Agamemnon</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pella_katadesmos.html" title="Pella katadesmos">Pella katadesmos</a>, one could seamlessly edit in the Greek names, it is actually a great idea, following the practice in many other articles as, for example, the Greek islands such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antikythera.html" title="Antikythera">Antikythera</a>, Gods of Olympus as for example <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athena.html" title="Athena">Athena</a>, all the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> articles, and yes and thanks for the link: <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phaistos_Disc_3d6c.html" title="Phaistos Disc">Phaistos Disc</a>. In these cited examples the Greek name is often a direct translation of the English term yet it is still included, as in Byzantine Empire the Greek translation doesn't translate in Greek as anything but Byzantine Empire. I realize one article such as <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phaistos_Disc_3d6c.html" title="Phaistos Disc">Phaistos Disc</a> does not make a tradition about Greek artifacts but in the absence of more artifact related articles one could make a case about the usage of foreign terms in general in any article. Our quest here at Wikipedia is Knowledge. Knowing the native language versions serves to broaden our cultural and linguistic horizons and sheds a native light, ever so remote, on the featured item that enriches its background. It is our <i>made in Wikipedia</i> version of the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosetta_stone.html" title="Rosetta stone">Rosetta stone</a>. That is why I would never oppose this for any foreign item, artifact, person etc. Anyway my vote is in. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETasoskessaris_38af.html" title="User:Tasoskessaris">Dr.K.</a> 20:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't have to convince me. It is not life and death for me. I stated my point and I am retiring from this discussion.</dd>
<dd>Also, I don't quite understand why the issue was jumped right into a mediation. Mediation is a step when two people could not agree in talk page. It is true that none of us started using talk page immediately, but in the future if one of the two opponents has more common sense to go beyound "edit summary", then I would suggest to start from the article talk page rather than from bureauceratic tools. In absense of serious conflict, mediation is waste of third person's time and clutter of the talk page.

<p>Another perspective here I hope will be useful. I am a professor of (ancient) Greek language &amp; literature who absolutely <i>loves</i> adding Greek names to articles whose subjects have a long history in the Greek language. But here I was one of the ones who got rid of the Greek (without realizing that there was a big brouhaha going on over here). And I'd have thought it would be an obvious &amp; uncontroversial move. I wonder if there really is a policy to put something "in the language of the country the item originated from." The problem with this, in a case like this one where we have no ancient texts referring to the article subject, is that it gives the false impression that we <i>do</i> have such texts. In other words, the Greek phrase in the article now is a misleading <i>fiction</i>. (I'm not saying that a Greek newspaper might not have used the term in the last year, but, are we really supposed to put in a foreign-language term for an ancient object because a Greek newspaper mentioned it in the last year?) The real equivalent to what's been done here would be to add the <b>Arabic</b> word for the pyramids in the article <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_pyramids.html" title="Egyptian pyramids">Egyptian pyramids</a>. That would be "in the (modern or unhistorically-produced-by-moderns) language of the country the item originated from." I can't parse the above as to whether a decision has been made to support this on a policy level, but I think it'd be a misguided policy. I won't edit this out again, but it's embarrassingly unscholarly and historically misleading. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 22:07, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many people have been asking about whether this device could have been used for astrology. One of the researchers answered 'no' in an interview on the grounds that astrology had not yet caught on at the time of its dating (early 1st century BC). It depends on who owned the instrument - technical astrology certain was flourishing in the Greek language in the 1st century, and likely a little earlier if we accept accounts of Berossus bringing Babylonian astrology to Greece and the dating of other works to 2nd century BC. The interviewee may have been thinking of astrology specifically in Rome. So I don't think it can be dismissed as having an astrological purpose. Maybe they are slightly off with the dating and it is really late 1st century BC. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:32, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. A better question would be whether the individual or individuals who created it, or commissioned it's creation, intended for it to be used for astrology. Because clearly a device that can calculate astrological phenomena has astrological uses. But it also has use as a calendar, not to mention being a technical marvel for its complexity and the ingenuity of its creators. Unfortunately, barring new archaelogical finds it's unlikely we'll ever know the actual intent of the creators, even if we know the function it was capable of performing.</dd>
<dd>With all our means of timekeeping today, I suppose it is hard to fathom exactly how many applications might have been interested in such devices; we know the obvious applications (astrology, astronomy), but also agriculture (predicting moon phases), seafaring (tides and star positions), cartography (shape of the world), and even rudimentary (though ultimately flawed) attempts at weather prediction (remember, it was the weather that prompted the resurgence of computation devices in more recent history). 12.104.195.112 22:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think trying to decide whether this device was (or could be) used for astrological purposes is futile, because the distinction between astrology and astronomy is a fairly recent one and the dividing line between them tends to be to some extent culturally defined. Advances in what we now call astronomy have always been used in astrology because both seek to enable prediction through the observation and calculation of cycles (though their interpretations of what the data actually allows you to predict have little in common). 67.170.148.111 04:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In light of previous comments and breaking news, I think the "Function and purpose" section should be rewritten. Much of what is in there now really belongs under the history of study. —<a href="../../../d/%C5%82/u/User%7ED%C5%82ugosz_4930.html" title="User:Długosz">Długosz</a></p>
<p>Your article contains a suggestion that the wreck of the Roman ship in which this device was found may have been plunder being sent to Rome by Iulius Caesar. That appeared to me to be incorrect. In the first place, your article states that the wreck was believed to have occurred in the period 150-100 BCE. Iulius Caesar was either not yet born then, or was an infant. Later, however, contradicting the earlier, imprecise dating, it dates the wreck to 80 BCE. My understanding is that Caesar could not have been sending plunder to Rome at that time, either. To check my recollection, i consulted your page on Iulius Caesar. In 80 BCE, Caesar was a minor military commander, without independent military command, and was seconded to the King of Bythinia. He did not return to Rome until after the death of Sulla in 78 BCE. Therefore, your article on Caesar (and my understanding of ancient history) contradicts the contention that the Roman ship in the wreck of which the Antikythera Mechanism was found could have been plunder being sent to Rome by Iulius Caesar.</p>

<p>The references were a mess - so I cleaned house a bit. To avoid making such a horrible mess again, would contributors please note that:</p>
<ol>
<li>We use the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite...}}&lt;/ref&gt; format for references embedded in the text.</li>
<li>Things that make interesting reading but which are not explicitly referred to in the text are <b>Further Reading</b> (if they are books, magazines, etc) or <b>External Links</b> (if they are web sites). You should still use the {{cite...}} format for these things so they have a nice uniform formatting.</li>
<li>For web sites, we <b>NEED</b> an 'accessdate' field so that should the link 'die' because the owner removed or renamed it, somone stands a chance of finding it using the Internet archive (aka The Wayback Machine).</li>

<dd>Thanks for that - however, I have to disagree with the further reading part. I've fixed it per MOS, and have explaine dmy rationale in the edit summary (references are books, books are to read &amp; therefore are "further reading"). Simple explaination, but basically they are one in the same. All other similar FA's I've taken part in have a similar style, so I'm sure you won't mind the change.

<p>As a part of major referencing cleanup, I renamed the section containing the &lt;references/&gt; tag to be ==References== (rather than 'Footnotes') in accordance with the example in the MOS section that specifically covers this part of the document and the referencing style this article now uses (post-cleanup): <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#Footnotes" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Footnotes</a> - whilst the MOS sometimes uses the word 'footnotes' and elsewhere 'references' to describe these things, it is clear from the example that what they expect to see in the article itself is the section heading 'References' and then the references tag. This change was reverted - and I'm now re-reverting it on the basis of what the most applicable part of the MOS actually says. I have gotten two articles through FA to the front page (one just a couple of weeks ago) by doing it this way - I think I know the rules!</p>
<p>But it makes sense my way - 'References' are (by definition) things to which we referred. In your version of things, everything in the 'References' section were books to which we absolutely DID NOT REFER. In that regard, they are like 'External Links' - they are things we think people might like to read - but they are definitely not 'references'. So - your "References" must become something else "Further reading" is a common heading used in lots of articles. The "Footnotes" section is a long-obsolete Wiki convention that is superceded in almost every FA you look at over the last six months by the section heading "Reference".</p>
<p>I've reverted those changes accordingly. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 04:55, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
