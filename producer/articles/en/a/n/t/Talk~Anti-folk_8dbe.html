<p>I'm inclined to argue that anti-folk is not a genre. The claims that the article make that anti-folk is a combination of punk and folk styles is something I don't see at all. I find most things to be considered "anti-folk" to be totally indistinguishable from folk music. Perhaps the only difference is the urban-centrism in the themes, but stylistically it's folk music. Artists that actually do combine folk and punk already have a genre in <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk-punk.html" title="Folk-punk">folk-punk</a>. It is pretty evident with these artists how much punk has influenced the music. But I think a lot of people who've encountered it would agree that anti-folk is mostly a New York City-based scene of folk musicians. The term "anti-folk" just seems like a historical residue as the term was adopted as a result of some schism between NYC folk musicians and Bob Dylan back some 30 odd years ago. So even at that moment, the term was meant to define a scene not a genre. I'd like to hear other opinions on this cause I don't think the article defines anti-folk as accurately as it could. -Anonymous Peruser, 11/26/05</p>
<p>PS Ghost Mice and This Bike is a Pipe Bomb are definitively not a part of the anti-folk scene. They are so obviously part of the folk-punk scene/genre that it's really absurd to have them as a link to anti-folk.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with the post above. This is at most a scene, not a genre. I'd argue it should be identified as a scene or, at most, subgenre. And yeah, Pipebomb and Ghost Mice are "folk punk," which I don't think deserves genre status, either. --<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsbojos_6e9c.html" title="User:Osbojos">Osbojos</a> 04:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly disagree with the suggestion that punk isn't an influence on antifolk. Certainly it's a big influence on the UK scene (being based in London, I find it harder to comment on the New York scene.) I think it depends on how you define punk. To me, the key factor of punk was less the 'sound' of punk music but more the 'attitude' (i.e. direct, abrasive songs inspired by everyday life, a Do-It-Yourself philosphy and a belief that the songwriter's performance and storytelling are more important than musical talent). In this respect punk is clearly a major influence on antifolk. Folk-punk differs in that it borrows from punk's sound far more than its attitude.</p>

<p>I'm in some agreement with the above, scene, not genre arguement. In the 1980's the scene developed around a small handful of artists, namely <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lach.html" title="Lach">Lach</a>, Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Manning_23a4.html" title="Roger Manning">Roger Manning</a>, and maybe Billy Syndrome. These people toured widely, got airplay on college radio, and called themselves anti-folk long before many of the people named in this article were performers.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to find a place to insert their story into the current article which seems to be full of speculation. Any suggestions? -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 02:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please note that though Billy Bragg also comes from a Punk-background and plays somewhat folkish music he is not Antifolk, which is a North American (actually very New York City centered) phenomenom that developed since the mid1980s. Also, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Country_50bf.html" title="Alternative Country">Alternative Country</a> must be distinguished from Antifolk, as it comes from a different scene (or actually different scenes), and has a stronger emphasis on country (and blues) influences than on 1950s/1960s US-folk. As opposed to Antifolk, there is no deliberate emphasis on diletantism or humor. Irony - if you find it at all - is usually expressed in a different way. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbD_f22d.html" title="User:BarbD">BarbD</a> 11:41, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

They say, "Finding inspiration in the righteous anger of punk rock and the socially conscious folk tradition of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg was the leading figure of the anti-folk movement of the '80s." As the folks at allmusic are fairly respected music journalists, unless you can find some counter-example, I would think Bragg should be mentioned in the article.

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I've seen that in the "Rock Snob's dictionary," but I've never found a basis for it. If you look at the subtitle for Bragg's <i>Back to Basics,</i> (the collection of his early back catalog)it describes these as <i>songs from the roots of urbane folk music.</i> His earl music certainly parralleled anti-folk in influences and additude though which may warrant mention. There are two stories regarding the origin of Anti-folk. In one the phrase was coined by Lach<a href="http://www.antifolk.net/archive/Voice.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antifolk.net/archive/Voice.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but in a somewhat more belivable account,<a href="http://www.antifolkonline.com/CindyLeeBerryhillInterview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antifolkonline.com/CindyLeeBerryhillInterview.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> it was coined by Cindy Lee Berryhill (who sill lacks a wikipedia article). I've been meaning to get in here and do some writing about the early NYC anti-folk scene, but just haven't found the time. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 21:30, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Beck was part of the "Anti-Folk" movement of the late 80's-early 90's as well, and could be called its earliest breakout success. Early articles on Beck in SPIN magazine talk about his affiliations to Anti-Folk in the NYC coffeehouse scene. Someone may also want to mention Jeff Buckley.</p>
<p>As for the controversy of "scene/movement vs. genre", well, it sounds to me like the same elitist snobbery that old-school London and NYC punks express when they insist that punk rock (and the "scene" thereof) died with the Sex Pistols and thus everything afterwords is not really "punk". The argument doesn't hold water. I'm sure a lot of the first generation rock n' rollers also refused to consider the Beatles rock n' roll. Genres aren't trademarks. The Anti-Folk of today may not be exactly the same as the Anti-Folk that a little clique of NYC hipsters "invented" in the late 1980s, but that doesn't mean its not covering similar musical and cultural ground, and it doesn't mean people today can't identify with the term (or be associated with it).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're pretty much right. I think the term initially applied to a small handful of artist and may now mean something different entirely. Beck indeed came and joined the NYC scene not long after it started, then moved back out west to find much greater success than any of his NYC pals. That said, to have an article that doesn't mention the early "hipsters" is akin to writing the history of punk rock and not mentioning the Sex Pistols. I don't think the early artist hold any snobbery, pretty much any attempt to define Anti-folk has been qualified with, "Anti-folk is whatever it wants to be." -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 20:12, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Go for it. I've been thinking the same thing. Its kinda hard to verify any of the artists constantly being added to the list. A category might attract a little less attention and help us keep the page from becoming a red link farm. I would drop the word "noted," though since it gets hard to define.

<p>I'm sure that there are some who have called anti-folk talentless, but without a citation, that's not saying anything. performers of every genre have been called talentless, I don't see how this complaint deserves mention unless it is cited or some evidence is provided that it is made more often about anti-folk than any other genre.</p>

<p>I would question whether "The Lucksmiths, Darren Hanlon, Jodi Phillis and The Mabels" would be considered antifolk by anyone. A folky pop music or poppy folk music, yes, but hardly anti folk. I think the australian Antifolk scene is better represented by bands like Singing Sadie, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Waver_0245.html" title="New Waver">New Waver</a>, and bands on labels like dualplover.</p>

<p>The "Criticims" section contains one unsourced criticism, and the rest of the section does not take a NPOV. It reads like an apologist's letter: "This criticism is wrong because..."

<p>Now I make no claim to be fully versed in the histories and mythologies of the antifolk genre/style whatever you call it, but does it seem to anyone else that the fourth parageaph is sheer POV nonsense? Saying that it is a:</p>
<p>"very pretentious genre fabricated by spoiled, self loathing rich kids. They have no love for music existing before 1980. They live in Williamsburg on their trust funds, and sit around thinking about how clever and ironic they are. They read dark novels because they feel they are supposed to, in order to meet their core requirements of counter culture. However, it should be noted that they are large in number. In fact, they are no longer a minority. They ARE the mainstream, which they have hated for so long because it rejected them. They have as much credibility as a Hot Topic store in a suburban mall, a refuge from which many of them came. Why do they hate the mainstream? Nobody knows. Not even they do,"</p>
<p>is not encyclopedia worthy. It is merely insulting a music form that an editor did not like, hence POV. I mean, come on, where can we possibly prove any of the points mentioned? Who is to say that all antifolk listeners live in Williamsburg or any of the other claims made by this editor. I am removing the paragraph as it is clear violation of NPOV guidelines and adds little to the article. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJankyalias_4be1.html" title="User:Jankyalias">jankyalias</a> 5:38 3 December 2006</p>
