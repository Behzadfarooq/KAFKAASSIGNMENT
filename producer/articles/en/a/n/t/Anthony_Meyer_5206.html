<p>Meyer's grandfather, Sir <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Meyer_13e9.html" title="Carl Meyer">Carl Ferdinand Meyer</a> was born in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg%2C_Germany_8ee0.html" title="Hamburg, Germany">Hamburg, Germany</a> into a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> family. He migrated to Britain in the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, when he worked for the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rothschild_family.html" title="Rothschild family">Rothschilds</a>, and later for <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Beers_3b1c.html" title="De Beers">De Beers</a>; he eventually became Governor of the National Bank of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and was given a hereditary <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">baronetcy</a> for the large donations he made to found a National Theatre in Britain. Meyer's father, Sir <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Cecil_Meyer_19c0.html" title="Frank Cecil Meyer">Frank Cecil Meyer</a>, was vice-chairman of the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Beers_3b1c.html" title="De Beers">De Beers</a> <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartel.html" title="Cartel">cartel</a>, and from 1924 to 1929 he was Conservative <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Yarmouth_24f3.html" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>.</p>

<p>Anthony Meyer was educated at <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a>, like his father, and he inherited the baronetcy at the age of 15 when his father died in a hunting accident. Like his father, he also attended <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_College%2C_Oxford_e952.html" title="New College, Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, but after one year he joined the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_Guards_b069.html" title="Scots Guards">Scots Guards</a> in 1941, the same year he married Barbadee Knight, and they would have 1 son and 3 daughters. During the battle for <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caen.html" title="Caen">Caen</a>, in the breakout from the <a href="../../../d/-/d/D-Day_72ea.html" title="D-Day">Normandy invasion beaches</a> he was seriously wounded when the tank he was travelling in was hit, and he spent the next nine months on his back in hospital. During this time he read extensively to make up for his lost years at Oxford, but decided not to return to university. Instead, he joined <a href="../../../h/e/r/Her_Majesty%27s_Treasury_1371.html" title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HM's Treasury</a> where he mostly worked on winding up the affairs of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_government-in-exile.html" title="Polish government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a>.</p>

<p>In 1946 he passed the Foreign Service examinations, and from 1951 to 1956 he was appointed to the British Embassy in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, where he became First Secretary in [953. The subsequent appointment to the embassy in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> was not so enjoyable – he did not speak the language, and confined to the "diplomatic ghetto" through the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> government's ban on foreign contacts with its citizens, he said he did not have a job to do. He was rescued by a Soviet attempt to compromise him – he reported an attempt to lure him into a cab by a woman agent to the ambassador, who put Meyer and his family on the next plane home. Between 1958 and 1962, he worked at the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office_9bfa.html" title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">Foreign Office</a> on European political problems, at a time when the Office was changing its policy from being against the "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Market_979a.html" title="Common Market">Common Market</a>" to in favour of Britain's joining it.</p>

<p>The death of his mother in 1962 provided Meyer with the family's wealth, and he decided to enter politics to support his pro-European views. He later said that he was initially undecided whether to stand for the Conservatives or the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>, but his admiration for the Conservative prime minister <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> swung his choice. In 1963 he was selected to fight the constituency of <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_and_Slough_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_1b76.html" title="Eton and Slough (UK Parliament constituency)">Eton and Slough</a>, then held by Labour's leftwing internationalist <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenner_Brockway_7946.html" title="Fenner Brockway">Fenner Brockway</a>. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1964_dac5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1964">1964 General Election</a>, Meyer won the Eton and Slough seat by 11 votes, gaining respect by ignoring his constituency party's advice to campaign on the race issue, which could have swung a number of votes in that constituency at the time. His was one of only two Conservative gains in that election. Recognising that he would only be in the seat temporarily, Meyer made the most of his time in Parliament, advocating Britain's joining the Common Market, strengthening the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and voting to abolish the death penalty. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1966_2c70.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1966">1966 General Election</a> he lost his seat to Labour's Joan Lestor by 4,663 votes.</p>
<p>His liberalism and part-Jewish ancestry made him almost untouchable in the Conservative party, and his applications to stand in six constituencies (including <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Berkshire_8835.html" title="Windsor, Berkshire">Windsor</a>, where he lived) were rejected, but eventually fellow <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Etonian_5fd7.html" title="Old Etonian">Old Etonian</a> Nigel Birch recommended Meyer to replace him in the constituency of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Flintshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7561.html" title="West Flintshire (UK Parliament constituency)">West Flintshire</a>, in north-eastern <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. He returned to Parliament at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1970_cdb2.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1970">1970 General Election</a>.</p>
<p><a name="MP_for_West_Flintshire" id="MP_for_West_Flintshire"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Meyer_5206.html" title="Edit section: MP for West Flintshire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">MP for West Flintshire</span></h3>
<p>He became a popular MP in his new constituency, gaining a reputation for putting the interests of his constituents ahead of those of the Conservative government, e.g. by voting against the closure of the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotton.html" title="Shotton">Shotton</a> steelworks, supporting the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus.html" title="Airbus">Airbus</a> <a href="../../../a/3/0/A300.html" title="A300">A300</a>B whose wings some of his constituents built, against its all-British rival the BAC311, insisting on the importance of an effective pan-European technology. After Labour's return to power in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, he opposed continued sanctions against the white rebel regime in <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia.html" title="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>, claiming that it was intended to transfer power "forcibly to a violent minority".</p>
<p>When the Conservative party returned to power under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in 1979, Meyer's type of pro-Europeanism was at odds with the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euroscepticism.html" title="Euroscepticism">Euroscepticism</a> of the bulk of the party. When his Flintshire West constituency's boundaries were expanded and redrawn to form the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_West_Clwyd_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_4256.html" title="North West Clwyd (UK Parliament constituency)">North West Clwyd</a> constituency in 1983, there was an attempt by local party activists to replace him with the more Thatcherite <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_the_European_Parliament_99f0.html" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beata_Brookes_cbe7.html" title="Beata Brookes">Beata Brookes</a>, whom Meyer managed to defeat. In 1989, Meyer put himself forward as the pro-European <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking_horse.html" title="Stalking horse">stalking horse</a> for the leadership of the Conservative Party, fully expecting that one of the more prominent pro-Europeans such as <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Gilmour_2e44.html" title="Ian Gilmour">Sir Ian Gilmour</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Heseltine_7c96.html" title="Michael Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a> would take over the role; in the event, none of them had the courage to do so, and Meyer had no illusions that he had any chance of success. In the leadership election Meyer was defeated by 314 votes to 33, but when spoilt votes and abstentions were added it was discovered that 60 MPs – a full sixth of the parliamentary party – had failed to support Thatcher. As Meyer said, "people started to think the unthinkable", and Thatcher was ousted the following year.</p>
<p>Meyer was promptly deselected as a candidate for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1992_ac6e.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1992">1992 general election</a> by the Clwyd-North West constituency party for his "treachery", by a 2-1 majority. The deselection campaign was enlivened by a tabloid newspapers' revelation that Meyer had for 26 years had an affair with black former model and blues singer, Simone Washington, who had kept a diary of their sex games. He and his wife (since 1941), Barbadee, could laugh about the affair, which she condoned – when the tabloid press telephoned, Meyer would call out "Darling, it's someone from the <i>Daily Sleaze</i> asking about Simone".</p>

<p>After his forced career change in 1992 Meyer became policy director for the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Movement_310e.html" title="European Movement">European Movement</a>, and in 1998 he defected to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-Euro_Conservative_Party_424f.html" title="Pro-Euro Conservative Party">Pro-Euro Conservative Party</a> before becoming a member of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_%28UK%29_9480.html" title="Liberal Democrats (UK)">Liberal Democrats</a>.
