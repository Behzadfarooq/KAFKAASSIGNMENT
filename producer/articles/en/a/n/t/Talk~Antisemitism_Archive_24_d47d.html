<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early Christianity</span></h2>
<p>I don't think that not wanting christian women to marry jews back in this time should, in itself, be considered antisemitic. They wouldn't have wanted Muslims or Hindus marrying christian women either. Jews were the only other religious group living in europe at that time so that probably explains the rule being explicitly against them. Most orthodox jewish families would disown a daughter if she married a gentile. Nobody labels orthodox jews as anti-gentile for this.</p>

<p>References:</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If we look at the considerable literature available about the position of Jews in the Islamic world, we find two well-established myths. One is the story of a golden age of equality, of mutual respect and cooperation, especially but not exclusively in Moorish Spain; the other is of <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmitude.html" title="Dhimmitude">“dhimmi”-tude</a>, of subservience and persecution and ill treatment. Both are myths. Like many myths, both contain significant elements of truth, and the historic truth is in its usual place, somewhere in the middle between the extremes."cf. Bernard Lewis, <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html" class="external text" title="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html" rel="nofollow">'The New Anti-Semitism'</a>, The American Scholar Journal - Volume 75 No. 1 Winter 2006 pp. 25-36.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewis says these are myths and that like many myths, both contain significant elements of truth and according to Mark Cohen, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, they equally distort the past. ref: Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages. by Mark R. Cohen. Princeton University Press. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-691-01082-X</a>, p.xvii , p.11</p>
<p>Lewis in his book The Jews of Islam listed one of Bat Ye'or books as emphasizing the negative aspects of the Muslim record.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is the only explicit mention of her in the quotes above. "Emphasizing negative aspects" does not even remotely equal "having extreme views and writing myth". What Lewis means is that Bat Ye'or is correct about the facts, but the fact she presents do not amount to a full picture. If anything, this citation confirms Bat Ye'or's standing because in the same footnote to Chapter 1 of <i>The Jews of Islam</i> Lewis reviews works of Antoine Fattal, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Stanley_Tritton_019c.html" title="Arthur Stanley Tritton">Arthur Stanley Tritton</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelomo_Dov_Goitein_a7d2.html" title="Shelomo Dov Goitein">Shelomo Dov Goitein</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a>, and other distinguiahed scholars.

<dd>You can refer to Cohen's book or read <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmitude.html" title="Dhimmitude">Dhimmitude</a> about this term. "The term entered English-language use after the 1996 publication of the book "The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam. From Jihad to Dhimmitude. Seventh-Twentieth Century"[2] and the 2003 followup "Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide"[3] by Bat Ye'or. She is widely thought to have invented the word[4] but she credits assassinated Lebanese Maronite leader Bashir Gemayel for the term."--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:13, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>H.S., the point is that hostility or persecution is not equal to anti-semtism. Anti-Semitism is a theological hostility; to persecute Jews simply because they are Jews. Surely, Christians were also persecuted under <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almohades.html" title="Almohades">Almohades</a>.

<p>H.S. A quote doesn't fix the OR problem. I need to check the source yet. The publisher is New York: HarperCollins Publishers, not a univ press or other ones which particularly publish scholarly books, meaning that it is not peer reviewed. The claim is so strange. In comparison with Christianity Lewis states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"But until fairly modern times there was a much higher degree of tolerance in most of the Islamic lands than prevailed in the Christian world. For centuries, in most of Europe Christians were very busy persecuting each other; in their spare time, they were persecuting Jews and expelling Muslims—all at a time when, in the Ottoman Empire and some other Islamic states, Jews and several varieties of Christians were living side by side fairly freely and comfortably."</dd>

<p>Lewis states that in most respects the position of Dhimmis "was very much easier than that of non-Christians or even of heretical Christians in medieval Europe": for example, in contrast, Dhimmis rarely faced martydom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and with certain exceptions they were free in their choice of residence and profession.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My own 2c of why his argument is not true: TruthSpreader might not agree with this argument though&#160;:) The regulation of Dhimmi, most of it, was designed later, not even by the four khalifa (the pact of Omar was written later). The jizya (Qur'an 9:29) verse refers to particular oath-breaking Jews and Christians at the time of Muhammad. Those Jews happened to worship Ezra as the Son of God, a heretic view, thus Qur'an treated them like polytheist (I have academic references for all these) (next verse to jizya verse: Qur'an 9:30). Thus most of the regulations was written later, partly copied from Byzantium, party from Persian, but initially in an attempt to be tolerant towards Dhimmis. But the problem was that the fair and usual definition of tolerance as understood and applied in pre-modern time was that: "I am in charge. I will allow you some though not all of the rights and privileges that I enjoy, provided that you behave yourself according to rules that I will lay down and enforce." Thus, that theory/practice idea is just off. Of course, later Muslims at times persecuted Jews, no question about that. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:52, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Being oppressive has nothing to do anti-semitism. persecution &lt;&gt; antisemitism. And you are right, antisemtism was not entirely absent as scholars usually assume. I haven't read S. D. Goitein's argument carefully. I just browsed it. I remember Cohen was also pointing out to some signs of existence of antisemitism. You might want to read his book.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit War</span></h2>
<p>First of all, I would like to express my resentment at the assertion in an edit summary that I've promoted any original research here. I reverted the article once for the following reasons, and after all of about a minute and a half of reviewing the new version:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new version appeared to have removed a significant amount of information, which could just as easily have been included with {{fact}} tags, at least long enough for a concerned party to find sources for said information.</li>
<li>The new version appeared to replace what had been on the page (which I had not read in detail) with a copious amount of apparently controversial information, which gave the appearance that the author was replacing sections of the article with his or her own opinions.</li>
<li>The new version had been reverted to several times on the basis that it was the "scholarly" version; where the other version had been reverted to on the basis that the new version was removing too much information. This gave the appearance that the author of the new version was engaged in an edit war with multiple other editors, cementing my belief that he or she was a common vandal.</li>
</ul>
<p>I edited the article as a good faith effort to combat what I had thought was vandalism on Wikipedia. I am now writing this in response to several blunt, rude, and frankly irrelevant comments on my talk page. I would like to apologize for ever becoming involved and step out, encouraging you folks to seek mediation rather than flooding the article history with an edit war. I'd also encourage you to learn to assume good faith. I've stated my reasons for thinking that Aminz was a vandal, and apologized. Evidence that I'm a vandal includes my failure to post here and the fact that some of the content in the version I reverted was sourced. If every removal of sourced content constituted vandalism, Wikipedia comes to a standstill, sorry. But here's my point: I've never read this article in full, I was making a good-faith mistake by reverting it, and I don't appreciate the influx of accusations and abuse on my talk page as a result of my very limited and brief involvement. I've apologized, not much more you can expect from me.</p>

<p>Please point to an specific sentence which was false (per other sourced material you have of course). Please show one poorly sourced material. Also, Dhimmi regulation has nothing to do with Anti-semitism since it was also applied to Christians, Zoroastrians, Hindus etc etc. Antisemtism is a theological hostility towards Jews and Lewis makes it clear *again and again* in his book, the Jews of Islam, that "In Islamic society hostility to the Jew is non-theological. It is not related to any specific Islamic doctrine, nor to any specific circumstance in Islamic sacred history." that it is quite different from Christian antisemtism. Normal Stillman states that during 19th and 20th century the anti-semitic ideas were imported into Muslim lands but were "too new and too palpably foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims" and were only found a reception among Arabic-speaking Christian.

<p>Jayjg, I didn't meant by those sources to prove that statement. But rather to prove it in some cases. Stillman writes that antisemitism ideas when first imported in Muslim lands didn't recieve any reception <b>because they were too new.</b> , yes, again he doesn't say Anti-semtism didn't happen. Lewis says:"President Khatami of Iran, in his interview on CNN, pointed out—correctly—that "anti-Semitism is indeed a Western phenomenon. It has no precedents in Islam or in the East. Jews and Muslims have lived harmoniously together for centuries.", "Prejudices existed in the Islamic world, as did occasional hostility, but not what could be called anti-Semitism..."</p>

<dd>Increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities within the Muslim world during the 19th and 20th centuries <b>introduced anti-Semitic ideas and literature into the region.</b> At first these prejudices only found a reception among Arabic-speaking Christian protégés of the Europeans in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt <b>and were too new and too palpably foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims.</b> However, with the ever-increasing conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine during the period of the British Mandate, the language and imagery of European anti-Semitism began to appear in political polemics both in the nationalist press and in books (Stillman, New attitudes toward the Jew in the Arab world, in Jewish Social Studies, xxxvii [1975], 197-204; idem, Antisemitism in the contemporary Arab world, in Antisemitism in the contemporary world, ed. M. Curtis, Boulder and London 1986, 70-85). For more than two decades following 1948, this trend increased greatly, but peaked by the 1970s, and declined somewhat as the slow process of rapprochement between the Arab world and the state of Israel evolved in the 1980s and 1990s; it remains to be seen how the tensions arising in 2000 will affect the trend.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It cannot be denied that from the last three or four centuries of the Middle Ages there was a general hardening against dhimmis in Muslim countries, helped materially and morally by the change in numerical proportions. Before proceeding further, however, it must be noticed that this hardening of opinion was contemporary with that which appeared in Christendom against the Jews and against Muslims where there were any, without our being able to say to what extent there was convergence, influence, or reaction. On the other hand it must be emphasized that the populace were more easily excited as a result of the deterioration in the economic climate, and that generally changes in the Muslim attitude had been occasioned more by political than by religious considerations. Hitherto <i>there had been scarcely any difference in the treatment accorded to Christians and Jews (at most they were distinguished by prescribed differences in dress); but it later came about that some categories of d̲h̲immī s were looked on as friends of foreign powers and were worse treated, and naturally some Christians were in this respect more of a target than the Jews. There is nothing in mediaeval Islam which could specifically be called anti-semitism.</i></dd>

<p>Well, Neyshaboor is a city in Iran. During the history, there are records of huge massacre of its population by rulers, by foriegner attackers ... Can we start the Anti-Neyshaboor article? NO! Because were it another city in the place of Neyshaboor, it would have been persecuted as well at times. It is very easy.

<dd>I don't think <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobic.html" title="Islamophobic">Islamophobic</a> attitudes is correct. I have read about it way back and don't remember correctly what happened. Apparently there are two well-established myths: one that Islam provided a peaceful heaven for Jews and the other is that Islam persecuted them. Jewish scholars, writing at the beginning of 20th century, like Gacs(I believe) were all very much towards the first myth, the peaceful heaven and equality. They were comparing Muslims with Christians and were for example pointing out to the Jews who became even close advisors of the Muslim kings without requirement of conversion. Were our brothers living in 1900s probably they would have had a over-positive estimate of Islam's treatment of Jews. During the conflicts between Jews and Muslims, the motivation for a dramatic change was available. I can't exactly remember how these view changed but I know that the works of Bat Ye'or was very influencial. Infact, Bat Ye'or was holding an extreme position, but its effect on academia was that it challenged the myth of the peaceful heaven observed in previous works. So, she did really contribute something to the academic circle. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:50, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was Graetz. This is indeed over-politicized so let's try to keep cool heads. The events I listed above (+much more) have occurred.

<dd>You are right! If someone treated slaves properly doesn't mean that he was a bad person. As it might be the best thing to do for that time. But associating a hideous concept of anti-semitism with traditional Muslim societies is wrong. As this concept is non-existent in Academic writings. I just came back from library, I looked into three book: The Oxford dictionary of Islam, The concise encyclopedia of Islam by AltaMira Press, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7591-0189-2</a>, and Encyclopedia of Islam and Muslims world by Macmillan Reference USA and all of these doesn't even have a entry for antisemitism, more over this that even index doesn't have an entry for anti-semitism. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 08:56, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Page 279 is not accessable. Need to go to library. But you guys can see on page 278, it says that "antisemitism was not enirely absent from Medieval Islam, as has been assumed. Its existence can be best proved ..." So, I am really interested to see how page 279 can change this view dramatically as the journalist concluded. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:11, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am reading page 278 but can not understand the point about "haters".

<dd>Here's the quote after that 1121 Baghdad letter that spills over from page 204 to 205:</dd>
<dd>"During most of this period Egypt was a relatively safe place for Jews, though Alexandria retained its long tradition of anti-Semitism dating from Hellenistic times. The writer of one genizah letter, describing an anti-Semitic outbreak there when a Jewish elder was falsely accused of rape, added: 'anti-Semitism is continually taking on new forms and everyone in the town has become a kind of police inspector over the Jews to express their sinuth. 78 <i>(this is the ref to Goitein -HS)</i></dd>
<dd>But in Fustat and Cairo, the genizah papers show that Jews, Christians and Moslems lived mingled together and went into common business partnerships. Goitein concludes that the evidence does not support the view that in Egypt, at least, anti-Semitism was endemic or serious. But then Egypt under the Fatimids and Ayyubids was a refuge for persecuted Jews (and others) from all over the world."</dd>

<p>From Goitein firsthand: "<i>Although the term [antisemitism] is perhaps inapprorpiate in medieval Islamic setting, it is used here to differentiate animosity against Jews from discrimination practiced by Islam against non-Muslims in general. The Genizah material confirms the existence of a discernible form of anti-Judaism in the time and the place considered here, but that form of 'anti-Semitism', if we may use this term, appears to have been local and sporadic rather than general and endemic.</i>" (<i>A Mediterranean Society: An Abrudgment in One Volume</i>, p. 293) As Goitein has correctly pointed out, the issue is solely about terminology: whether we call anti-Jewish sentiment "antisemitism" or apply some other term. Because scholarly sources usually use the term "antisemitism" to describe anti-Jewish sentiment, so will we. Please do not restart this pointless discussion about terminology. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 12:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a matter of fact, no one seriously disputes the existence of hostility towards Jews in medieval Islam; the only issue is whether to call this hostility antisemitism or not. I'm unaware of Stillman or Watt ever saying that there was no antisemitism in medieval Islam (I'm further unaware of Watt writing anything about antisemitism, and even if he indeed wrote something like that, I wouldn't accept this antisemite as a credible source on this issue). Lewis indeed redefines antisemitism so as to include only Christian and Chrisitanity-influenced varities of Judeophobia. Here he is at odds with the entire extant scholarship of antisemitism, which traces the origins of this phenomenon to the Hellenistic period rather than to the emergence of Christianity, as Lewis does. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 16:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hostility at times happened but a particular hostility that is directed against Jews because they are Jews is anti-semitism. As I said before there were rare instances of that. But it was rarely.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anti-Semitism in the 21st Century</span></h2>
<p>As I was reading through the article I realized that it is very brief about current Anti-Semitism. So according to our article Anti-Semitism today is either very minor, or it is almost gone. We all wish it was the latter, but that raises that matter of a better coverage. I would like to propose a series of Anti-Semitism articles, country by country. A history part would be included, as well as the 21st Century, where more could be written about the current situation in each country or region. This way, we would have better classified articles that can be updated easily as current events happen. Please let me know what you all think about this. It is just an idea yet, and it is up to you what you want to do.

<dd>Anti-Semitism today is NOT "very minor" as you suggest, but actually seems to be growing quite a bit despite what official polls may say. I've noticed that there are more anti-Semites than ever popping up in the USA, many of them blatant and more aggressive than ever before; also, true to its history, many parts of Europe are still anti-Semitic (most notably France, Eastern Europe, Russia, the UK, and others), along with the entire Middle East (obviously...), Indonesia (the largest concentration of Muslims in the world), Australia, Canada, and much of (industrialized) South America. In fact, it seems that the only parts of the world that aren't glaringly anti-Semitic are Sub-Saharan Africa, the major Asian countries, and India (only because these parts of the world have little history of Jewish involvement in their cultures and economies, and thus hold no deep-seated grudge against them). So, hold on to your hats ladies and gentiles: better start diggin' a deep well in the ol' back-yard and hoarding canned goods, 'cause a storms' a'brewin' -- <a href="../../../h/e/e/Hee-haw.html" title="Hee-haw">hee-haw</a>. --<a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudothyrum_ca2f.html" title="User:Pseudothyrum">Pseudothyrum</a> 04:27, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am sorry to interject on what is perhaps a dead topic. But I find the claims surrounding 21st Century anti-Semitism to be a little strange. I am not sure how one can link anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionism is a rejection of a particular reading of The Torah and its implementation in Palestine, If one rejects the Torah as a valid source are they then anti-Semitic because they no longer support the religious basis of Zionism (I realize that there is a political aspect as well)? The point is Zionism does not represent the Jewish people as a whole:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2005843,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2005843,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2005843,00.html</a></p>

<p>There are a great many Jews who disagree with Israel's activities in the Holy Land. Jews are not monolithic, so they should not be treated as such by considering one aspect of Judaism as a requisite part of all manifestations of Judaism (ie Zionism). Unfortunately the rise in anti-Semitism is blurred by incidents such as the following attacks on Jews which turned out to be faked:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1078_fake_attack_shock.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1078_fake_attack_shock.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1078_fake_attack_shock.htm</a></p>

<p>To say in the introduction that atnti-Semitism is a hatred of the whole of the Jewish race and religion, and then to say in a later section that disapproval of religious and political ambitions in Israel is tantamount to the anti-Semitism previously defined does not make a lot of sense to me. I am wondering if in the spirit of fairness that someone should include some commentary on the fact that the label 'anti-Semite' is often employed for political purposes and to stifle opposition to Israeli policies. Some people would even say that Zionism itself is a racist ideology seeking to create an ethnically exclusive state on land inhabited by others. Anyone for a change to include a different viewpoint? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAltrafton_2a8a.html" title="User:Altrafton">Altrafton</a>AT</p>

I don't know on the information on China or India and their situation on antisemitism is unsourced or violated wikipedia rules, but it has to stop! Here are these posts below, and again I don't want to look like I'm making Africans, Asians (east or south) or whoever else are "anti-semites"...not true! Antisemitism is worldwide and every race/religion can have prejudices towards other peoples, such as the Jews.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other concerns</span></h2>
<p>Aside from the above-mentioned concerns, the section on Anti-semitism and Islam starts with a paragraph on Qur'an and Dhimmi. One needs to find a reliable source which draws connections between these events and anti-semitism, otherwise they are not relevant to this article. Similarly, (though the journalist isn't a reliable source) but his first quote should be mentioned explicitly in the context of anit-semitism (i haven't checked it). The usage of "traditional Islamic judeophobia" doesn't appear in the reference provided (whether it is reliable or not I haven't checked). This section as it stands is OR and POV.</p>
<p>I think this section should also uses reliable sources like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Cohen_d89d.html" title="Mark Cohen">Mark Cohen</a> to show how politics affected the conception of some Jewish circles of Muslim anti-semitism; that they created a theme in which Muslims starting from the beginning were persecuting Jews and their arguments.

<p>I have got Encyclopedia Judica. It would be very interesting for me to see what would be the reaction of the Beit Or, who goes around and accuses others of misrepresentation of sources.</p>
<p>Beit Or, just mentions one sentence from this source. He doesn't mention the conclusion that the source arrives at. That in sum, anti-semitism could be employed only with qualifications in reference to Islam. The source seems to me is not only getting at anti-semitism but explaining the general position of Jews and Christians under Islam. Let's start from the beginning. The source starts: "From the theological standpoint, the Koran also contained attacks against the Jews, as they refused to recognize Muhammad as the prophet sent by God. In certain respects Muhammad utilized the Bible in a manner similar to that of Christian theologians..." and then goes on explaining the positions of Christians and Jews under Islam: "The religions of the two "People of the Book" were officially recognized , and a special status combining subjection and protection was evolved for them." The source mentions that "Apart from the distinguishing colors of their insignia, the dhimmi Jews and Christians were subjected to the same measures and were obliged to pay the same tax. But in regions were Islam reigned, the forms of anti-Judaism and anti-Christianity each evolved in their own way." The source continues: <i>When Islam began to spread, the majority of the subjected territories were Christian...One source of anti-semitism in Islam, therefore may derived from ancient Christian anti-semitism..Thus a number of anti-Jewish traditions and legends from Christian folklore penetrated, with appropriate adaption, into that of Islam. However,... In sum, the term anti-Semitism, which becomes a particularly blatant semantic misnomer when used in connection with the Arab world, also regarded as "Semitic" can be employed only with qualifications in reference to Islam."</i></p>
<p>And lastly, Beit Or has skipped all positive references to Muslim perceptions of Jews. He easily jumps over where the source mentions that only in exceptional cases Jews "were invested with the satanic character and attributes frequent in Christian literature." or that "There are Islamic literary sources in medieval age in which the contemporary Jew is endowed with positive characteristics." --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 04:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is antisemitism racist?</span></h2>
<p>A recent edit in the article points out that it is a fallacy to make Jews into a racial group, which indeed is true. But then again, all discrimination and bigotry is based on a fallacy, and there is no question that at least some antisemites think (or thought) that Jews were a separate race. So, in the mind of the bigot, Jews are a separate race, and he/she is therefore a racist.

<li>Nah. It's just that "racist" is a convenient generic term for ethnic/cultural/religious-group-based bigotry; we could also fit "Islamophobia" into that category, for example.

<dd>Indeed. And the definition there is correct. Look at it like this: It is not true that Jews have horns. Some people, even in this day and age, believe Jews have horns. Judeocerophobia is hostility to or prejudice againt Jews as people with horns. See? Antisemitism is directed against what is perceived as a racial group; in fact, as the article points out, the term "antisemitism" was coined to distinguish so-called racial Jew-hate from religious Jew-hate; some people on Wikipedia have objected to the term "antisemitic" being used to describe Martin Luther, because he didn't know for race -- his vitriol was all religiously based.

<p>Since Jews are widely agreed to be an ethnic group (if not a "race," though that term is too charged and imprecise to be of any real usage these days), you could say that people who dislike Jews are "ethnicists" (as opposed to racists) and practice "ethnicism" (as opposed to racism) -- either way, it's all childish semantic games because it is clear to anyone that investigates the facts that Jews are ethnically/racially group, thus rendering them a "race." However, they are Semitic and thus originally of Arab-stock, and due to their long history in Europe and to some extent America, some Jews do contain a dose of "Caucasian blood." NOTE: this has <i>nothing</i> to do with the Jewish religion (properly termed <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Judaism_7579.html" title="Anti-Judaism">anti-Judaism</a>), only Jews as a distinct ethnic group (because anyone can technically convert to Judaism, but they cannot convert their DNA to gain "Jewish genes").</p>
<p>Those doubting the ethnic/racial status of Jews only need to look to the immigration laws of Israel, the "Jewish State" -- only proven ethnic/racial Jews are allowed to legally immigrate to the country; however, they don't HAVE to attend a synagogue or be religious in the least once there. In fact, the majority of Israel's Jewish citizens are secular, entirely non-religious, as are most of the Jews in America, Argentina, Russia, Europe, and so forth.</p>
<p>Also, note that for thousands of years, Jews married and had kids exclusively with other Jews -- in fact, like many other ethnic/racial groups, they were quite fanatical about the "purity of their blood," as many <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra-Orthodox_Jews_59ef.html" title="Ultra-Orthodox Jews">Ultra-Orthodox Jews</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Jews_e692.html" title="Hasidic Jews">Hasidic Jews</a> still are today; notice for yourself the clone-like appearance of Ultra-Orthodox Jews (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Jews_98b1.html" title="Haredi Jews">Haredi Jews</a>) and tell me that they haven't been marrying/breeding with each other for a <i>very</i> long time. Some Jews are still so strict that even in today's relatively 'free' Western societies they will refuse to marry and have kids with a "mixed Jew," much less a Gentile! This goes back to the whole idea of "kosher" -- certain things are not to be mixed: milk/meat, work/Sabbath (sacred/profane), and Jew/Gentile. According to strict Jewish doctrine, some things are "clean" (kosher), while other things are thought to be "unclean" (non-kosher). Thus, the strictest Jews view Gentiles as "unclean" and will not and never have racially mix with them -- in the distant past racial mixing was VERY uncommon because Jews largely lived in ghettos (often self-imposed, by the way) and thus Jewish women rarely if ever met with foreign men because it was such a closed community. Save the occasional rape of a Jewish female and/or straying of Jewish male, Jews definitely DID NOT breed with the Gentiles -- thus, they are clearly a distinct ethnic-group/race.</p>
<p>Intermarriage and the rise of "mixed Jews" (<a href="../../../m/i/s/Mischling.html" title="Mischling">Mischlings</a>) only began in the mid-19th Century or so, mostly in Germany with the rise of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform movement</a> and the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Haskalah.html" title="Haskalah">Haskalah</a>, and later on in the former USSR, when the most idealistic Jewish Communists sought a classless/raceless/religionless society and thus sometimes married Gentiles. Jews didn't start marrying/mixing with non-Jews in semi-large numbers until modern times, around the time of the Industrial Revolution, when people of all races and religions were tossed together in to mass factories and worked together; the rise of public schooling also contributed to intermarriage quite a bit, especially as Jews have become increasingly secular and left behind private Jewish schools, Yeshivas, Jewish seminaries/universities, and so forth. It is interesting to note that today, in the USA, that since most if not all of the Ivy League universities and flagship state universities are heavily Jewish/Asian (many over 40%, some well over half), they serve almost the same purpose as a private Jewish school or university: to keep Jews from being exposed to Gentiles and Gentile society, thus decreasing the chance that they will marry and have children with them. I've read of anti-Semites calling elite universities "Jewish breeding grounds," of course reserving the most scorn for ultra-elite Harvard University, calling it instead "Hebrew University." Thus, the definite homogeneity by the Jewish gene pool, maintained through their religion and other forms of "social control," has endured over MANY generations despite exile from their ancestral homeland -- this attests to their status as a distinct ethnic/racial group.</p>
<p>The short answer is that YES, anti-Semitism is in fact a form of racism/ethnicism unless it is focused specifically on the <i>religion</i> of the Jews; however, the overwhelmingly vast majority of anti-Semites could care less about Judaism -- the people they don't like are the Jews themselves, the Jewish people whom they call the "Hebrew race." --<a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudothyrum_ca2f.html" title="User:Pseudothyrum">Pseudothyrum</a> 06:40, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's wrong with you people? Of course it's a race. You think hitler killed any Judaism practicing Aryans? No, in fact he had jewish people on his athletic teams for the olympics so long as they had blonde hair and blue eyes, because he's too much of a bastard to actually represent the race he thinks is perfect. However, there's no doubt that it is in fact a race, otherwise Hitler wouldn't have had anything to chase after. As well, I think it's extremely racist to say that it's not a race and as well worse than the persecution of them as a race. I personally have racial jewish heritage and there is no disputing genetics.</p>

<dd>While this self-indulgent rant doesn't lend any support to the distinction of "Jews" as a wholly separate ethnicity (provide more evidence than somehow feeling your own genetics and paragraphs of hearsay), this may serve as an excellent demonstration of pseudo-ethnic arrogance that is often stereotyped to be practiced by all Jews. Unfortunately this practice of self segregation may very well be at the heart of the history of anti-Judaism. It doesn't take much for this sort of thinking to transform into helicopter pilots getting direct orders to strafe Palestinian children. What's wrong with US people? Sorry, but a dozen or so generations of dad giving lectures to his kids about the dirtiness of "those who are not like us" is not sufficient grounds to establish a separate ethnicity. Invent a method for analyzing DNA that somehow isolates your religion-defined ethnicity, and a time machine, and then you can gather enough evidence to prove what you are so certain of.

<dd>Yeah, the "anti-Semitism" spelling is both confusing and a misnomer. It's a misnomer because the "anti-" prefix is usually used to mean "opposition to" (e.g., anti-Communism, anti-Socialism, anti-imperialism, anti-nationalism, etc.). It is primary used to mark opposition movements to certain <i>ideologies</i> (e.g., Communism, Socialism, imperialism, nationalism, etc.). But there's no ideology called "Semitism", so it doesn't make sense to talk about "anti-Semitism". The confusing part is that "anti-Semitism" (wrongly) reminds people of <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_peoples.html" title="Semitic peoples">Semitic peoples</a>, but antisemitism is only used in reference to Jews.

<p>Anti-Semitism seems to be often tied to the idea that Jewish people control the flow of money and media, but the article only briefly mentions this, and even then only in the section on Catholic anti-semitism. I was wondering if someone could give some background on this alleged conspiracy. Was there any statistical truth that Jewish people owned a disproportional high number of banks and media? If not, why did people think that they did? If so, are there any theories about how they got this control?

<dd>You're exactly right, and YES there is much statisitical proof that Jews hold a disproportionate amount of power despite their small numbers; however, as you can see, this is a VERY touchy subject for most Jews because your honest question on this page was soon deleted and/or ignored. Try to gather some facts/statistics from <b>reliable</b> sources, work out a few paragraphs on the topic here on this talk page, and we'll get a section going on this "disproportionate influence" of Jews in the modern world (especially in America in the 20th-21st Centuries).

<dd>Here's a bit more: <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Slezkine_4a2c.html" title="Yuri Slezkine">Yuri Slezkine</a>'s mainstream academic book <i>The Jewish Century</i> is a GREAT resource for this theory of anti-Semitism, especially in Europe/Russia: it gives a reason for German anti-Semitism circa 1900: [paraphrasing] -- "<b>Around 1900, despite being only 1% of the German population, it is estimated that Jews controlled around 20% of Germany's economy</b>." Remember, this author is a respected, mainstream historian at prestigious UC-Berkeley, and his book published by Princeton UP. Given these amazing numbers, it's quite understandable then why the German people would be indignant toward this minority that wielded so much power within their borders. Slezkine's book focuses on Jewish economic success in the 20th Century, linking their incredible economic and cultural influence in Europe with a brand of anti-Semitism that would culminate in the Holocaust.</dd>

He writes that: "...in 1921 Budapest, <b>87.8 percent of the members of the stock exhange and 91 percent of the currency brokers were Jews</b>, many of them ennobled..." (48). He continues on to write that: "...in interwar Hungary, <b>more than half and perhaps as much as 90 percent of all industry was controlled by a few closely related Jewish banking families</b>" (48). Soon afterward, he says: "In 1930, about <b>71 percent of the richest Hungarian taxpayers (with incomes exceeding 200,000 pengo) were Jews</b> (48). Slezkine says that Jews were disproportionately represented amongst college students in 19th-20th Century Hungary: "In Hungary, where Jews constituted about 5 percent of the population, they represented one-fourth of all university students and 43 percent at Budapest Technological University" (49). Jews were also disproportionately a part of the professional class of post-WWI Hungary: "In 1920, <b>59.9 percent of Hungarian doctors, 50.6 percent of lawyers, 39.25 percent of all privately employed engineers ans chemists, 34.3 percent of editors and journalists, and 28.6 percent of musicians identified themselves as Jews by religion (If one were to add converts to Christianity, the numbers would presumably be much higher</b>) (50). &gt;&gt; He also writes that "In large parts of Eastern Europe, virtually the whole 'middle class' was Jewish (pg. 50). There is TONS of information regarding Jewish success and wealth in both Russia and the USSR in the book too; far too much to put here.

<dd>As for America...well, that's trickier: much information is often suppressed or kept strictly hush-hush here in the USA despite the "freedom of press" and "free-flow of ideas/information" we hold so dear; many Jews seem to feel quite embarrassed regarding their success in America, preferring to keep it quiet lest it inflame anti-Semitism (jealously at the success of Jews is often a factor in anti-Semitism as well). <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_B._MacDonald_335e.html" title="Kevin B.

The percentage of Jewish households with income greater than $50,000 is double that of non-Jews; on the other hand, the percentage of Jewish households with income less than $20,000 is half that of non-Jews. <b>Twenty percent of professors at leading universities are Jewish, and 40% of partners in leading New York and Washington D.C. law firms are Jewish</b>.63 / In 1996, there were approximately three hundred national Jewish organizations in the United States, with a <b>combined budget estimated in the range of $6 billion—a sum greater than the gross national product of half the members of the United Nations</b>.64 For example, in 2001 the ADL claimed an annual budget of over $50,000,000.65 SOURCES: 60.

<dd>I didn't find the original questioner to be offensive, the question was phrased in a straightforward informational manner. That said, the concept that somehow Jews "control" one thing or another because they are proportionally overrepresented is silly. So the percentage of Jewish professors is 20% and Jewish lawyers is 40%; the percentages of nonJews are 80% and 60%. Most folks would come to the conclusion that the 60% probably is more in "control" than the 40%, no matter how overrepresentative the 40% is.</dd>
<dd>The Bush administration provides a typical example. People name like 4 Jews in high positions, and use this as evidence that the Bush administration is a puppet of the Jews, despite dozens of nonJews in similar or higher positions, including of course Bush and Cheney; and despite the fact that Jewish Americans voted against Bush 60% of the time in both elections and against the Republicans 80% in the last election.<a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 15:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apropos, I just saw a documentary on Hitler that called attention to his attempts to negotiate with Jews, or use Jews to negotiate with the US and UK, to reach a peace. The point that the documentary made is that Hitler really seemed to believe that all Jews were organized into some vast conspiracy controling the West and that such negotiations really could lead to a settlement with the US and UK. He simply could not recognize that for the most part the US and UK didn't care about the fate of the Jews and "the Jews" did not have the power to influence them. It didn't matter that, for example, Morgenthau was FDR's Sect'y of Treasury. Hitler seemed to have this mental map in which Morgenthau, other prominent Jews, and prisoners of the concentration camps were all connected. They weren't, and they aren't. The point is, <i>Morgenthau</i> may have had power and influence, but that does not in any way mean that this vague abstract group called "the Jews" have power. I think the key to the antisemitism of the above comments is their insistence on reducing those lawyers, bankers, and so on as "Jews" (with the implication that they think and act as a group) when (1) people have many different identities besides race or religion, and those other identities are often more salient, and (2) even people who strongly identify the same way can have conflicting desires and interests and are often - in any meaningful practical way - are just unconnected. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:51, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Clearly the idea of a Jewish conspiracy is silly. But if Jewish people do own more banks and newspapers than would be proportional by their population, it’s an interesting social situation that’s worth looking into.

<dd>I think however the article has a POV suggesting the antisemitism is somehow an irrational hatred on Jews and minimalizes such causes as presented by the anonymous contributor in those lengthy paragraphs just above. From these data some may conclude a Jewish conspiracy (and in this case I personally agree with the one who wrote above this is rather a proof of insanity) but some may only grow worried and eventually propose countermeasure of affirming the discriminated (the agents of discrimination can be very deeply buried historically, culturally, withour proper studies it's hard to put a blame on; what counts however are the results - disproportionate participations) categories (in this case, some non-Jewish categories) without being a "Jew-hater". Because, no matter what this article claims, the accusations of antisemitism are loosely used on many people criticizing or growing concerns or taking non-violent measures on Jews or Jewish communities. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 15:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Howcome there's not a "causes" section</span></h2>
<p>I was looking through the archives section and I saw this has been brought up several times. I'm sure a lot of scholarly writing has been done on theories of underlying causes, but none of this is discussed in the article. I'm wondering why this is.</p>
<p>I'm thinking the reason this isn't included is because there are only three possibilities for the nature and origin of antisemitism, none of which are politically correct:</p>
<p>1. The notion that anti-semitism is widespread and has been widespread throughout the world for as long as there have been Jews isn't really true, and the prejudice/zenophobia against Jews hasn't actually been worse than that against other minority groups.</p>
<p>2. Anti-semitism is caused by jealousy because Jews are actually superior to gentiles.</p>
<p>3. Jews have actually done more bad things than other minority groups and this has provoked prejudice against them.</p>
<p>There could be other possibilities I haven't thought of, but I haven't really seen any others discussed. But at any rate, it seems a major failing of this article to discuss a phenomenon in such depth without looking at its underlying causes... 69.29.30.178 22:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is pretty funny, because I have read some of the historians and sociologists who have theorized causes of anti-semitism and they never bring up any of the three "possibilities" the anonymous user brought up. Alas, I read that stuff back in college and do not remember (Yehuda Bauer was one important person but only one and there are many more). Needless to say the best scholarship does not offer global theories of anti-semitism but specific theories to explain specific forms and moments of anti-Semitism (blood libel in the middle ages, pogroms in early modern eastern europe, and the Holocaust) but their specific explanations of course have broader implications. I wish we had an editor who actually knew this literature and could incoprorate it into the article. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:28, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first possibility I raised was that antisemitism (in most parts of the world and for most of the history of the Jewish people) hasn't been more severe than bigotry against any other minority group. This would fit with your thesis of no one global big cause but rather smaller local causes at different places and times. However, if you reject possibility #1 and assert that bigotry against Jews has tended to be more severe than bigotry against other minority groups - both throught the history of the Jewish people and throughout the different majority cultures of the world - then there has to be a larger *underlying* cause of this. The two explanations I have heard are listed as possibilities #2 and #3. There may well be others, and if you've heard of any then by all means discuss them. 128.206.59.141 18:18, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you are right about point #1 - I would only add that your point #1 is two points. But just to be clear, the reason I was dismissing your comment was this: your points do not explain why there is no section on "causes." I interpreted your point #1 to be a possible explanation for why there is no "causes" section. If we agree that Jews have not always suffered from anti-semitism, and that anti-semitism has taken different forms and has been expressed with differing levels of intensity depending on time and place, this is <b>not</b> a reason for not having a "causes" section, it just means the causes section would have to be subdivided into different causes for different forms of anti-semitism. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anon. user 128.206... has a point -- NO OTHER ethnic/racial/religious group has been as despised as the Jews during their history; <b>Jews have been expelled from over 80 countries/territories</b> (and these are only the ones we have documented), not to mention slaughtered en masse in many of these same countries/territories. Surely there is a definite reason for this other than "mass psychosis" or "paranoid mental illness," unless extremely different cultures and people spanning thousands of years have been infected with this mysterious "illness"? Surely there is a definite reason this particular group has drawn the ire of <i>every group of people</i> they settle amongst.</dd>

In fact, it seems that the only places where the Jews have yet to be kicked out of are the countries of the "New World," i.e. North and South America. Even then though certain instances exist (see Ulysses S.

<dd>I speculate that if the Jews had settled in large/semi-large numbers in Japan and had, over time, gained vastly disproportionate cultural and financial influence as they have in most everywhere they've settled, that anti-Semitism would have eventually reared its ugly head there as well; but since Japan is so fanatically closed, they would have never been allowed to settle there in the first place. In fact, Jews seem to thrive in so-called 'open' societies; the more closed a society is (such as Japan), the less likely Jews are going to be able to gain any influence in that country/territory because that host population is itself wary of outsiders, much as the Jews are. However, the more 'open' a culture is, the more Jews thrive culturally and economically, despite the fact that, paradoxically, Jews themselves are actually a very 'closed' group, shunning 'outsiders' and Gentile influence. Herein lies the double standard of Jews and Jewish culture: if Jews aren't allowed to participate in the economic/cultural life of a country that place is deemed 'anti-Semitic' -- however, it's a given that Jews will never allow the Gentile societies they live amongst to participate in their own cultural/economic life because they are very 'closed' communities. --172.166.75.105 10:36, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There was not only religious intolerance towards the Jews, but the Christianity and Islam faught over land and territory while the Jews had gained rights in the same country. Throughout history there was almost absolute religious intolerance directed at everyone, besides the Jews. The Jews were alowed to stay and appeared as a seperate group promoting it's own interests as well as recieving rights from the governors. The Jewish comunity is extreamly closed and will not mix with other societies. This may not be in every case a relevant explanation but once a hate and prejudice are well established they are more often reverted to in times of need. A culture living inside you yet different, is often an useful scapegoat for any failure or problem.85.64.221.101 20:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very mature Moshe, but the insult is a poor substitute for a coherent idea. Maybe you can work on that. Moving on...I mentioned the areas already, but to give some specifics examples:<br />
<br />
"<b>Muhammad's attitude towards Jews was shaped by ..</b>"<br />
<i>This is the author's opinion, as he/she obviously does not converse with Mohammed. There is also no source</i><br />
<br />
"<b>Muslim holy text defined the Arab and Muslim attitude towards Jews to this day..</b>"<br />
<i>This implies there is a single unified attitude, which is untrue. This is otherwise known as a stereotype... or an example of prejudice where one assumes ALL Muslims think &lt;x&gt;</i><br />

<li>Well, actually, the first one is footnoted at the end of the next sentence, though to be honest I'm not sure what the footnote is referring to -- it simply says "Lacqueur (2006), p. 192", so someone needs to fix that reference.

<p>Regarding the second sentence, it does not state what you just asked me... as far as qualifying with "general" (which is a weasel word). The quotes contain obvious references to Jews, though whether those quotes were written because Muhammed "hated Jews" (was anti-semitic) is another matter. Any so-called "anti-semitic" behavior they allegedly inspired needs to be specifically documented and not summarized with a stereotype about "arabs and muslims" <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">Sarastro777</a> 04:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Historically, whenever Ottoman empire was strong, Jews and Christians were happy and were treated more tolerantly and when the situation was bad, they were put under pressure.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History of Muslim anti-semitism; another source</span></h2>
<p>The Encyclopedia of religion, in the anti-semitism article states the following about Islam (will post this on the antisemitism article as well)&#160;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The premodern world of Islam was quite different from premodern Christendom. The most obvious difference is the variety of populations encompassed within the world of premodern Islam, which was a rich melange of racial, ethic, and religious communities. Within this complex human tapestry, the Jews were by no means obvious as lone dissenters, as they had been earlier in the world of polytheism or subsequently in most of medieval Christendom. While occasionally invoking the ire of the prophet Muhammad(c.570-632) and his later followers, the Jews played no special role in the essential Muslim myth as the Jews did in the Christian myth. The <i>dhimmi</i> people, defined as those with a revealed religous faith, were accorded basic rights to security and religous identity in Islamic society and included Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians. Lack of uniqueness ameliorated considerably the circumstances of Jews in the medieval world of Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the post-World War II period, however, the Jewish Zionist enterprise did take on elements of uniqueness: it was projected as the sole Western effort at recolonization within Islamic sphere. This perception has triggered intese antipathy for Zionism and its Jewish supporters, often viewed as indistinguishable, and has resulted in the revival of harshly negative imagery spawned in the altogether different sphere of medieval Christendom. Popular Muslim writing and journalism now regularly introduce themes such as ritual murder, Jewish manipulation of finance, and worldwide Jewish conspiracy, themes taken over with little difficulty from an entirely different ambience. Once again, these themes have proven flexible, readily transferable from milieu to milieu.</p>

The most obvious difference is the variety of populations encompassed within the world of premodern Islam, which was a rich melange of racial, ethic, and religious communities. <b>Within this complex human tapestry, the Jews were by no means obvious as lone dissenters, as they had been earlier in the world of polytheism or subsequently in most of medieval Christendom.</b> While occasionally invoking the ire of the prophet Muhammad(c.570-632) and his later followers, the Jews played no special role in the essential Muslim myth as the Jews did in the Christian myth. The dhimmi people, defined as those with a revealed religous faith, were accorded basic rights to security and religous identity in Islamic society and included Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians. <b>Lack of uniqueness</b> ameliorated considerably the circumstances of Jews in the medieval world of Islam.

<p>H.S. At the beginning I thought you really are not aware of the academic view on Anti-Semitism, and that's why you are removing the quotes from EoI etc etc. But now, after presenting such strong evidences that possibility does not exist anymore. Surely none of the above scholars are anti-Jewish or paid to write so. Definitely not Mark Cohen or Bernard Lewis. It would be impossible that academic authorities like Claude Cahen write something this much contradicting the truth, since their articles will be peer-reviewed and they will be exposed. In fact, it threatens their career. I think the truth can be found through academic books, and not through media or people. That's why I changed my mind when I read about anti-semitism in modern times. Yes, I accepted it. Not only that, I have accepted too many significant facts about my own religion through Academic articles. H.S. please, for the sake of God of justice, haven't I provided enough evidence to establish my case? --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Actually, <i>none</i> of the persons you have cited, with a possible exception of Lewis, is a scholar of antisemitism. Neertheless their views are acknowledged in the article.

<p>The quotes that Aminz has brought to the discussion are coming from reliable academic sources. H.S. "one of the most prolific editors on antisemitism-related topics" has only brought a cadre of weasel words and uncited personal opinion (i.e. "but no one would...", "..in general..", "..[all] jews fared better.." All of this as worded is not even suitable for mention on Wikipedia. Please refrain from attacking other editors adding actual legitimate academic information with citation. Making up arbitrary requirements such as "not a legitimate specialist in anti-semitism" when convenient is not appropriate. Obviously someone that specializes (has a Ph.D.) in History and Hebrew Studies would be knowledgeable/qualifed in such areas.

<p>Here is what Aminz has written: "<i>According to scholars such as Claude Cahen in pre-modern times, there was not such a thing that would be called Antisemitism</i>". Among the sources used for this sentence is Joel S. Migdal, Boundaries and Belonging (2004), Cambridge University Press, p.55. However, this is what Joel Migdal says in relaity: "<i>The success of this system — insofar as the empire's Jews were concerned — was reflected in the virtual absence of anti-Semitism from the Ottoman landscape.</i>" Note the differences: first, Migdal speaks of "virtual" rather than "complete" absence of anti-Semitism, and secondly, his comment is confined to the Ottoman Empire, whereas Aminz has stretched Migdal's words to all territories in pre-modern times. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 11:21, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anti-semitism "root factors/causes": Christian gnosticism, Communism, Yiddish, Original Monotheistic Religion?</span></h2>
<p>Factors that seem noticeably lacking from this discussion of anti-semitism:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems unusual that, both in this article and in the article on Christian anti-semitism, no mention is made of gnostics or gnosticism. While Christianity as it developed in the early centuries, certainly had some negative views towards Jews, the gnostic movement which was flourishing at just the same time as early Christianity was developing, had a much richer source of descriptions of Jews as being evil. While early Christianity, when it finally consolidated, agreed to accept the Hebrew Bible into its canon (the "Old Testament"), the gnostic Christians who were around at the same time, opposed this, on the grounds that the God of the Jews, the God of the Hebrew Bible, was the Devil, the evil god that created sin and the material world. It's all the more unusual that no one mentions this in the articles on anti-semitism, when much of the material that the article references (the Nazi material, for example), is claiming that Jews are satanic and evil. Do people not see the possible historical influence that these early gnostic ideas may have had on the later history of anti-semitism in Christian countries? And it is also true that these gnostic ideas did not die out, that they continued to influence Christian countries through the centuries. (There are many works outlining the history and spread of gnosticism - see "Hans Jonas: the Gnostic Religion", for example).</li>
<li>Wasn't there a relationship between the Nazi desire to defeat the Soviet/Communist "threat", and the destruction of the Jews? Didn't the Nazis (and the members of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Comintern_Pact_c477.html" title="Anti-Comintern Pact">Anti-Comintern Pact</a>)see the Jews as being potential allies of communism, and for that reason they were an internal threat that could easily be destroyed, as part of the Nazi's greater war against the Soviet Union? In other words, the "Jewish Communist" was a cause of anti-semitism, similar to <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg_15e1.html" title="Julius and Ethel Rosenberg">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</a>, "Jewish Communists" executed in the United States in 1953 (only 8 years after the Nazis were defeated).</li>
<li>Does no one see the obvious relationship between the over 10 million speakers of Yiddish in Europe, and the anti-semitism which was spearheaded by none other people than German speakers (Austria and Germany)? German anti-semitism can certainly be explained in a large part by the German speaker's perceived threat of a huge ocean of non-Christian, non-European Jews, speaking what would to the German ear be a bizzare, incomprehensible dialect of German, and written, moreover, not in European, Latin letters, from left to right, but instead in Hebrew letters, from right to left. People also often forget today, how widespread Yiddish educational instutitions and the Yiddish press were in Europe before the Nazis took power. It is nearly impossible for someone living in the U.S. today to imagine the situation that existed between the German speakers and the Yiddish speakers in Germany - and this relationship is clearly a factor that influenced German anti-semitism.</li>
<li>What about the obvious fact that Judaism preceded Christianity and Islam, and Christianity and Islam claim to replace Judaism? Since Jews just weren't up to being replaced, this resulted in Christian/Islamic persecutions of them, as they stuck out like a sore thumb in Christianity/Islam that the Jews and Judaism really hadn't been replaced by the newer religions? This is further backed up by the noticable fact that ancient religions existing today that *did not* claim to replace Judaism, are not fundamentally anti-semitic at all.</li>
<li>These things listed above are all almost completely obvious possible root causes of anti-semitism, and there should be a subsection of this article that discusses root causes such as these.</li>

<dd>I may never be able to track it down, since I don't have time/inclination, but I know that the idea has been around for many years (that there is a possible influence of gnosticism on anti-semitism).

<dd>Obviously not, since a good number of Jews are critical of different policies. It is anti-Semitic if the critic holds Israel to a different standard than other countries, or believes that the policies criticized owe to the fact that the people who formulated them and carry them out are Jewish (rather than other considerations which could just as well apply to non-Jews). There may be other circumstances under which it is likely that criticism of Israeli policies is anti-Semitic - let's see what other say. But to sum up my own opinion, while I think it is very likely that someone who is anti-Semitic will therefor also be critical of Israel, this does not mean that someone who is critical of Israel is necessarily anti-Semitic. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is the consensus view that the antisemitism has passed through several stages with religious and racial antisemitism being two of them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Existence of Dispute</span></h2>
<p>Users: Beit Or, Humus Sapeins and Jayjg are removing POV tag from the section while some other users believe that there is at least a dispute (including the following one: In Academia there are exactly two POVs: 1. There was traditionally no antisemitism 2. There was little sporadic antisemitism&#160;; many sources writing on Antisemitism either don't mention Islam, or if they do they briefly in one or two sentences state one of the two above POVs. The section should make this clear; other disputes have been also raised above in this talk page about the proper usage of the source currently used and that when some passage is quoted, the author should have specifically drew the connection between the sentence and antisemitism). Overall there is a lot of dispute. And recently an RfC (first a user-conduct but later an article one) was filed (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aminz/rfc" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aminz/rfc" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>). Given all these, the POV tag is removed by above mentioned 3 users for whom the RfC was filed.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It's very clear that there is a dispute here, and a dispute in good faith, so some means should be found of resolving it other than seeking to remove tags placed, apparently in good faith, on passages people object to. The whole passage on "Anti-semitism in the Muslim World" seems to me to be very problematic as it stands. Aminz seems to have brought reasonable sources which are being rejected for reasons that aren't altogether clear to me. His version appears to start with a declaration that there's, more or less, no such thing as Islamic anti-semitism. OK, not very NPOV, but the current version seems to err in the opposite direction. Here are some of my queries.</dd>
<dd>The first sentence seeks to establish a connection between the Quran and anti-semitism in the Muslim world. The first element in this argument is sourced to Encyclopaedia Judaica. The last sentence in the paragraph is cited to Walter Laqueur. Are the intervening elements, particularly the second half of the first sentence also covered by the citation to Laqueur? In any case, should not the alternative viewpoint, that Islam is not inherently anti-Semitic, also be allowed a look in at this point? The point is not to create a case, after all, but to set out agreed facts and, in a neutral way, points of controversy. I think this passage falls down rather badly here, as it stands.</dd>
<dd>Second paragraph: is the first sentence being sourced to Lewis?</dd>
<dd>The third, fourth and fifth paragraphs all detail material in the Quran and Hadith that is hostile to Jews. Is there any source relating this to anti-Semitism, or is it being included as an instance of anti-semitism?</dd>
<dd>The material about dhimmis does not seem relevant. Dhimmi status applied to all tolerated non-Muslim population who were not militarily allied to Muslims, and there is no evidence that I am aware of, and certainly none given here, to indicate that it was an instance of anti-Semitism. But from the current version here, not only would one think it was anti-Semitic, one could easily understand that these were measures specifically taken against Jews. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 03:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have yet to arrive at a conclusion about this material and its placement. However, I consider this impromptu poll entirely illegitimate. Several of the support "votes" have no involvement here, and may be presumed to have appeared only to support their co-religionist against a <i>certain other</i> religion. As this pattern, both the reflexive animus and the inclination to meatpuppetry, is seen across a wide range of AfDs and other poll-like processes, these votes cannot be seen as saying anything meaningful about this particular dispute.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 03:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm, that I don't know the details of this article, but it seems to me that there is some sort of dispute concerning it. However, this is no reason to engage in edit warring.</dd>
<dd>Bet Or, I don't see that there is anything untoward with soliciting opinions of other WP editors as Aminz has done.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I don't want to get involved in the internals of this dispute; however, please report future 3RR violations to the admin page rather than to my talk page.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 04:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No evidence has been given that there is any connection whatsoever between the dhimma and antisemitism. There is also a difference between acknowledging the existence of antisemitism in Islamic territories and accepting the case that this article makes, partly implicitly and partly explicitly, that antisemitism is intrinsic to Islam. We seem to have a genuine case of differences in scholarly opinion here which, as far as I can see, the article does not accurately reflect; it reads to me as if it is making a case for one point of view. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 11:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is undisputable that Muslim antisemitism was traditionally quite different in nature from its Christian counterpart and that in many times and places of the Islamic world antisemitism was much less intense than in Europe, but the claim that in pre-modern times antisemitism <i>did not exist among Muslims at all</i> is a polemical hyperbola. Indeed, Lewis makes such a claim, but his argument wholly depends on his ad hoc redefinition of antisemitism. He redefines antisemitism not simply as prejudice or hostility against Jews, but only such prejudice and hostility that demonizes Jews and ascribes to them the attributes of cosmic evil. We acknowledge Lewis's position, but his definition of antisemitism is highly idiosyncratic. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 11:27, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not really up to us to give our views but to accurately reflect scholarly views, and we should accept that scholarly views may be quite nuanced and may include widely varying opinions. The problem is that the article does <i>not</i> currently acknowledge Lewis's position, as far as I can see, and in addition Cahen's has been suppressed although the citation to it and a later reference to him remain. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 12:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It was acknowledged in the first sentence of the last paragraph in the discussed section, and I've just added more details. Cahen is not suppressed, but all we have from him is one sentence from the article "Dhimma" in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i>: not exactly a lot to add from not exactly a work on antisemitism.

<dd>No, I don't see how not giving someone's position can be held to constitute "treating it appropriately" if that opinion is one given in a relevant article in the Encyclopaedia of Islam.

<p><b>Reply to Humus Sapiens</b>. The only reason I'm here is because of an appeal to lift a 24h block on one of the participants (which appeal was denied by me and another admin). On the face of it, it really would be unbelievable that in the broad range of space and time you mention <i>millennium of Islamic rule over vast territories</i> there were no incidents of persecution of Jews (and others for that matter). Whether that's the content of the dispute, is not clear to me (e.g., does the persecution have to be systematic etc.,). However, as a complete outsider to this article, there is evidence on this talk page that some argument about something in the article exists. Unless you can show the argument is purely frivolous, to me that seems like a dispute. As a compromise, may I suggest to the disputants that they specify in non-inflammatory language what the nature of the dispute is in a short paragraph and put it in a blockquote paragraph at the top of the <i>talk</i> page (i.e., this page). Would that be acceptable? However, as I said above, most admins will take a very dim view of edit warring, so please stop adding (or removing) tags. --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 17:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Just one point CSTAR: if there is a bona fide NPOV dispute with various users claiming the current version is not neutral, then it is simply not acceptable to remove tags, and I think it would be justifiable to reinsert them - providing tags is precisely an interim solution to avoid edit-warring on content, and non-abusive tags simply should not be removed. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 19:49, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CSTAR Anti-Semitism is not merely Persecution. The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion states: "There was little specific antisemitism, and Jews were treated (or ill-treated) like other infidels." --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is one of the essential points in issue. This article is about antisemitism. Where Jews were ill-treated, not because they were Jews, but because they were not Muslims, and other non-Muslims were similarly treated, then there is a considerable burden of proof to be surmounted before it can be shown that antisemitism is at issue. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 19:52, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Precisely. Claude Cahen says: "there had been scarcely any difference in the treatment accorded to Christians and Jews (at most they were distinguished by prescribed differences in dress); but it later came about that some categories of d̲h̲immīs were looked on as friends of foreign powers and were worse treated, and naturally some Christians were in this respect more of a target than the Jews. There is nothing in mediaeval Islam which could specifically be called anti-semitism." <b>Even Christians were more of a target than Jews since Ottoman Empire was in fight with Byzantium and Christians were more suspect of spying.</b>--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:57, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Reply to Palmiro</b> Re <i>providing tags is precisely an interim solution to avoid edit-warring on content, and non-abusive tags simply should not be removed.</i> I am inclined to agree with this in general. An exception of course, would be if the dispute were entirely frivolous. Again, it doesn't seem to me that it is frivolous, since at least one well-known scholar seems to support the "opposing" position. But I admit I'm in an area in which I have no competence. --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 20:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The views of that scholar are acknowledged in the article. The essense of the dispute is that Aminz wants to claim the absence of antisemitism in Muslim lands as fact, which would be clearly a violation of NPOV. However, even this is enormous progress compared to Aminz's initial version in which he attempted to claim, using the <i>same</i> sources he is citing now: "<i>There was not such a thing that would be called Antisemitism in Muslim lands before the establishment of the state of Israel. However many scholars believe that antisemtism arosed in Muslim lands after establishment of the state of Israel though this is disputed.</i>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=88772208&amp;oldid=88602278" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=88772208&amp;oldid=88602278" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 20:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I added the POV tag for inclusion of other POVs. This version was later modified slightly again when I found more sources. Nevertheless, all these were removed by calling EoI an unreliable source and accusing me of misrepresenting Lewis.

<b>Step 3.</b> The book: "Israel's Place in the Middle East: A Pluralist Perspective" By Nissim Rejwan, Published by <i>University Press of Florida</i> is a reliable source.</p>
<p>Arguments:</p>
<p>1. The publication is a university press, meaning that it is "peer-reviewed". The University Press of Florida states that further this book has won the year’s best book of non-fiction published in the category of Israel Studies from "Jewish Book Council’s 1998 Morris J. and Betty Kaplun Foundation National Jewish Book Award" <a href="http://www.upf.com/news/rejwan%20prize.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.upf.com/news/rejwan%20prize.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That the publication is from a university press does not necessarily mean that it is peer-reviewed. As I understand, not all university presses peer-review works they publish. The University Press of Florida does not claim to apply peer-review on its website. While this author sounds like a bona fide source, it isn't immediately clear how relevant the book is to the question. A secondary source is best used for questions it deals with directly - it seems like this may not be an ideal source for this article. Is it an edited volume or a monograph, or what? But I may be wrong. In any case, I'm not sure from the citation in the last version of the page it appeared in, what it was being cited for. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 01:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely that's the difference between university presses and other presses. Univ presses practice peer-reviewing. Prof. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a> pointed this out in relation to the books of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a>.

But I am sure many users have seen that. Rijwan in this book says:""Anti-Semitism, then, is an exclusively Christian phenomenon and, as such, a predominantly Western one.

<dd>Anti-Semitism is an exclusively Christian phenomenon if the author chooses to define it that way. This reminds me of attempts to define racism as something only white people can be guilty of. To the extent that it is a viewpoint articulated by some notable academics, it may be included as such, subject to due weight; but I would be leery of presenting it as fact. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 01:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

Dhimmis were granted protection of life (including against other Muslim states), the right to residence in designated areas, worship, and work or trade, and were exempted from military service, and Muslim religious duties, personal law and tax on certain conditions such as paying the poll (jizyah) and land taxes as set by Muslim authorities. At the same time they were subject to various restrictions in relation to Muslims and Islam (for example, Muslim men could marry dhimmi women and own dhimmi slaves, but the opposite was not true), the Qur'an or Muhammad (such as desecrating scriptures or defaming the Prophet), and proselytizing. Jews and other non-Muslims were at times subjected to a number of other restrictions such as restrictions on dress, riding horses or camels, carrying arms, holding public office, building or repairing places of worship, mourning loudly, wearing shoes outside a Jewish ghetto, etc."</li>

CSTAR doesn't believe in polls; I simply don't think it's going to work. It might be simpler to state your position (these five propositions, for example) and just ask for comments.

<dd>To be more specific, Aminz, I think you are abusing your sources, as you regularly do, selectively quoting them in ways that distort their actual positions. <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, in fact, puts it quite well:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality was of course more complex, less idyllic, less one-sided. There had been times of persecution under the Muslims and times of prosperity under Christian rule in Spain - and many Christian states, as well as Turkey, had given shelter to Spanish Jewish refugees. Even at its best, medieval Islam was rather different from the picture provided by Disraeli and other romantic writers. The golden age of equal rights was a myth, and belief in it was a result, more than a cause, of Jewish sympathy for Islam. The myth was invented by Jews in nineteenth-century Europe as a reproach to Christians - and taken up by Muslims in our own time as a reproach to Jews.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Like most powerful myths, this story contains an element of historic truth. If tolerance means the absence of persecution, then classical Islamic society was indeed tolerant to both its Jewish and its Christian subjects - more tolerant perhaps in Spain than in the East, and in either incomparably more tolerant than was medieval Christendom. But if tolerance means absence of discrimination, then Islam never was or claimed to be tolerant but on the contrary insisted on the privileged superiority of the true believer in this world as well as in the next. Bernard Lewis. <i>Islam in History: ideas, people, and events in the Middle East</i>, Open Court Publishing, 2001, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0812695186</a>, p. 148.</p>

<dd>Lewis uses unique definitions of antisemitism; Aminz , you abuse this to try to pretend that the medieval Islam did not discriminate against Jews.

<p>I think Aminz is working in good faith and not abusing his sources, certainly not habitually. Quotes are necessarily selective. If he finds most compelling the parts of Lewis that most closely correspond with what Aminz thinks is true, that is hardly surprising, and no more than could be said of most of us. We inevitably start with our own understanding, and look for, and at, scholarly sources that mesh with our understanding. We do have to go beyond that for anything but a superficial treatment.</p>
<p>Jayjg's extended quote raises points about Lewis' position that need to be addressed. I favor including Lewis' opinion on this page, but we need to be careful to correctly and completely articulate Lewis' opinion, where it matches our own as well as where it does not.</p>
<p>Finally, as elsewhere, this page is about antisemitism as a whole. We have <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_antisemitism.html" title="Islam and antisemitism">Islam and antisemitism</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_and_antisemitism.html" title="Arabs and antisemitism">Arabs and antisemitism</a>, and probably others, for more detailed and nuanced consideration of these issues. Just about any true statement or notable opinion can be included somewhere in Wikipedia, but not anywhere or everywhere. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 21:20, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I find particularly interesting in this regard is that - as far as I can without further context for the quotation - the Lewis quote Jayjg gives says nothing about antisemitism. It speaks of Islamic tolerance generally, and of Islamic certainty of superiority generally, but not of hatred or prejudice against Jews.</dd>
<dd>Jayjg then says: "Lewis uses unique definitions of antisemitism; Aminz , you abuse this to try to pretend that the medieval Islam did not discriminate against Jews." This, to my mind, and I hope I am not misrepresenting Jayjg, brings up some very relevant issues which have been already mentioned on this page. First of all, in my view, Lewis's definitions of antisemitism are worthy of discussion in relation to questions of antisemitism in the Islamic world. There can be few writers of greater stature in the field to have addressed the issue in such detail. But secondly, with all due respect to Jayjg, I don't think anyone has claimed that medieval Islam did not discriminate against Jews; but the salient point is surely whether it discriminated against them <i>as Jews</i> or not, whether <i>antisemitism</i> was at issue or not. Whether it discriminated against them insofar as they were non-Muslims - and that it did is not, to the best of my knowledge, questioned - is of no apparent relevance in an article about antisemitism. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 00:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have no background in this literature, so defer your challenge to others, with this caveat: we are not obliged to comform to specialist definitions in our use of well-known terms. The dictionary I linked is hardly the best one, but even so is closer to a reliable source on English-language meanings and usage than are Cahen or Lewis. If our sources document prejudice, hostility and discrimination against Jews, it is not our original research to organize these under a secton dedicated to anti-Semitism anymore than it would be to fairly paraphrase sourced material in any other instance. That specialist definitions have been offered by these scholars is notable, interesting and informative, and deserves mention.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 19:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see "Step 4" above. It is <i>original research</i> to draw connection between an incident and AntiSemitism.

<p>Note: Support of some co-religionist,co-workers, co-genders, etc etc editors is something that should not surprise us if happening <i>at some level</i> especially in religous related articles, (in work), etc etc. It is natural and it happens everywhere in this world. In family, work, and yes in wikipedia. Let me be more clear: Even among Admin in wikipedia. They evaluate each other with a different standard. My point is that making a big deal out of it is not proper especially when that of a particular group is unduly intensified. I can show you cases which were basically the same situation but you remained silent (e.g. recent voting at Dhimmitude). <i>Double standards is the source of problems.</i> --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 10:06, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that if Aminz hadn't decided to establish a poll, nobody could have objected to his asking other interested editors to comment on the issue. As nobody seems to be paying any much heed to the results of the poll, perhaps we can close this argument. Full disclosure: I propose to ask some editors whose neutrality and knowledgable editing I respect to look at this discussion, and the passage, and see if they wish to make any comments. This is part of the normal wiki collaborative process, after all... <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 12:57, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's correct. At the same time, it might be asked whether these solicitations would have been thought worthwhile had the poll not existed. Aminz, as I'd stated earlier, the problem is the way in which some users react to these solicitations, including some whom, no doubt, whom you hadn't contacted, but saw it on someone else's talk page. Other editors (such as myself, in most cases) ignore solicitations to engage in disputes we know little about, so contacting a hundred of us has no mitigating effect. At this point, the problem has been recognized and appears to be under control, so as per Palmiro I retire from this discussion.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 00:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion regarding section "Antisemitism and the Muslim world"</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that there is some divergence in the scholarly opinions that have been cited or suggested for citation here regarding the existence and prevalence of antisemitic ideas in Islam and in Islamic history, and also that part of this is due to differing analytical approaches, e.g. the distinction some draw between anti-Judaism as a religious sentiment and antisemitism as it existed in the Christian world.</p>
<p>I would suggest that in order to reflect these issues in a neutral manner, what is needed is a different approach to the topic. Rather than constructing an argument supported by scholarly sources, the section should begin with an overview of scholarly opinions, stating the different views and elucidating the different analytical frameworks that those views are based on (Lewis's views, for example, would bear discussion). I think this would be more conducive to a clear, informative and neutral treatment of the topic.</p>
<p>Then, on the specific issue of Qur'anic material, rather than presenting a set of examples of quotations from the Qur'an regarding Jews and Judaism and commentary on this, we should explicitly indicate the relevance of such passages to Islamic views and to the treatment of Jews in islamic lands, as seen by scholarly opinion, and when scholarly opinion diverges on the subject, we should say so. It seems more than possible that these passages have been used, and perhaps understood, in different ways and to different extents in the course of Islamic history, but it is not really possible to gain any impression of their real significance from the section as it stands at the moment. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 13:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Highly relevant articles to consider creating</span></h2>
<p>In light of all the articles on antisemitism here and in the antisemitism template, I'd like to propose a few more and I suppose that this is the place to do it (if it is not please redirect me to another location or page on Wiki). Considering we already have articles like "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization_and_antisemitism.html" title="Anti-globalization and antisemitism">Anti-globalization and antisemitism</a>," "<a href="../../../u/n/i/Universities_and_antisemitism.html" title="Universities and antisemitism">Universities and antisemitism</a>," and even "<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_and_antisemitism.html" title="Japan and antisemitism">Japan and antisemitism</a>," I think the following articles can be good, highly relevant additions to the already generous offerings on this subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-Americanism and antisemitism: especially part of the "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a>," Hollywood and antisemitism, Israeli-U.S. policy in the Middle East, etc.</li>
<li>Anti-Communism and antisemitism: so-called "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Bolshevism_3b83.html" title="Jewish Bolshevism">Jewish Bolshevism</a>," Nazi theories of Jewish controlled USSR, actual Jewish prominence in the Soviet Union, the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee_96d3.html" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> targeted many supposed "Jewish communists" in Hollywood (<a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_blacklist.html" title="Hollywood blacklist">Hollywood blacklist</a>), current manifestations of this in some parts of modern Eastern Europe (former Soviet bloc) &amp; Russia, etc.</li>
<li>Anti-Capitalism and antisemitism: so-called "Jewish controlled" industries, Nazi boycotts of Jewish businesses, etc: just search the internet -- there are links everywhere on this subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final two could go under a larger heading titled something like "Economic antisemitism," because Jews have been accused throughout their recent (and sometimes ancient) history of being <i>both</i> "greedy" capitalists <i>and</i> "exploitative" communists.</p>
<p>All of these areas have strong support for articles; there are easily dozens of reliable, scholarly websites/articles for each of these proposed articles, not to mention many books on these topics. I can start posting some good links that I've found here if some people like here feel like collaborating to create these articles over the next few weeks/months.

<p>I think he's bemoaning the lack of care taken to distinguish the virulent hatred of Jews that "antisemitism" signifies from the concept invented by a few rightists and pro-Israelis that goes by the name "new antisemitism". One is a demonstrable thing, with a long history. The other is a smear. Lumping the latter in with the former helps reinforce a current political stance and line of thinking (the same line of thinking that tends to smear any critic of Israel's policies in the territories that it disputes with others and other territories around it as "antisemites", as though criticism of Israel was always motivated by hatred for Jews). The editors pushing that view even occasionally become confused, claiming in one place that there <i>is</i> (rather than that some people with an axe to grind say there is) a "new antisemitism" -- a confederation of Muslim and Left in Jewhating -- but in others that Muslims have in any case always been antisemites. This isn't the place to argue whether the increased fever of leftist criticism of Israel, which is apparent, has tipped over into antisemitism (or into stances that encourage antisemitism), which I'd tend to agree it unfortunately has, but it's a debit to Wikipedia that articles are slanted in this way. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 08:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Different views</span></h2>
<p>Here are the list of different views</p>
<ul>
<li>There was no antisemitism: According to scholars such as <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anti-semitism was not entirely absent as it is assumed by Cahen. If the term 'anti-Semitism' could be used for the particular form of anti-Judaism understood from the Geniza letters, the antisemitism appears to have been local and sporadic rather than general and endemic.: According to S. D. Goitein</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There was little specific antisemitism except in periods of religous extremism: <i>The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion</i> states.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Leon Poliakov maintains that the term "antisemitism" could be used in relation with Islam only with qualifications.</li>

<p>Not any prejudice is antisemitism. Not any persecution is antisemitism. Not everything in the Islamic texts about the Jews is antisemitism. And that's the point.

<dd>Lewis's views are <b>highly idiosyncratic</b>, and few scholars of antisemitism agree with him. But even Lewis admits that there was antisemitism (in his "cosmic evil" sense) by the 19th century. You seem to want to deny there was ever any antisemitism in Muslim countries before Israel (just a few prejudicial massacres, nothing to fuss about), and after Israel, it was anti-Zionism, not antisemitism, which is of course completely legitimate, even when it involves calling Jews monkeys and pigs. This means that Muslims all over the world were the only people never to have fallen victim to the virus of antisemitism. This is an absurd and offensive view, which is demonstrably false, yet you've been trying to push it into multiple articles for months, trying to get Lewis mentioned wherever possible, revert warring when you're opposed, and tagging when you don't revert. <b>Please</b> read material by someone other than Lewis.

<p>Well, those who do not agree with Lewis's view or Cahen's view state that they are in minority. If it is not so and many incidents in pre-modern Islam were antisemitism, then it should be easy for them to find one scholar saying: There was a lot of antisemitism. The Oxford Dictionary of Judaism says there was little antisemitism because Jews were treated like others. Thus, I don't think these views are in minority.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Issues with the historiography of this series of articles</span></h2>
<p>From the WP article on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>.</p>
<p>"In the preface to his book the Muqaddimah, historian and early sociologist Ibn Khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past."</p>
<p>I'm wondering whether the reason that discussion on this article is currently stalled is because this point has not been sufficiently considered. Some serious attention should be paid to whether the term "antisemitism" can be usefully applied at all before the 19th century? I don't have a simple answer to the question and suggest that this article should summarise the usage of the major authors on the topic. Whether it can or not be applied retrospectively, is there a sound logic for separating the Christian and Muslim histories rather than following a chronological structure?</p>
<p>Also, the debates relating to this article might be more easily resolved by considering its place within the series. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_antisemitism.html" title="History of antisemitism">History of antisemitism</a> is actually just a timeline. A useful adjunct, but mainly unsourced and wrongly titled. <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_badge.html" title="Yellow badge">Yellow badge</a> is also a timeline. And <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> is as bedevilled by controversy as is this article.</p>
<p>Would it not be far more logical to have this article as an overview presenting the main definitions used by important writers, referring to a strong sub-article on the history, which would in turn have its own sub-articles on the relevant historical periods?<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 23:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Judith, your point is well made, but what we do here is simply report what the major sources say. If <i>they</i> apply the term "antisemitism" to events before the 19th century (and most seem to), then so do we, because we simply repeat what they say. Again, if the major sources separate Christian and Muslim histories, so must we. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> actually isn't "bedevilled by controversy," and nor is this one; the number of editors complaining is very small and they do not, so far as I can tell, have specialist knowledge. I'm not familiar with this page, but I do know that <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> <i>very faithfully</i> reflects what the major, published, scholarly sources say, and that is what we must do. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would suggest that while some authors would apply the term in that way, others are not happy to do so. Lewis would come into the latter category, at least as far as the Islamic world goes. And as he is the major historian of Jewish-Islamic relations his view should be reflected here.</dd>

<dd>Not all major sources separate Christian and Muslim histories; in fact most of the recent scholarship seems to have the explicit aim of taking a broader look and placing events in context. (Cohen's <i>Under Crescent and Cross</i> for example.) And indeed the timelines in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_antisemitism.html" title="History of antisemitism">History of antisemitism</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_badge.html" title="Yellow badge">Yellow badge</a> in this encyclopedia keep to a strictly chronological structure, interweaving events from all geographical locations. Keeping these two stories separate gives an unwarranted impression that it was <i>Christianity</i> and <i>Islam</i> as <i>religions</i> that implemented repressive measures against Jews. This ignores the important messages of some historians as to how attitudes to minority populations were related to the development of secular, state power, or to the clash between two empires, or even to technological and economic development.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 10:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Slim you know that there are some passages where he picks apart the differences between attitudes to Jews in medieval Islam and modern forms of antisemitism. Now, is Lewis the source for the distinction made in the lead between three types of antisemitism? There is currently no source given for this division and there should be, because it is not up to us to do this kind of conceptual work. And although there are multiple sources for the idea of New antisemitism there is none for "religious antisemitism".<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 20:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry you didn't understand my other points. Let me put it this way: this article is trying to reduce a massive body of knowledge spanning centuries and continents to a short, verifiable, easily accessible article. The structure has to be right to be able to do this adequately. Cf <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, which I've been working on recently to help it towards FA status. The history section is recounted chronologically and it summarises a main article on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Islam_572a.html" title="History of Islam">History of Islam</a> with a similar structure. That frees up the rest of the article to have a topic-by-topic structure dealing with definitions, main features, and an overview of the situation today. Perhaps that could work here.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 12:15, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can well understand the point that one could perceive the current structure of the articles to not clearly indicate the historical differences between the various forms of anti-semitisism that have existed over time, and that differentiation is an important one to make. Certainly, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Armstrong_ba0b.html" title="Karen Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a> recently devoted an entire book to discussing the histories and differences between Christian, Jewish, and Islamic fundamentalism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neutrality and Off-Topic Tag</span></h2>
<p>The Off-Topic tag was added because many parts of this section are related to the status of Jews in Muslim lands which is not related to antisemitism. Dhimmi regulation for example. Some passages were taken from places where the author has not been writing about AntiSemitism.</p>
<p>While the neutrality concerns were raised sometimes. One example is "There are Islamic literary sources in medieval age in which the contemporary Jew is endowed with positive characteristics." from Judica Encyclopedia. The "Jews blasphemously claim that Ezra is the son of God" is directed towards particular Jews who were taken heretic beliefs (e.g. David Waines An Introduction to Islam, p.27). The distinction between particular Jews and Jews is important. Furthermore, the issue of Quranic polemics can be best covered in Quran and polemic (as in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_the_Qur%27an_24fd.html" title="Encyclopedia of the Qur'an">Encyclopedia of the Qur'an</a>). Their particular relevance should be established. According to some scholars, the Qur'an is reflecting many of the polemics which some sects of Christianity and Judaism were addressing toward each other at the time of Muhammad. Anyways.</p>
<p>BUT the first step is not discussion of neutrality but rather which sections are relevant to antisemitism. After reaching concensus on that, we can discuss neutrality.

<dd><a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a>, from what I can tell, Lewis hesitates to label institutional discrimination against Jews as "antisemitism" because the discrimination was extended to Christians as well. That is surely a valid point of view, but he clearly does not dispute the premise that Jews were at best subject to discrimination and at worst murderous persecution under Muslim regimes because they were Jewish. The article goes to some lengths to differentiate between different types of antisemitism, among them those that are based on religious rather than racist premises; so it must follow that dhimmitude and other discrimination properly belongs in this article. Otherwise, someone else might equally logically make the argument that Hitler's race theories had nothing to do with antisemitism since they also included persecution of "Slavs," Gypsies, and others considered "inferior." --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 22:36, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Both in the Muslim Near East and the Ancient Near East, persecution of Jews was not a reaction to "Judaism" racial or religious but was a function of ANE culture - political competition, geography, sometimes culture, etc. As I've mentioned elsewhere, there should really be an article on this phenomenon (probably taking the place of the anti-Judaism article (which in my opinion is nonsense) or the Judeophobia redirect. -- <b><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChabuk_81ec.html" title="User:Chabuk">Chabuk</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChabuk_849e.html" title="User talk:Chabuk">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chabuk_38b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chabuk">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 15:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>We currently have a situation over multiple articles where various editors are protesting that pogroms, murdering Jews, spitting on them, stoning them, teaching children to call them monkeys and pigs, expelling them or refusing to let them leave, forcing them to wear special clothes, publicly condemning Judaism, suggesting that Jews killed Jesus and Muhummad and bombed the World Trade Center, forcing them to live in certain areas, banning them from certain professions, suggesting that synagogues be set on fire or, indeed, setting them on fire ... and so on ... are not examples of antisemitism. We can call it anti-Judaism, or Judeophobia, or prejudice, or persecution, or perhaps even Judenhass, but we <i>must</i> not call it antisemitism, because antisemitism "has a special meaning." Come on! Would editors please stop imposing their personal opinions on this topic, and read what the scholarly sources write about it — and that means reading <b>a great deal more</b> than Bernard Lewis. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Shall we all calm down and have a cup of tea? I haven't seen anyone trying to justify oppression, violence and discrimination - perhaps I am not looking at the same articles. Proabivouac has expressed a sensible point with which I would like to politely disagree. In my opinion we are getting confused because "antisemitism" can have both an everyday meaning and a technical meaning within the social sciences. Compounding that grounds for confusion, the technical meaning is by no means fixed but varies considerably between authors. What it seems to me needs to happen at this stage is that we agree which authors are most important and then we go away and consult how they use the term. Slim has read much more on this topic than most of the rest of us will ever have the time to do, so perhaps she could please list the two or three authors she thinks are absolutely essential and some others whose views should be reflected.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 23:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've always understood anti-Semitism had to have something to do with hatred by definition. If someone believes that performing a religious ritual every seventh time the Earth spins on its axis is a silly primative superstition, that's certainly an anti-Judaic belief, as keeping the sabbath is a central tenent of Judaism (last I checked). I don't know what your ivory tower intellectuals want you to believe on this score, but I'm simply not convinced that anyone who holds such a belief is an anti-Semite.

To the contrary, it emphasizes that Jesus and his early followers were Jews speaking to other Jews in the tradition of some earlier prophets; the Tanakh is full of self-rebuke.

<dl>
<dd>It is a straw man argument becuase no scholar of antisemitism has ever said that any criticism of Israel is antisemitism. Antisemites, however, frequently hide behind this assertion. First, they demonize Israel and denounce it as the root of all evil in the world; then, they claim that they are maligned as antisemites for "criticizing Israel". No, they are called antisemites for their fixation on Israel and its demonization, for carrying posters like the one you can see in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> and for calling the only democracy in the Middle East "an apartheid state". To say that Israel was wrong to withdraw from Gaza because it only encouraged terrorists is perfectly legitimate criticism; to say that the Israeli government rules America or distributes poisoned food to Palestinians is antisemitism. Please read <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> to see why "criticism of Israel is not necessarily antisemitism" does not belong to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 12:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm. I may be beginning to follow something here. I once was in the company of someone who would say something provoking to me, i.e. figuratively, slap me in the face. Then, they would be upset, even angry with me, that I was not comforting them because their hand hurt. (There's probably some scholarly or clinical terms for this. ) Ok. If this kind of exchange happens, I suppose sometimes 'we' can address the one whose hand hurts.

<dd><i>These poison gas attacks were perpetrated just two years ago, by Israeli troops against civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Although they are documented by a small mountain of detailed and consistent open-source information, they remain a silent, ignored, seemingly untouchable story. At least eight separate attacks were reported from February 12 through March 30, 2001, first in the Gaza Strip and later in the West Bank. Several hundred civilians are reported to have suffered from exposure to the gas. Many required prolonged hospitalization. Six weeks after the initial attacks, a doctor caring for victims at Ali Nasser Hospital in Gaza said, "We still have 10 cases who we would like to send abroad for treatment."</i></dd>
<dd><i>The poison gas canisters were unfamiliar, marked only with a few numerals and Hebrew letters. The smoking gas they released was non-irritating and initially odorless. After a few minutes a sweet, minty fragrance would emerge. One victim recalled that "the smell was good. You want to breathe more. You feel good when you inhale it." The smoke often spewed in a "rainbow" of changing colors, ending in a steady billow of black soot.</i></dd>

<dd><i>Aptly and with due reference to the subject of "poison", the book presents its case initially through the events of March 21 1983 when Palestinian girls at Arrabeh school near Jenin were reportedly poisoned en masse by .....Israel. Further events following at later dates with 56 Arab girls at Jenin's Zahra School likewise being taken ill and in April another 310 Arab girls at Hebron being hospitalized.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Despite investigations revealing that the reported poisoning was merely a case of mass hysteria, the book reveals how the International media reported Palestinian/Arab accusations as fact, irrespective of the circumstances and their lack of authenticity. Little if any time being given to provide the Israeli version of events and the fact that poison pollution teams had examined the schools but found absolutely no trace of poison in any case. Reporters instead are shown to be only too prepared to publicly declare the horrendous allegation that Israel had used Nazi methods in these alleged incidents.</i></dd>

<dd><i>It is a straw man argument becuase no scholar of antisemitism has ever said that any criticism of Israel is antisemitism. Antisemites, however, frequently hide behind this assertion. First, they demonize Israel and denounce it as the root of all evil in the world; then, they claim that they are maligned as antisemites for "criticizing Israel". No, they are called antisemites for their fixation on Israel and its demonization, for carrying posters like the one you can see in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> and for calling the only democracy in the Middle East "an apartheid state".

<p>FWIW, when I read "the Israeli government rules America or distributes poisoned food to Palestinians" what comes to mind for me is "ignorance" or "conspiracy theory." For me, one who can say the Israeli government does these things <i>may or may not</i> be anti-Semitic or anti-Judaism. If when pressed on this concept, the one who said this about the Israeli government also <i>believed</i> this, it would be pretty hard for someone to convince me that the person was not anti-Semitic and/or anti-Judaism. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 11:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

You seem to be trying to claim that as soon as Jews become Israelis, you can invesnt any conspiracy theory against them without being called an antisemite.

<p>I'm not sure who you're addressing, Beit Or, but I'm not trying to "claim" anything. I observe many people who base their life on ignorance or conspiracy theories. I do not believe in any conspiracy theories ... not that I'm aware of anyway. And I'm not exactly ignorant. IMO, people who think this: "the Israeli government rules America or distributes poisoned food to Palestinians" or who think Israel is responsible for 9/11 or some such nonsense, in my opinion, are ignorant or have been sucked in by a conspiracy theory. Just my observation, perhaps.

<dd>According to your logic, those who believe that Jews use blood of non-Jews for Passover are also just ignorant. One can be ignorant and antisemitic at the same time.

If when given the truth, they insisted they were right (i.e. non-Jew blood is a part of Passover), then I'd say they are anti-semitic. Much hatred of the "other" is often based on unfamiliarity ... And, much is not.

<p>I think the point is this: there is no value or sense to adding this quote to the article <i>unless</i> we also have a quote from a verifiable and appropriate source - off the top of my head, examples would be leaders of major Jewish organizations like the WZO, AJC, or B'nai Brith, or a leader of a major Israeli political party, or an acknowledged (published in peer-reviewed journals or academic press) scholar of anti-Semitism)- claiming that any or all criticism of Israel <i>is</i> ipso facto anti-semitic. IF we have such a quote, then the quote from Itsmejudish becomes pertinent.

<p>I think your counter-argument fails because you have selected an example of extreme views namely those who "demonize Israel and denounce it as the root of evil in the world." By the same token the example of legitimate criticism that you provided is relatively tepid. In between there is a large spectrum of critical opinion. For example, there are those who reject the notion of an Israel lobby controlling U.S. Policy as absurd, yet who nevertheless argue that Israel is the main agressor in the region and/or that the occupation has been illegitimate and that justice requires that major reparations be made to the Palestinian people. Yet even some of those who hold these kind of critical positions get labelled as anti-semites. I could go on, but for a little more clarification would you please tell me if you consider the following statement to be anti-semitic?</p>

<dd>Jay, something your comment ignores is that <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_antisemitism.html" title="Racial antisemitism">Racial antisemitism</a> is not an epithet used by some rightists to smear leftist anti-Zionists but describes a clearly definable thing, much in evidence throughout history, which even those who perpetrate it would not deny exists! IOW, the <i>real thing</i> is much more important and worthy of discussion, at greater length, than the <i>quasi thing</i> invented by your favourite pro-Israeli mouthpieces. That you wish the summary to reflect only that view of it is another issue, which should be dealt with on the page for the article in question, but let's face it, never will be. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reducing antisemitism</span></h2>
<p>There have now been efforts - discussed in this talk page - to eliminate from the definition of antisemitism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrimination and persecution of Jews on religious grounds (anti-Judaism)</li>
<li>Discrimination and persecution of Jews with a pretext in the concept of dhimmitude</li>
<li>Discrimination and persecution of Jews with a pretext in anti-Israeli activism</li>
</ul>
<p>If all these objections to the scope of antisemitism carried the day, we'd be left with a definition of antisemitism that was only based on theories of race. Is there anyone who actually believes that this is the only form of discrimination and persecution of Jews - because they are Jews - that qualifies as antisemitism? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't agree in eliminating the definitions of antisemitism as it is still prevalent and travels globally some times unchecked. Documentation of hate of any kind should not be reduced (here in this article or else where), minimized or hidden. Upon reading the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a> I see antisemitism is alive and doing very well, even put into DVDs for export "A DVD of preachings by a radical Australian sheikh, in which he refers to Jews as pigs "<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/outrage-at-sheikhs-pig-jibe/2007/01/18/1168709878630.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/outrage-at-sheikhs-pig-jibe/2007/01/18/1168709878630.html" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>!

<dd>Sorry, I shouldn't have tried to place that in without clear sight (just had eye surgery..still not good). This issue is of particular interest to me as I had the impression for some time that there was this strong lobby/activism in the Jewish community and so they didn’t need assistance.</dd>
<dd>Then our local Jewish temple was vandalized and well I was a bit surprised about the political reaction “silence”. So, some were asked to write what we thought was bringing about the vandalizing with a clear hate message. Shortly after that article was published the mayor and council members went about on foot, door to door on a whistle campaign to stomp out the problem. My point being that it was the “minimizing” that allowed the hate to continue and everyone seemed to have forgotten that this temple had suffered an act of arson in the past, and more importantly that it was part of the “whole” community. So, I hope I have clarified my position and my sincere apologies to if anyone I left the wrong impression. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkAbout_6f36.html" title="User:TalkAbout">TalkAbout</a> 22:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)PEACE</dd>

<p>I hope this can be taken as a neutral question: Is there a good reason for putting this link at the top?

<dd>Ok, well at least hear me out. Basically, "Antisemitism," I think, is a rather monumental topic, like <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> (each subjects with their own banners, etc.). Everybody knows what these subjects are when they come to them. So just as a general matter, it strikes me as odd then to link from such a broad topic to a subissue at the outset. It almost implies that "Antisemitism" as its own term is dated, or at least that many would arrive here by accident when they're actually looking for New Antisemitism, neither of which seems correct.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There's also a NPOV problem, though, simply because the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Antisemitism_b40d.html" title="New Antisemitism">New Antisemitism</a> is controversial. Thus, it sets WP up as seemingly promoting a controversial theory, from a topic much broader and completely accepted. This could really be misleading, even, by impliedly linking to <i>contemporary</i> antisemitism, when "New Antisemitism" is, by definition, much more specific. Thus, a person clicks the link thinking, "Ah, Antisemitism today, perfect," but shows up on an article which then defines it as something coming from the left, not the right, etc. Of course, that's politically significant. I'm simply saying I'd avoid the problem, since New Antisemitism really isn't a discussion of contemporary antisemitism, but actually a specific theory regarding contemporary antisemitism, to which many object.

<dd>Are you familiar with any scholars of antisemitism who object, Mackan? There aren't many who do, so it's really not that controversial. There are political activists on the left who dispute it, but that's because it's by and large aimed at them, and they're not experts on antisemitism. No one who studies antisemitism (that I know of) believes that it only comes, or even largely comes, from the right, and we link to the page that most comprehensively discusses some of the ideas about where current/contemporary/new antisemitism emanates from. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the New Antisemitism page makes pretty clear that it's controversial in many respects. Even if many scholars don't object per se, I'm pretty sure they acknowledge the controversiality. And some do object, strenuously. At the same time, the New Antisemitism isn't just a scholarly issue, it also has huge spillover in the political realm. Again, though, isn't it also misleading to put this specific theory up at the top, as if it's simply a discussion of contemporary antisemitism, when it's actually a specific theory on contemporary antisemitism to which many people, scholars and otherwise, strenuously object? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 19:24, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But to the extent we're acknowleding this limited scope and this controversy, that's hardly a great reason to put it up at the top, as "<i>the article you may find more useful than this one.</i>" Shouldn't we just settle for discussing <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Antisemitism_b40d.html" title="New Antisemitism">New Antisemitism</a> and linking to it where it's discussed in the article? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 01:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All you're doing is presenting my own work back to me. Finkelstein and Chomsky are not scholars of antisemitism. Klug, Zipperstein, and Raab do not "object strenuously." Klug in particular makes clear that he believes that the ideas and incidents included under the heading "new antisemitism" are indeed new and <i>are</i> examples of bigotry; his main concern is that he feels there's no clear lineage from classic antisemitism to the new concept.</dd>

<p>If you know so much about New Antisemitism, why am I having to convince you that it's a controversial theory? I respect your respect for scholarly sources, and you have scholarly sources to show that the theory is controversial. But the New Antisemitism is much more than a scholarly theory on antisemitism. It's also a political theory, which has received extensive discussion in the political realm, all of which is just as relevant to WP as the experts on antisemitism, particularly in showing that the theory is controversial, as in contentious, as in politically contentious, which is the only point I'm making. I don't believe I'm in any way underqualified to make this point. In fact, I think it's actually a point much more related to political science than it is to scholarship on antisemitism.</p>
<p>To your second point, however, would you please stop asking me hostile questions on talk pages? You're the only person who has acted like I need to present a resume in order to edit on WP. You have no right to ask, and it is not even proper, for me to offer up my personal history or political leanings as some basis for my making a suggestion on this or any article. I understand your concern about cranks, but you simply can't go around assuming bad faith and personally interrogating everybody whose edits you don't deem to sufficiently show whatever it is you want them to show.

<p>Re: <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAntisemitism_2117.html" title="Talk:Antisemitism">Talk:Antisemitism</a>, I think you should know why these questions are inappropriate. 1. Politics and personal views aren't supposed to be a part of this. 2. There's no right answer. What do I say, "No, I'm <i>very</i> familiar with arguments about antisemitism"? Or do I say "No, I really don't know anything about antisemitism." Either answer simply give you more ammunition, to which I can't respond, since we're both only anonymous users on the internet. Do I tell you, "Actually, Norman Finkelstein is my brother, and I don't like the way people attack him." Or "My uncle is a Palestinian refugee, that's why I don't like Israel, not because I'm antisemitic." Or "Actually I have 12 degrees from Harvard in Middle Eastern Studies." If I said that, would you leave me alone? Of course not: there's no right answer. That's why we're supposed to deal with the articles, not the users. 3. Every time you ask me this, you're telling the group that you, SlimVirgin, admin and longtime user, believe that I, Mackan79, am here for illegitimate reasons. If I respond by saying I've already explained this to you several times, the idea is only rubbed in further. This is not fair. It dissuades other people from having a dialogue with me, because they see that you don't want them to.</p>
<p>As I said, I understand why you would be suspicious in general, as antisemites seem to make their appearances, but you simply can't <a href="../../../a/b/f/WP%7EABF_c955.html" title="WP:ABF">WP:ABF</a>.

<dd>Your edits are often POV and, more importantly, show no knowledge of the subject matter you're editing. In addition, you seem to focus on Jews. That raises certain questions, and they are legitimate questions, not only about the editor, but also about content. You're asking people to spend time answering your questions on talk, which are often wrong-headed because you haven't read the literature, and although this is very time-consuming, you expect them to do it without a peep. If they don't, you start reverting on the grounds that no one is replying to you, and you ask other people with no knowledge of the subject to join in reverting with you in order to keep it going. You then complain that people are unjustly suspicious of you. Please think about the reasonableness of that position. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I gave you an example above. I asked you a question about new antisemitism. You responded by quoting back to me a Wikipedia article that I've written.

<p>Slim, please read back what you have written. You can wonder all you like about Mackan's motivations, but wondering aloud is tantamount to assuming bad faith. I don't wonder aloud about why you edit the articles you do. People might wonder why I have recently spent time editing articles about small Indian towns and districts. I wonder myself. I have virtually no knowledge about them; there might be an element of unhealthy fascination. However, the important thing is that while my ignorance has been a barrier in some ways, on balance I have improved the quality of the encyclopedia. I could explain to you how my interest in the anti-Semitism articles arises, but you would tell me that it wasn't relevant for the talk page.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 21:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Slim, I think you're personally attacking me, and I think it's without justification, and I think it's inappropriate. I believe you're directly violating both <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. It's impossible for me to prove my good faith to you, when you have no idea who I am. This is why WP requires that we act civilly to each other. Is this simply not possible for you to do? I really feel like we could, and that it would be for the better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, right here, I'm suggesting that <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Antisemitism_b40d.html" title="New Antisemitism">New Antisemitism</a> is a controversial theory. I really don't think I'm out in the woods on this one, or that this shows some strange bias. In the end, isn't it really pretty clear, to the extent you probably don't even have to be an expert to see the controversy? That's how I feel about it. I'd appreciate if you or anyone else could respond.

<dd>The problem is that some people think they can form an opinion on antisemitism and other Jewish issues without having done a scintilla of research. The same people wouldn't dream of going to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantilever_bridge.html" title="Cantilever bridge">Cantilever bridge</a> to argue the toss with engineers, or <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc%C2%B2.html" title="E=mc²">E=mc²</a> to argue with physicists, <i>unless they knew what they were talking about</i>. But they seem to think it's fine to turn up at pages related to Jews and just argue for any old thing that strikes them as plausible, and almost always from a position of opposition, oddly. But antisemitism is an enormously complicated subject, and the amount of reading that needs to be done to understand the development of scholarly views about it is horrific. To be honest, the kind of editing I'm talking about strikes me as baiting, pure and simple, because I can't see any other reason for it. Articles about Islam suffer the same fate for a similar reason, and I strongly oppose it there too. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right that it's POV Mackan, but it's POV either way. Either you believe new anti-Semitism is a logical and historical extention of the anti-Semitism discussed here, or you believe it's some pro-Israeli canard, or you're somewhere in between, but ultimately there's no possibility of a negotiated settlement as to where the link goes because it's all or nothing. Sometimes you just have to give the devil his due. <i>So what are you trying to say Kendrick7, that all Jews are devils!?</i> No, dang it Slim Virgin, it's just an <i>expression</i> — <i>get outta my head!!</i> OK, so SV gets to me a little too sometimes.

<dd>I will talk you to death, Kendrick&#160;:) The problem is twofold: 1. The theory is controversial, but 2. Even if it weren't, it's still just one theory. It's the combination that does it in. The point is, if there's a "dab" at the top, it'd be entirely appropriate going to a neutral article on contemporary antisemitism. But that's not what <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Antisemitism_b40d.html" title="New Antisemitism">New Antisemitism</a> is. It's <i>one</i> discrete theory on contemporary antisemitism. The predominant theory among experts, perhaps, but still just one theory. That is, the theory that antisemitism today is basically manifested in leftist hyper-criticism of Israel. That's why I'm saying it's clearly out of place: It doesn't make sense for such a monumental topic as Antisemitism to link up top to one discrete theory -- controversial or not -- but particularly not when it's controversial. It'd be somewhat similar to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> linking up top to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_Race_Theory_60b9.html" title="Critical Race Theory">Critical Race Theory</a>, although that's probably less controversial. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 06:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The link at top of the page is just for a question of practicity, right? Someone searching for one concept, and ends up in another, one appreciates these little wiki-helps. It is not corroborating or less the concept of "new anti-semitism". I see nothing wrong with the link there, but maybe with a different writing: "This article describes the development and history of antisemitism. A separate article exists on the more recent (and more controversial) concept of New antisemitism." I am not sure how, but the sentence, to be useful to the user, should make clear that "the more recent concept of New antisemitsm" DOES NOT MEAN "antisemitism in recent times", nor should imply that antisemitism until this moment has been A (traditional anti-semitism) and from now on is B (new antisemitism). That is why I would eliminate the word "traditional" (which, by they way, implies an almost homogeneous and non changeable idea of anti-semitism, as if antisemitism in the 19th century was the same of medieval anti-judaism, which is contradicted by the article itself).</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I am more interested in discussing the way "new antisemitism" is presented in the body of the article. Some of the confusion seems to come from the origem of the entry. I believe "new anti-semitism" is a subentry of "anti-zionismo" (i.e., the proposal that much of the criticism against Israel is also or mainly anti-semitism). Let me come clean and say that I don't agree with the way the concept has been framed by its main proponents--but that is another story. The point here is how to present the concept within the main entry (antisemitism) in a way that makes sense. As it is, I believe it is a bit repetitive, "new anti-semitism" and "antisemitism and anti-zionism". Would you agree that it is possible to merge both, in this article? I would have done it myself, but when I saw this discussion going on here, I thought that it would be prudent to discuss it with those who have been editing this article for some time...</dd>

<dd>There's also another problem, though, which is allowing disruptive people to create a presumption of bad faith, and allowing self-styled experts unchecked authority. I'm not denying that many disruptive people show up here. I do think WP has shown an ability to cope through its procedures, however, and not by abandoning <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in the hope of smoking bad people out.

<dd>I also think your attacks against my (and others') ignorance are exaggerated. Antisemitism is not an insular field. Various aspects, like the New Antisemitism, are entirely connected with other things -- racism, religion, domestic and world politics, and more. I'm not an expert in antisemitism, but I've studied these related areas a great deal. I'm currently learning about antisemitism. So you can claim this is an esoteric issue of whether the New Antisemitism is controversial, but I really don't think it is. I think the article, which you apparently wrote (it's a good article, btw, except the picture at the top, which I think is excessive), makes this entirely clear. I could produce other sources, but I don't see the need, when the point is made throughout the article already.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One other thing: I really do believe that NPOV on these contentious articles is good, for WP, and for everyone in the world, including you. I also don't think experts are always keenly aware of NPOV issues, just like an expert in string theory might not be keenly aware of grammatical issues. Sometimes, a person with almost no background in a subject can provide insight, which shouldn't be pushed away. I'm pretty sure I'm not arguing about things that are beyond my comprehension, but of course, I'll always accept an explanation for why I am. This may be tedious, but I also don't see a better option. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 23:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please accept that editing from an anti-Jewish/anti-Israel POV, when you have no specialist knowledge, you're not an experienced editor, and you're very often undoing other people's work, is extremely time-consuming for other editors, and it inevitably weakens assumptions of good faith. If you really want good faith to be restored, you have to help it on its way. You say people with no background in a subject can provide insight, but it's almost always only the people with no background who believe that.

How would you feel if I were to turn up there, with strong views but no knowledge, and proceeded to make uninformed edits, engaging in revert, revert, revert when you tried to correct me; then drew you into several weeks-long debates on talk about what this or that meant, all the while refusing to read a single thing about it, except what I could easily find on Google?

<dd>Well, I understand you have an argument here; the problem is simply that I don't fit it. I'm not anti-Jewish, I'm not anti-Israel, and I'm not ignorant. I respect your frustration with people who come on here with no idea what they're talking about. I also respect the sensitivity, and that a person pushing for true neutrality on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> or the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> has to expect, and understand, that there's going to be strong resistance. This is why I've tried very hard not to lash back. Nevertheless, I continue to strongly believe truly neutral articles really do benefit everybody. Indeed, I certainly know enough about antisemitism to know if there's one thing that encourages antisemites, it's a politicized article on antisemitism. And if there's one thing that will effectively educate people, I think it's a truly neutral article on antisemitism. I think this is serious.</dd>

For how much benefit, at the cost of giving an immediate appearance of bias to anyone who knows the topic? Anybody anti-Israel who sees this is immediately going to say "Ah, clearly written by Zionists." This was my same concern with the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> page. How much benefit did the article get for jamming that information into the first sentence, at the expense of giving the article an immediate flavor of bias? I truly think it benefits nobody, and I think Jayjg ultimately agreed. If I were going by Kendrick's analysis, it'd be a no-brainer: a link like this probably won't misinform many at all. It simply saps the article's credibility. So if I wanted that, I'd say sure, leave it in. That's not my aim. At the same time, it does also annoy me, simply because I know it's not neutral. I know a neutral writer wouldn't link "New Antisemitism" at the top of an article on Antisemitism. So I'll be honest, things like that also just bug me.</dd>

I'll say it again: I recognize that you have a legitimate frustration, but I think you've lumped me into that frustration too quickly. I'm not an expert, but I'm not ignorant either, unless you can show where. That means if you want to revert me, you'll probably have to keep explaining why...

They insist their POV is simply common sense, common knowledge, NPOV. One example of someone at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> who feels they are a model of NPOV: this person changed the description of a certain lawyer who complained about new antisemitism from "a leading litigation lawyer" to ["a lawyer] who has since moved to Israel."

If we all know what the reliable sources on any given topic say, then all that remains is to make sure the writing's good, and to argue about the balance of material from X as opposed to material from Y. But if editors haven't read X or Y — and worst of all, refuse to read it, year in, year out, despite continuing to edit in those areas — we're left with nothing to do but exchange prejudices on talk pages, which leads to frustration all round. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My edit on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Antisemitism_b40d.html" title="New Antisemitism">New Antisemitism</a> was a concilliatory attempt toward a compromise, suggesting that if we simply combine the first two paragraphs, it would help clarify the concept such that the dab link here might be ok. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, I'm trying very hard to work nicely with you. I'm also interested in these subjects, though, and have read and studied and discussed them a great deal with people of all varying viewpoints, and actually, think I'm pretty well-equipped to discuss neutrality on these issues. So please don't expect me to simply go away. The Middle East is interesting, you know, for a lot of reasons.</dd>

<p>--- Hi Mackan79, For me this is such a long thread that perhaps the best way to weigh in on your opening</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>I hope this can be taken as a neutral question: Is there a good reason for putting this link at the top? My understanding is that New Antisemitism isn't just a phrase for current Antisemitism, but refers to a specific theory surrounded by a lot of controversy. Wouldn't the link more appropriately go simply by the discussion of New Antisemitism in the article? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 04:11, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>is to try to focus on it alone. (Though I have read, not studied, the rest of the thread.) For me, I come to an encyclopedia to begin finding out about topics of interest. Encyclopedias are not the end-all-be-all of all scholarly knowledge, but they can be a great place to start. This article on antisemitism is a good place, for me, to start. I have long known about the religious and racial kinds of antisemitism. When I use this WP article to get a grounding on today's understanding of antisemitism, I find the disambiguation link at the very top of the article that references New Antisemitism helpful. If I want to know what it is, the link is there. If I want to read the primary article first, I'm already there. WP is a continually updated encyclopedia. In this vein, it seems most appropriate that what some readers may have heard of as the controversial 21st century version of antisemitism is available at the top of the article should that be their current knowledge quest. And, the traditional or longer standing versions of antisemitism are indeed what the reader is brought to when they type antisemitism in to WP's search box. This is how I find I am comfortable with the current disambiguation link; perhaps my articulating this will help you as well. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 12:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've just noticed that in the above discussion Slim is having a go about an edit I made a long while ago. The background to that edit is as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First I saw that the author in question was described as "an attorney", or could have been "a lawyer". I think it also said he was famous or notable which is not relevant in describing a source. I hadn't heard of him but then not many lawyers are household names in the UK. In the UK legal system we have lawyers in general, who are divided into barristers and solicitors. I thought he should be described simply as "a British solicitor" or "a British barrister". When I googled his name I found his former company's website, which said he was now practicing in Israel. So I said something like "a British solicitor who has since moved to Israel". At the time I was starting to wikify bio articles which often start with where subjects were born and where they migrated to, so that might have been an influence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was definitely at fault for not realising how contentious the edit sounded. It could easily have been read as making him out to be a stooge for the Israeli government and even though the source was being quoted because of his political blogging that would have been inappropriate. Slim clearly read it as part of a witch-hunt to "out" a source as Jewish which was so far from my intention that I had no idea how to respond. Far from the best edit I've ever made, but I didn't quibble when it was reverted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I don't set myself up as a model of NPOV. I'm simply trying to help towards NPOV and as far as I can I try to take the discussion away from personalities and back to sources and their interpretation.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 18:32, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But why mention that he had moved to Israel? People don't stop being British just because they live elsewhere. If he had recently gone to live in France, would you have mentioned it? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, the website of his former employer said that he had gone to live in Israel. Senior lawyers in the UK are given the status of Queen's Counsel and carry QC after their names. Other than that, all solicitors are of the same status, as are all barristers. I recall that this subject is a solicitor in the UK and is also at the Israeli Bar, so it is not immediately obvious how he should be described. "Leading" should not be part of that description. Being <i>well known</i>, i.e. having been mentioned in public, does not carry any weight in the UK legal profession. Also, "leading" is a peacock term and not relevant to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 21:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, if I looked up an American lawyer, and his website said he's now practicing in France, I would not presume to still call him an American lawyer. Nothing is permanent, but if you're working in a new country, that's generally considered a move. At the same time, if we're talking about something related to Israel/Palestine, and I see someone has moved to the ME, my interest would be peaked. It's relevant and interesting, regardless of any ethnic connection. It says "This guy isn't just some British lawyer; he hangs out in the ME." A person can wonder whatever they want about motivations, but at some point, you're assuming an awful lot. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 14:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Controversial</span></h3>
<p>I have to agree with Jayjg that "controversial" here doesn't help. It's helpful in a way, but simply highlights the question, "Then why is this the one link at the top of the article? Why are we immediately contraversializing the page on antisemitism?" That's the question I don't like. I made a suggestion, simply to combine the first two paragraphs on New Antisemitism, which I think makes clearer that it's a complex theory, in addition to probably being more enyclopedic. I still think it's problematic, but maybe good enough? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 16:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like having the disambiguation link, and can go either way on whether or not it has the word 'controversial' in it. It does make more sense to me to exclude it. Is this the only aspect of the article that may need attention right now?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Three types of antisemitism</span></h2>
<p>I disagree with the division of antisemitism into only three types as in the article. There is a modern form of "intellectual antisemitism" professed by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligentsia.html" title="Intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> which is aimed at Jews as a culture or an ethnic entity rather than religion or race. I compiled several quoted in the <a href="../../../i/g/o/Igor_Shafarevich_55a9.html" title="Igor Shafarevich">Igor Shafarevich</a> article - his <i>Russophobia</i> "study" and more recent "work" doesn't seem to fall into either of your three categories.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Host Desecration</span></h2>
<p>Please note, this comment is not meant to be antisemitic.</p>
<p>I edited this article approximately 1 month ago, changing the line:<br />
"Jews were sometimes <b>falsely</b> accused of desecrating consecrated....."<br />
to:<br />
"Jews were sometimes accused of desecrating consecrated.....".<br />
<br />
The reason I did this was that there was no evidence given which indicated that the jews who were accused of this were innocent. In fact, assuming that they were accused, there must have been a trial. The only way we could know, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that they were falsely accused is if they were aquitted or some other court has since overturned the verdict. From how I understand this situation, the only thing we know for sure is that these people were accused (and, as the paragraph goes on to say, often put to death). Therefore the sentence should be changed to accused and not "falsely" accused, unless a reputable source is cited. Merely putting in a "citation needed" tag is not good since it is extremely ambiguous (to the reader) as to what needs to be cited (a valid interpretation would be that the accusation is being questioned).</p>
<p>It is important to note that I am not asserting that these jews were guilty, this is a question that is probably not resolvable to a satisfying degree. The only thing we can determine to a very good degree of certainty (and be completely NPOV) is that they were accused.</p>
<p>As a side note, I am outraged that my edit was reversed within hours, with no comment.</p>

<dd>I understand your edit, and can accept that it was done in good faith. At the time I took it as an implication that there was substance to the accusations. I'm sorry for your outrage, and that I misunderstood your motivation. Still, the accusations were clearly false. In some cases they were insincere pretexts to rouse the public against the Jews for political ends. In other cases they may have been moral panics, or another species of popular delusion. The "Elders of Zion" were no more desecrating hosts than conspiring to spread the plague, and it seems to me we ought to just say so. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 03:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the most important issue to concentrate on is the intended meaning of the statement. I think it is safe to assume that the intended meaning of the statement is that antisemitism caused people to accuse jews of a crime they did not commit. If the word "falsely" is left out, the statement simply means that jews were persecuted (not using personal judgement to say whether they were falsely accused or what caused people to accuse them). As this is an article on antisemitism, clearly the better solution is to leave the word "falsely" in, and cite a reputable source that contains evidence of the falsity of the accusations and the reasons for them. I didn't do this simply because changing the word was much easier for me.</dd>

<dd>To me, this statement is a clear example of weasel wording, as it introduces an opinion as fact. If it is a fact, a source should be cited.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Although taking "falsely" out is not optimal, it allows the article to be neutral and correct.</dd>

Sensible readers will recognize the accusation as false without having to be told that it was a false accusation.</p>
<p>It is not necessary in an article on a witch-craze (or other <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_panic.html" title="Moral panic">moral panic</a>) to say that the witches were <i>falsely</i> accused of having sex with the Devil. Even a passing knowledge of witch-crazes tells one that false accusations are <i>part and parcel</i> of witch-crazes. Worse, to say that some people were <i>falsely</i> accused of having sex with the Devil implies that there is a distinction to be made between false accusations of Devil-sex and true ones. But there are no true accusations of Devil-sex. Since nobody anywhere has ever had sex with the Devil, and this fact is obvious to the casual reader, it is unnecessary (and somewhat insulting) to point it out.</p>
<p>Likewise here. To say "falsely accused" actually gives the absurd accusations a wrongful credibility, as if to suggest that while <i>these</i> host-desecration accusations are false, some other ones somewhere else might be true. Since such accusations are <i>always entirely</i> about the fears of the accusers rather than any real actions of the accused, there is absolutely no need to suggest that the reader would be tempted to take them seriously. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 11:36, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Judeophobia</span></h2>
<p>I think that the name of this article should be changed to Judeophobia. Anti-semitism doesn't mean nothing when talking about Jews. It hypothetically refer to the hate of someone of Semite origins. So it can be said about Jews, Arabs, Ethiopians, etc. I think it would be a good occasion in a place like Wikipedia, to educate people in using the word "judeophobia when talking about hate towards Jews. I think it's a good time to talk about it as it's a more accurate term. VincentG 00:59, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see the big red tag at the top.

<dd>If your edits indeed are an improvement, it is unlikely they'll be implemented by edit-warring. Regardless, Judeophobia is not a more accurate term. Not counting my inherent aversion to phobiamania (the trend to turn everything into a phobia), antisemitism is the far, far more used term in both regular life and in academia. While it could refer to other people in that region, it is commonly held to be referring to Jews. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 01:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CJC, good encyclopedias often list facts that some may consider "obvious and banal". Plz. check the article's and this talk's history and you will see that for many it is a revelation. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 11:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please provide proof for the bold text: <i>... this implies that Arabs cannot, by definition, be antisemitic. <b>The argument for such an extension of meaning comes from the claim</b> that since the Semitic language family includes Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic languages and the historical term "Semite" refers to all those who consider themselves descendants of the Biblical Shem, "anti-Semitism" should be likewise inclusive.</i> Is there a proof that "such an extension of meaning" doesn't come, for example, from intention to confuse the public? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 01:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
