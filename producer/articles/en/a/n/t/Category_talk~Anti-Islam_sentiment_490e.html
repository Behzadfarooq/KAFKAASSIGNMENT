<p>I've begun this category after <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_May_31_b49a.html#Category:Islamophobia_to_Category:Anti-Muslim_sentiment" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 May 31">this CfR discussion</a>. Before this category is populated though, clear and well sourced criteria (remember <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>) need to be added to it to explain which articles qualify for categorization under it. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 02:36, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that it's currently being populated with the wrong kind of articles. A lot Critics of Islam has been added to it, and I believe it would make more sense to categorize them under a new category with a more obvious and neutral name such as Category:Critics of Islam. The current title is not neutral when it is used in the articles re Islam critics because it indicate that their opinions about Islam is based more on feelings rather than on logic and reason. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 05:52, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also just noticed that this category is actually a subcategory to the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Category%7EPrejudices_ae25.html" title="Category:Prejudices">Category:Prejudices</a>. That makes it even more biased to add it to articles regarding Critics of Islam such as <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Warraq_acf5.html" title="Ibn Warraq">Ibn Warraq</a> and <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali_4cc6.html" title="Ayaan Hirsi Ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>.

<dd>That's your opinion, but that doesn't make it NPOV.

<dd>Karl Meier I do agree with you <i>generally</i>. As I have been explaining to BhaiSaab this category is generally not meant to be used on articles that cover critics of Islam. I also explained to him that I understand your and User:Pecher's efforts to remove this category in light of the fact that it was being blanket applied to articles covering critics. In all honestly relative to this category things just need to slow down and cool off. When editors are blanket applying it to articles it doesn't appear as though thought has gone into it's utilization and utilization of this type of category definitely requires the usage of thought and research. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 16:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Bhadani, welcome to the discussion. Have you gotten a chance to see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_May_31_b49a.html#Category:Islamophobia_to_Category:Anti-Muslim_sentiment" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 May 31">this CfR discussion</a> yet? <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 20:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hello Netscott! Long time, no see ... Anyway, I agree with Bhadani that this category appears to be a fine example of Islamopedianism. It rubs in the views of the zealot hardliners, those who adore the jihad-by-the-sword, and advocates that otherwise reasonable Muslims must feel offended and side with them in their quest for supremecy. But think about it: Nobody is calling criticism of Ku Klux Klan anti-Christian or criticism of Hitler anti-Democratic. Criticism of Baader/Meinhof isn't called anti-Socialistic either and criticism of Vegetarians isn't called anti-Hinduism (and I could go on and on ...)</dd>
<dd>The naming of the category is overly broad and needs to be adjusted to reflect the reasons for its inclusion. <a href="../../../m/x/4/User%7EMX44_d2c9.html" title="User:MX44">MX44</a> 05:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC) I</dd>

Judging from that example, it appears that this category is not only <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a>, but actually no research at all!

<p>Content is being deleted here because no exact guidelines exists to determine what or who should be listed. That means we now have to work on building consensus as to what goes here. The AFD shows that the vast majority of people voting for a 'keep' on this cat did so because of the precedence of an 'antisemitism' category. It should follow then that this category should echo that category in terms of content. In that category, the guideline mentions that people can be listed if there is notable content stating the individual is antisemitic. That's not a bad policy to adopt here. Other guidelines suggest there and in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-catholicism.html" title="Anti-catholicism">anti-catholicism</a>, and other such articles, should also suggest how we deal with content here. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon2020_4eb8.html" title="User:Falcon2020">Falcon2020</a> 02:38, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Not saying that is the case, But wiki is dynamic. If antisemitic can be used and not considered OR or NPOV then so 2 can this cat. You cannot justify people making hostile anti-Islamic statements and wish to use wiki to whitewash bigotry, this is very very disturbing because we are not confusing critic we hatred. meaning critic is one thing anti-Islamic sentiment means just that. These bigoted statements if said about Jews would not be excused. so show balance and allow this cat to be developed.

I dont claim to represent Islam but i can say i represent fairness (as i c it).

<p><a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentiment.html" title="Sentiment">Sentiment</a> See definition. Anti (means against) Islam (religion of Muslims which makes them Muslims) Sentiment, a feeling, opinion etc. This is not restricted to organizations. thus this section needs to be expanded. Critic of Islam is like saying "Islam has a male centric biased", "Islam has inhumane policies towards the death penalty". However "Islam is evil" is not a critic, "Muslims should be wipped out and converted to Christianity" is not a critic. "Muhammed was a sex offender" is not a critic. "Muslims are terrorist" is not a critic. So this section is not about observed critic of Islam, like "The Quran and Hadith contradict themselves" it is about people who have used hostile language towards Muslims. And in our current climate this cat is 100% valid.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(áááá)</a> 11:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with the above points. There is a clear distinction between criticising something which exists in Islam, e.g. capital punishment, and using words which are hateful, or disingenious. if somebody says that islam promotes murder, child abuse, rape, forced marriage, and all sundry of evil things, this is clearly not the case. Such people should be categorised as having anti-Islam sentiment, because they do. People like Miss Hirsi have been found to fabricate things within Islam, and then criticise them as if they exist in Islamic theology or law as opposed to what some Muslim societies practise as local culture, e.g. forced marriage, and female genital mutilation. People like her should be categorised as having anti-Islamic sentiments, otherwise next we will be saying that the <a href="../../../b/n/p/BNP_9db3.html" title="BNP">BNP</a> are not racists, just critics of Islam.</p>
<p>On another note, there are people who falsely claim that a number of Muslim activist groups are terroristm even though they are not listed as such by the US or western governments. These types of people also need to categorised as such, because they play on stereotypes to cause a general feeling of antipathy againts Muslims. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 11:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Holding doubleplusungood un-Peecee opinions does not make one a bigot. Anti semitism is a well agreed and defined term. "Islamophobia" is not. Hirsi Ali is a woman with personal experience of how Islam treats people of her gender. Her criticisms are based on logic and fact, unless you think the Qur'an and Hadith are not truely Islamic documents. As such, she is not just blind sentiment. Her criticism is based on logic. The only reason she's been attacked by some court is due to the fact they cannot discern the difference between legitimate criticism and blind emotion. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 22:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Miss Ali is a critic and a bigot at the same time, she is so full of hate she has become hate. I actually feel sorry for her. Her local experience in a culture is not a valid or objective bases for critic a religion. A stay in G-bay in Cuba is a poor relection of America it however isnt an objective or worldview of the American experience. basically her horror doesnt typify the religion. her uneducated cultural taboos mixed with Islam have confused her, now she is a vessel of hate. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(áááá)</a> 00:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

There is a huge difference between saying things like "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity" (Coulter) and "Mohammad was a sex offender" (he had sex with children, as per the Hadiths )<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/008.smt.html#008.3310,http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.064" class="external free" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/008.smt.html#008.3310,http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.064" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/008.smt.html#008.3310,http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.064</a>,<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.065,http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.088" class="external free" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.065,http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.088" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.065,http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.088</a>) (thank you to Ali Sina for the links). Someone who has sex with children would indeed be a sex offender in modern society. Even soliciting sex from teenagers is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Foley_ac4b.html" title="Mark Foley">looked down upon</a>, much less outright sex with CHILDREN. So unless you regard the Hadith as an inaccurate text, going against centuries of Islamic jurisprendary tradition, Mohammad would indeed be a sex offender in our modern times.</dd>

<p>While commiting FGM may not be mentioned in the Quran, Islam is not respectful to women (4:34, for example, commands men to beat disobedient wives). <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 02:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm interested in creating a page about the history of Islam/Christian hatred. Having a background in the Arabic language and in Medieval European culture, there are several interesting points to explore (keep in mind these are medieval ideas):</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian association of Arabs with polygamy</li>
<li>Arab association of Christians with alcoholism and lechery</li>
<li>Mutual willingness of both sides to kill the other (heathens, unbelievers)</li>
</ul>
<p>... and so on. I'm just interested in what would come up. Also, understanding the past could shed light on the current debate in this category. Are there any who can add to this idea? <a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrad_81c2.html" title="User:Wrad">Wrad</a> 07:20, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
