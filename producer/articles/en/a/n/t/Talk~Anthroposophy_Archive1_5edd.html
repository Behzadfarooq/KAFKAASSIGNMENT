<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not a Science</span></h2>
<p>Anthroposophy is not considered a science by any scientific authority whilst psychology is. Also it does not fit any modern model of what science is. To compare the two is to try to give anthroposophy a level of acceptance and authority it does not have and is misleading to the reader. This is an attempt to promote Anthroposophy rather than fairly report on it. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 13:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is a scientific authority?</p>
<dl>
<dd>A science department at a University, a peer reviewed journal, a learned society of scientists. If you can find an example of any of these calling Anthroposophy a science I would be interested to know.<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 08:20, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Outright slander</span></h2>
<p>One of the primary links on the Stelling page has outright slander on it (reference to the O.T.O.). I am removing the link to this page. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 02:47, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The SIMPOS page contains over 100 links to articles which comment on Anthroposophy. You claim that one of these onwardly links to a page which you say contains a slander. This is a poor argument for removing the link to a sober and useful resource and feels like censorship. You cannot protect the reader from accessing sites you disapprove of. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 11:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The link is the second on the list. It is to a discredited source (there have been law suits over these matters; it is not a matter of opinion but of established fact). Neither false information nor links to false information belong in an encyclopedia. It is not censorship but honest standards; would you wish false information about you to appear in or be linked to by the Wikipedia? <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 02:39, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A secondary link, not the one in Wikipedia but an onward link leads to a page which you say contains slanderous remarks. I don’t believe this is sufficient grounds for removing the link to the intermediate page. The SIMPOS page is not itself a problem. We cannot prevent a reader exploring the www by trying to close doors. Which court cases are you referring to can you give details? <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 21:06, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes to the latter; a book was published in Germany called the <i>Schwarzbuch Anthroposophie</i> with the claim about the OTO (amongst other claims that appear on the SIMPOS page/links) and a court case was brought against it due to the libelous contents. The case was successful and the book was withdrawn from sales. For a reference to this case see an article which was originally printed in an official Swiss government journal, Bulletin der Eidgenössischen Kommission gegen Rassismus EKR, Bern: the link is <a href="http://www.infosekta.ch/is5/gruppen/anthroposophie1999.html" class="external free" title="http://www.infosekta.ch/is5/gruppen/anthroposophie1999.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infosekta.ch/is5/gruppen/anthroposophie1999.html</a></p>
<p>The SIMPOS page is a problem if it does not ensure that its links are respectable; in the last month, Science magazine has publicized heavily problems with reports on cloning it had published that turned out to be falsified, though it was the authors of this journal, not the magazine, that had falsified material. A page that does not work to ensure accuracy should not be linked to, plain and simple. If they want to ensure that they have accurate material on their site, a bare minimum for scientific (or encyclopediac) respectability, they can be linked to. Wikipedia is implicitly recommending its links for their accuracy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please, can we stop the revert war. I agree the link following the link is of dubious nature, but that disputed article (<a href="http://www.update.uu.se/~fbendz/pseudo/anthropos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.update.uu.se/~fbendz/pseudo/anthropos.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) in turn also links its own critics (<a href="http://user.cyberlink.ch/~koenig/steiner.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://user.cyberlink.ch/~koenig/steiner.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> by Peter-R. Koenig) at the bottom. I think that the link can stand since Wikipedia readers are highly capable of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_thinking.html" title="Critical thinking">critical thinking</a> and can evaluate facts and slander alike themselves. <a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixdorf_8d7c.html" title="User:Nixdorf">Nixdorf</a> 23:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you give examples where other Wikipedia articles link to pages with links to slanderous, or simply false, information? I think of Holocaust deniers, for example, are they given a chance to make their voice known? The Flat Earth society? People can obviously evaluate these facts and slanders equally well. Are there any examples at all to establish that this is Wikipedia policy?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you trying to argue that Wikipidia can only link to sites which are 100% bone fide , because there is no such thing. All sites contain errors and omissions. The <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science (journal)</a> site still has credibility and is linked to in articles, its up to the reader to treat any information with caution. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 13:27, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hgilbert, there are several such links actually. For example see entries for <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majestic_12.html" title="Majestic 12">Majestic 12</a> or <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a> which you mentioned yourself. Readers obviously have to evaluate all information, even that which is on Wikipedia, linked from Wikipedia, or linked 2 degrees away from Wikipedia or whatever. Please turn down your belligerent tone, it does not add to the discussion. <a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixdorf_8d7c.html" title="User:Nixdorf">Nixdorf</a> 11:40, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, I apologize for any mis-tones.</p>
<p>The Science journal (and its site) have credibility because they have immediately reacted to the accusations of falsifications; the top headline on their site is <a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/110/1" class="external text" title="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/110/1" rel="nofollow">South Korean team's claim demolished</a>. I looked at the links from Flat Earth Society; they are well-balanced discussions not entirely sympathetic to the idea of a Flat Earth, not polemical supports of this. In a second section titled 'External Links' there is a link to the Flat Earth Forum, which is a discussion group, and as such does not pretend to be anything but obviously personal opinions of not necessarily qualified participants. I would personally say that this is a radically different solution; the PLANS web-site has this character, for example.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I understand your concern, but can you be precise on the demarcation line between "highly critical" and "slanderous"? I would be inclined to say that sites spreading verified lies are "slanderous", and if that article about the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordo_Templi_Orientis_01b0.html" title="Ordo Templi Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> was linked directly, I could understand if it was removed. However, I think it's still a bit of a special case since they link their critics (Mr. Koenig), this means they recognize the need for debate and critical thinking. But I don't think that unlinking a portal resource can be supported by this fact, I think it's too weak. I think we need more voices than just the three of us so we can reach some broader consensus before this is resolved. <a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixdorf_8d7c.html" title="User:Nixdorf">Nixdorf</a> 19:16, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I would say there are several distinct stages that might help: neutral, critical, polemical and slanderous. Under neutral I would include simply informative sites, as well as discussions that include positive and negative aspects, pro and contra reasons and stances. This would be my preferred category for anything under general links. Critical approaches would be unsympathetic but relatively objective discussions; both sides of issues should be included, but a critical bias might be apparent. Polemical discussions simply ignore positive features and seek out negative ones; they may distort facts, are clearly unbalanced and should really only appear when there's room for a rebuttal as well (this is what journals do with such contributions; they ask for a response from the original author or a representative of the other side -- the Swiss governmental site I mention on this discussion page does exactly this). Polemics are not normally included in encyclopedia links; they might be referenced by researchers who already have a background in the subject and can see through the polemic while looking for any valuable nuggets buried in the bias. Slander (or simply erroneous information) is found when there are provably false statements made. These do not belong anywhere near a respectable site, or if they creep on, they are corrected immediately.</p>
<p>That would be my off-the-cuff suggestion for a nuanced policy; I would welcome others help here, as I am sure that I've left out important aspects. I do think it important that Wikipedia finds a clear and consistent approach (and perhaps all this has already been worked through somewhere). <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 19:35, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should the SIMPOS site entitled "Anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner, Waldorf schools; and their critics" be linked</span></h2>
<p>The SIMPOS site is a resource containing links to (mainly critical) information on occult tendencies. User Hgilbert is arguing that because this site's Antroposophy page contains 1 link out of 100 that onwardly links to another site that contains material of dubious quality the whole SIMPOS site should be excluded from this articles external links section. SIMPOS is merely a collection of links. It is a key resource for those wishing to find views on Anthoposophy that don't originate from inside the movement. The SIMPOS site is <a href="http://www.stelling.nl/simpos/anthroposophy.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.stelling.nl/simpos/anthroposophy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stelling.nl/simpos/anthroposophy.htm</a> , for those wishing to follow this conversation but without the benefit of a link on the article page. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 13:27, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, the link is placed in the highly prominent position of being second in the list, not buried somewhere amongst the 60 or so actual links. Second of all, it is not just dubious; it is slanderous. Third of all, there are other problematic links on the site; I mentioned only the one that contains verifiably slanderous material (because there has been a court case over this, the evidence is clear). Many or most of the other links are written by polemicists (as opposed to historians, objective journalists, or experts in any field) and several of them have also been described publicly as false or slanderous; there are published, hot discussions about this. Above and beyond this, many of the respectable-appearing links are actually dead; they no longer function. To have contentious or highly-debated material is one thing; to have outright slanderous material is another. Having both gives credence to the accusations of slander or error against the 'only' dubious material, as well. There are surely balanced discussions and expert opinions that would better serve an encylopedia. I will try to find something that gives the questions that are being publicly debated without themselves entering problematic territory! <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 01:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The discussion here is should we link to a Portal site which links uncritically to a range of material on this subject. I think we should.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t think we should directly link to sites which tell lies, but all the others are fair to use as references if they illustrate a point of view or serve as a resource. It is the Wikipedia article which allows the reader to make sense of the range of sites by putting them in a broader context. Its part of Wikipedia’s scope to tell the whole story about a subject including all sides of arguments past and present and to report on the untruths which might have circulated and how these were repudiated.</dd>

<p>I looked at one of the links just added and it says, in part: Findings from laboratory studies have suggested that mistletoe may enhance the activity of immune system cells so that they release more of the chemicals that damage cancer cells.</p>
<p>Animal studies assessing mistletoe's ability to stop cancer cell growth have had different results depending on the extract used, the dose, how it was given, and the type of cancer studied. Results of a few animal studies have suggested that mistletoe may be useful in decreasing the side effects of conventional cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and that it may counteract the effects of drugs used to suppress the immune system.</p>
<p>A heading 'mistletoe references showing it to be largely ineffective' is inappropriate for a reference that contains a differentiated range of results.

<p>Criticism of this article.</p>
<p>1. Anthroposophy is not a science, "spiritual" or otherwise. Not by any stretch of imagination. That RS himself asserted it is doesn't count for much. RS asserted lots of things and many of those assertions where completely looney, if you pardon my expression. L Ron Hubbard called his brainchild, dianetics, a science. Notwithstanding, the Wikipedia page on dianetics (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics</a>) rightfully identifies it as a pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The article does not claim that anthroposophy is a science, but that RS called it this. This is simply accurate. The introduction clearly states that anthroposophy is not one of the natural sciences.</dd>
<dd>See this link <a href="http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2006-0217-200216/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2006-0217-200216/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for one small example of the scientific basis for anthroposophy.
<dl>
<dd>I know the article doesn't say it but my point is the Dianetics article doesn't say LRH thought it was a science and neither should this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. The new-agey woo-woo about QM having said anything negative about objective study and the naive musings on the reality of the number two and the imaginary unit is complete bollocks and totally irrelevant to the subject of anthroposophy's relation to science. Again, pardon my french, and I refer you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Mechanics" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Mechanics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Mechanics</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Quantum mechanics does assert exactly what is said in the article, especially in the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schrodinger%27s_Cat_4112.html#Copenhagen_interpretation" title="Schrodinger's Cat">Copenhagen interpretation</a>. Mathematics has often been called a non-empirical science, as it is in the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a>, for exactly the reasons cited in this article referring to 2 and i. It is not irrelevant; the discussion is about the meaning of nonempirical sciences.

<p>3. Anthroposophy is not philosophy. It is not recognised as such by professional philosophers. Philosophy (good philosophy at any rate) is based on arguments while anthroposophy is revelational and authoritative at its core.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Several of Steiner's books, including his <i>[[Philosophy of Freedom]</i>, are philosophy by any standard. They use standard philosophical methods of discussion and offer no revelations whatsoever. They are very rarely (but sometimes) dealt with in university courses, as Steiner is not generally considered an important philosopher in the academic world. Feel free to add a mention that his philosophical works are not valued by most academic philosophers, but please support this with more than my own impression.</dd>
<dd>Did you know that Steiner had a PhD in philosophy? That he is listed on the <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/philinks.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/philinks.htm" rel="nofollow">Earlham University list of philosophers</a>, for example?
<dl>
<dd>So what? Anthroposophy is still not philosophy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. The "critics of anthroposophy" section is laughable. There is a lot of real critical material around and it's not as if it's hard to find. I urge the editors to do their homework! See <a href="http://www.skepdic.com/steiner.html" class="external free" title="http://www.skepdic.com/steiner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepdic.com/steiner.html</a> for a start.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The skepdic.com article you mentioned has always been cited on this page. I have looked about for more material; there is an article by a pharmacist, basketball coach and punk rock fan (Bendz) that is often cited, but there are six serious errors of objective fact in his short (one-page) article. The Stelling page has the same problems; Wikipedia standards explicitly say that pages with erroneous information should not be cited, nor should chat rooms, forums or other mail-in cites. Please add any <i>serious</i> critical references. Remember that Wikipedia standards are there to ensure that the article (and its links) are accurate.
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia standards don't seem to ensure anything. Not that I'm surprised.</dd>
<dd>Wow, that's the way to NPOV an article, dismiss any criticism as wrong and thus not worthy of citing!--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 18:05, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Do you suggest that we include errors of <i>fact</i> in Wikipedia articles to ensure that no one's opinion is left out? I am not talking about divergent opinions here; I am talking about the basic facts themselves being totally erroneous. The article in question averages significantly more than one demonstrably false statement per paragraph, which is pretty bad. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 01:20, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>5. No mention of central occult "wisdom" such as the Ahriman demon that lives in your TV, reincarnation, karma, the not-so-PC "theory" of root races, astrology, the use of a pet's head in the preparation of biodynamic fertilisers etc. Gee, I wonder why...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reincarnation and karma are mentioned in the site. No pet's head is used in the preparation of biodynamic fertilisers,
<dl>
<dd>Mentioned very briefly. Pet's head: semantics. Pet, domestic animal, who cares? It's still completely looney and not mentioned in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>but see the article on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodynamic_agriculture.html" title="Biodynamic agriculture">biodynamic agriculture</a> and feel free to add more (accurate) details of the biodynamic preparations there.</dd>
<dd>Steiner's complete works total about 330 volumes, 13 buildings, thousands of drawings and paintings and several sculptures.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and L Ron Hubbard wrote 50 million words. Who cares? Most of them were false.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not all this can be discussed here. It would be good for something about spiritual beings to appear here; I will try to get to it (or someone else can do so). Incompleteness, especially in the case of such a vast corpus, is not a violation of POV, it is a sign that yet more could be done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I recognize that you are concerned, but ask that you provide objective material to the article to balance it. POV checks are normally used where an effort to do so has been made but a balanced presentation is not possible (because of revert wars, for example). No one has removed any of your material; I don't believe you have added any, in fact. I am removing the POV check tag. I ask that you respond to the above remarks before adding it back.

<p>You assert that anthroposophy is not philosophy. Some areas of it (such as Steiner's philosophical work) are and are taught as such in bona-fide universities; I have already demonstrated that he is regarded as a philosopher by bona-fide academics. Have you ever read any of Steiner's philosophical works (Truth and Science, Goethe's Conception of the World, Philosophy of Freedom)? One glance at these would dispel the idea that they are not philosophical works.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that we disagree about the significance of quantum mechanics and the non-empirical nature of mathematics. Notable scientists and mathematicians agree with what I say here, such as <a href="../../../n/i/e/Niels_Bohr_303e.html" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schrodinger.html" title="Schrodinger">Schrodinger</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Zeilinger_4dd1.html" title="Anton Zeilinger">Anton Zeilinger</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9_760c.html" title="Henri Poincaré">Henri Poincaré</a>. NPOV means that you cannot assert your own POV and deny other, accepted (and even majority) POVs.</p>
<p>I am happy to add more material to the article. The article on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodynamic_agriculture.html" title="Biodynamic agriculture">biodynamic agriculture</a> already covers the biodynamic preparations in detail. A section on spiritual beings and more material on reincarnation could be added to the present article, and I am happy to do so. I repeat: the field is vast, and it is not a violation of neutrality to not have every aspect of a field covered.</p>
<p>If you will list what you feel is missing in terms of <i>neutrality</i> (not just completeness), including citations of references you wish to have added, I am happy to do the work of adding new material. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 14:25, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A 36k article on a controversial subject with a 1k criticism section that devotes more of its time to supporting the topic than the actual criticisms? How can that be NPOV?--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 18:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have repeatedly asked for contributions to the criticism section that conform to Wiki policy, i.e. are not discussion lists or personal opinions. There has been no attempt to exclude these; rather the opposite. Please add appropriate material rather than assume that any POV has been pushed out. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 19:01, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a lot of personal opinions here, all Steiner's, and other positive opinions. Anything The criticism starts by listing [i]supporters[/i] of anthroposophy, a clear attempt to poison the well. "Natural science even includes non-sensory phenomena as the content of its study in the special case of mathematics. Is the number two purely non-sensory? What about 'i', the square root of negative one? Mathematics provides a doorway through which we can see how a scientific treatment of nonsensory phenomena may be valid." isn't an NPOV look at anything; it's a horribly POV argument <i>for</i> the subject. This is a horribly POV article in pretty much all ways. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 19:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article is about Anthroposophy, and therefore will include a lot of purely descriptive material on the subject. Steiner was the founder and hitherto most prominent voice of Anthroposophy; to describe the latter requires including his ideas. This article has been through a long period of development, but please suggest or execute improvements.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> article begins by mentioning that mathematics is a non-empirical science. Is this a narrow POV? It is arguably simply a fact; mathematical truths are by and large not based upon sensory evidence, yet we can have confidence in them. Why can we have confidence in them? The answer to this question leads one into an epistemology of all science (knowing): that which is dependent upon logical reasoning applied to sensory data as well as that which is independent of sensory data (logic and mathematics). This line of reasoning does not represent a special POV, or rather, the point of view it represents is that of philosophers of science rather than applied science; the latter usually ignores the question of what we are doing when we do science and why it works).</p>
<p>I agree completely about the beginning of the criticism section and am happy to change it (and have done so). <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 21:19, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> doesn't say that mathematics is a non-empirical science. All the intro says about science is "Mathematics is used throughout the world in fields such as science, engineering, surveying, medicine, and economics." and "The word "mathematics" comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthēma) meaning science, knowledge, or learning...", neither of which say math is a science. In fact, there's a section called "Is Mathematics a Science" that says "Karl Popper believed that mathematics was not experimentally falsifiable and thus not a science" and "The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. While some in applied mathematics feel that they are scientists, those in pure mathematics often feel that they are working in an area more akin to logic and that they are, hence, fundamentally philosophers." So a leading philosopher of science (Karl Popper) believes that math is not a science, as do many mathematicians.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 03:20, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Vis a vis sources: there is an extensive bibliography, but I have added a footnote with three specific sources (including Encyclopedia Brittanica) to the practical work section. *Are "believed", "said", "wrote" and the like POV terms?

<li>I am generally a bit at a loss to follow what you are seeing that I am not; it doesn't help that you continue to be pretty unspecific ("over whole article", "overall", "many claims").

<p>Jeffire -- The three MAJOR figures in Anthroposophy are Lucifer, the god of light, Ahriman the god of darkness, and Christ, the sun god who was sent to earth to balance these opposing figures. There is nothing in this whitewash nonsense about this.

<dd>Yes, it is nonsense. But it is POV to call it nonsense. In an encyclopedia we list what they believe (making it clear these are beliefs). If they make a scientific claim then a scientific responce in appropriate. It is POV to call the beliefs rascist, what we do is accurately describe them and if people think they are rascist or not that is their judgement to make, not ours. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 12:45, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jeffire -- My point is NOT that that anthroposophy is nonsense. My point is that the this presentation of anthroposophy has little resemblence to anthrposophy. The same misleading presentation is made to thousands of parents every day worldwide that are enrolling there children in a Waldorf school (that is if they are one of the lucky parents that are actually told that Waldorf schools teach Anthroposophy!) It is not a "critical comment" to say that anthroposophists believe in high fevers for children anymore that is a "critical comment" to say that catholics do not believe in the use of birth control -- both are facts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.129.127.170 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.129.127.170.html" title="User talk:69.129.127.170">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.129.127.170_943e.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.129.127.170">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Some Catholics do believe in the use of birth control. You can say that the Vatican has declared that this is contrary to Catholic faith; you should then also mention that birth control is nevertheless used by many Catholics. There is no equivalent to the Vatican for anthroposophy, but neither the Executive Council of the Anthroposophical Society nor any other authoritative body within anthroposophy has ever made a ruling on high fevers. It comes down to individual doctors' recommendations.<a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 08:22, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
<p>Religion is defined as a belief in the supernatural. Anthroposophy contains a belief in the supernatural. The Californian legal system does not define what universaly is and is not a religion. Antroposophy is a religion regardless of the opinions of the Californian legal system. By American law tomatoes aren't fruit, but we don't change the definition on Wikipedia because of that. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 10:13, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jeffire -- The California Court's decision can't reasonably be interpreted as a ruling on whether or not anthroposophy is or is not a religion. The issue was whether PUBLIC waldorf charter schools were in anyway religious because of the thinly veiled anthroposophic practices at the schools in question. to Christianity and other religions. The plaintiff attorneys in the case did a shotty job of admitting evidence and witnesses and much of their case was thrown out purely on technical grounds and not on the merits of the case. That said, it is fairly easy --as we see in other public schools -- to find church and state loopholes by not being overtly religious, changing the names of religious celebrations, ect.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Steiner recognized that convential religion were destructive and devisive -- a positive thing. So, Steiner created a "spiritual science" that he said was not a religion. This spiritual science incorporate the world's other major religions into Christianity by having Christ reincarnated several times and coming back as religion x's central god. So, instead of wandering how so many different religions can have different Gods and come away from it that religion is absurd, his conclusion was that all religions have the same god -- Christ. (I don't see anything about that view that is not religious.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.129.127.170 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.129.127.170.html" title="User talk:69.129.127.170">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.129.127.170_943e.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.129.127.170">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Hgilbert -- As of Friday, that quote was in the Steiner archives in the place where I cut and pasted it from -- but has since been removed. However, as you know, Steiner made similar quotes, including in the Gospel of St. John Lecture, where he said "Thus, for Anthroposophy, the central figure in the whole tableau of reincarnation, of the nature of man, of the survey of the cosmos, is the Being whom we call the Christ." <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GospJohn/19090630p01.html" class="external free" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GospJohn/19090630p01.html" rel="nofollow">http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GospJohn/19090630p01.html</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paka33 (<a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPaka33_0531.html" title="User talk:Paka33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paka33_1a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paka33">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I am moving one section of the introduction focusing on Steiner's ideas about Christ to the section on religion. The majority of Steiner's 40 books do not mention Christ at all, and in only two, I believe - <i>Mysticism</i> and <i>Christianity as mystical fact</i> (both relatively early works, from 1901 and 1902) does Christ or Christianity play a major role.</dd>

<dd>This is not to say that Steiner did not consider the Christ being of great importance, but in both his books and lectures this is one theme of a great many others, equally important.

I have moved the introductory material down.</p>
<p>If there is a desire to have material on his relationship to Christ, then there should be material on other special topics as well, and the introduction becomes an essay.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pseudoscience</span></h2>
<p>I did not delete this category, but I think it is arguably a misnomer to call anthroposophy a pseudoscience. It does not pretend to be a natural science, but rather attempts to apply systematic research principles similar to those developed for natural science in the realm of inner or spiritual experience. An argument for calling it a pseudoscience would be that this is not possible; inner or spiritual experience is wholly subjective and thus an inappropriate object of scientific methodology. An argument against calling anthroposophy a pseudoscience is that it does not pretend to be doing natural science. Just as social sciences such as economics and political science are arguably "soft", i.e. not firmly based upon an empirical and experimental basis, yet are not considered pseudoscience because they clearly identify their objectives - and are not operating under false pretences - so the same could be claimed for anthroposophy.</p>
<p>The term "pseudoscience" has the perjorative connotation of a false presentation that seems unwarranted. Perhaps a less perjorative term could be found. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 00:52, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anthroposophy presents itself as a science however. Is anouther name for it not spiritual science? I'll do a review of this when I rewrite the criticisms section anyway.

<p>Philosophers such as <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilthey.html" title="Dilthey">Dilthey</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husserl.html" title="Husserl">Husserl</a> advocated recognizing that there can be sciences (they used the term "Geisteswissenschaften", sciences of the mind/spirit/human being) that are not empirically based in outer perception, and yet are fully scientific. (The Wikipedia article on Dilthey mentions this briefly.) Steiner certainly was part of this (largely Germanic) philosophical tradition, and called anthroposophy a "Geisteswissenschaft" (humane science), not a "Naturwissenschaft" (natural science). Philosophers grounded in the German tradition would certainly have comprehended the distinction.</p>
<p>Geisteswissenschaft is the standard German term for what English-speaking peoples call the humanities. Steiner was thus calling what he did by the same name as the humanities generally go by in German, and what Dilthey defended as the "humane sciences": though neither quantitative nor empirical in the same sense as the natural sciences, yet qualitatively exact and rational. In his late period (cf. <i>The Crisis of the European Sciences</i>), Husserl used the word Geisteswissenschaft much as Steiner did: to refer to an explicitly spiritual science, not just the humanities generally. All of these thinkers believed that the natural sciences should not claim a monopoly on scientific approach; though the humane sciences would not copy their quantitative empiricism, they would still have a valid claim to the term 'scientific'.</p>
<p>Perhaps a completely different terminology would have to be found in English for this to be readily comprehensible to English-speakers. In any case, Steiner was speaking in the tradition of the <i>Geisteswissenschaften</i> and to declare his work pseudoscientific is badly to misconstrue his cultural context. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 00:04, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We normally differentiate religions and spiritual movements, for good reason. Religions have, generally, rituals, dogmas, hierarchies, and places of worship; anthroposophy has none of these.</p>

<p>First of all, I have to scream it from the hills to all connected with the pseudoscience article and categorizing scheme: we are not here to do our own creative philosophizing on what is and what is not pseudoscience, though this makes for prolix and never-ending discussions of the most interesting, albeit totally fruitless kind. Our questions should be: Are there citable sources for making the claim? Are there citable sources against the claim? If there is a sufficient imbalance between the pros and contras, we can claim conclusive (or pretty conclusive) unanimity; otherwise we should report the <i>two</i> sides. If there are no citable sources, why are we even talking about making the claim?</p>
<p>Secondly, and this is for the benefit of the prolix and never-ending discussions, because of the length of this talk page, I am pasting a list of journal articles about the use of mistletoe extract as an agent against cancer, suggested by Steiner in the 1920s and developed by his co-workers at that time; since then further developed by an array of anthroposophical researchers; presently used successfully far and wide outside anthroposophic circles, by many, many mainstream doctors, chiefly in Europe. Peer-reviewed references include (I can only list a small sample here):</p>

<dd>I see you have also renamed the article Anthroposophy/Steiner's views on races to Rudolf Steiner's views on races. It looks like you are trying to distance the accusations of racism in Steiners work from Anthroposophy itself , yet Anthroposophy is mostly Steiner’s work. The link was also in the <i>See also</i> section not the article itself. This appears to be a public relations exercise.

<p>Sorry; I saw the See also section becoming a collection of items that belonged elsewhere, and also thought that I had already changed the article 'Steiner's views on races' to a sub-article of the Steiner article (where it obviously belongs). There should be a link to this somewhere on the anthroposophy page, of course...and we just need to figure out where. It's a little tricky because anthroposophy is ever less and less "mostly Steiner's work"; look at a catalogue from an anthroposophical publisher, <a href="http://www.geistesleben.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geistesleben.com/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> for example, and you will see Steiner taking backstage to a large number of more recent authors. The accusations of racism in Steiner's work are pretty particular to him, rather than to the literally hundreds, perhaps thousands (in various languages) of other anthroposophical writers. I'll try to find an appropriate context for the link. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 11:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Hansson reference went with all the rest of the material onto the referred-to page. The treatment grew extremely long and the editors at the time (including Jefffire, if I remember rightly) agreed that it made sense to put it all in an easily findable location. It would violate NPOV to only put one side of the argument here and leave the other side on the other page. What is the problem with the link? Sub-pages of articles are an approved of way of including important information that would be too full for the main page.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to produce a <i>balanced</i> summary for this article. If you want to try this, go ahead; please look at the full treatment and give equal weight to all referenced material. Otherwise, the link seems a good solution.</p>

The article needs to explore this the topic of racism in Anthroposophy more thoroughly - as it is quite obvious, to me at least, that Anthroposophy is a racist doctrine. Unless you can provide some evidence that Anthroposohists have rejected Steiner's racist doctrine (you can't because they haven't), I think it needs to be mentioned prominently in the article. If we are going to have an article about Anthroposophy, it should certainly talk about what constitutes Anthroposophy. It's not just angels, you know. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 23:11, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Besides having a section on racism, which I think should be added, there are many racist statements about karma and reincarnation that Steiner has made that should be discussed here (in the article). Steiner's views about how man reincarnates through the races, for example, and man's physical development, the hardening of the body at verious stages of development causing the various races, man's evolutions through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, etc. and how these are articulated in the races. There's lots of stuff that has been left out of this article that belongs here. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 23:19, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see we're going to play the silence game here. OK, this week I will insert a section on Racism in Anthroposophy and include quotes from Steiner to support it completely. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 17:41, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If what you mean by racism in anthroposophy is alleged racism in Steiner's work, then this belongs in the Steiner article or the article devoted wholly to the topic of Steiner's views on race. If you have documentation of issues in anthroposophy beyond Steiner, they belong here. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 15:27, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I'm talking about racism in Anthroposophy - in subjects like reincarnation and karma - the foundations of Anthroposophy. This is not a Steiner issue, it's an Anthroposophy issue. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 15:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Overlap with Rudolf Steiner article</span></h2>
<p>(duplicated from <a href="../../../r/u/d/Talk%7ERudolf_Steiner_97b2.html" title="Talk:Rudolf Steiner">Talk:Rudolf Steiner</a> page). For me, at least, there has been some unclarity about what belongs in this article and what in <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Steiner_8c51.html" title="Rudolf Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a>. I would like this to take some form now.</p>
<p>Steiner's ideas initially formed anthroposophy, but anthroposophy has had a rich existence and development apart from Steiner's own thought and work. I'd like to begin moving what is particular to Steiner into his article, and make the anthroposophy article less one-sidedly Steiner-centric.</p>
<p>This is a long-term project, probably. Any contributions or suggestions would be most welcome.<a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 00:41, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are very few attributions in Anthroposophical writing to new thinking outside of Steiner, but there are many commentaries on his work. If you can identify new thinkers, not commentators, who have contributed to Anthroposophy and can show they are publicly acknowledged as such then please do this. There is a danger, though, this could become original research , see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 06:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There certainly are such figures aplenty: Steffen, Kolisko, Prokofieff, Schmidt-Brabant, Kranich, Bothmer, both Hauschkas, etc. It's a huge task because of the sheer number of these. The other question, however, is how much to duplicate content between the Steiner and anthroposophy page. I suppose for now there is a necessary overlap.<a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 09:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
