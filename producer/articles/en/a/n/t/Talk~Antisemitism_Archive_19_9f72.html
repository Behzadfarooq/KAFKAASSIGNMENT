<h2><span class="mw-headline">Circumcision &amp; Antisemitism Sources</span></h2>
<p>Although I still strongly feel that many wikipedians are using WP as a platform to censor information linking antisemitism and circumcision I feel that progress is being made in this area as an increasing number of people are seeing that indeed Wikipedia must include this information if shown to be valid. In that spirit, I am willing to be sensitive to people's concern that I haven't provided adequate sources for now. I will however note that links supporting the current version of this article such as <a href="http://www.aish.com/seminars/whythejews/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aish.com/seminars/whythejews/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which is a seminar and certainly not a encyclopedic references are not challenged simply because they reflect the status quo view of this forum. I seem to be held up to the flame. I doubt many universities would accept it as a source in a Masters or Doctoral thesis. I will note that I don't think its realistic to expect Wikipedia to live up to that standard anyways. I am myself a university grad, so I know something about the standard.</p>
<p>Because of the enormous bias I cannot guarantee that it is possible that any link will be scholarly enough to satisfy my most forosious critics that believe that WP is a soapbox to idemnify circumcision and believe that the cure to antisemitism is to change everyone but those greatest effected by antisemitism: The Jews themselves. It brings to mind an old saying I once heard. You can't change anyone but yourself. This is something I think is relevant here. But in any event I will not stay on this point as I have given up on constructively critizing Judiac circumcision on WP but hope the inclusion of data linking circumcision and antisemitism which I believe now to be inevitable, will speak for itself. So I will do all I can.</p>
<p>Since I do not decide what scholarly and what's not around here I will begin a list of links to web sources which are relevant. Even if none of these are seen as scholarly I trust that eventually their shear number will provide that this is a real and not isolated phenomena and others will join in and eventually sources can be found that are considered scholarly, or the community will be content that the shear volume of links is enough to show that this phenoma is actual and documented: Not just OR. I have started by adding a completely new, never before seen on wikipedia link and invite others to contribute.</p>
<p>I look forward to working together in a constructive manner. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 09:41, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="http://www.haruth.com/JewsChina1907.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haruth.com/JewsChina1907.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - Link mentions that the Chinese object to circumcision of Chinese Jews.
<ul>
<li>It says "Even today they object to our circumcision, which they denounce as a barbarous and cruel practice." This is just one of a list of complaints registered by one Jewish man, recorded by a National Geographic author in 1907. It does not say that the Chinese object to "circumcision of Chinese Jews", it says that they object to "circumcision...as a barbarous and cruel practice". There's no link made between their objection to circumcision and antisemitism, especially not as a cause thereof, no claim made that any attempt was ever made to ban the practice, and the article's claim about the situation, in fact, stand in stark contrast to many other descriptions of Chinese Jewish life. In any case, a 1907 article in NG is not really a good source for either a WP article, nor does it do anything whatsoever to support your assertion that we're going to see a phenomenal upsurge in anti-semitism as a result of Jewish refusal to recognize "importance of the circumcision issue". The last "scholarly" article you had was from 1967 at least. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.circumcisioninfo.com/igor.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.circumcisioninfo.com/igor.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - This link may not be scholarly but it does add to evidence that circumcision has been banned since the hellenistic period - something denied by opponents.
<ul>
<li>Igor is still not noteworthy, nobody's claimed that circumcision hasn't been banned since the hellenistic period, and as I've said elsewhere, circumcision was banned in the USSR in an attempt to squelch Islam, not Judaism. Igor, in fact, nowhere claims that the prohibition on circumcision in the former USSR had anything to do with circumcision. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.crosscurrents.org/eisenbaum.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crosscurrents.org/eisenbaum.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - May or may not be relevant - scathing article condemns Paul for antisemitism - makes many references to his negativity towards circumcision.
<ul>
<li>This is of laughable inclusion. It does <i>not</i> condemn Paul for antisemitism, and certainly not on the grounds of his stance on circumcision. Rather, it fairly clearly says that Paul's insistence that circumcision was unnecessary <i>for non-Jews</i>, was a result of his clearly distinguishing between God's covenant with Jews and God's "new" covenant w/ non-Jews. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.circumcisioninfo.com/circ_aquotes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.circumcisioninfo.com/circ_aquotes.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - This link is quite clear in linking anti-circumcision activism to antisemitism.
<ul>
<li>This does not like anti-circumcision activism to antisemitism, it is merely a catalog of incredibly stupid things said by anti-circumcision activists, some of which are antisemitic. This is more of a list of how obscenely moronic <i>some</i> anti-circumcision activists really are. Quoting Teresa Heinz Kerry and Howard Dean could just as easily be used to demonstrate the ignorance and intellectual (and civil) bankruptcy of the US Democrat party and by extension anyone who identifies with it, but that doesn't make a good case for anything. It's nothing but a list of quotations. And in this case, more to the point, it neither does what you claim it does, nor does it do anything to lend legitimacy or credence to the point you're trying to make. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The relevant passage, "<i>A general debate concerning Somali refugees who practice circumcision on their young daughters expanded into antisemitic claims against the brit mila (Jewish male circumcision ritual). Although most writers were careful to avoid comments that might be construed as antisemitic, Finn Nielsen, in Jyllands Posten (9 Sept.), stated, for instance, that the practice of circumcision was “barbarian,” but that there was no hope of abolishing it since any criticism led to “a chorus crying ‘Holocaust!’”</i>" nowhere links anticircumcision activism with antisemitism, it merely says that some anti-antisemites have claimed that opposition to circumcision is antisemitic. This is completely irrelevant to the point you are trying to make. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The only way this can possibly be a "source" is if you don't understand what the author is saying. To quote the only remotely possibly relevant passage: "<i>Those who see antisemitism everywhere notice that an anti-circumcision message could readily twist into "Jews circumcise, therefore Jews are evil." Though if this kind of antisemitism is really present, it is well camouflaged.</i>" If you really don't understand, let me try to explain it: he's saying that those Jews who perceive the slightest criticism of Judaism as rabid antisemitism will be quick to point out that the message that circumcision is bad can quickly be drawn into a view that, because Jews circumcise, Jews are therefore evil. He then continues to say that if anyone is making that assertion, there's little evidence of it, which is, in fact, what everyone on this TALK page has been telling you (Sirkumsize) for quite some time now. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The only potentially relevant passage on that site is, and I quote: "<i>According to medieval myth, Jews thought the Christian blood could purge the diseases caused by their own corrupt blood, or cure the wounds caused by circumcision.</i>" As that whole section makes clear however, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libels</a> were invented by people who hated Jews as rationales for their hatred. There is no link made between the practice of circumcision and an increase in antisemitism. That fact the blood libel was used to incite mobs (whose antisemitism was instilled during the time of the Roman Empire and later cultivated by the Christian religion) to riot and kill Jews, is a very different thing from the erroneous claim that circumcision caused antisemitism. This is kind of a bad trend. First 1967, then 1907, and now the middle ages. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't you think that this myth is an extension of the dislove for Jewish circumcision? If not then why does it mention circumcision as the justification for the blood libel thingie? <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 02:44, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The author makes this claim on his website, as cited, but his inclusion in the <i>Antisemitism World Report 1997</i> was because he attacked Jews as hypocrites for railing against clitorodectomy but not against neo-natal male circumcision. In doing so, he singles out Jews for attack. He also demonstrates that he doesn't know that clitorodectomy is <i>not</i> analogous to circumcision. The analogous surgery would be lopping off the glans itself, to which the foreskin (what is actually removed in Jewish circumcision) is barely connected, as you (Sirkumsize) should know. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:11, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know the difference between the clitorus and the hood. I also know that mutilation is mutilation. I also find it hard to believe that singling out the Jews for an example is antisemitic.

<p>Circumsision makes Jews look evil only to people who are already anti-semites.

<li>There is a huge difference between objecting to a Jewish practice and being anti-Semitic. The same mistake appears to be made by Sirkumsize and those who say his opposition to circumcision is ipso facto anti-Semitic. Supportive data for Sirkumsize's position might include some statements from anti-Semites such as "Oh, I'd be just fine with the Jews except for that circumcision stuff." But I'll be bold and generalize that anti-Semites who object to circumcision would have no difficulty at all finding plenty of other justifications for their anti-Semitism should circumcision suddenly be removed as a Jewish commandment. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 16:23, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Jpgordon, this is a kind of circular argument, since if you think about, we have to first decide who gets to label who as antisemitic or just someone who criticizes a Jewish practice. If for instance you consider the <i>Antisemitism World Report</i> to be the authority on who's antisemitic and who isn't then there's fairly good example of that already. I certainly don't see any evidence that Sami A. Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh is antisemitic beyond his views on circumcision and I think we have an obligation to assume him innocent until proven guilty. Therefore he is antisemitic because of the circumcision issue. If the Report is wrong and he's just a dude that criticizes circumcision, then I guess this link doesn't means anything. So hopefully you see my point: Quoting an antisemitic person like you suggest doesn't mean a darn thing because we have to decide first whether or not he is antisemitic. So we have to decide whether or not being anti-circumcision makes you antisemitic before hand. I hope that's clear (its still leaving my head spinning). <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 21:55, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for clearifying that I am person with a valid objection to a Jewish practice rather than an antisemite. I am a lot more comfortable seeing myself that way. If I am forced to wear the label antisemite for opposing circumcision as some here seem to believe, then I'm not particularly bothered by that. After all its just a label ascribed to me by other people. It doesn't change who I am as a person. I am glad that this issue is getting clearified because the links suggest that there is huge indistinction between supporting a ban on circumcision (including but not limited to Jewish) and being antisemitic and here on Wikipedia we have a golden opportunity to clearify that by adding it into the article text. If you are in agreement that there is considerable confusion on this at large, then surely you agree that it needs to be in this article. Perhaps this issue is bigger than you think and adding a circumcision section to the article would not be disproportionate afterall. 64.229.149.16 02:26, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Tomer, thank you so much for commenting on the sources. I want to note that I am not currently trying to justify the thesis that antisemitism is increasing because of anti-circumcision activism. I did mention only in one revision that I made. Currently there is nothing in the article text or on WP about the circ-antisemitism link, but I would frankly settle for anything at moment, even if its to discredit the link. I would even be happy with a statement that doesn't make a specific reference to circumcision but states that there is a debate between where the valid criticism for Jewish practices ends and antisemitism begins. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 02:44, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to recap -- based on the references I provided, there is now sufficient grounds to include the following in the text of the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Jewish practice of circumcision has been banned since the Hellenistic period -- at least one specifically references it in the criminal code.
<ul>
<li>Relevant perhaps in <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a>, but not here...especially, as I've said at least twice now, the practice was outlawed in the USSR in order to try to squelch Islam, not Judaism. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:57, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Antisemitism World Report</i> has cited anti-circumcision activists -- or at least reserachers who publish findings that would counter-indicate it as antisemitic for no other apparent reason.
<ul>
<li>Not relevant at all, since citing someone is not the same as calling them antisemitic. As I said in my earlier comments, he was cited not because of his opposition to circumcision, but because he called Jews hypocrites. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:57, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A study has shown that people of other culturals do react negatively to tangible Judaic practices and circumcision is the most signicant of these -- not a trivial finding to anyone interested in antisemitism.
<ul>
<li>This is indicative of xenophobia. That said, there is nothing in the cited source that indicates that being disturbed by circumcision. If the individuals who say they're disturbed by it are antisemites, there's nothing to indicate that they're not just using circumcision as an excuse, just as many antisemites cite Israel's "mistreatment of the poor defenseless peaceloving 'Palestinians'". That's an excuse to cover up a pathology, it's not a cause of the pathology itself. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:57, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is all just speculation. We have to add this to article somewhere I think. No one really know if antisemitism isn't related to Jewish practices and its very healthy to concede in the article that some Jewish practices are disturbing. This is a quantitative scientific study. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 18:12, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I couldn't disagree more strongly. The majority of suicide bombers are young men, muslims, who likely have circumcised penes. Most Jewish men have circumcised penes.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Proposed Circ-antisemitism para</span></h4>
<p>Guys: Here is my proposal for a paragraph on the link or proposed link between circumcision and antisemitism. It is entirely based on the research above and so belongs in the article. Please do not thwart this effort out of malice but comment on it. You owe me this for the hard work I've gone to, to include such a paragraph.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Research into the causes of antisemitism has shown that the single most disturbing tangible aspect of Judaism is their circumcision ritual. Many individuals with antisemitic view have held view strongly against circumcision in specific. Throughout history circumcision has been banned in a number of instances. Many legends that defame the Jews such as the blood libel make specific reference to the practice. In recent years there as been increased activism against circumcision due to ethical concerns about the practice. Some researchers who publish work that counter-indicates circumcision have actually been cited in reports against antisemitism. There is no way to know how much anticircumcision activism is actually rooted in antisemitism.

<li><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin">User_talk:SlimVirgin</a>, these links are to support a controversial inclusion of a section linking circumcision and antisemitism. This section has been debated widely before. An article was written on wikipedia specifically on this subject was deleted - I believe - unjustly. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 10:19, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the debate, it has nothing to do with the new anti-Semitism, which is a distinct phenomenon, described by the article, and written about by several journalists and others. If you can find a credible source linking the new anti-Semitism to circumcision, by all means include it, but the source would have to make that specific link; otherwise, it's your <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:10, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>If I understand the article correctly this refers to new anti-Judaism since the 1970's. It seems very focused on anti-semitism/anti-zionism. Maybe this issue is relevant to it since there are some sources that suggest that anti-circumcision sediment is rising and this will lead to increased antisemitism. Personally I don't think that the circumcision/antisemitism link is new, but I will agree that it is fairly new that it is finally coming into the public conscience. I can see the change in the number of relevant links since I last searched the net for WP articles on this topic a few months ago. I am still curious however what brought your attention here. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 11:39, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>This isn't the place to discuss circumcision. This page is for the new anti-Semitism. If you can find a credible source making the specific link between new anti-Semitism and circumcision, then include that source's argument, with a full citation; in the absence of that, there really is nothing to talk about.

<p>TShilo12,</p>
<p>What do you mean? If you read the anti-semitism page, there are a bunch of "theories" there that anti-semitism is based on the "alleged" massive socio-economic power Jews hold. Well, that socio-economic power Jews hold is NOT "alleged" it's a documented fact. So that alone should be changed.</p>
<p>And it's also interesting that we read about how bad the Jews suffered under pogroms or the Pale of Settlement, but never once is there an honest reflection by Jews that their own behavior, manner of dress or ways of working as a unified Tribe and repeated refusals to assimilate have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>That's like a 10 year old who is constantly getting disicplined by his teacher going, "I don't know why everyone's always pickin' on me" but he insists on wearing his own clothes to class, not associating or assimilating, refusing to sit, etc. And somehow he is the 'victim' and the native group is supposed to feel sorry for the newcomer that refuses to assimilate with the group but has the audacity to demand the group assimilate and accomodate him!</p>

<p><br />
In addition, it is a highly speculative theory by one individual which is notable only for being intensely reductionist. Very few researchers seem to take KBM seriously; the fame of his theories is pure notoriety. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 3 July 2005 22:35 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jfdwolff,</p>
<p>Just because only a few "researchers" take MacDonald "seriously" doesn't mean MacDonald is incorrect especially when his biggest critics are Jews.</p>
<p>In the interest of fairness, Jews should recuse themselves from that debate less they continue to show their bias.</p>
<p>And if you want empirics on what I say about MacDonald, consider that when Stanley Prusiner introduced the idea of a protein called a "Prion" causing diseases like mad-cow all the scientists thought he was a dumb jackass! That didn't prevent Prusinger from not only BEING RIGHT but WINNING a NOBEL PRIZE.</p>
<p>This is especially true when MacDonald is facing so many "circle the wagon" Jews in the media and scientific community.</p>
<p>Lastly the "notoriety" you ascribe to MacDonald is the same notoriety that drove Gibson's "Passion of Christ" - fearful, hateful, paranoid, Christophobic Jews reacting to something THEY didn't like.</p>

<p>Spencer195, even though I know nothing of this theory I feel for you. I was treated exactly the same way when I tried to introduce a section on the link between circumcision and antisemitism which I think is fairly well established by a variety of sources. I was shot down the same way. This particulair bunch just don't seem open to anything outside of the status quo.

<p>Sirkumsize,</p>
<p>I agree with you. I fear that nothing, no matter how true it is, will see the light of day on this site as long as a Jew is in control because if it makes a Jew look bad, it's getting buried.</p>
<p>And I've yet to see any objective framework of WHAT makes anything anti-semitic other than some Jew says it is.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticising Israeli politics</span></h2>
<p>I'm quite sure we've all both heard it and seen it on television: one person is criticising Israeli politics, for example for its treatment of Palestinians and particularly the separation barrier. Another person defending the Israeli politics, after some initial discussion on the topic, reverts to calling the first person an anti-semite. I added a small note to the beginning of this article in reference to this. Someone (you know who you are) found it too uncomfortable and removed it. Now I want a proper discussion around this because I don't see why there should be any hiding the fact that <b>idiots come in all shapes, colors, nationalities and religious beliefs</b>. <a href="../../../d/s/a/User%7EDsandlund_1641.html" title="User:Dsandlund">DSandlund</a> July 6 2005, 19.02 GMT+1</p>

<dd>Uncomfortable about your edits? Did you even read my edit summary? If someone is trigger-happy with branding people anti-Semites, that doesn't affect the definition or the commonly understood usage of the term (which is the purpose of the article's intro). If I run around calling people "anti-Swiss" because they don't like <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_cheese.html" title="Swiss cheese">Swiss cheese</a>, it doesn't make cheese-haters into <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a>-haters.

<dd><i>On the one hand</i>, you are happy to classify people criticising Israeli politics as anti-semites. I'm referring to the article about <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> - section "10 Nazi / Third Reich terminology in popular culture" - the paragraph about critics of Israel. There, I removed the sentence "Some regard this as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitic</a>" (in reference to people disagreeing with Israeli politics regarding the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_barrier.html" title="Separation barrier">separation barrier</a>). My reason for doing so was, clearly (although not stated in the edit comment), that the only reason for having that sentence there, would be to stupify critics of Israeli politics as having no merit (which I think is a rather serious way of disrupting discussions of merit in general). But, only minutes later, you cared to make one edit to put that sentence back in.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>On the other hand</i>, you refuse to acknowledge that people criticising Israeli politics regarding the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_barrier.html" title="Separation barrier">separation barrier</a>, are by some classified as anti-semites (as in the article about <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a>, where you removed the sentence in the introduction that said "Some people may also call anyone disagreeing with Israeli politics, an anti-semite").</dd>

<dd>To Jayjg: what you say is something that is very important to remember, but to this particular case it's actually not relevant at all.

<dd>Actually, what I said is quite relevant, since you have provided no actual evidence, but instead merely made <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> allegations. Moreover, even if it were true, it has nothing to do with the definition of anti-Semitism, but is rather a polemical statement made for other purposes. As for HKT being inconsistent, not true as well; the article in question said that some believe describing Israel as "Nazi" is anti-Semitic. Calling someone a Nazi is not the same thing as criticising their actions or policies. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 6 July 2005 18:24 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me translate this from <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doublespeak.html" title="Doublespeak">doublespeak</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>I'm delighted to accuse you of doublethink. I am certain that you are attempting to glorify one side, but I'd rather accuse you of this subtly and suggestively, merely implying that proof of this exists. I'd also like to imply that I stand for objectivity and must preach it <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedagogue.html" title="Pedagogue">pedagogically</a> to you</i> (note: I assume you meant '<a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity.html" title="Objectivity">objective</a>' instead of '<a href="../../../s/u/b/Subjectivity.html" title="Subjectivity">subjective</a>'). <i>To conclude, I'll portray myself as an indignant victim of your writing, which I will characterize as hostile.</i>"</dd>

<p>Your writing style is not at all original; it's frequently employed by certain unsavory journalists. If you'd write in a less condescending tone, you would quickly gain the respect of the greater Wikipedia community. I hope you take these comments as constructive; I mean them as such. (P.S. How exactly do extensive scholarly backgrounds in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Jewish literature</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_history.html" title="Jewish history">Jewish history</a>, and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_politics.html" title="American politics">American politics</a> prove that I try to glorify "one party" (i.e. the "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> party")? Maybe the fact that "you'll usually find me editing <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>-related articles" proves this? Well, I can only point to the large numbers of editors who "you'll usually find editing Judaism-related articles" that were banned from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitic_cf3f.html" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>.
