<p>Isaac, he definitely belongs in this category but the objection to his categorization would seem to have some validity. That is, there is no mention in the article itself of his being anti-Semitic. Clearly he <i>is</i> anti-Semitic and I have certainly read enough on that. Why not simply add verified examples of his anti-Semitism to the article itself? I have not followed the issue too closely, but surely those who have can do so.</p>
<p>I would do so myself but that is not my area of expertise. However, I will certainly support you if you do so, and I certainly hope that some of our other friends here, including some not enthused about this category, will join in to see to it that this individual is listed in the categroy and that the article is complete in that regard. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 11:41, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The allegations concerning anti-Semitism have been mentioned many times in reliable news accounts. I counted 81 in Google News alone, many more on the web. I found a bunch but did not save. I can go back but where shall I cite these links. Here? On the article itself? The Senate resolution itself is obtainable from the Thomas website, as well as mentioned in news accounts. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 19:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comment on article talk page</span></h3>
<p>Well, I did a little googling and found a veritable mountain of material on the subject. Given the "controversial" template on the top of the talk page, I did not make any changes to the article but instead posted a little comment at the bottom of the talk page, and would encourage others to take a look and weigh in if so inclined.</p>
<p>After reading through the google stuff, I was really quite astonished why the anti-Semitic character of his statements is not mentioned in the underlying piece. I think that omission skews the POV of the article, frankly.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 12:52, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, actually I do, to the Senate resolution, adopted unanimously, specifically condemning him for anti-Semitism and also to a resolution of 28 NGOs doing the same thing and citing the Canadian parliament. <s>Do you want me to put them on the page itself?</s>--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 19:54, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As per below, a section has been added. Incidentally, this subject is being discussed in perhaps two or three different locations in two separate discussion pages.

<dd>I renamed the section to "Alleged antisemitism" to avoid repeting his name and it was more describing. "Many sources" also sounds a bit <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasly</a> so something better should be added. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a>
<dl>
<dd>You may be right that it may sound a bit weasly. However, unless one believes that, for example, "the Western media empire" is controlled by one central Zionist source, "the Western media empire" must refer to "many sources."

<dd>That's very interesting. Do you have any sources supporting your contention that Chomsky is anti-semitic? I don't see any in the article on him.

<dd>Several sources that provide evidence for Chomsky's anti-semitism include "The Anti-Chomsky Reader," which provides a good deal of quotes from Chomsky himself and his own works which are overtly ant-semitic. I also offer these paragraphs, from <a href="http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1232" class="external free" title="http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1232" rel="nofollow">http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1232</a>:</dd>

<dd><i>In "Israel and the Art of Disinformation," Paul Bogdanor discusses the "astonishing displays of polemical rage and vindictiveness" in Chomsky's long hate affair with Israel, a country he regards as playing the role of Little Satan to the American Great Satan and functioning strategically as an "offshore military and technology base for the United States." The animus toward Israel is so great—Chomsky sees it as a terror state "with points of similarity" to the Third Reich—that it seems to call for a psychological explanation, especially given the fact that his father, an immigrant from the Ukraine, was a Hebrew teacher; his mother wrote children's stories about the heroism of Jews trying to form a new country in the face of Arab hatred; and Chomsky himself was once a member of a pro-Israel youth group.</i></dd>

<dd><i>Even more bizarre is Chomsky's involvement with neo-Nazis and holocaust revisionism. This strange and disturbing saga began in 1980 with Chomsky's support of a French crank named Robert Faurisson, a rancorous anti-Semite who was fired by the University of Lyon for his hate-filled screeds. ("The alleged Hitlerite gas chambers and the alleged genocide of the Jews form one and the same historical lie.") Chomsky defended Faurisson as an "apolitical liberal" whose work was based on "extensive historical research" and said that he saw "no hint of anti-Semitic implications" at all in his work. In his carefully documented "Partners in Hate," Werner Cohn follows Chomsky into this murky world, locating him at the intersection where his loathing of Israel and his "paroxysm of self-hatred" meet Faurisson and the neo-Nazi groups Chomsky allowed to print his books and to promote them alongside the works of Joseph Goebbels.</i></dd>

<dd>Mantanmoreland is completely correct. I have certainly known at least one Jew who were strong supporters of Nazi Germany and their policies. Does it make sense? No, at least not to me, but there is no inherent exclusionary relationship between a Jew and an anti-semite. To say otherwise is a diversionary canard.

<dd>I'm puzzled as to why you mix opposition to Israel in with support for Naziism, as if the two charges were of equivalent importance. What have they to do with one another? There is a difference between opposition - even violent opposition - to a political movement, and hatred and contempt for a race of people. Whether Chomsky is or is not an anti-semite, his position regarding Israel, when stated on political grounds, surely cannot be considered relevant. Anti-zionism does not an anti-semite make.

<dd>Anti-zionism is anti-semitic. Opposition to Israeli policy X does not necessarily make on an anti-semite. Calling oneself an "anti-zionist" instead of "anti-semitic" doesn't change the face of the beast, as their favored outcome, the destruction of Israel, would still end up killing 6 million Jews, so hiding behind another label for anti-semite doesn't work.</dd>

<dd>When did anti-zionism come to mean <i>only</i> "favoring the destruction of Israel"? I always thought it meant "politically opposed to the concept of a Jewish homeland in Palestine", and it was upon this second definition I based my argument.</dd>
<dd>Let's see... according to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>, the term is more controversial than I was aware, however (according to Wikipedia) the <i>"diversity in terms of motivation and expression (of Anti-Zionists) is so great that anti-Zionism cannot be seen as a single phenomenon."</i> So, I learn more every day.</dd>
<dd>For whatever it's worth, I disagree with both you and Mr. Prager. The term "anti-zionist" is not as cut-and-dried as you make it out to be. How can opposition to a <i>policy</i> - the goal of building a Jewish homeland in Palestine - be 100% equivalent to hatred of a <i>race</i>? I'm sure that many, for all I know a majority, of anti-zionists are anti-semites. I'm sure that many, for all I know a majority, of those who oppose Israel do so due to hatred of Jews. But there is certainly ideological and logical room for a distinct minority that oppose Zionism without animosity towards Jews. Whether Chomsky falls within that minority, I have no idea.</dd>
<dd>Allow me to amend myself, therefore: anti-zionism does not <i>necessarily</i> an anti-semite make. As to Chomsky, I must say I'm disappointed in him. I had never read some of these things by him before, and he had always seemed fairly rational and sane to me. I have serious doubts about the sanity of anyone who can make such comments about, essentially, himself. Mantanmoreland is right; once one stops assuming sanity on a particular person's part, it then becomes sensible that they could express racial hatred against their own race. I was operating on an assumption that Noam Chomsky was sane. I'm now reassessing that notion.

<dd>I disagree with your position that anti-Zionism isn't anti-Semitism, but I can see how one could come to such a conclusion. In the meantime, do you agree that Chomsky could be classified as an anti-Semite?

<dd>I will have to do more research and get back to you on that. If I find that he has made statements supporting or defending Nazi policies or goals (such as Holocaust denial or apologism), or otherwise expressed hatred for Jews as a race, that would definitely fit with what I understand anti-semitism to be. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 02:32, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate the several nice references to myself (I was getting so battered on another talk page it was harming my self-esteem!). One wee point on this -- prior to the establishment of Israel in particular, a fairly large portion of both Jewish and non-Jewish public opinion was non- or evem anti-Zionist. Therefore one could not say then that anti-Zionist=anti-Semitic. Today, however, the two are more likely to be equivalent. I think it must be examined on a case by case basis. Unfortunately, some people refuse to describe any anti-Zionist as anti-Semitic.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 20:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Chomsky isn't an anti-Semite. He's just one of those fringe leftists that take their dislike of Israel to hyperbolic extremes when describing their anger at the government. (That's not to say that some of those guys aren’t anti-Semitic because they end up misconstruing their loathing of the Israeli government and then associating that hatred with Jews, but I think it's fair to argue that Chomsky, though a bit "out there", isn't one of those idiots who is incapable of distinguishing between the two groups.) He's also one of those people with enough common sense to defend people's rights to hate speech, even if it's directed at his own heritage. All in all, his attitudes toward an free speech and vitriolic dislike of the Israeli government has absolutely no bearing on whether he hates Jews (or even Israelis) as a people. Give some solid evidence (i.e. him actually saying something negative about Jews as a whole as a people) and then you have a case. Until then, you're just being foolish. 66.229.182.113 09:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've done some more research since my above discussion with Mantanmoreland and Doright, which I conceded out of an awareness of my own ignorance. Since then I've read the sources cited at <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> and the matter appears to be highly subjective. From one point of view, Chomsky was merely defending a holocaust denier's right to freedom of speech; from another point of view, he was defending the holocaust denier's actual <i>views</i> as such, and thus is tarred with the same brush. I would personally tend to hold with those who feel Chomsky was merely defending an extremely unpopular kind of speech. In fact, the most damning quote his critics in the Faurisson affair seem to be able to find is his describing the holocaust denier as "a relatively apolitical liberal of some sort", along with a disclaimer that Chomsky had not thoroughly read the man's work. To me, this does not equate to hating Jews. And he raises a good point that it is precisely in the cases of the <i>most</i> unpopular speech that freedom of speech must be most vigorously defended.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Chomsky is quoted as saying <i>"...even denial of the Holocaust would not prove that a person is an anti-Semite."</i>, his reasoning being that <i>"...if a person ignorant of modern history were told of the Holocaust and refused to believe that humans are capable of such monstrous acts, we would not conclude that he is an anti-Semite."</i> Thus he appears to be making the point I have occasionally made on Wikipedia, that allegations of anti-semitism depend not so much on what a person says or does (because in some cases the same things could be said or done for non-anti-semitic reasons), but what they <i>intend by it</i>, which is a largely subjective matter, except in those rare cases where a person recognizes himself as hateful and admits to it. Chomsky is essentially saying, "Who are we to judge another's motives?", and I'm inclined to agree, particularly from the standpoint of Wikipedia's policies concerning verifiability and original research. He has certainly been cited as anti-semitic by some, but the question is, <i>what is the balance of opinion</i> - and I say opinion because as I have illustrated, this is a subjective matter - what is the balance of opinion on whether Chomsky is in fact anti-semitic? Because Wikipedia should attempt to reflect that balance, whatever it is. I haven't yet seen any compelling evidence that Chomsky's critics have proved their point.

<p>Here's Luther's plan for the Jews:</p>
<ol>
<li>"First to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them. ..."</li>
<li>"Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. ..."</li>
<li>"Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them. ..."</li>
<li>"Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb. ..."</li>
<li>"Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. ..."</li>
<li>"Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them. ... Such money should now be used in ... the following [way]... Whenever a Jew is sincerely converted, he should be handed [a certain amount]..."</li>
<li>"Seventh, I commend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow... For it is not fitting that they should let us accursed Goyim toil in the sweat of our faces while they, the holy people, idle away their time behind the stove, feasting and farting, and on top of all, boasting blasphemously of their lordship over the Christians by means of our sweat. No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants."</li>
<li>"If we wish to wash our hands of the Jews' blasphemy and not share in their guilt, we have to part company with them. They must be driven from our country" and "we must drive them out like mad dogs."</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category deleting</span></h2>
<p>While I run the risk of substantiating a discussion by responding to it, the fact is that this category is POV. And even though it may have less controversial or even non-controverisal uses, its nevertheless misused and is therefore problematic. Further, it invites similar relativistic-subjective pejorative categories - some of which would apply directly to people who would (by equivalent criteria) apply no less than the above categorization. A simply solution would have been to limit its usage to dead people, as they cant argue, but even this limit was not supported and therefore enforced. Failing the designation of a reasonably agreeable spectrum of anti-Semitism (1/2 anti-Semitic, 1/4 anti-Semitic from patriarchal lineage, etc.) then there is no need to have this category other than to lable people according to the definition of a particular POV. I agree it could be nice to find a categorical way to use it, but its usage has been too... liberal. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 20:29, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, there is no consensus period. Theres a big difference IMHO between lacking consensus to delete, and having consensus to keep. Consensus is simply a factor of convincing people of your argument. Silence is often an indicator of capitulation, and we could simply interpret "consensus" in that way as well. Another CFD might prove useful, though that forum is not really conducive to rational discussion.All we have left is argumentum ad absurdum via something like Category:Anti-Swiss people, Category:Anti-French people etc. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 00:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just found this category through reading the <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Pound_79cc.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a> article (not a fan, just wanted to know more about him). Do I have my head in the sand or is being an "anti-Semite" so notable as to deserve a category in an encyclopedia? I know this was referred to above as "<i>argumentum ad naseum</i>" but if this category is acceptable, why don't we have Category:Anti-American people or Category:Anti-Caucasian people? I could legitimately populate these two categories with dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Ahmadinajad has made the same threats toward America and Western Culture in general that he has made toward the Jews, why do we categorize his views on the Jews but not on Americans? What's notable is that the man's a lunatic, not that he has anti-"whatever" views, same for Hitler, Stalin, etc. What about <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farakhan_788a.html" title="Louis Farakhan">Louis Farakhan</a> (maybe even <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Nagin_a73c.html" title="Ray Nagin">Ray Nagin</a>) in the Anti-Caucasian category? What's wrong with that? We need to stop worrying about being <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_correct.html" title="Politically correct">Politically correct</a> and just be consistent and truthful. Oooohhh, here's one that will have folks running to the CfD page:Category:Anti-Christianity people. I could easily populate that one with dozens of names as well.

That is, stalking is a modification and worsening of harassment; without harassment, stalking isn't happening. First you accuse BhaiSaab of stalking you, then when he claims to have followed Liftarn here, you claim this is evidence of stalking. What? You think BhaiSaab is stalking Liftarn?

He admitted to making vile anti-Semitic statements. This is typical of the frivolous character of this "disputed" label.

<dd>I'm a little uncertain here. This category is not named Anti-Semitic <i>person</i>. It's named "Anti-Semitic <i>people</i>." Are they not people?

<dd>It's a matter of nomenclature, that's all. If there were a category for "anti-semitic bands", I'd be the first to put Prussian Blue in it. "Prussian Blue" does not refer to people per se, but to an organization (of the subtype "band") which happens to be made up of people, two of whom we definitely know are anti-semitic. They would fit better under a category referring to "Anti-semitic groups" (or "organizations"), if we had one. "Anti-semitic duos" would probably be too specific, since there are probably very few such duos. Should such a category be created, do you think? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 21:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly, I don't know if these people are antisemites or not. And, I understand that your point relates to nomenclature. But, I don't yet see this as a violation of WP nomenclature. I was hoping you could provide me the WP guideline text which suggests that it is. I don't know if other categories should be created. However, I don't think it makes sense to make a special category for antisemitic musical groups, nor do I think they belong in the category of organizations. I think it's better to just include them in this category.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 21:58, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She was accused of anti-semitism by the person who started the academic boycott of Israel in the UK! She has advocated a number of positions which are generally considered anti-semitic such as:
<ol>
<li>Holocaust denial</li>
<li>The Jews control the media and the culture</li>
<li>Jews run the American government</li>
<li>"I believe there is quite a bit of evidence that points to the truthfulness of his (<a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_B._MacDonald_335e.html" title="Kevin B. MacDonald">Kevin B. MacDonald</a>'s) theory of Judaism as a group-evolutionary strategy to enhance their own agenda and exploit, and even in some cases, enslave others, via proxy.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>She has written articles with titles like:
<ol>
<li>"Zionization of Miami"</li>
<li>"The Myth of Jewish Tolerance"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In addition she has posted articles on her website with titles like
<ol>
<li>"The Jewish Role in the Bolshevik Revolution"</li>
<li>"Is the New World Order 'Jewish'?"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>That took about 10 minutes. Still think she's not an anti-semite? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:54, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
