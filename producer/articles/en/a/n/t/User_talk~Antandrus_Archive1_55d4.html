<dd>Thanks for the suggestion. I think Luzzaschi is about number 15 or so in overall importance in the late Renaissance as a madrigalist so I'll leave him off for now... unless someone decides to list most of the madrigalists, not just the four or five most important.</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for the note. I've kept meaning to say how much I appreciate your work here, so here's a good opportunity. The stuff you've been doing on early music is particularly welcome: it's a somewhat under-served area at the moment (no article on Obrecht until you started it!), and not something I know a lot about, so it's great to see somebody who knows what they're talking about working on it&#160;:) (By the way, I hope the op. 111 image will be making a reappearance in an article on the piece itself soon... but I've been threatening to write that for months now, so who knows if I ever will...)

I'm also a great believer in giving people the historical sweep of a subject, and the varying viewpoints on it, so that they are armed to understand the range of POV. The "late 20th Century" still needs to be covered in more detail from the late moderns such as Carter and Berio, as well as the post-moderns. Harder to sort out what is going to be lasting practice and what will be forgotten however.</p>
<p>A new century, and a new music for it, of course, needs to be worked out elsewhere.</p>

I am hoping other people will write similar articles. I need to get back to writing on classical music, but right now politics calls. Thought - cyclical form should get a more extensive write up, including examples where themes, cells and melodies are used for resonance, and those where there is a more central structural function.</p>

<p>Hi Antandrus, Thanks for your comment! Looking over your edits, I notice you're covering a lot of topics that editors without specialist training (e.g., me) would find daunting, or even be unaware of. (<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_subtilior.html" title="Ars subtilior">Ars subtilior</a> is an example--gotta check that out!) This is a big plus.

<p>I agree Bluebeard and Salome would make a great double-bill (what a bitch to rehearse though...)! And if in San Francisco then all the better! I saw the Elektra in I think '97 or '98. Saw it on Halloween&#160;:). Wish they would do the Halloween shows still, but that tradition seems to have died. I just reworked a lot of the Bluebeard article; have been meaning to write it for a long time but it's great that you took charge. See what you think with my edits. I'll plan to do some more work over the next week. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinasaur_7224.html" title="User:Chinasaur">Chinasaur</a> 05:48, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, unfortunately I am out of town for the summer so I missed Faustus. Yeah, I noticed that you had been kind of skirting some of the major issues; I put stuff in, but tried not to be too heavy-handed. The video is unfortunately (in my opinion) overstaged; the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluebeard%27s_Castle_3c34.html" title="Bluebeard's Castle">original stage directions</a> are very sparse. But it's still worth seeing and the performance is great (acting pretty good too). I think the video is out of print now, so I'll make you a copy when I'm back if you'd like. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinasaur_7224.html" title="User:Chinasaur">Chinasaur</a> 06:17, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, how did you know I was working on this already? Anyway, I'm not actually knowledgable on this subject; I just found the reference in your to do list and it sounded interesting so I Googled it.

Do you work with unix/lilypond stuff at all?

<p>I beefed up your article on cantus.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Antandrus. Yes I love Part, and I am a Buddhist. The stuff I've wrietten is from a longer essay where I analyse Cantus from a Buddhist perspective. I he's hit upon some very deep "truth" in the universe in Cantus, there is something universal about his response to Britten's death. I've listened to the piece 100's of times now and studied the score as well, and it still sounds fantastic! There's a performance later this year in my town (Cambridge, UK) which I hope to go to as it will be the first time I've heard it live, and the orchestra are usually very good (Britten Sinfonia). I always wondered whether Britten had any influence over Parts music, but I'm less familar with Britten and listening to Part I don't seem to hear any similarities. Maybe it was a "vibe" thing? My workl usually requires a bit of copy editing - I'm not so much sloppy as grammatically challenged&#160;:-) Cheers <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahaabaala_a94a.html" title="User:Mahaabaala">mahābāla</a> 08:15, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC) (aka Michael)</dd>

<p>I see that you beefed up the article on Bortniansky. I am somewhat excited that anyone added some real content to it.

<p>Hi Antandrus, glad you spotted that ad in <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_quartet.html" title="String quartet">String quartet</a>. Since you're attuned to this problem, I wonder if you could take a look at the discussion of the "Belknap method" in <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">Violin</a> and tell me what you think. A Google search of "Belknap method" yielded nothing other than copies of the Wikipedia Violin article. I smell commercial exploitation but it's not so blatant that I feel I could revert without consulting others first.

<p>Antandrus, thanks so much for your note! I'm pretty much done editing for now -- anything more would take some research on my end, and I'm swamped right now. I'd be fascinated to learn more about the music (I like Byrd, and have heard of Tallis, and that's it for my knowledge), and I think it would beef the article up nicely. Then I or one of the other literature geeks around here can get a bit more about the playwrights/essayists/poets and we'll be in good shape.&#160;:-) Thanks for your note, and please, edit to your heart's content! I'll be reading it with interest. Good luck, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 21:06, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the support! As far as non-recent music goes in such articles, I have only ad hoc opinions. I suppose each country is unique, and the articles should each give as much info as is necessary to understand the music of today in each country... but that is a complicated solution. In any case, my usual position in such issues is to add information to the main article until it bursts, and then a logical and informative method of dividing into sub-articles is usually apparent... Anyway, any help you could give would be most appreciated. Especially at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Germany_3092.html" title="Music of Germany">music of Germany</a>, I have exhausted the only print resource I have access to, and every single scrap of info I can find with google, and have still found relatively little -- contribute anything you can. Please don't worry about translation issues or anything else (I don't know if English is your first language, or not, or where you are from) -- if you add info, I promise to incorporate it one way or another!

<p>Re. "Never edit any articles on popular culture. They're horribly overrepresented. You like them? You do them." Gee, you might not make friends this way, but I admire your forthrightness. I often find works of popular culture to be bleak and life-denying, so I see where you're coming from.</p>
<p>I once put into <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> that claim that it's <i>good</i> that the Wikipedia has all this popular culture stuff in it, because we'll understand the people of the 21st century better if we document their cultural detritus with care. Sort of like a biologist carefully dissecting an intestinal parasite--there's things we ought to know for scientific purposes, even if the research task is unpleasant. Nice Ravenscroft, b.t.w..

<p>&lt;Antandrus replied on Opus33's user page, then&gt;</p>
<p>Hi Antandrus, thanks for your message. I can't compare Sibelius to Finale because I've never used Finale. Sibelius is very impressive and follows an approach I respect (there's a real manual, written by literate people) but is hard to learn. I had to call product support to figure a couple things out. See <a href="../../../t/o/c/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_Minor_197a.html" title="Toccata and Fugue in D Minor">Toccata and Fugue in D Minor</a> for a hard case I never did figure out...</p>
<p>I got Sibelius because it seemed to be the next big thing , but probably not worth paying $$$ to switch from Finale if that's working for you. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../o/p/u/User%7EOpus33_8708.html" title="User:Opus33">Opus33</a></p>

<p>Looking at your history, I'm sure this must have been an oversight on your part, but your supposed "reversion of vandalism" at the article <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> today left the section "Ancient Terminology" saying (I can hardly bring myself to reproduce this, but I will) "'Jew' comes from 'Nigger', but more evolved.

<dd>You are correct: it was my mistake. Word to the wise, always check what has saved after reverting someone's vandalism. What happened, and what still mystifies me a little, is that someone else attempted the revert as the same time as me, and my revert ended up undoing the other person's revert.

<p>Hi Antandrus, thanks for your message. I'm glad you are watching this article too.</p>
<p>Um, apart from the need to defend it from eccentrics, are you entirely happy with this article? I have feelings of discontent myself.</p>
<p>It seems much more feasible to prepare a good article about, say, Ravenscroft than about Beethoven because in the latter case there are zillions of people who want to get their word in. Even when what they have to say is basically sensible it seems rather like the horde of jostling commuters in Grand Central Station.</p>
<p>Might a strategy that would help be the "general article--dependent articles" model, like they do for country articles? Then the Beethoven article could be short and sober, with the details farmed out to where people could read about it where they want to. Just a thought...

<p>I want to thank you for the warm welcome. I indeed feel very inclined to stay and help extending the articles on art music. Alas, I have no formal musical training; I hope that a bit of reading on musical theory can help here. I always wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the music I love, e.g. its technical and historical aspects; authoring and co-authoring articles will be a very welcome opportunity do to that. This week I am going to order a few books. I have much to learn yet.</p>
<p>Speaking of editing, is there any place where that "small but dedicated group of 'classical music' editors" gathers for discussion of the whole of articles on art music? The first thing I want to do---provided that I can collect enough material---is to expand the stub on <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luigi_Dallapiccola_3842.html" title="Luigi Dallapiccola">Luigi Dallapiccola</a> (and maybe write something about his "Ulysse"), because I feel that I owe that to him. But I am biased. I'd like to explicetly ask for peer review, when I am done (which will not bee too soon, though).</p>
