<p>I am expanding this stub, but there are few things in his writings I don't understand. Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>If there are "no universal stages, or periodization, of social development" than how can he differentiate between pre-modern/modern/late modern societies at all?</li>
<li>His concept of importance of 'time-space' in the structurization theory still eludes me.</li>
</ol>
<p>--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 00:55, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>In answer to question 2, this quote may be of some help: "but social practices ordered across space and time". Giddens argues that "society has a form, and that form has effects on people, in so far as structure is produced and reproduced in what people do." thus soical practices ordered across space and time are not homogenous, it therefore shows how structures, dirived from social action, are specific to their locale. Britain in the 19th century had a geographical space and social practices and action were carried out in terms of sturcture. However, Britain in the 21st century has a completely different geographical space and thus the nature of time and space change as does action and structure; this relates to the duality of structure and agency transformation. (Daniel R. Smith, 2007)</li>

<p>Here's my reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only one picture of him, and it is fair use, not GFDL.</li>
<li>Possibly too long, consider condensing.</li>
<li>Could use a thorough copyedit by a third person familiar with this topic (I'm not), as much of this article has been written by one person.</li>
<li>Select Bibliography may be too long, and needs ISBNs.</li>
<li>Too many redlinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It certainly has a lot of information, though. It's well on its way. Just needs a bit more time and TLC. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 16:18, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update: can't find another image, can't get copyleft license for it. Can't find anybody else to work on it. ISBNs are optional.

<p>I feel this article fails the first criteria that the prose should be well-written, compelling and accessible for the non-specialist reader. An admirable effort has been made in synthesising summaries of Giddens' work from academic books, but the text is still dauntingly dense for the non-specialist reader. The text also needs a thorough going over for wording, misspellings and syntax e.g. "<i>The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in <b>social science</b> result in <b>a desintrest</b> of the people. For example, when <b>scientist</b> don't agree about the <b>greenhouse-effect</b>, people will withdraw from <b>that arena</b>, and <b>negate that there is a problem</b>. <b>Therefore</b>, the more the sciences expand, the more <b>incertitude</b> there is in <b>the</b> modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut <b>even gets more steerless</b>.</i>" (sentence also doesn't distinguish clearly between social science/scientists and natural science/scientists). Also there is a lack of NPOV issue as this article is comprehensive in its positive portrayal of Giddens' theories and concepts but it neglects to convey that while he is a very influential contemporary theorist, he is also a much-criticized (as all influential social theorists are) and even academically controversial one (controversial even at Cambridge SPS). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the POV tag is a little extreme and needlessly off-putting to potential readers. The article appears a fair representation of the man and his theories regardless of whether they are agreed with or not. As mentioned above, most influential theorists are criticised, that is the point of critical study and analysis. Therefore have removed the tag.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.153.139.126 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.153.139.126_b953.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.153.139.126">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Only when there is a consensus that the article is now cleaned up should you then de-list it by deleting the cleanup tag from the article, this causes the article to drop off the monthly cleanup-needed list page.</p>

<p>As a start, I've tried to clean up part of the Modernity section, but are having problems with some of the content. Aside from my reservations that this kind of jargon-orientated account is suitable for a general encyclopedia, I'm not sure what the original writer is trying to say, as some of the content seem contradictory and odd. Giddens may have written about these things (I don't recall enough of his work to be definite), I don't think most of these problems stem from his actual writings.</p>
<p>It is stated (this version includes some minor word tweaking by myself, but the original sense remains intact) for instance: <i>Humanity tries to steer [the juggernaut of modernity], but as long as the modern institutions, with all their uncertainty, endure, we will never be able to influence its course. The uncertainty can however be managed, by 'reembedding' the expert-systems into the structures which we are accustomed to.</i>. This statement has a number of problems - how are modern institutions separable from modernity? Have modern institutions really had <u>little or no influence</u> over managing the course of modern social transformations? The solution of rembedding the expert systems into familiar structures... does this mean that modern structures are unfamiliar to us? i.e. we find modern offices, hospitals, banks, supermarkets, factories, police stations alienating?</p>
<p>Then there's the apparent reference to the US TV chat show celebrity, <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> (I assume that's what the original "Oprah" was referring to - if not, what does it refer to?) uses expert (computer?... this is what "expert system" usually refers to) systems to guide people while being perceived as an ordinary woman. But Oprah isn't perceived as an ordinary woman (she's a major celebrity and the wealthiest African-American woman, I believe) and how does she use expert (computer?) systems to help people as if she was a doctor? I'm not sure how this explains how uncertainty is managed... as apparently the expert systems of modern institutions are still relied on?</p>
<p>Then there's the line about how the enhanced reflexivity of modern institutions needs explanation, and explains it by saying that language has become increasing abstract and institutionalized into universities - so the reflexivity of modern institutions is due to the institutionalized abstraction of language into universities (themselves being modernized institutions too)? Then the section launches into a discussion of double hermeneutica which describes a concept which is attributed to Giddens, but doesn't sound particularly original. I'm not sure where this explanation is going.</p>
<p>As for the block of text immediately following this, I already discussed this above in an earlier comment. I'll try to look at the rest of the article more later. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:35, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted the following, from the end of the first paragraph:</p>
<p>"It is not clear, however, that his theories have had any beneficial impact on social research. His theories have been criticised as being empty conceptual schemes lacking any empirical implications."</p>
<p>This is a strange point and just not true. Giddens has clearly had a significant impact on social research. The comment is subjective and rather silly, so i got rid of it.</p>

<hr />
<p>I just noticed that this article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Giddens writes in Modernity and Self-Identity that: "The importance of the media in propagating many modern lifestyles should be obvious. [...] The range of lifestyles - or lifestyle ideals - offered by the media may be limited, but at the same time it is usually broader than those we would expect to just 'bump into' in everyday life. So the media in modernity offers possibilities and celebrates diversity, but also offers narrow interpretations of certain roles or lifestyles - depending where you look.".[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... but this quote is not from Giddens; in fact it is from my own book, 'Media, Gender and Identity' (David Gauntlett, 2002) - page 104.</p>
<p>So this obviously needs to be fixed, but i don't want be the person adding references to <i>myself</i> in this article. But it would be great if somebody could do some work on this article please...</p>

<p>"grew up in an upper lower middle-class family"</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as "upper lower middle-class"? I would tend to think of lower middle-class or upper middle-class or just middle-class, but upper lower class sounds to me like an oxymoron... <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigzig20s_3d27.html" title="User:Zigzig20s">Zigzig20s</a> 01:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This may not be significant, but the statement, "He has been described as Britain's best known social scientist since John Maynard Keynes", bothered me.</p>
<p>I decided to check the source, and found the exact statement in <i>Blackwell's Companion</i> (bottom of p.248), but the source didn't indicate where they had garnered that notion from. Is it a legitimate claim since it's from Blackwell's? Or can it be removed? <a href="../../../j/y/1/User%7EJy10_a7c8.html" title="User:Jy10">Jy10</a> 18:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
