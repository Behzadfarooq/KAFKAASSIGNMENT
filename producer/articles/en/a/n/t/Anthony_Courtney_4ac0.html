<p>Courtney studied at the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia_Royal_Naval_College_e319.html" title="Britannia Royal Naval College">Royal Naval College</a> in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth%2C_Devon_614e.html" title="Dartmouth, Devon">Dartmouth</a> and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Naval_College%2C_Greenwich_94c9.html" title="Royal Naval College, Greenwich">Royal Naval College, Greenwich</a>. He joined the Navy at the age of 16, and served in it for thirty years. From 1925 he was a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midshipman.html" title="Midshipman">midshipman</a> on <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Renown_%281916%29_f645.html" title="HMS Renown (1916)">HMS <i>Renown</i></a>, serving during the world tour of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">Duke</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon_de74.html" title="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon">Duchess of York</a> in 1926 - 27.

<p>In 1933, Courtney studied <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> in Bessarabia and in 1934 qualified as an interpreter. He then qualified at HM Signal School in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> in signals and wireless telegraphy. He served briefly on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet in Plymouth, before becoming Flag Lieutenant (later Flag Lieutenant-Commander) to a Flag Officer commanding a squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. He was acting Squadron Signals and Wireless Telegraphy Officer. During the first two years of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> he was on the staff of the Admiral commanding the 3rd Battle Squadron and the North Atlantic Escort Force, based in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>.</p>

His service was marked with the award of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> in 1949.

<p>After retiring from the Navy in 1953 with the rank of commander, Courtney became an export consultant, setting up the Eastern Trading Group Consultancy Services which specialised in trade with the Soviet bloc. He also made a living writing and lecturing. At the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1955_142e.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1955">1955 general election</a>, he fought unsuccessfully as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> in <a href="../../../h/a/y/Hayes_and_Harlington_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_29e5.html" title="Hayes and Harlington (UK Parliament constituency)">Hayes and Harlington</a>.</p>

<p>He had been reselected to fight the seat, but then Courtney was chosen to follow <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Harvey_%28politician%29_81fe.html" title="Ian Harvey (politician)">Ian Harvey</a> as Conservative candidate for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow_East_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_0910.html" title="Harrow East (UK Parliament constituency)">Harrow East</a> in early 1959. Harvey had been forced to resign over a homosexual scandal in which he was found <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_flagrante_delicto.html" title="In flagrante delicto">in flagrante delicto</a></i> with a guardsman in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James%27s_Park_e3d3.html" title="St. James's Park">St. James's Park</a>.

<p>Courtney could be a rebellious MP. He opposed the 1961 Defence White Paper and called for replacement of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s V-bomber force with a fleet of submarines. He supported corporal punishment. He was a consistent advocate of a strong Navy to counter the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. In 1962, while on a business trip to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, he demanded a personal visit to see <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikita_Khruschev_e3b9.html" title="Nikita Khruschev">Nikita Khruschev</a> over the case of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greville_Wynne_df3d.html" title="Greville Wynne">Greville Wynne</a>, a British businessman accused of spying by the Soviets. He often raised the issue of religious freedom in Russia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Courtney_4ac0.html" title="Edit section: Scandal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scandal</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1964_dac5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1964">1964 general election</a> cut Courtney's majority in Harrow East. In January and March 1965, anonymous letters including pictures of Courtney with Zina Volkova (a guide with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intourist.html" title="Intourist">Intourist</a>, the Soviet tourist board) were sent to him and his stepson and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Douglas-Home_d703.html" title="Alec Douglas-Home">Alec Douglas-Home</a>, leader of the Conservative Party. The photographs dated from four years previously: Courtney's first wife, Elizabeth Stokes, had died of a heart attack on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">1 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, and he had a brief affair with Volkova during the British Industrial Exhibition in May. The letters with the photographs accused Courtney's wife of being unfaithful and urged him to resign before there was a public scandal.</p>
<p>Courtney did nothing, and in the first week of August 1965, a further set of letters was sent to other MPs, a factory owner in Courtney's constituency, and to the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i> newspaper (which declined to publish). Courtney had retained contacts with <a href="../../../m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a>, and went to see <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Hollis_30f5.html" title="Roger Hollis">Roger Hollis</a>; MI5 experts thought the photographs had been faked (as did Courtney himself), and presumed a KGB attempt to damage Courtney. The satirical magazine <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Eye_4f62.html" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i> did run the story (although it knew the KGB was behind it), but it was largely kept quiet; however, rumours did circulate in Harrow. He beat off an attempt to deselect him by 454 to 277, but Courtney lost his seat in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1966_2c70.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1966">1966 general election</a>.</p>

<p>Out of Parliament, Courtney sued a Conservative Party official, Sir Theodore Constantine, for slander arising out of a dinner party when Constantine had given his own view of the scandal. He won the case and was awarded £200 damages. However his second marriage was dissolved in 1968 and his business failed. He set up again as the Managing Director of the New English Typewriting School Ltd from 1969. In 1970 he interrupted the trial of former Labour MP <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Owen_2762.html" title="Will Owen">Will Owen</a>, accused of spying for <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, from the public gallery. Courtney married for a third time in 1971.</p>
