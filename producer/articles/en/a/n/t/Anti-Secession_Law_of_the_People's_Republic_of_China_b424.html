<p>Taiwan was formally incorporated into the <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qing_Dynasty_4907.html" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Empire</a> in 1680. It was then ceded by China to Japan in perpetuity in the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Shimonoseki_594e.html" title="Treaty of Shimonoseki">Treaty of Shimonoseki</a> of 1895. At the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, it was then surrendered by Japan in 1945 to the <a href="../../../k/u/o/Kuomintang.html" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> Administration of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a>. After the declaration of the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> in 1949, Taiwan and some neighbouring islands continued to be controlled by <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> forces. In its official view, the People's Republic of China (PRC) government considers <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> to be a province of the People's Republic of China (PRC). According to the PRC argument, the government of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> ceased to be legitimate following its retreat to Taiwan in 1949, and thus all sovereignty and governmental authority in China was automatically transferred to the PRC government, including that over Taiwan which was then under Republic of China's administration. The official Republic of China (ROC) view is that it did not cease to exist in 1949 and has continued to function as a sovereign political entity in Taiwan to the present day, making the relationship between the PRC and ROC similar to that between other partitioned states (such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>). The PRC's position has been acknowledged by most nations, often because of the PRC's <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-China_Policy_cc68.html" title="One-China Policy">One-China Policy</a>, although most nations prefer to take an ambiguous approach on this issue. Some <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> supporters oppose both the PRC's claim to Taiwan and the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_status_of_Taiwan_7059.html" title="Legal status of Taiwan">legality of the Chinese sovereignty</a> over Taiwan.</p>
<p>Multiple opinion polls conducted in Taiwan have indicated that there is very little support for immediate unification on the PRC's terms nor for an immediate declaration of independence<sup id="_ref-Poll06_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Poll06" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Polls have also consistently shown that a large majority of Taiwanese would support discussion of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_reunification.html" title="Chinese reunification">reunification</a> only if the economic and political systems of the two sides of the straits were comparable<sup id="_ref-Poll4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Poll4" title="">[2]</a></sup>. A majority of Taiwanese appear to support the "status quo" but there are different opinions in Taiwanese society, with the PRC, and in the international community over what the status quo is.</p>
<p>The re-election of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Shui-bian_a9be.html" title="Chen Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> to the ROC Presidency<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup>, led many to conclude that there was a growth in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> sentiment and that a new Taiwanese identity is emerging on the island as opposed to identification with China. In the 2004 ROC Legislative Election, the strategy of the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Green_coalition_71bd.html" title="Pan-Green coalition">pan-Green coalition</a> was to try to capitalize on this trend to win a majority in the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan. Among some Taiwanese Independence supporters, it is believed that a <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-green.html" title="Pan-green">pan-green</a> majority could force a crucial referendum for constitutional reform and, perhaps, to further move the island toward de jure independence. Many Taiwanese independence supporters, including former President <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Teng-Hui_b727.html" title="Lee Teng-Hui">Lee Teng-Hui</a>, argued that Taiwan should declare independence before 2008 on the theory that international pressure would prevent the PRC from using force against Taiwan.</p>
<p>These events in late 2004 caused a great deal of alarm in Beijing. Observers indicated that many in Beijing believed that its policies toward Taiwan had failed both because it did not have sufficient incentives to gain Taiwanese public support and at the same time, it seemed that many in Taiwan did not take Beijing's stated threats to use force seriously. The ROC government on Taiwan had defined the status quo such a way that a de jure declaration of independence could be argued to not represent a change in the status quo. Some Chinese believe these events lead to the formulation in 2003 and 2004 of the Anti-Secession Law.</p>
<p>In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> a similar, proposed law had already appeared. Titled <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposed_National_Unification_Promotion_Law_7f7b.html" title="Proposed National Unification Promotion Law">National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>: 中华人民共和国国家统一促进法), it was authored by a Chinese academic Yu Yuanzhou (余元洲), a professor from the <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jianghan_University_236c.html" title="Jianghan University">Jianghan University</a> in <a href="../../../w/u/h/Wuhan.html" title="Wuhan">Wuhan</a> who does not have a formal governmental position, as a suggestion to create formal a legal basis for the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>'s unification with <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. Although no formal legislative action was taken on the document the heavy debate surrounding it and the suggestion that some sort of anti-secession law would be passed was viewed by many in Taiwan as evidence of hostile intent by the PRC government towards <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> supporters.</p>
<p>In December 2004 the ROC Legislative elections, although the ruling DPP party actually increased its share of votes in the legislature and remained the largest single party there, the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-blue_coalition.html" title="Pan-blue coalition">pan-blue coalition</a> maintained a razor-thin majority, which surprised many. However, this result may have been less a reflection of popular sentiment than a testament to the effectiveness of the KMT's more frugal nomination of candidates (116) compared with the DPP's over-nomination of candidates (122) and the KMT's rigid party rules for allotment of votes to its candidates within individual districts.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> This election result ended most prospects of an immediate declaration of independence and also called into question whether there really had been an increase in Taiwanese independence sentiment. Despite this, the PRC proceeded with the drafting of the law. The main reasons given to Western interlocutors was that the PRC leadership believed that its Taiwan policy in the past had been reactive rather than proactive and it was necessary for the PRC to show initiative rather than merely react to events. Furthermore, Beijing expressed residual distrust for Chen Shui-bian. Many Western experts have argued that the PRC's decision-making system was rigid, and that plans put into place to deal with a pan-green victory had simply developed too much momentum to be shut down.</p>
<p>In announcing the drafting of the law in December, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the state press mentioned explicitly that the law was not intended to be applied to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macao.html" title="Macao">Macao</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Secession_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_b424.html" title="Edit section: Content">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Content</span></h2>
<p>The Law is composed of ten articles. Articles one to five are aspirational. Articles six to nine set out in general terms the procedures for promoting cross-strait relations, negotiation, and resolution of the issue. Article ten sets the date of operation.</p>
<p><b>Article one</b> states that the aim of the law is to stop the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> movement from splitting the country, and promote <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_reunification.html" title="Chinese reunification">reunification</a>. Stabilizing the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_Straits_d0fa.html" title="Taiwan Straits">Taiwan Straits</a> area, protecting the interests of the <a href="../../../z/h/o/Zhonghua_Minzu_c664.html" title="Zhonghua Minzu">Zhonghua Minzu</a> are also purposes of the law.</p>
<p><b>Articles two to four</b> outline the PRC government's view of the present <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_status_of_Taiwan_f3d7.html" title="Political status of Taiwan">political status of Taiwan</a>. This view is that the Mainland and Taiwan belong to one China and that there is only one China and that the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of that one China is indivisible; the "Taiwan issue" is a residual problem of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_civil_war.html" title="Chinese civil war">Chinese civil war</a> and is an internal affair of China.</p>
<p><b>Article five</b> maintains that the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_China_principle_f528.html" title="One China principle">one China principle</a> is the basis for resolution of the issue, and that the State must seek all possibilities of peaceful reunification. The same section also states that, following <i>peaceful</i> reunification, Taiwan will enjoy a high level of autonomy and operate under a system different to the mainland. Although this would appear to be similar to the "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_country%2C_two_systems.html" title="One country, two systems">one country, two systems</a>" scheme, highly unpopular in Taiwan, it is not so named. In addition, the law does not explicitly equate <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> with the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> (referred to in the law as "the State").</p>
<p><b>Article six</b> deals with cross-strait relations. It states that in order to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan straits and to foster cross-strait relations, the State should (1) encourage people-to-people contact to foster closer relations and understanding (2) encourage cross strait economic exchanges (3) encourage scientific and cultural exchanges (4) joint efforts to fight crime and (5) encourage efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan straits.</p>
<p><b>Article seven</b> deals with cross-strait negotiation. It states that the State shall support negotiations and consultations on both sides of the straits with equal status, with different modalities, and in differing stages. The topics of such talks can include (1) ending the states of hostilities across the straits (2) developing rules for cross strait relations (3) the means of promoting unification (4) the political status of the Taiwanese authorities, (5) appropriate means by which Taiwan can participate in international organizations, and (6) any other issues relating to unification. There are several notable aspects of this article. First, this is the first time that the PRC has officially spoken of talks between the Mainland and Taiwan occurring in terms of equal status. Second, the condition that Taiwan accept any form of the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_China_principle_f528.html" title="One China principle">one China principle</a> is not explicitly mentioned in the text, and the statement that talks can occur in different modalities and in differing stages suggests that Beijing is willing to start at least informal talks without requiring a one China commitment.</p>
<p><b>Article eight</b> deals with non-peaceful action, and is the article which has caused the most controversy and attention. It states that the State shall use non-peaceful and other necessary means under these alternative conditions: (1) if "Taiwan independence" forces, under whatever name and method, accomplish the fact of Taiwan's separation from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, (2) or if a major event occurs which would lead to Taiwan's separation from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, (3) or if all possibility of peaceful unification is lost.</p>
<p><b>Article nine</b> states that, in the planning and implementation of "non-peaceful and other necessary actions", the State must as much as possible act to protect the persons and property of Taiwanese <i>civilians</i> and foreigners in Taiwan, and to minimise their losses. The State must also protect Taiwanese interests in the PRC.</p>
<p>Under Article 18 of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_Law_of_Hong_Kong_f59d.html" title="Basic Law of Hong Kong">Basic Law of Hong Kong</a> and similar measures in the Basic Law of Macao, the NPCSC must explicitly designate a law as having force in Hong Kong or Macao for it to be operative there. No such designation was made for this law, which is consistent with statement in the state press that this law would not be directed at Hong Kong or Macao.</p>

<p>In December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the Chinese state news agency <a href="../../../x/i/n/Xinhua_News_Agency_58bc.html" title="Xinhua News Agency">Xinhua</a> reported that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_People%27s_Congress_1259.html" title="National People's Congress">National People's Congress</a> in its upcoming session would enact an 'anti-<a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">secession</a> law', without specifying further details.</p>
<p>In a rare moment of agreement, Taiwanese politicians from both the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-green_coalition.html" title="Pan-green coalition">Pan-green coalition</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-blue_coalition.html" title="Pan-blue coalition">Pan-blue coalition</a> have reacted negatively towards this development. Some politicians have proposed that Taiwan enact an 'anti-annexation law' to counter the proposed PRC law. Various opinion polls have revealed that 80% of Taiwan residents oppose such an 'anti-<a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">secession</a> law' and a majority agree that a defensive <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a> should be held in the advance of such a law to protect the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a>.<a href="http://news.yam.com/ettoday/politics/200412/20041231784093.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yam.com/ettoday/politics/200412/20041231784093.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>President <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Shui-bian_a9be.html" title="Chen Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> commented on the 'anti-<a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">secession</a> law' during his 2005 new year speech: "Such actions will not only unilaterally change the status quo of peace in the Taiwan Strait, but will also pose the greatest threat to regional stability and world peace." Whereas PRC President <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Jintao_ccff.html" title="Hu Jintao">Hu Jintao</a> said "We will definitely not allow anyone to separate Taiwan from China by any means." in his New Year’s Eve speech.<a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_2-1-2005_pg4_6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_2-1-2005_pg4_6" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Although the PRC's official English translation of the law is the <i>Anti-Secession Law</i>, which is intended to invoke the actions of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">southern Confederacy</a> during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_Affairs_Council_893e.html" title="Mainland Affairs Council">Mainland Affairs Council</a> on Taiwan has consistently translated it as <i>Anti-Separation law</i> as secession implies that Taiwan is a part of China. The <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_Affairs_Council_893e.html" title="Mainland Affairs Council">Mainland Affairs Council</a> and the government on Taiwan has argued that the relationship across the Taiwan strait is not analogous to the situation during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> since Taiwan was never part of the PRC. This alternate translation is not commonly found in the international media.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> claims that this bill is the PRC's most sincere attempt at resolving the Taiwan issue peacefully (see <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_status_of_Taiwan_f3d7.html" title="Political status of Taiwan">Political status of Taiwan</a>). However, <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei.html" title="Taipei">Taipei</a> points to Article 8 as cause for concern. Shortly after the bill was passed, ROC President <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Shui-bian_a9be.html" title="Chen Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> called for a National Security meeting in Taipei to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>One major topic of controversy between Beijing and Taipei is to what degree the law changes the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a> in the Taiwan straits. Beijing has maintained that the law preserves the status quo and creates no new conditions for the use of force. In contrast, Taipei has argued that the law does change the status quo and gave the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Liberation_Army_1d81.html" title="People's Liberation Army">People's Liberation Army</a> a "blank check" to attack Taiwan.</p>
<p>Prior to the passage of the bill, a statement from Taipei's <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_Affairs_Council_893e.html" title="Mainland Affairs Council">Mainland Affairs Council</a> and a resolution overwhelming passed by the Taiwan legislature stated that the status quo is that the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> is sovereign and independent. The statement and resolution were carefully worded to avoid disagreements between the pan-blue and pan-green coalition over whether the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> has any residual sovereignty over <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">Mainland China</a>.</p>
<p>After the law was passed, the Mainland Affairs Council official referred to Beijing's definition of "one China" in the PRC law as fiction. Most of the statements from Taiwan were carefully worded to prevent escalation of already tense cross strait relations.</p>

<p>Reaction in the PRC was mostly consistent. State media and the Beijing leadership all stood firmly behind the new law and vowed never to allow anyone, using any means, to "separate Taiwan from China", in any name. The Chinese parliament voted in favor of the law 2,896 to zero, with two abstentions. In the run-up to the law's ratification, state media in the PRC accused those in Taiwan in favour of Taiwan independence of creating hostility to the new law and of confusing the Taiwanese into thinking that the law had hostile intent. Prior to passing the law, <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Jintao_ccff.html" title="Hu Jintao">Hu Jintao</a> in a speech outlined a four-point guidline to resolving the issue.</p>

<p>At the time the unification law was proposed by legal scholar Yu Yuanzhou, the press in Hong Kong expressed concern that it would be legislation by stealth the anti-treason or anti-secession provision of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law_Article_23_87d5.html" title="Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23">Basic Law Article 23 legislation</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. These concerns were addressed when a mainland official stated explicitly the law would not be added to Annex III of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_Law_of_Hong_Kong_f59d.html" title="Basic Law of Hong Kong">Basic Law</a>, which means that it would not be applicable to Hong Kong. After the passage of the law in March 2005, there was very little reaction in Hong Kong and news of the law was far overshadowed by the resignation of Hong Kong's chief executive, <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tung_Chee-Hwa_f07d.html" title="Tung Chee-Hwa">Tung Chee-Hwa</a>.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, the passage of the law was condemned by officials and politicians from both of the main political camps including the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-green_coalition.html" title="Pan-green coalition">pan-green coalition</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-blue_coalition.html" title="Pan-blue coalition">pan-blue coalition</a>, although there were differences in the content of the criticism. Supporters of the pan-green coalition tended reacted angrily to the spirit and content of the law as purported infringement of what they saw as Taiwanese sovereignty. By contrast, supporters of the pan-blue coalition, while stating that they opposed the law and the threat of force against Taiwan, called for more dialogue with the PRC and pointed to parts of the law in which Beijing showed hitherto unseen flexibility.</p>
<p>Opinion polls indicated a widespread opposition to the law among the general public. Some questioned whether Beijing has the authority to issue such a law as Taiwan is not under the PRC jurisdiction (See <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_status_of_Taiwan_f3d7.html" title="Political status of Taiwan">Political status of Taiwan</a>). The <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Green_coalition_71bd.html" title="Pan-Green coalition">Pan-Green coalition</a>, in particular, reacted with distaste and there have been calls for an "anti anti-secession law" to be passed by the legislature. However, such a law is unlikely to pass, given that the "pan-blue" control the legislature and that premier <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Hsieh_426e.html" title="Frank Hsieh">Frank Hsieh</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-green_coalition.html" title="Pan-green coalition">pan-green coalition</a> has ruled out officially introducing such legislation. On the other hand, Hsieh pointed out that the PRC law has already infringed the ROC sovereignty and that the situation has compromised ROC sovereignty and thus met the criteria for initiating a "defensive referendum". However, he added that whether a defensive referendum would be invoked is under the discretion of the incumbent ROC president.<a href="http://yam.udn.com/yamnews/daily/2564075.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://yam.udn.com/yamnews/daily/2564075.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>A protest march against the PRC law took place on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a> and it was widely reported that one million Taiwanese participated in the protest. Both the former President <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Teng-hui_9c5e.html" title="Lee Teng-hui">Lee Teng-hui</a> and the incumbent President Chen Shui-bian joined the march. However, Chen Shui-bian announced in advance that he would only attend the march without giving a speech. On the other hand, most politicians from the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-blue_coalition.html" title="Pan-blue coalition">pan-blue coalition</a> did not participate in any protest march, although they claimed that they would not dissuade their supporters from attending if they ever wished. The turnout of the march became a subject of political debate in Taiwan, with the mayor of Taipei city, <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma_Ying-jeou_e416.html" title="Ma Ying-jeou">Ma Ying-jeou</a>, downplaying the participant number to around 270,000, while the march organizers claiming the goal of one million participants was reached.</p>
