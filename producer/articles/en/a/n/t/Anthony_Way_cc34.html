<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Way_cc34.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Way was born in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, and was a chorister by the age of eight. His father worked as an officer at <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormwood_Scrubs_%28HM_Prison%29_b1cf.html" title="Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)">Wormwood Scrubs prison</a>. In 1990, the prison chaplain, the Rev. Ray Guymer, suggested to Way's father that young Anthony should go for a voice trial at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Paul%27s_Cathedral_6064.html" title="St. Paul's Cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</a>. Anthony passed the audition and was given a place at the Cathedral Choir School and at the age of nine.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve, he received attention for his portrayal of Henry Ashworth in the lavish 1995 <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> mini-series based on the <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Trollope_0964.html" title="Joanna Trollope">Joanna Trollope</a> novel 'The Choir' as a gifted young chorister whose voice saved a cathedral and its choir. The series comprised five one-hour episodes, and has since aired on America's PBS Network.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Anthony was the prominent voice on 'The Choir' soundtrack, and was backed by the Gloucester Cathedral Choir and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Philharmonic_Orchestra_306d.html" title="Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra">Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. Released by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygram.html" title="Polygram">Polygram</a> label "<a href="../../../d/e/c/Decca_Records_8e99.html" title="Decca Records">Decca</a>", the recording went <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum_record.html" title="Platinum record">platinum</a>, selling 350,000 copies worldwide and spent 15 weeks at the top of the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_classical_chart_5e4f.html" title="UK classical chart">UK classical chart</a>. It was notably the fastest selling classical release since <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Three_Tenors_0902.html" title="The Three Tenors">The Three Tenors</a> five years previously. Meanwhile in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Singles_Chart_3b11.html" title="UK Singles Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> the album secured a No 3 spot, squeezing out <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. (The <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> of the series was eventually released in March 2006, shortly after "The Choirboys" debut album became the fastest selling classical debut album ever).</p>
<p>In 1995, his record label released "The Choirboy," an amalgamation of classic and contemporary songs which was excluded from the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_classical_chart_5e4f.html" title="UK classical chart">UK classical charts</a>. A court battle then ensued between Anthony's record label and the Classic Chart compilers that resulted in huge media controversy and saw Anthony splashed across the national press, propelling the album to gold status and taking total album sales to half a million. The chart compilers soon thereafter started a new classical crossover chart (in January 1996). From this album also came the hit singles "<a href="../../../p/a/n/Panis_Angelicus_b736.html" title="Panis Angelicus">Panis Angelicus</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord%27s_Prayer_1b98.html" title="The Lord's Prayer">The Lord's Prayer</a>" which both went <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum_record.html" title="Platinum record">gold or platinum</a> within a short time of their release.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1995, Way and the choir played an important part in the "<a href="../../../v/e/_/VE_Day_06de.html" title="VE Day">VE Day</a> 50" celebrations: Firstly, St. Paul's Cathedral hosted the National Service of Thanksgiving that was broadcast live on British television; the day after in London's Hyde Park, the youngster confidently performed "Panis Angelicus" in front of an estimated crowd of 150,000 people including <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">HM The Queen</a> and the rest of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Royal_Family_853c.html" title="British Royal Family">Royal Family</a>. The event was broadcast live to millions of people on television worldwide and introduced the boy to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1996, Anthony had risen to Deputy Head Chorister at St. Paul's. The choir was given the honour of serenading <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon_de74.html" title="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon">HM Queen Elizabeth</a> the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Mother_eade.html" title="Queen Mother">Queen Mother</a> on her 96th Birthday.</p>
<p>Way recorded "The Choirboy's Christmas" with the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Chamber_Orchestra_df10.html" title="English Chamber Orchestra">English Chamber Orchestra</a>, released in November 1997. This album was recorded in London's famous <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Church_69bf.html" title="Temple Church">Temple Church</a>, where chorister <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Lough_3316.html" title="Ernest Lough">Ernest Lough</a> had recorded his version of "O For the Wings of a Dove" more than sixty years earlier, in 1929. It was reported that Decca spent an initial advertising budget of £300,000 in the run up to Christmas to promote his new album. By the following Easter, the album had sold over 60,000 copies.</p>
<p>The choir also recorded two other albums at this time, "How Can I Keep From Singing?" and "Passiontide at St. Paul's" both of which featured a number of soloists, including Anthony on one track.</p>
<p>He went to <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppingham_School_5bef.html" title="Uppingham School">Uppingham School</a> on a music scholarship, and in 1997 saw his last album release as a treble with its Choir, during which time he continued to be in heavy demand for performances. On the release of his "Wings of a Dove", it entered the UK Classical music chart at No 3.</p>
<p>In May of that year, maturity took its toll on his signature treble voice forever. His final few concerts saw him perform in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_College_19af.html" title="Kings College">Kings College</a> Chapel, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and at the home of the English Sinfonia in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevenage.html" title="Stevenage">Stevenage</a>, where he performed tracks live from the album for the very last time alongside his old friend and "Choirgirl of the Year 1995", Tabitha Watling. To mark his retirement as a treble soloist, Decca Records released "The Best of Anthony Way" in 1998.</p>
<p>He has since starred as Tom Long in 2000's film version of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom%27s_Midnight_Garden_2d49.html" title="Tom's Midnight Garden">Tom's Midnight Garden</a>, alongside <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greta_Scacchi_557e.html" title="Greta Scacchi">Greta Scacchi</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wilby_b58c.html" title="James Wilby">James Wilby</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Plowright_8d4e.html" title="Joan Plowright">Joan Plowright</a>, filmed in the summer of 1997 on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>. The film won considerable critical acclaim on its release at the <a href="../../../g/i/f/Giffoni_Film_Festival_8876.html" title="Giffoni Film Festival">Giffoni Film Festival</a> in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>.</p>
<p>From 1999 to 2001 Anthony spent two years at Peterborough College studying music. He then went on to play drums for a Peterborough-based punk band called "Upshot" that folded in 2003. He is presently living in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, playing drums and recording and composing new acoustic material.</p>
