<p>he was the Returning Officer for the tina molinari campaign, on behalf of the Ontario PC party?</p>
<p>am I correct?</p>
<p>He was the returning officer for the provincial election in the thornhill riding not for the PC party. Check out this and scroll down to thornhill it shows (liberal) Mario Racco was elected and Anthoney Reale was the returning officer</p>

<p>Someone keeps changing the wiki article. It is somewhat biased, in favor of Reale, and does not mention that he no longer resides in the riding, was aqquited only for lack of evidence, and that he is not a star candidate</p>
<p>Theonlyedge STOP your vandalism of this article, you keep posting up false info. It will be changed back everytime.--64.228.149.108 04:43, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The following are the answers to the anonymous (I think from theonlyedge) questions. You mention the article being biased, in favor of Reale. If anything it is biased against Reale. The misunderstanding between Reale and Racco is nothing more that a misunderstanding that was proven in court and really in my opinion shouldnâ€™t even be in the article but I have not and will not change it if every one else thinks it should be here. Reale is a star candidate that is why all the other people that wanted the nomination decided to not challenge Reale. Reale is a former city councillor in this riding. --Eyeonvaughan 07:03, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>No, Reale is not a star candidate. He has been pretty well unempoleyed for two years, and doesn't even live in Thornhill. The other candidates were just <i>considering</i> running, but they eventually decided not too. A star candidate is someone with cabnet potential.</p>

<ul>
<li>The article should only contain verifiable NPOV information. If Reale is a "star" candidate, then source the claim. Similarly, the allegation that he is a shoe-in to be a member of a federal Conservative cabinet should be sourced. And, frankly, it is unclear why someone insists on caps on zoning by-laws and property development, since neither term should be capitalized. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:44, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The slanderous info. about a so called altercation that happend over 15 years is not verifiable but you feel it still should be posted. Some one put up a link to an old Toronto Star article claiming it mentions about this altercation but look at it for yourself it has nothing about it. I looked in to it myself although it wasn't even a big deal back in 1988, Reale and later Mario Racco admitted that the charges were dropped because it was proven in court that it was in self defence. All the information that I posted is verifiable. Reale did not launch his campaigne on Dec. 1 he was acclaimed as the candidate at a special meeting on that day and launched his campaign a few weeks later. Do your research on the Thornhill riding, the Liberal PArty does not even expect to win this ridng anymore. In terms of caps on zoning by-laws and property development that was done unintentionally with I reverted the complete article and it was orignally posted that way.--Eyeonvaughan 05:32, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the case of the assault NO verifiable source was stated, check the link that someone put up it has nothing to do with the assualt or for that matter does not even mention any names in this article. I posted all my sources through links to other articles, take some time to read them. In terms of the returning officer as someone slanderously tried to make it sound that he was not a returning officer for the Pro. election, I provided a source when chages were made against this and was taken as fact that he was not with no source. Why do you and a few others think you can post fase and slanderous info. with no source but expect everyone else to provides sources for every little thing that is common knowledge in the thornhill area?--Eyeonvaughan 05:49, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've temporarily protected the article, let's try to work together to create an article we can both agree with. Please cite any sections in the present version you believe are incorrect. I would like to see some evidence that Reale is a "star candidate", that he is predicted to make cabinet, and that the others interested in the nomination backed down purely because of his abilities. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 06:13, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>sounds good to me, I would rather work togehter. I live in this riding, and know whats going on here. When I am questioned about say for example about adding star candidate, that is why I explained it in more detail in the article about others that were interested in being the candidate but backed down when Reale was interested in the being the candidate. I can not find a media report or source that is posted on the internet to link this. But if this is the only reason why it shouldn't be posted then everything that cannot be backed with a source should not be posted including the assault. I am not saying the assualt didn't happen but it cannot be backed with a source. The assualt did happen but it wasn't even a big deal back in 1988 let alone now. This has been brought up again from the Susan Kadis campaign team because they realize that they are mostlikely going to lose this election and are trying to run a slander campaign against Reale as a last resort.--Eyeonvaughan 06:33, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> requires verifiable sources for all facts, so yes unless you can present some media coverage of the nomination that information cannot be in the article. There are two different articles listed in the references that discuss the assault. These can easily be found on Proquest, and pretty much anyone in Canada with a library card has access to that archive. If you have a Vaughan library card, you can check the archive <a href="http://www.vaughanpl.com/find/databases.php" class="external text" title="http://www.vaughanpl.com/find/databases.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 06:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just did an internet search to see if I could find anything, here are a couple of sources that are comments from the public about the Thorhill riding. <a href="http://www.electionprediction.org/2005_fed/riding/35089-thornhill.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.electionprediction.org/2005_fed/riding/35089-thornhill.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.electionprediction.org/2005_fed/riding/35089-thornhill.htm</a> <a href="http://www.electionforecast.ca/ON/Thornhill.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.electionforecast.ca/ON/Thornhill.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.electionforecast.ca/ON/Thornhill.htm</a> --Eyeonvaughan 06:42, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Election prediction ranks a little below a blog in its reliability, anyone can post pretty much anything there, and it is dominated by clueless partisans. Look at the <a href="http://www.electionprediction.org/2004_fed/riding/35089-thornhill.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.electionprediction.org/2004_fed/riding/35089-thornhill.htm" rel="nofollow">2004 discussion</a> of Thornhill, for instance, where there was just as much talk about a Conservative victory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My own searches have found that Reale has been quite invisible, no mention in local newspapers in over a decade, 0 hits on Google news, and a <a href="http://marlonelectionanalysis.blogspot.com/2005/12/well-well-well.html" class="external text" title="http://marlonelectionanalysis.blogspot.com/2005/12/well-well-well.html" rel="nofollow">lone blog post</a> discussing how little known he is. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 06:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Do your research on the Thornhill riding, the Liberal PArty does not even expect to win this ridng anymore." You really must be naive to think that or your a Conservative supporter who thinks the Liberal party doesn't think they can retain the riding. Stop putting false facts. 70.31.239.70 17:42, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Theonlyedge: The Liberals are clearly set to win the riding, as Susan Kadis beat Josh Cooper by over a 20 percent margin in 2004, and now she is the incumbent. I think its fair to remove the 'sta' candidate part for Reale, as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>FYI, in case anyone is interested, Anthony's website is now up at <a href="http://www.anthonyreale.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.anthonyreale.ca" rel="nofollow">Political website</a> (my company does his site), and both he and his campaign manager, Peter, are available in case anyone wants to pose him some of the above questions. ALSO, Dan Samson stepped aside for personal reasons prior to Anthony entering the picture. In personal conversations with party insiders (members of the riding association board of directors as well as more than one organizer of the Federal CP), it appears that they do indeed consider Mr Reale to be a strong contender, and the riding association pushed heavily to get him the appointment. How well he will do will just have to play out in the polls. J.R. Lichtman 15:41, 2 January 2005 (EST)</p>

<p>Since it has been brought to my attention that my name is being used in Anthony Reale's Wiki entry, here is all you need to know:</p>
<p>1) I won the nomination on first ballot with a simple majority (over 50%) Anthony finished last.</p>
<p>2) After Belinda saved Martin's bacon on May 19th, the spring election was off. I moved with my wife to London, ON in late summer to allow her to pursue professional opportunities. In September, I resigned the nomination to allow the riding to find someone locally. This decision was my own, without any pressure from the party.</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies.

<p>I think that the proposal to merge the article into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_candidates%2C_2006_Canadian_federal_election_39db.html" title="Conservative Party candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election">Conservative Party candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election</a> makes good sense. The subject is none too notable, but partook in a notable event. It is looking likely that the vote to merge Andrea Payne's article will be carried, and this proposal would be an consistent with other losers (unless they were independently worthy of an article). I have already worked the contents into that article. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:13, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
