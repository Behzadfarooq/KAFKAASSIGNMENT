<p>The Pakistan Narcotics Board (PNB) was established in the Revenue Division in 1957 to fulfil Pakistan s obligations under the International Opium Convention of 1925. The Pakistan Narcotics Board consisted of representatives from the provincial governments and some federal ministries and divisions. Pakistan ratified the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 on August 15, 1965. To meet its obligations under the said Convention, the government, through a declaration dated March 8, 1973, renamed Pakistan Narcotics Board as the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board (PNCB).</p>
<p>The Anti Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) was established in December 1991. In February 1995, PNCB and Anti Narcotics Task Force were merged to constitute the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), which is now the Premier Law Enforcement Agency in the field of narcotics control. The ANF is assigned to:</p>
<p><br />
Streamline coordination procedures among law enforcement agencies for the implementation of international obligations.</p>
<p>Make earnest endeavours to attain a drug-free society. Translate the government s objectives into reality on issues pertaining to narcotics control. At present, ANF is operating with around 1,500 personnel as against an authorized strength of 2,552. Other organizations associated with narcotics control are: Airports Security Force, Pakistan Coast Guards, Customs, Provincial Excise and Taxation, Frontier Corps (NWFP and Balochistan), Frontier Constabulary, Pakistan Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), Political Levies/Khasadar Force, Provincial Police (NWFP Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan) and Pakistan Railways Police.</p>
<p>Under the Ministry of Interior, a separate division - the Narcotics Control Division was established in 1989 to exclusively deal with drug-related matters.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Policy Review Board</b></p>
<p>To monitor the policies of Federal Government a Policy Review Board headed by Minister for Narcotics Control comprising 14 members from relevant Federal and Provincial Ministries was setup in 1997. Since a separate ministry for Narcotics Control has been setup therefore there is a need to revise the composition of this body. Existing composition of the Policy Review Board is as follows</p>

<p>The past three decades have witnessed massive proliferation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in Pakistan. The government has instituted a series of measures to address the situation. However, the formulation of a comprehensive drug abuse control strategy demanded a realistic assessment of the scope of the problem.</p>
<p>The country s first National Survey on Drug Abuse (NSDA) was conducted in 1982. Its findings not only indicated a significant increase in the use of heroin in Pakistan but also predicted a similar trend for the future. Subsequent NSDAs were conducted in 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1993. All these surveys pointed towards a considerable increase in drug abuse.The government, held its last NSDAwith the assistance of the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), with the name of National Drug Abuse Assessment Study 2000-2001.</p>
<p>The assessment study consists of three data collection studies namely, Key Informant, Treatment Registry and Four-Cities Study. Each of the studies can be treated as independent research. At the same time, however, it allows a comparison of indicated patterns from across the entire country by virtue of the statistical assumption that what applies to known data (i.e., actual geographical locales studied in detail), would also apply to similar locales (not studied in detail).</p>
<p>The study is geared to estimate the total population of hardcore heroin users, including intravenous drug users. For other drug types, increasing and decreasing trends and patterns have been assessed. The study s scope was ascertained in keeping with budgetary allocations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is an assessment study and not a survey as the estimates do not include drug use by household women, workplace, skilled and unskilled workers, students, transporters and recreational users.</p>
<p><b>Findings of the Study-Highlights</b></p>
<p><b>Prevalence</b> Among males in the age bracket of 15-45 years, there are 500,000 regular heroin users and drug injectors - an alarmingly high rate by international standards.</p>
<p><b>Major Drugs of Abuse</b> Cannabis, in one form or the other (marijuana, charas, etc), is the most commonly used drug in Pakistan in terms of lifetime use and prevalence, followed by heroin, alcohol and psychotropic substances.</p>
<p><b>Rural/Urban</b> Charas/hashish is equally popular in urban and rural areas. Heroin abuse, however, is conspicuous as more of an urban phenomenon.</p>
<p><b>Literacy and Employment Rates</b> Heroin abusers, on the average, have six years of education. Of the total number of heroin users, 43% are unemployed and 26% are engaged in full-time employment.</p>
<p><b>Age Group</b> An examination of social and demographic factors reveals that 40% of the heroin abusers fall in the age bracket of 25-34 years.</p>
<p><b>Occupation</b> Occupational grouping indicates that the frequency of drug abuse is highest among people belonging to the skilled and unskilled labour categories (47%), followed by business persons (16%), agricultural workers (5%) and students (3%).</p>
<p><b>Means of Financial Support</b> Among drug users, 22% sustain themselves through casual work, 18% enjoy family support, 16% are beggars, 13% are drug peddlers, and 11% resort to petty thefts and pick-pocketing.</p>
<p>'<i><b>Gender'</b></i> For most drug types, abuse is not as common and pervasive among women as it is among the male population. Psychotropic substances are the most common drugs of abuse among women. It has also been found that women comprise only 3% of the total number of patients being reported, making it an important area for intensive research.</p>
<p><b>Problems Associated with Drug Abuse</b> In all provinces (both urban and rural locales), heroin has been identified as the drug predominantly responsible for creating unrest in the society. Alcohol has been rated at number two. Whilst cannabis is the most commonly used drug in all areas, respondents do not necessarily perceive it as a cause of social upheaval. However, in some areas, cannabis-related troubles have been reported.</p>
<p><b>Current Drug Use</b> Among heroin users, 77% report using the drug on a daily basis. As for hashish/charas, 41% use it on a daily basis and 34% occasionally. Alcohol consumption remains more varied. However, most of the respondents (76%) report consuming alcohol twice or thrice a week or less, with only 10% reporting consumption for five or more days a week. Other significant drugs include opium and tranquilizers, which are currently being used by a quarter of all respondents. A majority of the hardcore drug abusers consists of multiple drug consumers - a fairly common phenomenon throughout the world.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Administration</b> As many as 73% of the total heroin users either smoke the drug or inhale its fumes while 11% sniff it and 15% inject it. Injecting drug use is accompanied by high incidence of practices associated with the spread of blood-borne infections.</p>
<p><b>Treatment and Rehabilitation</b> As for treatment and rehabilitation, 64% of the respondents report difficulties in getting treatment. For an overwhelming majority (80%), treatment is unaffordable. Lack of in-patient facilities in government hospitals is cited as the major deterrent for treatment by 23% of the respondents. Forty-four percent have received treatment for a drug problem at some stage in their lives. Ninty six percent have been treated for heroin addiction. Most of the addicts did not receive intensive or sustained therapy.</p>
<p><b>Prison Contact</b> Thirty-five percent of the respondents are reported to have spent some time in prison for their alleged involvement in a drug-related offence</p>
