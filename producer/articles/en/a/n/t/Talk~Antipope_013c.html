<p>Questions: Is the title of antipope a derogatory title? Did any one pope call himself "antipope" or is the prefix anti- added in retrospect to uphold the illusion of an unbroken papal succession? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrikM_8f4a.html" title="User:FredrikM">FredrikM</a> 12:48, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmmm. I don't know the answer to this question: do antipopes have to be people irregularly elected by otherwise legitimate electors? Because if so that would explain why there hasn't been one since the 15th century (the Cardinals are behaving more regularly) and why there were so many early on (the whole clergy of the city of Rome had some say in the matter, if not exactly a vote, and could mobilize mobs). It would also expalin why sedevacantist groups don't have antipopes - none of them has ever gotten a cardinal in the first place, so they have to just proclaim themselves pope. I dunno. This sounds reasonable, but I can't find anything in print or online to support it, and I'm too lazy to make a special trip to the library over it. --MichaelTinkler</p>
<hr />
<p>I would think at the very least an antipope needs wide acceptance -- I think some of the medieveal antipopes had large political support -- and I think in some cases competiting temporal powers would each support different claimants to be Pope, as in the great schism (the one where there were three popes, not the one that split east and west). The 'popes' of modern sedevacantists, by comparison, have no large scale following, political or religious. Their following and influence is absolutely miniscule in comparison to the that of the official Pope, unlike medieveal antipopes whose following often could at least begin to rival the official ones. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">Simon J Kissane</a></p>
<p>While your speculations about some of the medieval Antipopes is correct, the idea that wide acceptance is required isn't very useful. Some of the early 'Antipopes' had little or no influence, in fact some of them have only been 'discovered' in relatively modern times through scholarship (e.g. Felix II). That is to say, that some of them were so insignificant that their titles and names have been confused with others. Surely, the Roman Catholic Church is the only arbiter of who is and who is not a 'Pope' and thusly, who is an 'Antipope'. Some of the modern sedevacantist 'Popes' would have a larger following numerically than did Antipopes from the early or high middle ages. Further, I don't think a separate entry is justified for the modern sedevacantists, and therefore this article is the most reasonable place to have them listed for readers who are seeking information about them. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 18:42, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it would be nice to order in some way this page, eg section for each schism and subsection for each branch of the schism. --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnn_O%27nyme_6af0.html" title="User:Ann O'nyme">Ann O'nyme</a> 01:34, 29 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hereby declaire myself pope. Everyone kiss my ring.</p>

<hr />
<p>I would argue ANYONE who claims to be pope, but wasn't elected validly is an antipope, since it only means someone who claims to be pope but isn't. As wo whether or not someone should be listed, that is a different question. Davescj 16:51, 8 December 2005 (UTC) 16:50, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I have removed the listing of who are considered 'Antipopes' by the sedevacantists themselves. While on the surface this may seem like a good addition to the article, it is impossible to know which sedevacantists acknowledge which popes without considerable more research into each of these obscure sects. Further, the detailed aspects of such sects properly belong in their own articles. Even though I am a main contributor to this article, I am beginning to feel as though the discussion of obscure antipopes is beginning to overtake the scope of the article as a whole, and too much discussion of them on the main page must be curtailed. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:42, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something's wrong with the Sedevacantist numbering. We have two Antipope Gregory XVIIs, then jump to Antipope Gregory XIX. It would seem that the second XVII should be XVIII, except that the article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipope_Gregory_XVII_0491.html" title="Antipope Gregory XVII">Antipope Gregory XVII</a> matches with that person's name.

<p>There are two modern antipopes who have styled themselves "Gregory XVII" - they are from two separate groups which have broken with Rome. It is unclear who Reinaldus Michael Benjamins would consider to be popes Gregory XVII and Gregory XVIII, but he does not recognize either of the groups in Quebec or Spain. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:08, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article contained the following sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sedevacantist antipopes frequently refer to the conventional successors of Pope Pius XII as a series of antipapacies, though never in the Church's history has an Antipope opposed a sede vacante.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I deleted the part after the comma. Here are my reasons.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> If this is supposed to mean that there has <i>never</i> been a time that an antipope has coexisted with an empty seat, that's totally false. For example, in the great schism, every time the Roman pope died there was an empty seat until the next Roman pope was elected; during this time there was an antipope in Avignon. Similarly, if you accept that JP2 was a valid pope, then today there are half a dozen antipopes opposing a vacant seat.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> If this merely means that there has never been an <i>extended</i> period where the Roman seat was vacant, then that's begging the question: sedevacantism is, by definition, the claim that we are in exactly such an extended period. (As an orthodox Catholic myself I recognize JP2 as the valid pope, and I think Wikipedia articles in general should treat him as the pope, but in articles about sedevacantism it would violate NPOV to treat JP2's pope status as simple fact.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a> 06:40, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think there is some confusion about the nature of the modern use of on the one hand <i>Sedevacantism</i>, and the status of the Holy See formally being in a <i>Sede Vacante</i> state. <i>Sedevacantism</i> is NOT, as you put it, that we are in an extended period by definition. Rather, it is the claim that the Holy See is vacant because of the invalidity of John XXIII, Paul VI and/or their successors, NOT because the Sedevacantists reject the election of these Popes (although there may now be claims to retroactively reject their elections), but rather because these Popes are 'heretics' in the opinion of the Sedevacantists due to innovation and support of Vatican II reforms. In other words, the Holy See being in a canonical state of <i>Sede Vacante</i> has little, if anything, to do with <i>Sedevacantism</i> as a movement.</p>
<p>With respect to whether or not JPII was the Pope - he is. This is NOT a NPOV issue, because the Roman Catholic Church is a definable thing from an objective standpoint. The Sedevacanists are simply do NOT constitute the Roman Catholic Church in secular law or any other except in some cases, perhaps, their own documents - but even these are required for legal purposes to bear other names ie. "The True Catholic Church", et al. Unlike the medieval and renaissance AntiPopes, there is no question that for any legal purposes, whether that be Church or Secular law, the Sedevacantist bodies do not constitute the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>I have reverted these clarifications because they are just plum incorrect. An antipope is not one who necessarily disputes the results of a papal election. It is clearly stated in the article that it was many times impossible to determine at the time whether or not an historical antipope would later be disavowed by the church or not. The old wording was much clearer in terms of an appropriate definition of an antipope.</p>

<p>This antipope is listed in a number of places on the web by various sites which watch for antipopes. I can provide a list of them if necessary. It must be recognized that almost every contemporary "antipope" could be qualified for deletion or changed to notable vanities, even those that have been covered by the press such as Micheal Bawden or Manuel Alonso Corral. By their VERY NATURE, modern antipopes are obscure, self-promoting and of interest only as novelties and to obscurantist historians and cult-watchers. While a quick VFD for a page on Dimech makes perfect sense, the listing of any of these antipopes on a page about anitpopes is most suitable, as it well may be one of the few collections of such names that have *any* reference checking done whatsoever. If Mr. Dimech from Malta is to be removed from the listings here, then most, if not all of the listings here should be removed as well.

<p>Just an inquiry, would you consider a sedevacantist antipope of equal status to an antipope in middle ages who have a large following and has the pretension to be the real pope of the Catholic Church? If so listing the sedevacantist along with the real antipopes of the past does indicate that they have equal authority or support as much as the real pope (like Benedict XVI). I think someone should seperate this article into a new page as it giving a false impression -especially to those who know Catholicism and its leaders! -Ed</p>
<p>Some of this issue was discussed above, but it apparently requires some revisiting. First of all, the statement "listing the sedevacantist along with the real antipopes of the past does indicate that they have equal authority or support as much as the real pope" is a patently nonsensical argument. By virtue of being an "antipope" one inherently does NOT have 'equal authority or support' as the real Pope. As I pointed out in an earlier discussion above on this very issue, some of the early 'Antipopes' had little or no influence, in fact some of them have only been 'discovered' in relatively modern times through scholarship (e.g. Felix II). There are some Modern 'Antipopes' whose influence is considerably greater than some of the classically numbered antipopes, most notably those antipopes of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmarian_Catholic_Church_1db9.html" title="Palmarian Catholic Church">Palmarian Catholic Church</a> and the Reformed Church of Christ/Apostles of Infinite Love. What is more, modern antipopes, whether labelled such officially, semi-officially or by default by the Church are not usually called "Sedevacantist Antipopes" by the Church, or in the press, but are typically styled simply as "antipope". It is confusing and misleading to have a separate article that somehow divides historical antipopes (who may or may not have had a wide political influence or following) from modern antipopes (who may or may not have a wide influence or following). The obvious function of this article is to do exactly what it does at present: provide a short description of what exactly an 'antipope' is, as well as a listing of antipopes for further research/reading. If your argument that this article should be reserved for 'influential' antipopes only, I would argue that a number of historical antipopes have little or no influence or following whatsoever (notably Felix II and Phillip) and if the standard of inclusion in an article on "Antipopes" is what you are suggesting, then these should be excluded. Obviously this is a page about "Antipopes", not "Historical Antipopes" or "Inflential Antipopes" or "Antipopes who have 'equal authority or support as the real popes'" or "Antipopes who are known to those who think they 'know Catholicism and its leaders'". An antipope is an antipope is an antipope, irrespective of how much support or publicity he has or has had in the past. Sedevacantism (and thusly it's antipopes) as a reaction to Vatican II and other Pauline reforms is <b>far</b> more significant in the history of Catholicism than Felix II (who didn't even "exist" until recently) or Phillip (who reigned for an entire day) or Dioscorus (who managed a stunningly influential and "authoritative" 22 day reign) - even in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church (witnessed by pastoral letters and excommunications against Sedevacantists and their leaders). --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:41, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, previous discussion in various VfD/AfD was to include less notable antipopes in list format under this article rather than in their own article. Second, the repetition of Manuel Corral in your novel idea of having a section for Antipopes named Peter II is unnecessary. The antipopes listed here are not a series of asylum inmates, but (largely, anyway) verifiable conclavist claimants to the Papacy. I have devoted a fair amount of time to at least establishing that these individuals exist and you are simply deleting for some unknown, unexplained reason (possibly because you "know azylums [sic] full of apopes" - whatever that means). A heading for popes named Peter II is an absurd heading, these popes belong with other conclavists who are claimants to the Holy See. It is obviously less useful to group them by name, as we do not do this with any other Antipopes.

You have to realize that while unquestionable notable, antipopes are nonetheless obscure, to a certain extent. Many are shameless self-promoters, and it is easy to dismiss the whole lot of them as a bunch of quacks - but the fact is that combined these sedevancatists now have literally tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of follows (I haven't yet included a section for Pope Ahitler in Kenya who has a peculiarly large movement) and their activities are obviously shady. Nonetheless, for the vast majority of these antipopes, there is plenty of external evidence. I do have one reference on Raymond Dimech and the so-called "Schimastic Catholic Church" but it is not on the web. I am curently looking further into these claims. Frankly, all of the other anitpopes listed are well documented through a little bit of Google-searching (although admittedly, one has to be able to read and/or translate Italian, Spanish or Portuguese for many of the articles - obviouslt many of these antipopes are from Italy, Spain, etc. so much of the primary source information will not be in English). I should also mention there are a number of verifiable antipopes who are not listed here because they are so obscure that their real names are not even public.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:01, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In order for somebody to be mentioned, it is essential their existence be verifiable. For some reason there are no citations in this article. I think the removal of many modern-day "antipopes" is easily called for. It's the editor who adds the entry, or wishes it to remain, who has that obligation to do the research in such a case. Also, even when somebody is proven to exist, and have made the claim to be a pope, that by itself, doesn't prove any signficance. They must have some following, or have had some impact on somebody, before they're worth mentioning. An article discussing the disputed 2000 election in the US, would mention Gore's initial claim to have won, but it wouldn't discuss some unknown guy's claim that he was the real president of the US.

<dd>"Most people lookung up Antipopes expect to find the historical antipopes here." - This is just your own speculation. How on earth can you possibly determine what "most people" are expecting to find in this article? Your statement about "cult leader" is just plain wrong. Please show <b>any</b> reference in the press where a sedevacantist pope is called a "cult leader". I have never encountered a reference like this (with the exception of perhaps Ahitler's group in Kenya or The Apostles of Infinite Love), and I have researched and written published articles about various Sedevacantist and other Traditional Catholic groups for years. The Church does not refer to these individual as "cult leaders", but rather as "antipopes". Every mention I have ever seen of the sedevacantists in either print media or in rare occasions they receive television news coverage have referred to them as "antipope" or politely steered clear and just called them "pope" (in quotations). As I have stated above, the sedevacantists are every bit as much Antipopes as are the historical antipopes, both canonically speaking, and in fact. Some of the modern antipopes are far more significant in their "reigns" than many of the historical antipopes - to seperate them to a different article makes no sense whatsoever, in my opinion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 15:22, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It absolutely is speculation. Sedevacantism is part of a large, international Traditionalist Catholic movement (or movements) with hundreds of thousands of adherents and sympathizers - both within and outside of the Roman Catholic Church. I am not a sedevacantist, but they view themselves as a legitimate expression of Catholicism and simply dismissing them as "crackpots of no significance" demonstrates a clear ignorance of the scale and scope of traditionalist Catholic movements and the impact they have had (and continue) to have on the Church (not to mention being extremely perjorative). I am sure that to many Catholics (and others), Jehovah's Witnesses are just as much "crackpots" as the Palmarians. To suggest that the Palmar de Troya movement, and other movements growing from dissatsifaction with the changes of Vatican II are of "no significance" and conversely claiming that almost completely non-notable historical personages such as Antipope Felix II or Antipope Phillip are "serious history" fails to recognize even the most basic relative importance of modern antipopes. Further, and most significantly (as I have already tried to point out) the sedevacantists are "Antipopes" and the Church canonically recognizes them as such. They aren't "cult leaders" or "crackpots" - they are "Antipopes" and any of them (except the completely non-notable) are of interest to people who may be reading or researching the subject of antipopes. The obvious function of this article is to do exactly what it does at present: provide a short description of what exactly an 'antipope' is, as well as a listing of antipopes for further research/reading. Given that these modern antipopes have received a modicum of interest from both the print media and the television media (including interviews with "Pope" Michael of Kansas, and several books having been written which include research into the Palmarian Catholic Church), I would suggest that for many people their first exposure to the very idea of "antipopes" will be through the media reports of this nature. To assume that wikipedia readers are coming to this article for "serious history" only is elitist, and presumptive. The issue is whether the article should be split or not - I see absolutely no need to split off an already small article in order to relegate it somewhere the information that at least <b>some</b> readers will be looking for when they search for antipopes using the encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 17:30, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, before deciding what should be split, what's needed is sources to verify each and every modern anti-pope exists, and has at least some followers/beleivers, to be considered notable. Those citations must be put in the article itself (not just argued here). Those that can't be verified, can then be deleted.

<dd>Almost all of the Antipopes now listed are verified, either in their own articles or elsewhere, although some of the claimants using the appellation "Peter II" are certainly less documented (one of them I haven't even heard of). Adding the citations to the article is a housekeeping measure that has little to do with the issue of the merits of splitting the article.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 14:57, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The very definition of Antipope is: <i>An antipope is one whose claim to being Pope is the result of a disputed or contested election.</i> . Also note: <i>It would not necessarily have been evident, during periods when two (or three) rival claimants existed, which was the antipope, and which was the pope, and the clear-cut distinctions made between them in retrospect can give a false sense that certainty existed among their contemporaries.</i>. So, traditionally and as correctly defined in our very article, antipopes are the result of <i>factional struggles</i> in the Roman Catholic Church and usually had significant support, hold control of at least some of the organisation and its resources. Quite contrary to people <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmarian_Catholic_Church_1db9.html" title="Palmarian Catholic Church">having a vision of Virgin Mary</a> or people <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Konrad_Schuckardt_f860.html" title="Francis Konrad Schuckardt">who never publicly made this claim</a>. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 23:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The elections of Pope Michael, Manuel Corral, Lucien Pulvermacher are elections which are "disputed" by mainstream Catholics and the Church itself, I am quite sure. I am not sure where you get the idea that Schuckardt never publically made the claim to be Pope, he did so just prior to his expulsion from the CMRI. Further, using the definition in a hard and fast way is nonsensical, particuarly if the idea is to exclusivize this article to the historical antipopes. Not all of the 42 historical antipopes meet all or indeed in some cases <b>ANY</b> of the criteria you have listed. Some were never elected, quite a number did not have "significant support", held little, if any control over organization and resources. Frankly, some of the historical antipopes are not even results of <i>factional struggles</i>. The very existence of these sedevacantist antipopes is in fact a <i>factional struggle</i> which has emerged since Vatican II. Traditionalist Catholics and their sympathizers number in the hundreds of thousands if not millions, both within and outside the Church. Sedevacantism and the anitpopes created, represent a noteworthy episode in the history of Antipopes. Further, the appearance of these characters in the mainstream television and print media as "antipopes" more than justifies their inclusion in this article.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 14:57, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>I 'voluteer' a better name: "Antipope". "Sedevacantist Antipope" already redirects to this article (as it should). Your RfC failed to garner any comment whatsoever. You have failed to respond to the specific points I have made, simply ignoring them. These individuals are "antipopes" defined as such in Canon Law, and referred to as such in televsion and print media. Your unilateral "decision" that you will split the article is unsupported at RfC and has been objected to by at least three other editors on this talk page (myself, <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a>) for a variety of reasons that you simply don't agree with. At the very least, in the small discussion that has taken place about splitting this article, your view is the minority view. The Sedevacantist and Conclavist Antipopes should remain in this article where they belong, with Sedevacantist Antipope redirecting to this article. Anyone searching for these modern antipopes who does not have an in-depth knowledge of post-Vatican II schisms will search for them as "antipopes" since that is their proper appellation both in Canon Law and in all references in the media (where they are referenced in such a prejorative manner).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 17:04, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The split is certainly <b>not</b> eminent. Your continual refusal to address the fundamental argument is germaine. Modern antipopes are just that: "antipopes". Also, your stated intention to act in clear contravention of concensus (all editors who have commented on this matter do not agree with a split). There is already a concensus <b>not</b> to split the article as you have suggested. The other three editors involved in this discussion have clearly voiced their opposition to your idea. To restate as clearly as possible: No split is required, nor is there any concensus whatsoever to split the article. Indeed, the opposite is true: there is a concensus <b>not</b> to split the article. This concensus is opposed by one editor: you. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:18, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: Bishop Schuckardt. There is no verifiable evidence that Bishop Schuckardt ever claimed to be the pope or has ever called himself pope Hadrian VII. This claim first surfaced when those who sought to overthrow him made the accusation in order to stir up the people against him. Their motive was the retention of their positions of power and a church worth millions of dollars. Power and greed are historically strong motives for dishonesty and claims from such people without outside verification have historically been given very little credence. It has now been over twenty-one years since these accusations were first made and those making the claim still have not produced a single piece of verifiable evidence to substantiate their claims. Those who think a picture of him in a white cassock is evidence of such a claim simply demonstrate their own ignorance of permitted episcopal attire.</p>
<p>I plan on removing Bishop Schuckardt from this article as a self-proclaimed papal claimant, but first wanted to give others a chance to present verifiable evidence, as is Wikipedia's written policy, to demonstrate that he did indeed make such a claim. My name is Frater John. I have personally known Bishop Schuckardt for 30 years and make no false pretense at being someone without a personal bias in his favor. I also know first hand, that much of what is said about him is false, and where I can present the actual facts in his regard, I plan on doing so. NOT MY OPINION, but the facts. Thanks.</p>

<p>Dear Lima, I am not sure what the Annuario says about Silvester III. Does it number him as a legitimate Pope or merely ignores hims? At any rate, he should be included in our list, which is why I restored him. But if the Annuario comment now is wrong, please correct it. Cheers, <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:30, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The part of the Annuario's series of Popes and Antipopes that interests you runs as follows (my hurried translation - where I use two terms, the first is the original Italian form, the second is a more English form; Roman numerals indicate the month):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Benedict IX, <i>Teofilatto (Theophylact) of the Counts of Tuscolo (Tusculum)</i>, ...VIII or IX. 1032 - ...IX.1044</dd>
<dd>Silvester III, Roman, <i>Giovanni (John)</i>, 13 or 20.I.1045 - ...III.1045</dd>
<dd>Benedict IX (for the second time), 10.III.1045 - 1.V.1045</dd>
<dd>Gregory VI, Roman, <i>Giovanni (John) Graziano</i>, 1.V.1045 - 20.XII.1046</dd>
<dd>Clement II, from Saxony, <i>Suitgero of the Lords of Morsleben von Horneburg</i>, 24.XII.1046 - 9.X.1047</dd>
<dd>Benedict IX (for the third time), ...X.1047- ...VII.1048.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A footnote to the last entry says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The pontificate of Benedict IX was interrupted for the first time through the intrusion of Silvester III; the second time, Benedict IX resigned and was succeeded by Gregory VI; finally, Benedict IX again became Pope for the third time, after the death of Clement II.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Typographically, the Annuario presents antipopes as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gregory V, from Saxony, <i>Bruno of the Dukes of Carinthia</i>, 3.V.996 - ...II or III.999
<dl>
<dd><b>[John XVI, from Rossano, <i>Giovanni Filagato</i>, ... II or III.997 - ...V.998]</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus, the Annuario Pontificio presents Silvester III as Pope, not Antipope. And 1045 is in the mid-eleventh century, a period in which the Annuario says (in the footnote about Pope Leo VIII, partly quoted in the article) that it is impossible to determine with certainty who was the lawful Pope.</p>
<p>The footnote about Pope Leo VIII begins as follows: "Leo VIII was elected in the Council of Rome held in the Basilica of Saint Peter by Emperor Otto I after the deposition on the same day, 4.XII.963, of John XII, who died on the following 14 May. Was the deposition valid? If it was, Leo VIII was a lawful Pope. At this point, as again ..." (the rest of the note, in a translation to which I devoted more time, is in the article)</p>
<p>I leave it to you to adjust the article in view of this information.</p>
<p>By the way, I already noticed the difference in spelling between the Annuario (Filagato) and the article (Filagatto), but, in case the article is correctly based on a good source, I did not retouch it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick information. I will semi-revert my edit to reflect this. I do not know on what the sources the article is based, re Filagatto. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 16:40, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The latter, however, is by far more probable in the hypothesis that Heraclius was the chief of a party made up of apostates and their followers, who demanded immediate restoration to the body of the Church. Damasus characterizes in very strong terms the conflict which ensued (seditcio, cœdes, bellum, discordia, lites). It is likely that Heraclius and his supporters sought to compel by force their admittance to divine worship, which was resented by the faithful gathered in Rome about Eusebius. In consequence both Eusebius and Heraclius were exiled by Emperor Maxentius. Eusebius, in particular, was deported to Sicily, where he died soon after. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by anonymous 75.14.211.31 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_anonymous_75.14.211.31_5c14.html" title="Special:Contributions/anonymous 75.14.211.31">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I think the list should be no more than a list. The annotations that have been added to several names belong to the articles on the individuals. What do others think? <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 04:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that some thins can be deleted in the list, which should tell us the name (papal and personal), the dates and in case of the great schism the "papal line" a certain anti-pope came from. Also, the "see above" notes should stay. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 07:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>To summarise, the arguments above, as I see them:</p>
<p>(The use of the title Pope in other churches is not part of this discussion.)</p>
<p>i) There are at least two 'sequences of persons' who can be included under the given heading:</p>
<p>a) The historical group, in which there are several subgroups. Some "multiple occurrances of popes" may have arisen through lack of communication between various geographical locations, or, were in effect, "front runners variously mentioned"(but not necessarily disputed elections): others, particularly in the later period, reflected factional/political/international tensions. (Anyone - was this "merely a question of leadership" - those involved recognising the others as being Catholic as then defined?)</p>
<p>b) The modern group, where visions and a preference for traditional presentations of Catholic liturgy etc appear to be significant factors in differentiation (as far as non-participants understand the situation to be). The groups associated with these popes are of varying significance and influence, are stable over a period of time (membership numbers, definitions of beliefs/differences from the Church of Rome as generally recognised etc) - even if in the longer term some disperse or amalgamate.</p>
<p>A subsection of this latter group make use of Malachy's list (query - and other such statements?) to make use of the name Pope Peter II because of the resonances associated with it.</p>
<p>ii) There are a number of persons who claim/are claimed to be popes falling into category (b) who are purely transitory/of no visible significance or influence. These persons are likely to have stubs created for them which are subsequently deleted on the grounds of non-notability (perhaps there should be a "kite flying flag" for such topics - a stub which the creator can see the reasons for deletion on lack of development/reassigning but will let others make the decision: one up from a stub, where there is more reason to see development into a full article.)</p>
<p>iii) While there are technical/theological-linguistic reasons for separating categories (a) and (b), what generic term would the "curious person" who comes across references to someone in category (b) be likely to look up first in Wikipedia (ie if not looking up under by actual name)? "Not Pope of Rome, not head of minor church, therefore will try [x] for starters"</p>
<p><br />
Two last comments:</p>
<p>There are some topics which generate much discussion because they fall in the borderline area between one and two (or several) articles - and an observer/Innocent Bystander can see the arguments on both sides (but will passively accept the majority view).</p>
<p>The use of the papal veto (up until 1903 when it was abolished after its use against <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariano_Cardinal_Rampolla_128a.html" title="Mariano Cardinal Rampolla">Mariano Cardinal Rampolla</a>) does not appear to have resulted in disputes of this nature).</p>

<p>The above refers to the previous version of the present page, when the "modern" group were included on it.</p>
<p>In its present format, the page should have an intro to the modern group - as they are in some senses different to the earlier group to clarify matters. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackiespeel_edf5.html" title="User:Jackiespeel">Jackiespeel</a> 22:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
