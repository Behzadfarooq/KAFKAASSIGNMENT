<p>I don't understand this article - isn't it possible to be anti-copyright without being an anarchist? To be honest, I'm struggling to understand what the article is trying to be <i>about</i>. If it's about anarchists views of copyright, it should probably be called Anarchists' views of copyright (although I doubt there is a consensus amongst anarchists on the matter). Can somebody enlighten me? --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p><i>Karl replied thus on my talk page:</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>re anti-copyright: It is an actual "copyright" statement. It is required because in may places items are copyright unless specifically stated otherwise. It would be a bit more popular than "some" anarchists. With most things anarchist, it is very difficult to tell how popular. My feeling is that it may be 75% or more popular in the small fanzine area of anarchism of 15 years ago. I do not know how popular it is today. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_8592.html" title="User:Karl">Karl</a></dd>

<dd>Ah, I see - so you would find an "Anti-copyright" statement at the bottom of an article or something, kind of like a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyleft.html" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a> statement? Would it make sense to begin the article with something like "An <b>anti-copyright</b> statement is one which explicitly gives up any rights the owner may have under normal <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> laws"? That might make the subject of the article a bit clearer, I think (if it's accurate, that is). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>yes - typically such a statement is found in the masthead of a magazine, refering to its entire contents. It can also be attached to individual articles. It is like a copyleft statement. Ok, moving first bit of response to article.</dd>

<p>Hi Camaebert- I was going to go to bed but thought I'd quickly reply- as I see it, <i>anti</i> copyright is an explicit political statement of opposition to the concept of 'copyright', as opposed to say, wikipedia, which is <i>non</i> copyright- perhaps a subtle distinction, but I would agree that one need not necessarily be an anarchist to support the idea of anti-copyright. In a way it's a statement about the ownership or freedom of ideas...</p>
<p>I used to put out fanzines/pamphlets and what have you years ago that displayed the 'anti-copyright' symbol ( a copyright 'C' in a circle with a cross through it), but being a capitalist running dog these days I do actually consider my work 'copyright' (such as my self published books or indeed the original essays from which many of my wiki artcles on organic gardening, permaculture, etc, are drawn) nowadays for reasons I won't go into now... Urg,clear as mud no doubt but I must get some kip- work tommorrow, yippee!!! <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a></p>
<hr />
<p><i>I wrote this without reading the above:</i></p>
<p>This is one anarchist view of intellectual property. It's written in encyclopedic style, at least, but it is inaccurate in a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've already corrected the reference to Property is Theft as Proudhon's "slogan".</li>
<li>It is certainly <i>not</i> true that this represents everyone who calls him/herself an anarchist: especially not anarcho-capitalists, who hold the right of property above pretty much anything else, I think.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article should be incorporated into <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a> (or <i>anarchist communism</i> or <i>anarcho-communism</i>, wherever it ends up). However, it could get lengthy, so it's own article would also be good. This view of intellectual property is really a "communist" one, in its true sense; however, many anarchist communist and communist works are still copyrighted, so there is some controversy and possible hypocrisy to write about. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Francis_c89a.html" title="User:Sam Francis">Sam</a></p>

<hr />
<p>Thanks very much to all for the above - I'm off to bed myself shortly, and won't be around tomorrow, but I'll stick my head in here Wednesday to see what's happening and if I can maybe improve things a little. I'm anti-copyright myself in theory - I was involved on the periphery of the <a href="http://www.droplift.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.droplift.org/" rel="nofollow">Droplift Project</a> and a lot of my musical work would not be very well received by the <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a> (unfortuantely, I have to eat, and so until the revolution, theory is not always equivalent to practice). However, I wasn't sure if this had an article's worth of material in it - too similar to copyleft, maybe; or else why not incorporate it into <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a>. I'm still not sure about this now.</p>
<p>I'm still a bit troubled by this article (though it's better than it was) - it isn't really clear to me whether anti-copyright ought to be treated as a concept ("<b>anti-copyright</b> is the belief that all copyright laws should be scrapped") or as a kind of anti-license ("an <b>anti-copyright</b> statement is one which gives up all rights to a work under copyright laws"). That's more of a question of which angle the subject is approchaed from than anything else. I suppose one might try to come at from both angles at once. Anyway, I'm probably not making much sense - I'll go away, mull it over, and hopefully return with a clearer vision of what might be done here. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>I would think both - but in any case now that I have started this mess, I'm going to go away for a while and see what develops or disappears! <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_8592.html" title="User:Karl">Karl</a></dd>

<p>I read through the bullet points under "Anti-copyright movement" listing arguments against copyright and I didn't find any arguments along a line of thought that I've had (any suggestions on how to word this better, and does anyone else think this way?):</p>
<p>In the case of entertainment works, the existance of a work may not raise one's quality of life. Instead, it may only raise the bar of quality of life. For example, if someone makes a movie and I watch it, I may be no better off than if that movie wasn't made (I'll just find something else to do). On the other hand, if someone makes the movie but I can't afford it, I'm worse off because my friends who watched it are talking about it and I'm left out. So the work shouldn't be copyrightable or else its mere existance will make people who can't afford it worse off. Rather, people who have seen it should be able to share it with their friends freely.</p>

<p>No attempt has even been made to balance this article with counter arguments. It is propoganda. I have serious doubts about whether this article should exist in its present form.

<p>It seems that the first use of "anti-copyright" described above is entirely the same as placing a work in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. By relinquishing all rights to a work, the creator cannot enforce any right over its subsequent use (as would be the case under <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyleft.html" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a> schemes. The second use of the term is just an opinion and a political statement, and thus eliminates <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-copyright.html" title="Anti-copyright">anti-copyright</a> from holding a place in the section describing the facts and details of copyright and related schemes. An anarchist can believe anything he wants, but this won't get any laws overturned. (Speaking of which, is anyone aware of an anarchist refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the law of gravitation?) User:Kradak</p>
