	    <p>The "renewed" word is quite controversial. I know that you will be referring to the autocephalous Montenegro and the Littoral Metropolinate - but that <b>is not</b> MOC. The Montenegrin Orthodox Church might <i>claim</i> descent from the autocephalous metropolinate, but like I said, there was no <b>autocephalous Church</b>. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 21:11, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not being ignorant. MOC was introduced for the first time in history in 1993. The <i>Ohrid Archbishopric</i> was <b>autocephalous for <i>half a millennium</i></b>, and the current Macedonian Orthodox Church <i>claims</i> it - but it is known that M(ac)OC isn't 50 years old. The Metropolinate was autocephalous as such as well. Besides, the MOC shares totally different goals, beliefs and other pursuits than the original Metropolinate (which lasts up to this day and has <i>never</i> indeed been abolished). --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 13:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You have nerve to say that vladikas from Petrovic dynasty were controlled by the Serbian patriarch, are you saying that <a href="http://www.montenegro.org/pictures/charter.gif|" class="external text" title="http://www.montenegro.org/pictures/charter.gif|" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a lie? Are you saying that true vladika of Montenegro would be treated <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFJHJv5mqFk|" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFJHJv5mqFk|" rel="nofollow">like this</a> in Cetinje, seat of his church? Not to mention that Petar I and Petar II were wearing the white "kamilavka"(a version of aholy cap), which is for heads of <b>autocephalous churches only</b>. But I see that preserving Serb nationalist-assimilatory view is more important than presenting things as they are.

<p>First of all, that is a <b>personal attack</b>. Please read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. There is <i><b>no excuse</b></i> for making them.</p>
<p>Second, I obviously <i>do not</i> have the nerve to say that <i>..vladikas from Petrovic dynasty were controled by the Serbian patriarch..</i>, since I never said that, did I? Anyway, if I said that, that would've been <i>true</i> for the historical period from 1697 to 1833 (when the Russian Patriarchate kicked in and took over leadership over the Montenegrin Metropolinate).</p>
<p>Next, you have an error on that link (an extra <i>|</i> in the end). I am not saying that the Constitution of the Holy Synod (composed in 1903) is a lie - it <b>indeed</b> declared the Metropolinate of Montenegro an autocephalous one within the Eastern Orthodox Church (which was politically official-ized in the 1905 Constitution of the Princedom [later Kingdom] of Montenegro). By the way, the short-lived age of this autonomy is greatly overestimated (when it apparently wasn't even two decades).</p>
<p>Worn by the Archbishop of Ochryd as well, yes (however, there is no "Orthodox Church of Ochryd" (although "Church of Ochryd" was indeed sometimes used); there is only "Ochryd Archbishopric". Hence, there were/are no such thing as "Orthodox Ochrydians", nor could anyone be "Ochrydian Orthodox".</p>
<p>Your reference to Youtube I do not understand, I am sorry.</p>
<p>Perhaps what you perceive as a <i>..Serb nationalist-assimilatory view more important than things as they are.</i> is actually <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>?</p>
<p><b>The thing that is as it is</b> is that an (national religious) institution known as the "Montenegrin Orthodox Church" was created ("illegally" as could be described) in 1993. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 23:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I explained the <i>personal attack</i> issue, I reverted it myself as soon as I calmed down. Hope you wont hold it against me.</dd>

<p>It is well known that Montenegrin Orthodox Church was <b>autocephalous</b> at the beginning of 20th century, until 1920,when it was cancelled by the order of King Alexander,and the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and Littoral was created as a part of the Serbian Orthodox Church. I acknowledge the manner in which the MOC was re-created in 1993, but if anyone can be called a rightful successor of Montenegrin vladikas throughout the history, it is certainly not the Metropolitanate with Amfilohije at its helm. Reference to Youtube...It was just a video uploaded by my personal friend who sent it to me a couple of days ago. It just shows how the people of Cetinje treated Risto Radovic in 1993 on the Assembly about Petar II Petrovic Njegos, revolted by the bias and inaccuracy of the facts presented on the assembly by academics from SANU and CANU,which at that time was heavily controlled by SANU leaders. It was simply an interesting addition to the talk, revealing the people's feelings about the current head of SOC's puppet Metropollitanate. Is MOC canonically aknowledged? No, but who are we to demonise any side here by suggestive vocabulary, such as <i>self proclaimed Archbishop, head of Church(least he deserves is a formal title),</i>church that registered as a non-governmental organization at the Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior in 1997<i>(any relevance?!) etc. Cheers. <a href="../../../s/i/d/User%7ESideshow_Bob_3991.html" title="User:Sideshow Bob">Sideshow Bob</a> 21:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Of course I won't.</dd>

<p>That's what I've been saying, that was <b>not</b> a "Montenegrin Orthodox Church". For example, the Serbian Orthodox Church had existed in 1219-1532, but has been recreated and lives on ever since 1920. Despite the Serbian sacral institutions existed across various periods, those were <b>not</b> a "Serbian Orthodox Church" (despite even referred to as "Church of Serbia" many times), i.e. the Serbian Patriarchate of Pec in 1557-1766, or the Metropolinate of Montenegro and the Littoral that inherited its heritage from the first half of the 18th century onwards, or the Metropolinate of Karlowitz from 1691, that became a self-proclaimed Patriarchate in 1848 - merged into SOC in 1920.</p>
<p>Understand this - there was no "order" of King Alexander that abolished it. All the Metropolinates (karlowitz, Belgrade, Bosnia, Dalmatia, Croatia and others) gathered in 1920 and (re)proclaimed the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. The Montenegrin Metropolinate <i>later</i> gave its agreement and joined the SOC because there were numerous disagreements. The sole (or better, the most of it) of the disagreement was the claim (which I consider <i>very</i> justified) of the Montenegrin Metropolinates for the seat of the Serbian Patriarch. Other than that, was the struggle for the historical Pec Patriarchate (which would be on the soil of Montenegro, and under its influence, naturally) to be the new (olden) seat of the SOC. Montenegro's historical successes were greatly unrecognized and diminished by Serbia, especially by the scandal insisting on Belgrade (because its the nation's capital and largest city) to become the seat. This, together with the total abolition of the Montenegrin state and the overthrowing of the dynasty is what caused the Christmas rebellion and the following disorders, by the way.</p>
<p>Just remember Gavrilo Dozic... For the MOC to be the autocephalous metropolinate's successor, it needs to <i>base its claims</i>. Do the two have similar pursuits? No. Are the MOC heads head, or at least descendents/heirs of the Metropolinate? No. Did the Metropolinate exist when the MOC was created in 1993 (and still does)? Yes (and yes). So you see there was <i>no line</i> that was somehow broken and then returned in 1993. There was only <i>slight change</i> (referring to the autonomy - which by the way, lasted only for some 15-20 years).</p>

</div>
<p>That's why I actually <b>do</b> think that Amfilohije is the <i>only canonical</i> heir to the Montenegrin-Coastal Metropolinate (canonical=legal in Church Law). Understand Dedeic something like (this is gonna be a bizarre comparison, brace yourself) President of Abkhazia (in Georgia). I don't really think that it's "demon-izing", but there are/were usurpers to thrones, and Dedeic (and his predecessor) in some way, <i>are</i> <b>usurpers</b> (although they didn't take it yet,&#160;:) - he's trying hard though it seems!&#160;:).</p>

<dd>Imagine if I gather an institution and created a "Dalmatian Orthodox Church", and claim that I re-created the old Metropolinate (although this is slightly less expressive with this case than with the Montenegrin, the comparison still stands) of Dalmatia. I think I would deserve those words. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 00:05, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
