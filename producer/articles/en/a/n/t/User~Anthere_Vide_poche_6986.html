<p><a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">Ethics</a> is now updated to better reflect the issues of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientism.html" title="Scientism">scientism</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_philosophy.html" title="Gaia philosophy">Gaia philosophy</a>. Our friend attempted to add a big chunk of one-religion-centric crap on the Bible, and then a section title, "Ethics in the religion" (*THE*!!) but was repelled by a troll, who did an admirable job adapting his second pass. The article may now need some defense against attack. Also, a French translation would be timely about now. On the Marxist and feminist issues raised, there may be more wisdom en francais than in the hain-Glitch.</p>
<p>On a different matter, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/ideas" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/ideas" rel="nofollow">CBC ideas</a> has an interesting talk on "the civilization of difference" on it somewhere. "The problem of how we deal with those who are different than us... " - Beverly McLaughlin</p>

<p>How common are air-conditioners in France? We deal with 30-40 °C temps every summer where I live (got up to 44 ° for a day or two this year). Of course north-central California probably isn't as humid as much of France, but parts of the US mid-West are as hot as Central California but with a great deal of humidity. Just curious. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<p>Wow! What fantastic pictures, Anthere! I'd love to help out more with the ecozone project, but I'm so ridiculously busy these days that taking on more work is just out of the question. As you may have noticed, I'm not getting many edits at all in over this last month or two. Real (i.e., paid) work aside, this new bird photography obsession of mine is chewing up almost every spare hour I can find. No matter - I am enjoying it immensely. Doubtless it wil wear off eventually and I'll get time to do some more wiki-work. (BTW, if my tinkering with the links to correct case has messed up your scheme (linked to the wrong things), feel free to revert me as needed.)</p>

<p>Hi, the second one had a slightly different ending but I extended it to mix it with the beginning of the next song. The lyrics at the end give a sense of inability to draw any conclusions, but of course the music doesn't have to follow suit. &#160;:-) ... Unfortunately, I can't do much about the singing on the 3rd. She doesn't end each word precisely, and as it is there are a lot of drum hits covering other pops caused by cutting her off.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. I've been told before that the ends of the songs just seem to drift off, so that's something I should work on. Those are all I have now, though, unless you want to hear the old embarassing ones. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 23:28, 31 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well on the 3rd one it was originally a cappella; I chopped up the vocals and rearranged them slightly, then added all the music. On the other two, I downloaded all the original tracks (cello, piano, guitar, drums etc.), rearranged it all, threw away about 3/4 of the music, and added what I thought it needed. No, I don't sing, or at least I don't when I'm around people and fully self-aware. It's not recommended for me to sing. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 00:18, 1 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In response to your question about the translation of <b>board</b> I looked at the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i> to see how it handled the matter. Both the French and English versions are official in Canada. This particular law governs the operation of corporations. Where the term, <i>Board of Directors</i>, is used in English, it uses <i>conseil d'administration</i>. I hope this helps. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 21:46, 1 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ha Ant, why did you empty your page? I have the feeling, you are kind of giving up some things "Removing from Ambassador", "blanc page"... I hope you did not interpret my "Support" line in Eloquence's page as "I am against Anthere". You know what I think of you. I was supporting Erik in general, and especially I did not like the "voting for voting", therefore I thought, maybe it would be good if he knows that some people are on his side, even if they don't say so.</p>
<p>But you also know that you have a lot of people that have a high esteem of you and respect your work. It is difficult to write because I don't know what is going on... I am just guessing...

<p>Well its kinda gruesome looking--belies the beauty of the beautiful flowaz. Good luck with "the diet." As someone familiar with eating, and eating habits -- Id like to (ifI may) point out that the term "diet" is best thought of in the wholistic sense--not that you are on "a diet" (even the Round Table Pizza man is on "a diet"), rather that you have decided to make changes to your overall "diet." Eating less meat is certainly a way to do that, but you need to be realistic. Forget the weight thing--its not a good enough reason to mess with your cycles, and your body will disagree with you.

<p>17 August was the day that mav started telling people they had to put the VfD notice on things so I went through VfD checking that the pages listed did have one that day.

<p>It occurs to me that youre an extremely sensitive woman, with slighly problematic English, who perhaps has difficulty distinguishing between an attack on a particular behaviour and an attack on her person. I want to be clear, I think your work is first rate, and that the value of your contributions is beyond measure. That said, your extreme sensitivity can also be percieved as a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_complex.html" title="Persecution complex">persecution complex</a>--which in turn tends to accuse people acting within reason, of the crime of persecuting you. I dont accept this as valid. Im not going to treat anyone with kid gloves simply because of their gender or particular ethnic sensitivities.

At least its better than assuming the worst, which by your comments about "ostracizing" --you seem to mean.-<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">戴&amp;#30505sv</a> 06:35, Sep 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read your comments on the Wikipedia mailing list regarding copyright and fair use. What I don't understand is why you deleted the photos of <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuelle_B%C3%A9art_a7d6.html" title="Emmanuelle Béart">Emmanuelle Béart</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Marceau_efcc.html" title="Sophie Marceau">Sophie Marceau</a> on the French Wikipedia but did not delete them here on the English version.</p>
<p>anon</p>
<p>I did not really follow the initial matter as regards deletion of the two above mentionned pictures, except for the fact they were properly listed on votes for deletion. After a decent time on votes for deletion, these images were deleted. Then, JacquesD raised the question of the disparity of "rights" between some editors and others, in terms of fair use images uploading.</p>
<p>I decided to first understand the matter better before taking any further position. I do not believe direct deletion based on *my* personal perception is OK. I also know that image deletion is permanent, hence I think it was wiser to wait till we understand more and are perhaps more able to judge what should be done with these pictures.</p>
<p>We were three people yesterday, spending most of the night, trying to translate policies in french, and trying to decipher what fair use was. As soon as this is set, I hope french people will try to be much clearer in terms of information (source and cp status) given.</p>
<p>If the two above mentionned picts are said fair use, I will personnaly put them back on the french wiki, mentionning their status at least. If french people say they are not, I will personnaly list them on votes for deletion here.</p>
<p>Then, I will take care of something else, because I am more interested in fixing up a consistent policy and fair behavior between contributors, than hunting copyright infrigement.</p>

<dd>Thanks Angel. It is curious there are no birthday cake...I was always amazed by the looks of typical american ones; Tomorrow, I will make three for one of my kid, who will turn 7 on thursday. This summer, I made a huge one for my sister in law and husband. I tried to put one candle for each year. Huge number. And huge mistake. It was during the heat wave, and between the outside heat and the heat released by each candle, they all entirely melted on the cake, which ended enterely coated with pink and blue wax. That was plain awful. I was ashamed&#160;:-))))</dd>

Hiya, Happy birthday! Great to hear from you. I don't much about Ducker but we do have and have had people who specialise principally in editing rather than article writing, including Zoe and Michael Hardy. I think there work is very important in keeping things together. Ducker's reversion of BuddhaInside's page was part of a general reversion by plenty of people. I don't think there is a problem with blanking talk pages on their own. Evercat blanks his after reading his comments; he shows he reads them by his reactions to comments else. In contrast Buddha makes controversial changes, recreates deleted pages, and then when plenty of people want to comment on his behaviour he just deletes their comments en bloc, saying 'I'm not listening. Go away.' It is showing gross disrespect to people like you, me and everyone else who wants to contribute, if only to tell him 'please understand the way you are doing things is wrong'. Reverting the blanking is not trying to show him respect but to force him to <i>listen</i> to people. Talk pages are there to help people learn from everyone else's advice. I think Ducker is well intentioned in what he had doing. If only Buddha <i>listened</i> to people he migh well turn into a valued contributor.<a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 18:11, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have protected a page for a person (Gustavf) who is inserting wrong and political (not NPOV) information on <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>. Maybe some Saami fanatics will tell you that Saami is an official language of Norway, but most people will not. It's just co-official in a few municipalities and is written by the Saami people - 6000 persons out of 4,5 million, and should therefore be written as a footnote (see for instance <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, under Official language)</p>
<p><br />
It is not mine to decide whether Gustavf is right or not. Nor you right or not. I just did my role in protecting a page because someone ask. Please settle your problem in the talk page, and if needed, find someone you think neutral and perhaps knowledgable on the topic. Not me&#160;:-) Best luck. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthère</a></p>
<p>You should probably also have a look on the German, French, Danish, Swedish etc. wikis. Why are the English wiki telling you that Saami is an official Norwegian language, when none of the other wikis (and other encyclopædias at all) are? The answer is Gustavf.</p>

<p>Dear Anthere,</p>
<p>I am sorry you are exhausted from the complex process that is going on regarding the evolution of Wikipedia policies and procedures. Some of it has been confusing to me too, as you know. Are we discussing banning someone or him being a problem user? Regarding the interaction of French and American law I first must say that while it is generally true regarding copyright law that as Wikipedia is being published in California that US copyright law will generally rule (though there is an exception that the case I told you about above applies). Regarding other laws there are differences. If we are talking about a tort (usually in Quebec we translate this as a "delict" into English because the law is not exactly the same) the tort (or extracontractual delict) occurs in a different place than publication, it is the place of publication that is at issue, not merely where the tort was written down (I hope this is clear, it is an important point that I have tried to stress before). Under this rubric of tort are all these things such as privacy, personality and publicity rights. In civil law jurisdictions they are usually called "right of private life" or something like that, since ther are no real English civil code countries sometimes the translation is difficult (though remember that Scottish law is basically similar to the civil law as it is still based upon the uncodified ancient Roman law). Can one defame oneself? I don't think so, because one makes a statement about oneself and publishes it there is the concept of consent that stands in the way. Unless one can show that he did not consent to the publication by himself of the defamatory information then maybe he could sue himself. In other words, one can write whatever one wants about oneself and one must face the consequences afterwards.</p>
<p>Is criticism defamation? No. if someone is being criticized reasonably then such criticism cannot be considered libel or any kind of delict, it is only statements that are wrong, wrongful or malicious (and there may be differences bewtween jurisdictions that might make such a determination difficult) that then might be considered defamatory.</p>
<p>Regarding that comment on David's talk page, I hope it was seen as tongue in cheek, Americans say the same thing about Canadians. Americans don't realize that they are often arrogant and rash, Europeans are often very sharp in their criticisms. That makes Wikipedia exciting, because all these different kinds of cultural differences are being thrown together. Interesting? Yes. Frustrating, definitely!

<p>I'm just awake now, bored, trying to get sleepy. I'm not intending to spend much time here; it's best to email. Take your time, though--no rush. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 00:57, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would prefer that you do not take out the list of mirror sites in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_sites.html" title="Shock sites">Shock sites</a> article. Even if the content is the same, the goatse website does not mention them, and the article must say that those mirror sites exist and are used to trick people into going to the website. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 01:09, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EEloquence_non-process_93dc.html" title="User talk:Eloquence/non-process">User_talk:Eloquence/non-process</a>. You are mentioned. So are some articles deleted out of process, which might be undeleted. Those who oppose RK also really should be talked to about all these issues. There is a chance now to create some democratic alternative way to do these things...</p>

<p>Anthere is there a page on the French Wikipedia about this France-US legal squabble: <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is02/readings/yahoo-order.html" class="external free" title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is02/readings/yahoo-order.html" rel="nofollow">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is02/readings/yahoo-order.html</a> see also <a href="http://www.lapres.net/yahweb.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lapres.net/yahweb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lapres.net/yahweb.html</a>&#160;? If there is such an article could you point me to it? I'm not quite sure where to look for it. it should be noted when people are discussing the power of French law in US courts related to free speech issues. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 23:46, 1 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
