<p>Many antifeminist proponents say the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_movement.html" title="Feminist movement">feminist movement</a> has achieved its aims and now seeks higher status for women than for men<sup id="_ref-.28Wattenberg.2C_B_1994.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28Wattenberg.2C_B_1994.29" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-.28Pizzey.2C_E_1999.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28Pizzey.2C_E_1999.29" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-.28JSC_2006.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28JSC_2006.29" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Others consider feminism a destructive force that endangers the family. For example, conservative political scientist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Gottfried_4a3b.html" title="Paul Gottfried">Paul Gottfried</a> describes this antifeminist position:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serious conservative scholars like <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Carlson_ae17.html" title="Allan Carlson">Allan Carlson</a> and F. Carolyn Graglia have maintained that the change of women’s role, from being primarily mothers to self-defined professionals, has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family. Rather than being the culminating point of Western Christian gentility, the movement of women into commerce and politics may be seen as exactly the opposite, the descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos<sup id="_ref-.28Gottfried.2C_Paul_2002.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28Gottfried.2C_Paul_2002.29" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antifeminist writer James Kalb describes the stance thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be antifeminist is simply to accept that men and women differ and rely on each other to be different, and to view the differences as among the things constituting human life that should be reflected where appropriate in social attitudes and institutions. By feminist standards all societies have been thoroughly sexist. It follows that to be antifeminist is only to abandon the bigotry of a present-day ideology that sees traditional relations between the sexes as simply a matter of domination and submission, and to accept the validity of the ways in which human beings have actually dealt with sex, children, family life and so on. Antifeminism is thus nothing more than the rejection of one of the narrow and destructive fantasies of an age in which such things have been responsible for destruction and murder on an unprecedented scale<sup id="_ref-.28Kalb.2C_J_2004.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28Kalb.2C_J_2004.29" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antifeminists often decry what they view as the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandric</a> policies of Western governments. They sometimes point to an increase in divorce and "family breakdown" and attribute as its cause the influence of feminism. They also cite that crime<sup id="_ref-.28NCPA_1997.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28NCPA_1997.29" title="">[6]</a></sup>, teenage pregnancy<sup id="_ref-.28Ellis_BJ_2003.29_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.28Ellis_BJ_2003.29" title="">[7]</a></sup>, and drug abuse<sup id="_ref-fathers.com_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fathers.com" title="">[8]</a></sup> are higher among children of <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatherless.html" title="Fatherless">fatherless</a> homes, considering that 66-80% (depending on the sources) of divorces are initiated by women.</p>
<p>Opponents of antifeminism argue that although there are correlational data to support a link between fatherless homes and increased social ills, that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation_implies_causation_%28logical_fallacy%29.html" title="Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy)">correlation does not necessarily imply causation</a> and that antifeminists run the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions by sometimes ignoring other possible factors.</p>
<p>Antifeminist comments periodically appear in U.S. political punditry. For example, in a 1983 syndicated column, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> wrote, "Rail as they will about discrimination, women are simply not endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition and the will to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of Western capitalism."<sup id="_ref-fair96_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fair96" title="">[9]</a></sup>}}</p>
<p>Buchanan and other <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleoconservatives.html" title="Paleoconservatives">paleoconservatives</a> argue that feminism is an ideology of the modern <a href="../../../m/a/n/Managerial_state.html" title="Managerial state">managerial state</a>, an ongoing regime that remains in power, regardless of what political party holds a majority. It acts in the name of abstract goals, such as equality or positive rights, and uses its claim of moral superiority, power of taxation and wealth redistribution to keep itself in power.</p>

<p>Feminists such as Jennifer Pozner blast that claim and argue the feminist label is a ruse.

Do not pass up the college lecture circuit. Do not turn down close to $200K in Right Wing grants" and wait "for the money to come rolling in". She goes on to further counter claims of silencing debate or criticism: "Use your role as 'rebel feminist' to denounce every feminist concern other than women's economic advancement." and "(...)substantiate your claims by using faulty research methods and superficial interviews.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifeminism.html" title="Edit section: Antifeminism in Nietzschean philosophy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Antifeminism in Nietzschean philosophy</span></h2>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyond_Good_and_Evil_%28book%29_a6f2.html" title="Beyond Good and Evil (book)">Beyond Good and Evil</a></i>, <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> expresses his belief that women are naturally more cruel and contemptuous of truth than men, and that the emancipation of women threatens to compromise what he considers these admirable feminine qualities.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has grown smaller in proportion to the increase in her rights and demands, and the "Emancipation of Woman," to the extent that that is desired and demanded by women themselves (and not just by superficial men), has, as a result, produced a peculiar symptom of the growing weakening and deadening of the most feminine instincts. There is a stupidity in this development, an almost masculine stupidity, about which a successful woman—who is always an intelligent woman—would have to feel thoroughly ashamed.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>He goes on to write that, "The thing in woman that arouses respect and often enough fear is her nature, which is 'more natural' than man's nature, her genuine predatory and cunning adaptability, the tiger's claws under the glove, the naiveté of her egotism, her uneducable nature, her inner wildness, the incomprehensibility, breadth, and roaming of her desires and virtues," and concludes that these superior qualities can only thrive when women are repressed or relegated to subordinate roles. He attacks the men of his time he sees as "idiotic friends of women and corrupters of women among the scholarly asses of the male sex who counsel woman to de-feminize herself in this manner and to imitate all the foolish things which make 'man' in Europe and European 'manliness' sick, people who want to bring woman down to the level of a 'common education,' perhaps even to reading the newspapers and discussing politics. Here and there they want even to make women into free spirits and literati: as if a woman without piety were not something totally repulsive and ridiculous to a profound and godless man."<a href="http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/beyondgoodandevil7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/beyondgoodandevil7.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Nietzsche also writes that if a woman is "corrupted" by having the same freedom as men, it "make[s] her incapable of her first and last profession, giving birth to strong children." Although <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswald_Spengler_e951.html" title="Oswald Spengler">Oswald Spengler</a>'s own expressed views on women were generally more empathetic and less inflammatory than Nietzsche's, Spengler endorsed the Nietzschean opposition to feminism for many of the same reasons. Spengler also expressed concern that both men and women in Western countries no longer wanted to get married and raise children, claiming this would eventually result in the destruction of Western Civilization. But while Nietzsche argued for stricter societal controls on women, Spengler found it deplorable for either society or the state to force women to meet a "standardized type... in body, in clothes, in mind," which he considered a sign of cultural decline or inferiority<a href="http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/spengler/hourthree.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/spengler/hourthree.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Spengler's concept of "strong race" defined as "the eternal warlike in the beast of prey man," an ethos rather than a zoological notion, was similar to Nietzsche's "Will to Power." Nietzsche considered this a masculine attribute, once writing, "The happiness of man is, 'I will.' The happiness of woman is, 'He will.'" Unlike Nietzsche's concept, Spengler believed women, specifically mothers, could have "strong race." Spengler did not share Nietzsche's rejection of <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goethe.html" title="Goethe">Goethe</a>'s notion of an "eternal feminine" metaphysical presence, instead viewing it as engaged in a neverending war with the masculine Will to Power. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Decline_of_the_West_693a.html" title="The Decline of the West">The Decline of the West</a></i>, he writes, "Woman in childbed wins through to her victory." Noting that the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztecs.html" title="Aztecs">Aztecs</a> "honoured the woman in labour as a battling warrior," he views childbirth as an expression of a constant struggle for dominance between the sexes inherent in every healthy culture<a href="http://members.garbersoft.net/spartacus/spengler.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.garbersoft.net/spartacus/spengler.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. When a civilization loses its warlike instincts (between the sexes and against other peoples), he believed, it falls into decline and succumbs to "Caesarism" before eventually falling to enemies with stronger "race." Spengler continues this theme in <i>The Hour of Decision</i>, in which he attacks both feminism and modern misogyny as signs of Western culture in decline.<a href="http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/spengler/hourfive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/spengler/hourfive.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Much of feminism also conflicts with the Nietzschean view of world history, continued by admirers and emulators such as Spengler, which rejects the traditional linear notion of world history headed toward a greater goal. Because feminist ideology deals with victims and oppressors in a subjective way that sympathizes with the former, it falls under the category of "slave morality." Finally, it is an ideology that revolves around intellectual assertions about relations between the sexes, and thus runs in opposition to the fundamental core of Nietzschean anti-rationalism.</p>
