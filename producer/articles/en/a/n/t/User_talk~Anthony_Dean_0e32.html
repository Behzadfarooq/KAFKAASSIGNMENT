<p>You wrote: "Deleted year given---the year often anachronistically stated for the Flintstones' "Stone Age" era was "1 million B.C.")". Are you sure? I can't recall ever seeing that, but as I recall it, Pebbles was born 10.000 BC. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliter_d5f5.html" title="User:Aliter">Aliter</a> 01:01, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The year given on the various Flintstone series has varied over the years; IIRC, the "official line" from Hanna-Barbera was that Pebbles was born on "February 22, 10000 BC", but such a rather "late" year was never given anywhere in the show itself---one episode of the original series features Barney noting he graduated "20 years ago" as "Class of 1,000,020 BC" (implying it's 1 million BC), and other episodes and spinoffs (particularly the movie "The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones" mentioned Fred and the gang being from "a million years ago" a lot) imply the Flintstones lived in/around 1,000,000 BC. (The actual Stone Age was obviously closer to the "10,000 BC" mark, but then again, dinosaurs weren't alive in 10,000 *or* 1,000,000 BC&#160;;-) ). Granted, this isn't the most consistent show, but by my call, the Bedrock bunch lived "circa 1,000,000 BC"...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The best Flintstones website I've seen online has a bunch of miscellaneous trivia listed <a href="http://www.topthat.net/webrock/trivia2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.topthat.net/webrock/trivia2.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and gives the "10,000 BC" birthdate...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe under the entry could be a line like: "Pebbles was born on February 22, 10,000 BC (according to the show's producers; most citations of the actual year during the series' various runs placed the date as <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circa.html" title="Circa">circa</a> 1,000,000 BC)"? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Dean_d90f.html" title="User:Anthony Dean">Anthony Dean</a> 01:58, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe not literally the L.A. suburbs... but as a child in <i>Chicago's</i> suburbs when this show began, there is no question in my mind that the Flintstones represented what people call "White Suburbia"... in contrast to "The Honeymooners", on which it is patterned, and which was set in the inner city, in the time before many of the white city folks fled to the suburbs. That casts a sober note on the Flintstones, I realize. However, that might also be reading a little too much into a cartoon. &#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:19, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, everything on TV in the early-to-mid 60's (when the show first aired) reflected the segregated society of its time, though like TV after the mid-60's, subsequent Flintstones spinoffs presented a more integrated society for the car-driving cavepeople of Bedrock. As an African-American kid watching the originals in reruns, though, I still thought it was funny, along with the Honeymooners (though I don't recall the Honeymooners showing a very integrated Brooklyn, either...). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Dean_d90f.html" title="User:Anthony Dean">Anthony Dean</a> 03:09, May 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anthony Dean:</p>
<p>Why do you keep cleaning up the record of this disgusting little creep Michelangelo Signorile? The man is the homosexual and intellectual equivalent of Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney. I know of someone that killed himself because the local paper outed him. Now I donโt suppose outing should be against the law exactly but this person should at least have to live with the reputation he has earned for himself. Not all in the gay community approve the politics of personal destruction. I certainly don't. We all have the right to privacy. Even conservative closet cases like I used to be.</p>
<p>This bully did invent the practice after all. You should not call your self neutral while cleaning up all the droppings of "leaders" you seem to favor. You are his advocate and defender. You will not allow anything critical about him to stay up for very long.</p>
<p>I am afraid this Wikipedia experiment is a failure. There is too much re-writing of history for this website to have much practical value. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccommas_03af.html" title="User:Mccommas">Mccommas</a> 02:07, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I edited the reference not out of personal political biases, but because the Coulter article you linked to said nothing about Signorile, just discussing <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outing.html" title="Outing">outing</a> in general, for which the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outing.html" title="Outing">outing</a> page is the most appropriate topic. Plus, Wikipedia's NPOV is there to prevent postings from people with particular axes to grind---that's what <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblog.html" title="Weblog">weblogs</a>/personal websites are for. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Dean_d90f.html" title="User:Anthony Dean">Anthony Dean</a> 03:00, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have a point regarding your apparent objection to inclusion of all of the CBG Awards. I note that in several places you have deleted references to some pieces which did not receive what you seem to think of as a sufficiently high percentage of the vote or a sufficiently high place in the final totals. Please note that in most cases they didn't even mention those "contenders" who finished with only one or two votes, which probably number in the hundreds. Simply so that we don't continue to bump up against each other, I request some clarification as to what you would consider to be sufficient percentage of the vote or ranking in the vote so that you will not eliminate them later. Also, if you can think of a better phrase than "top votegetter" for these awards, which do not technically HAVE nominations, please let me know and I will change the phrase accordingly.<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My criteria was that only award winners should be listed, not nominees; as I stated elsewhere, this isn't the <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscars.html" title="Oscars">Oscars</a>---in this case, "just being nominated" for a fan-based award (of which there's a zillion such awards) isn't particularly special. Also should state that your link to an awards page is off-topic on most of your pages; simply wikifing the name of the award (and listing the external link on the award's page) is sufficient enough. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Dean_d90f.html" title="User:Anthony Dean">Anthony Dean</a> 01:39, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. You removed the following text I added to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, stating it wasn't NPOV. Could you clarify what you mean. "with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> lauding him as "the perfect cultural artefact for the 21st century." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,314504,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,314504,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>"</p>
<p>The quote itself is verifiable and from a reliable source, so I'm unsure where your problem lies with its inclusion. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> itself states <i>An encyclopedic article should not argue that corporations are criminals, even if the author believes it to be so. It should instead present the fact that some people believe it, and what their reasons are, and then as well it should present what the other side says.</i></p>
<p>It also says: <i>Where we might want to state an opinion, we convert that opinion into a fact by attributing the opinion to someone. So, rather than asserting, "The Beatles were the greatest band", we can say, "Most Americans believe that the Beatles were the greatest band of the Sixties," which is a fact verifiable by survey results, or "The Beatles had more Billboard #1 hits than any other rock band," which is also a fact. In the first instance we assert an opinion; in the second and third instances we "convert" that opinion into fact by attributing it to someone.</i></p>
<p>It then goes on to say: <i>Disagreements over whether something is approached the Neutral Point Of View (NPOV) way can usually be avoided through the practice of good research. Facts (as defined in the previous paragraph) are not Points Of View (POV, here used in the meaning of "opposite of NPOV") in and of themselves. A good way to help building a neutral point of view is to find a reputable source for the piece of information you want to add to wikipedia, and then cite that source.</i></p>
<p>The quote is clearly labelled as being a quote rather than the opinion of the article, and therefore is a fact, since The Guardian published the quote. I believe I have fulfilled the guidance in finding a source for the statement and citing it. The reason I added it was to add credibility to the preceeding sentence, which reads <i>one of the world's most well-known comic-book characters</i>, and technically is point of view since the article is asserting the statement rather than sourcing it. I'd appreciate a clarification of your thinking, ta, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 20:30, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The quote had sounded a bit like an opinion to me (since not everyone might agree on such), though moreso, it sounded like an oddly phrased way to praise the character's greatness/cite how he's a well-known comic character ("perfect cultural artefact"?), vs. quoting sales figures or something. Still, guess the quote could be put back in---though maybe as a footnote link, with the quote at the bottom of the page? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Dean_d90f.html" title="User:Anthony Dean">Anthony Dean</a> 01:37, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I had considered just putting his picture back on the top of the page originally (even though I think that depiction of Lois looks ugly, frankly---mostly for the tacky 80's clothes she's wearing), but opted to upload a different one altogether. Would just settle for either his image or one that looks as neutral but with less tacky clothes and *doesn't* involve Lois' clothes being ripped to shreds (like the "For Tomorrow" photo someone posted) or falling off a building with her legs/part of her rear end exposed---such as the "10 Cent Adventure" picture I posted for instance.

<dd>yeah i just want ANYTHING but the tacky eighties byrne one. or at least a byrne one that doesn't look ridiculously dated. i mean even the alex ross painting of when lois meets supes in Action #1. i was thinking something by ed benes where she is just wearing a business suit. or how she looked in infinite crisis #2 - <a href="../../../e/x/v/User%7EExvicious_5725.html" title="User:Exvicious">Exvicious</a> 18:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
