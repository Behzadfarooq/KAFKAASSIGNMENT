<p>Anti-Semitic People is an unnaceptable titile, first question: who determines who is Anti-Semitic. If you are going to list all members of the Nazi Party then thats over several million articles.

Battlefield, it's irrelevant how valid or useful, or otherwise, the category is. Someone has nominated it for deletion. The deletion procedure requires that people coming to look at it can see that it is being voted on; thus they can form their own judgement and go aand vote. If it really is a good category, then the people who have actually seen it will presumably be more likely to vote to keep it. So if you're happy with it, you should be happy to keep the deletion vote notice on it. But even if you're not, the rules say it must stay. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 15:43, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Yes it's pretty bad. Take German Rudolf, for example: neither the article, nor its talk page contains any kind of proof (or mentions) of anti-semitism, but he's in the list. That's just one example I see, I wonder how bad is it in general. As far as I can understand, deletion as of now has been refused because lack of consensus (sorry, not really experienced with deletion). I don't know about deletion, but this certainly deserves a stong disclaimer, as it is not (and probably can't be) fully NPOV, IMO. --Poison sf 23:38, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An attempt to delete this category has failed. Let's define who is qualified to be included here. I noticed that some of those who voted have only some fuzzy idea on the subject. As a FAQ, may I suggest article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and its links.</p>
<p>I propose to rename this into Category:Anti-Semitism (people) or Category:Anti-Semitism (individuals). It may include those individuals who were mentioned in connection to antisemitism, either as a victim or as a perptetrator. An alternative would be Category:Anti-Semitism (victims) and Category:Anti-Semitism (perpetrators). â<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">âÐ½Ñ?</a> 00:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise Proposal</span></h2>
<p>I recently participated in an interesting discussion on this category on #wikipedia. I've supported keeping this category because I think that it is useful to have a category that encompasses all the historical movements of anti-semitism. However, this category poses some significant epistemological problems. How do we determine who is an anti-semite? Personally, I think that there is a pretty good objective definition of anti-semitism, namely hostility or prejudice towards Jews, the difficulty is figuring out who meets that criteria. Some have suggested that only self-avowed anti-semites be added, but I don't think that someone's opinion on themselves is any more objective than other people's opinions about them. Clearly <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Nash_dbb6.html" title="John Nash">John Nash</a> is a mathematician, but as a result of his schizophrenia he might deny that fact, should we then not call him a mathematician? On the other hand, a judge determined that <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> was an anti-semite, something he denies. Surely someone whose job is to be objective should be a better source than the person himself, who cannot objectively evaluate himself because of possible delusions, or a fear of the world's reaction. Further, the self-avowed test would exclude historical anti-semites who any reasonable person would conclude clearly meet the criteria but never explicitly called themselves anti-semites. Clearly there needs to be a standard criteria for inclusion into this list, so here is a proposal:</p>
<p>To be included in this category, either</p>
<ul>
<li>A The person must be dead for at least 25 years AND Historians must have reached a consensus that this person was an anti-semite. This doesn't mean that one lone historian objects to that classification, but that the person is identified as an anti-semite in nearly all reputable historical accounts</li>
<li>OR, if the person has not been dead for 25 years than either</li>
<li>B. The individual must have an indisputable record of persecuting or participating in the persecution of Jews because they were Jews</li>
<li>OR</li>
<li>C. The individual must have a lengthy and indisputable record of hostile and inflammatory comments made against Jews on the basis of their religion</li>
<li>(B and C) are designed to include only the most blatant anti-semites such as perpetrators of the holocaust, it should not be used casually and editors who are not sure if a person should be included under this criteria should lean on the side of not including them).</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria would be stated explicitly on the category page.</p>
<p>Based on these criteria, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_Brunner_8898.html" title="Alois Brunner">Alois Brunner</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> would be acceptable entries in this category but <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> would not be.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear people's thoughts. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:23, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, "mathematician" is different IMO, because with it, the focus lies more on real life manifestations so to say. I.e. a person's actions define it, if somebody possibly has an ingenious grasp on math in his mind, but doesn't create new theories, solutions etc and doesn't work as professor, then I guess he's not called a mathematician in an encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd>Now, with anti-semitism, it's largerly trying to get into people's heads often. Of course, in cases when somebody willingly engineered or participated in large scale policies directed against jews as such, then it's pretty clear. Substantially less clear it is when it's based on words, as in many cases it's controversial what may be a legitimate critique of beliefs and behaviours dominant (or perceivably so) among jews, or among a visible minority of jews etc. Take anti-Nazi critique vs "anti-German" or omnipresent "racist prejudice" vs "anti-White", as an example. But it doesn't end here, and often becomes not even judging of words, but guessing of motivations and other such divination! Take German Rudolf. I didn't see any mention of anti-semitism (except the category name) in his article at all. I'm guessing the key is in the sentence describing him as a "holocaust denier". Now I did hear such heuristic "the evidence of the Holocaust is overhelming, therefore the denial proves an anti-semitic motive", but how is this for bad? IMO way too bad.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a>, your criteria is pretty sensible (except that I'm nore sure about usefullness of " on the basis of their religion" passage) for a "hard" one, it would certainly filter out most outrageous cases. Now, POSSIBLY, being even a "suspected" anti-semite or accused of it may be the information somebody may be interesting in. Say, while studying anti-semitism, to also look into the controversy surrounding it, find some disputed cases, maybe even examples of unscrupulous / slanderous / wrong usages of the term. Because of it some kind of collection of people with a "weaker" (in general) relation to anti-semitism may be useful.</dd>

<dd>I'm not quite sure what exactly to do, but the present form can certainly use improvement. Maybe even two categories somehow can be made so that people German Rudolf or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> are not "Hitlerized" by placing them in such a list. Or maybe a disclaimer, that some people inside have pretty weak, controversial, or even just alleged association with anti-semitism. --Poison sf 23:06, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A couple of quick points. By saying "on the basis of their religion" in C I am trying to weed out somebody adding John Smith to this category because John Smith thinks <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Allen_6fd3.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> is jackass. The problem is what to do if John Smith calls Woody Allen a money-grubbing jerk with a big nose - that sounds like an anti-semitic remark to me. The question is how many times does John Smith get to say something like that about Jews before we can reasonably conclude he's an anti-semite and add him to the category? Once? What if Woody Allen coincidentally happens to be greedy and has a big nose? Clearly your example (if I understand it correctly) of a Nazi who rants about an assault on the white race should be listed as an anti-semite here because the historical consensus is that that is anti-semitism. The problem is that if a neo-Nazi said that same stuff today he couldn't be listed under the criteria. I think that criteria C needs to be amended to include speech that is clearly anti-semitic but veiled, but I just don't know how to do it while disqualifying the guy who calls a Jewish guy who happens to be greedy greedy.</li>
<li>A holocaust denier who did not say anything about Jews but only challenged the facts of the holocaust would not be included in this category even though that person is probably an anti-semite. From the point of view of an encyclopedia this is probably a good thing since we wouldn't be labeling someone definitively when that person might not deserve those labels (although I really hope that the article page mentions whatever the ADL has to say about the person). <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well I agree to most of what you say. About religion - what I mean, is that, for example, Nazis couldn't care less if a jewish person is religious or not. Could be an absolute atheist, no difference. Perhaps "or having jewish ancestry" or something like that has to be added.</dd>

<dd>"Clearly" is in fact where the problem lies, since I doubt a criteria can be formulated about what is clear enough. For some, holocaust denial clearly indicates anti-semitism. Or critique of Israel etc. For criteria that only undisputable cases will pass, this is IMO unacceptable ambiguity, unless "veiled" means only something simplistic, like referring to jews via some other name or description.--Poison sf 02:42, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Eh, Mr. Isaac Brock I think the point is that it is usually not so simple to determine that someone is "clearly antisemitic". For you, perhaps, but not for everyone and certainly not based on any standard, widely recognized criteria. I think GabrielF's compromise solutions, if implemented, would possibly salvage this category, would prevent it from becoming a playground of ad hoc, unsourced and unverified judgments made by random editors in random articles. So I think his suggestions are very sensible. Thus, I predict they will garner little to no support. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:10, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The judgement over if a person is an anti-Semito or not should not be left in the hands of editors. If we have a reputable source saying that a person is an anti-Semite it's one thing, but to have any random editor adding persons to the category would be a misstake. For instance <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> was a member in Hitlerjugend. Should he be added? <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Icke</a> is suspeced of being an anti-Semite because some people thinks he is refering to Jews. Should he be added? <a href="../../../z/v/i/Zvi_Mazel_b4cf.html" title="Zvi Mazel">Zvi Mazel</a> have called former <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_minister.html" title="Foreign minister">foreign minister</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sten_Andersson_418d.html" title="Sten Andersson">Sten Andersson</a> and Sweden's <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> ambassador <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Schori_9ceb.html" title="Pierre Schori">Pierre Schori</a> "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional.html" title="Professional">professional</a> anti-Israelis".

<p>I appreciate GabrielF's thoughtful input on this thorny issue and his effort to come up with a compromise. However, I think it is far too restrictive (e.g., excluding David Irving). Better to simply follow Wiki's existing policies, such as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 17:23, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One problem with the category is that it's binary. It's no problem witht the clear-cut cases, but some a dubious. If it would be <i>Category:Allegedly anti-Semitic people</i> or <i>Category:People claimed to be anti-Semites</i> I don't think we would have the same problem. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Purpose, Function, Utility</span></h2>
<p>Resolved: The purpose here is not "name calling,â rather, it is to provide an index to individuals that are linked with antisemitism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Noteworthy individuals that have at least a "significant minority" (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> ) of historians, scholars or commentators that associate them or their works with antisemitism should be eligible for inclusion.</li>
<li>I think the problem of category inflation is overstated, since inclusion requires tagging of the individuals' article pages, other editors will naturally limit their inclusion. For example, see John Chrysostom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Chrysostom&amp;diff=35770681&amp;oldid=35764316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Chrysostom&amp;diff=35770681&amp;oldid=35764316" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, Martin Luther <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther&amp;diff=35944629&amp;oldid=35944258" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther&amp;diff=35944629&amp;oldid=35944258" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</li>
<li>The name of this category should reflect its purpose, function or utility. I agree that consideration should be given to renaming this as "Category:Anti-Semitism (people)." The introductory text would clarify that names listed have been associated with antisemitism by virture of their contributions, etc. to it rather than defense against it.

<p>Well I would like to <b>propose</b> that the category be <b>renamed</b> 'Anti-Semites', a perfectly comprehensible term, rather than the present clumsy title. We don't say 'communistic people' for 'communists', after all. But the page is protected, so I can't even put this up for discussion.

<dd>If anything, your proposed rename would make the category into even more of an epithet. Something like "people typically considered anti-semitic" would be better. Of course there'd still be the issue of what exactly constitutes such a threshold, but at least Wikipedia wouldn't be officially taking the position that they were anti-semitic.

<dd>I agree with Smerus, calling this category Anti-Semitism (people) as DoRight proposes just pushes things towards more obfuscation. If we're going to provide an index of people who are anti-semites we should call them what they are. Personally, I'd rather rename the category to 'Anti-Semites' and specify exactly what criteria should be used to determine inclusion (i.e. a consensus of historians agreeing the person was anti-semitic, or participation in persecution of Jews because they were Jews or a lengthy history of remarks attacking Jews) - this wouldn't eliminate the subjectivity issue, but it would allow us to add unambiguously anti-semitic people to the category while leaving the ambiguous ones up for debate.

<p>I fail to understand the controversy my proposal has unleashed. I hope no one is using it to grind their own axes on topics that have nothing to do with what I propose. It would be disheartening to find people indulging themselves by seeking to railroad straightforward, non-controversial, proposals.</p>
<p>Once again then: I <b>propose</b> in the interests of the English language, that this category be <b>re-named 'Anti-Semites'.</b> The category exists - I am not entering the debate as to who or what is an Anti-Semite. But as it does exist, it should have a title which is in concordance with English usage. There is no category for 'Communistic People', 'People who live in London', etc. etc, because there are perfectly good English words such as Communists, Londoners, etc. etc. 'Anti-Semitic People' is a dictionary definition for 'Anti-Semites' - but it is not a phrase which would be generally used in writing or conversation. Example: Very rarely someone may say/write 'Hitler/Wagner/ (or who ever) was an Anti-Semitic Person', 95%+ of the time they say/write '...was an Anti-Semite'. Therefore any debate on my proposal should not involve any debate as to 'what is an Anti-Semite?' but should stick simply to the issue of English usage. And I would like someone to explain to me the WP mechanism for formally proposing this name-change for debate when the main page for the category is locked, as in the present case.

Frankly I don't give a flying frankfurter which spelling is used and I definitely don't want to be dragged down in to some hair-splitting, navel-gazing debate on the topic. As regards the other debate, I will just try to stick with this one, as long as it can be kept on the rails.

<p>Doright, asking for a citation and confirmation that we are not in violation of copyright is in <b>no</b> way "harassment."

<dd>Slrubenstein, I think you're a bit off on this one. First, if you actually read my reply you would see that I provided a link to the wikipedia page from which the poem was cut and pasted. In fact the poem is so famous that it has its own Wikipedia article. It is one of the most famous poems of the 20th century. Second, you know or should know that the editors, in fact, knew who the "original author" was. Of course, that's exactly why the editors issued their edit "Plagerism challenge." Your attempts to justify the editors' evil speech has no connection to reality. The editor states his purpose explicitly. Their edit summary is labeled, "Plagerism challenge." What's the challenge except to show I'm the original author of one of the most famous poems from the holocaust? By the way, I'm also the "original author" of The Gettysburg Address. Suggesting that I'm trying to take credit for authoring this famous poem is transparent mean spirited harassment. That this is not clear to you is a bit surprising. Eariler, the editor wrote, " ...I think the best way to deal with these high school kids with such bad attitudes is to ignore and not respond to them. Perhaps in a few years they may acquire some maturity, but in the meanwhile they are not worth the time to explain why their edits are reverted ... "; then StanZegel writes to CTSWyneken: "An anonymous editor is like a sniper in a tree top, taking pot shots at those trying to do serious work on the ground, and dropping his waste matter into the work in progress. I'm not sure that anything such a person attempts to add is worth verifying but should be summarily deleted on the basis that a responsible person would identify himself. If the material is truly worthy, a responsible scholar will get around to adding it. In the present case, I believe we are dealing with a sock puppet for an editor who has been banned previously for similar activity and may be on probation right now. If so, that probation is being violated, and keeping his edits or wasting time on his "contributions" simply enables continuing violations.--StanZegel (talk) 03:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)." The editors also write: No one knows the vicious blasphemy that prompted Luther's book. I guess Luther over reacted because He was a deeply religious man. The Jews must learn to forgive. There was an interesting play in the 60s called something like The Man in the Glass Booth about the trial of a Holocaust perpetrator. The man was not a Nazi or a Holocaust perpetrator at all: he had one of those concentration camp numbers tatooed on his arm. He was a Jew, who was consumed with his hatred. Dave, as I look more into this, and read the summary of the 1543 pamphletOn the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther), I cannot help but see the parallels in those recommended actions in context with those done against the Palastinians since 1948. I guess it matters whose ox is being gored. --StanZegel (talk) 11:35, 3 November 2005 (UTC) You are so right about this. It had even been discussed in Israel about deporting all of the Palestinians out of the region. I remember my professor Dr. Erich Kiehl, who spent many years in the Holy Land, who said that the Israelis should not have been simply given the land of others, namely the Palestinians. Both must seek to coexist. Thank you for your even temperedness and editorial genius. drboisclair 11:45, 3 November 2005 (UTC) A Biblical Archeologist told me that in today's Holy Land, Christians do not count at all. I think we are only 3% of the population. This was brought home to me in the aftermath of a massacre by a militant Zionist at the Tomb of the Patriarchs: Jews and Muslims were henceforth to use separate doors, reserved exclusively for them. No door for Christians who might want to visit. (I think that for our $3 billion sent there annually, we might be allowed in the door?) --StanZegel (talk) 11:55, 3 November 2005 (UTC) --Best Regards,<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 17:55, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A link is not a citation. Simply because some editors know a famous poem does not mean that all do. So it is important to, at the very least, indicate the author to whom the work is attributed. Since that author is mentioned in the first paragraph of the page about the poem, this is very easy to do. This is especially important when the resource is an internet source. These files move. Sometimes they're deleted. Wikipedia editors should take the time to be sure they cite even these resources as fully as possible. That way, if the link breaks, the information can still be traced. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 20:49, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now it's not enough that I had provided the link to the Wikipedia Article about the poem. A full and complete citation is required for this talk page quip. Here's the link again <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_they_came....html" title="First they came...">First they came...</a> . But, this link is no good, even though it is done throughout Wikipedia for every other page, because according to you the page might move or the link may break. Really? Since the link is to a Wikipedia page, if it "moves" a redirect will be implemented. Not to worry. If you or your mate actually had that concern, then why suggest I was trying to take credit for this famous poem? Also, you could have just as well fixed the alleged "problem" yourself. But, you did not. Further, If this is still such a problem, why did you again and again and again not fix it? If a name is required, "if the link breaks," why have you not added the name? Afterall, you now admit, "that author is mentioned in the first paragraph" of the linked article. BTW, are you aware that this is a talk page, not an article page? Seriously, try to focus on the articles and not me. I'm flattered, but am I really that important? That you don't like being identified with antisemites is understandable, but that is your choice and burden, not mine. I did not call you an an antisemite. However, repeatedly censoring, deleting and whitewashing antisemitism makes Wikipedia less valuable. Antisemitism denial is similar to holocaust denial, and flows from the same stream, IMHO.<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 00:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please look at the poem above. When it was added to this page as an attack on fellow editors, user Doright did not even identify the author, which he has not done to this moment. It was suggested that he do so. He followed it up with more personal attacks, which you have noticed above. Since this user has a history of not attributing material to its sources, misattributing them, etc. (See the talk pages for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_and_the_Jews_9d61.html" title="Martin Luther and the Jews">Martin Luther and the Jews</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_e96c.html" title="On the Jews and Their Lies">On the Jews and Their Lies</a>) I think it's reasonable to ask him to do this much. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 10:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<cite>CTSWyneken, Concern with proper citations is nice. However, then you falsify the citations provided by other editors. Stripping the citation, as you did, of the authority it garners by being cited in "Luther's Works," you diminish its authority. POV so extreme that leads to plagiarizing references surely cannot be considered proper. Please correct your falsification of the reference you edited in the first paragraph. The citation was clearly to On The Jews and Their Lies footnote 173 in "Luther's Works." I even had a link to it so that it would be completely unambiguous. Of course, you removed that too. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 17:54, 23 December 2005 (UTC) By the way, this is similar to the intellectual dishonesty and misrepresentation exposed here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29#Responding_to_Apologetics_for_antisemitism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29#Responding_to_Apologetics_for_antisemitism" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 18:24, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</cite> "</p>

<p>Humus, I agree with your concern regarding the ad hominem nature of the discussion and your observation, "the requirements for citations in <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">talk pages</a> are not the same as in the articles." Hopefully, more need not be said on this topic and if other editors want to correct any perceived deficiencies in the posting of the poem, they will avail themselves of their ability to edit it. For example, CTSWyneken has deleted entire portions of my talk section contributions in the past, surely then he can add the "original author" if he thinks it's required. However, as noted in the poems article section titled, "Controversy over origin and text" , "The poem's exact origin is unclear."[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came...#Controversy_over_origin_and_text" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came...#Controversy_over_origin_and_text" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>] Cheers,<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 20:11, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is one of the most rediculous, petty, and vidictive things that I've ever seen here on Wikipedia, and that's saying a whole lot. For someone to make an official complaint over the fact that <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">User:Doright</a> forgot to put a citation on his quotation of an extremely famous poem a on talk page is beyond rediculous. I'm incredulous that people would waste so much time arguing over something so stupid. Obviously the complaint was motivated by some other personal hostility and not by any bona fide concern about plagerism. Generic69 20:22, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Martin Luther was deleted from both "anti-semitism" and "anti-semitic people" categories. I restored them, however, Drboisclair immediately reverted my restoration of the "Anti-Semitic people" category to the Martin Luther article, claiming in his edit summary (as though it's a settled matter) that this category is being renamed.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 20:06, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guillou should be removed from this list. I cantÂ´t find anything that would make him worthy of being on this list. Well if you equal some anti-israel opinions as antisemitism you maybe could.

<dd>You and Slarre are both incorrect; your logic is fine but your premises are false. "French" is not a race. "Jewish" <i>is</i>. "French" is defined as "a citizen of France", therefore to be anti-France is to be against French people by definition, because since France is democratic in nature, the actions of France are decided by the French people. "Jewish" is <i>not</i> defined as "a citizen of Israel", and therefore it is possible to be against Israel without being against Jews specifically. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 02:27, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I cannot see any point in attempting a serious reply to that. The sheer chutzpah of accusing <i>me</i> of incivility when you're jumping all over me like a junkyard dog (not to mention making offensive insinuations) is staggering. You seem to be utterly impervious to irony, so I'm all out of tools to work with here. I see now there is no possible productive way for me to engage in civil discourse with you, much as I would like to. You seem to be very erudite and well-spoken, but also too willing to assume the worst of anyone you disagree with. If you want to <i>convince</i> anyone of the rightness of your views, Doright, you must first treat them and <i>their</i> views with a modicum of patience and respect. This is the very essence of the concept of "civility" which you are so fond of mentioning. Otherwise, you will only "win" arguments because people will give up on talking to you and stop listening. I can assure you, their silence does not indicate agreement. You also might want to do some research on <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanlon%27s_Razor_789c.html" title="Hanlon's Razor">Hanlon's Razor</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">As a Luther Scholar I object to his name on this prejudiced category</span></h2>
<p>The question of whether or not Martin Luther engaged in the crime of antisemitism is a matter of debate among Luther scholars. His inclusion here is at the behest of an editor, who is pushing his POV. This characterization is debatable. With all of the posturing about being an NPOV online resource, the existence of this category on Wikipedia is the establishment of a POV. I object to Martin Luther's being listed here, and I would be glad to discuss the matter with anyone.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">List of Nazi Party leaders and officials</span></h2>
<p>I am certainly aware that anti-semitism and far worse, the Final Solution was part of the NAZI ideology. My question is, is it accurate to have an all-inclusive list of NAZI party leaders, and say each and every one of them was anti-semetic? I have little doubt that many (most?) of them were, but I don't know that they all were. Please forgive me for witholding my name, but I really don't want to be flamed by someone incorrectly accusing me of holocaust denial. 68.11.51.44 07:46, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-What nonsense page this is! What is a Semite?! Thus what is an anti-Semite?! Jews hate Arabs, Arabs hate Jews--fellow semites murduring each other? Semitic is a a linguistic term--not the definition of a people! Furthurmore, since when were Khazars (Eastern European pagans) converts to Judaism ever the descendants of a Semitic-speaking people of the middle-east? This whole category is absurdity to the extreme. Do you know how many Jews would fit in this category if you were to take even the slightest criticism of Political Zionism, Judahism and Talmudism?!! Will they be categorised as anti-semites too?! I suppose those Jews who belittle the holocaust (one of the gravest sins of "anti-semites") should also be categorised as such. This is garbage issued by Know-nothings and so-called "Semites"! --68.146.186.180 23:14, 13 May 2006 (UTC)antinutjobs</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Standards?</span></h2>
<p>Looking at the pages listed in this cat, I see some obvious ones and some non-obvious ones. I'm very concerned as to whether there are any objective, impartial guidelines in place for deciding upon whom to bestow this badge of infamy? Claims of anti-semitism carry great negative power, and Wikipedia must have guidelines to prevent the use of such labelling to smear and libel.</p>
<p>When a person reads a page like this, or any of the articles on the people listed here, and reads the term "anti-semitic", I'd suppose their immediate mental image is of a person who hates Jews and constantly speaks ill of them. But some of the names here seem to have been added to the cat on the strength of one sourced anti-semitic comment. I have no intention of apologizing for anti-semitic comments, but a single negative comment is hardly a way of life. People can change, or say something they later regret. Wikipedia's standard should be, a person who has a known habit of making anti-semitic statements, or has repeatedly stated, or published, material with a pervasive bias against Jews. It is irresponsible of us to have lax standards here; by doing so we merely open this category up to being used as a tool for ad hominem attacks.</p>

As to which was sourced by only one comment, I must admit I can't remember which one I meant. I remember coming to this category from an article on a person with one sourced comment, and I remember thinking that one source was not enough to make such a broad accusation based on.

<dd>One different example I have found, though, is Martin Niemoller. From reading his bio, I feel a very clear picture is shown of a man who conformed to prevailing anti-semitic notions and later learned of his folly, overcame his prejudices, and became an opponent of anti-semitism. There can be no greater admission of guilt and shame than his immortal words "then they came for the Jews, and I said nothing, because I was not a Jew." Yet there are sources supporting that he was anti-semitic at one point in his life, and there he is on the list with Eichmann. I think that most people, when exposed to a list purporting to detail "anti-semitic people", do not have a mental picture of people who reformed in later life. I'm not saying Niemoller was added as a deliberate smear or anything like that. I'm just saying that "anti-semitic" is awfully powerful language, and there needs to be a strict and clear guideline for inclusion in the category, both to prevent deliberate abuse and to deal with questions like the issue of reform. Of course, the problem with this is that that decision itself is a subjective matter, and probably best avoided by not even having the category. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 14:33, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cordially replying I say that calling Luther or other people before the 19th Century anti-semites is oblivious of history. This is a matter of debate whether Luther's anti-Jewish writings are either anti-semitic or anti-judaic. Perhaps we should have a anti-christian category for all of those that hate Christians. Something to think about. As to whether Luther is in this category he might be in good company because I read that there are some on this website that are thinking of putting William Shakespeare in this category. This category is prejudicial. I imagine that even Jesus Christ might be put into it before long. I am only asking that people be given the benefit of the doubt. Hitler, Goebbels, Himler, yes. But Shakespeare and Luther, no. No other encyclopedia has such a category. Well, some have posted, they do not have our <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy! Well, that is all the more reason for removing it. Thankyou.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The polarization of insisting on this category</span></h2>
<p>I would like to make a few observations on the general result of insisting on this category. The vote to delete it seems to be going in favor of those who want to keep it. Be that as it may, keeping it may be a win for them, but a Phyrric victory in the polarization that it continues to cause here on this website. Instead of building bridges it widens chasms between all of us. Why not make a compelling argument on by understating a thing rather than overstating it? You get your point across better. Keeping this category plays right into the hands of an antagonist like Doright who delights in setting people the one against the other. It is the pushing of a POV when NPOV is touted as the soul of this website.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting this category would create a bad precedent</span></h2>
<p>I fail to see why keeping the category would be "polarizing" and deleting it would not be "polarizing." I fail to see why the very existence of this category could be considered offensive. After all, I am sure we would all agree that there are anti-Semitic people. While subjective human judgment is required in creating such a category, that is true for all Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>I think that singling out this category for deletion for the reasons stated on the Rfd page would create a very bad precedent.</p>
<p>If uniformly applied, it would mean that similar categories would have to be deleted as well. I just stumbled upon this discussion on a user page and to be frank was not even aware there was such a category until today. I was, therefore, alarmed by the proposed deletion.</p>
<p>I also don't agree with the references in the preceding comments to the existence of this category being a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Perhaps the gentleman can explain. It seems to me that if a person is correctly included in this category, there can be no such problem to any reasonable editor. Yes there will be debate, but I don't believe a debate on this category is inherently more polarizing than debates on anything else.</p>
<p>I have been involved in discussions on esoteric securities trading issues that get extremely heated, believe me!</p>
<p>It seems to me that as long as the policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is strictly applied, there should be no difficulty.</p>
<p>Yes, on all subjects of this kind there will be tensions, as indicated by the comments on this page, but that does not mean that Wikipedia should throw up its hands and abdicate its responsibility to tackle difficult and controversial subjects. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 21:13, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mantanmoreland, nicely stated. The claim that "keeping the category would be 'polarizing'" does beg the question why deleting it would not be 'polarizing'?" Re-reading Drboisclair's "Phyrric victory in the polarization," it appears to be more of a prayer over sour grapes than an argument. If history is a guide, there can be little doubt that Drboisclair's self-fulfilling prophesey is on its way. For example attempts to delete articles of their entire contents merge them out of existence or otherwise "whitewash" them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29&amp;diff=33349880&amp;oldid=33345340" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29&amp;diff=33349880&amp;oldid=33345340" rel="nofollow">[16]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29&amp;diff=33375751&amp;oldid=33349880" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29&amp;diff=33375751&amp;oldid=33349880" rel="nofollow">[17]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29&amp;diff=33329971&amp;oldid=33319352" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29&amp;diff=33329971&amp;oldid=33319352" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther/archive2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther/archive2" rel="nofollow">[19]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther/archive4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther/archive4" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther" rel="nofollow">[21]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther_and_the_Jews/Archive_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther_and_the_Jews/Archive_2" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29/Archive1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28Martin_Luther%29/Archive1" rel="nofollow">[23]</a><a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 22:37, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wish to post my objection to this new attack by User:Doright. All this kind of adversarial exchange via links causes bad feelings. Some of us like myself have made it a lifetime project of studying Martin Luther. We want Luther to be given a fair shake. Because I am a Lutheran I feel that putting him in this category insults my faith; however, since the majority of Wikipeers deem it necessary, I must deferâI will not engage in edit war. To help the reader understand what I mean I say that it would be similar to casting aspersions on persons like Rabbi Hillel, Akivah, and Shammai among the Jewish people and the Prophet Mohammed among Muslim people. We Lutherans are raked over the coals by User:Doright and his campaign to vilify not only Luther but us as well. <b>We do not intend to whitewash anything.</b> What User:Doright does not mention is that we have had to "grow" in our understanding of the consequences of what Luther wrote and did. The polarization comes with running roughshod over persons who are highly regarded by millions of people throughout the world. Other encyclopedias see the need of being more sensitive to others' religious feelings. By his activities User:Doright incites conflict and increases polarization. If User:Doright lifts me among others up for ridicule because we care about how Luther is presented, he reveals his own strong POV by relentlessly attacking us. At best, it is bad form to ubiquitously single out editors for accusation and ridicule as User:Doright does, and I formally request that he stop it.

<dd>Not if the checks and balances provided by WP:V are applied. I am not familiar with the article so I cannot say one way or the other.</dd>
<dd>The issue of whether Martin Luther was anti-Semitic is separate from the issue of whether there should be such a category. I would urge that the two issues be evaluated separately. Certainly it is not a good idea to remove this category just because of concerns that people may have re the inclusion of Martin Luther. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 17:49, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it were up to me, there would be no categories for -ism's on Wikipedia. People should have to read the article if they want to know about the person. It's this constant human urge to slap a label on everyone that bugs me. When you shrink a person down small enough to fit them in a box, you remove everything that makes them human. Categorization is a first step towards dehumanization, and if it were up to me, there would be no categories and labels at Wikipedia: just articles. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 00:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, but there are categories for a wide variety of "isms" on WP. Singling out the "anti-Semites" category for deletion as "subjective" while leaving the other labels alone strikes me as troubling to say the least. Frankly I think it will be damaging to WP's reputation were that to occur. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 01:16, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Eh. If there were votes on the others, I'd vote to delete them, too. But <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> would seem to apply... my opinion is very much in the minority. It may seem cynical; perhaps it is, but I'm willing to settle for deleting at least the most harmful categories. And I consider this category to be indeed harmful, unless as I mentioned above, standards for inclusion were decided upon by consensus. However, from reading the arguments between Doright and Drboisclair, it appears there are more than one opinion on just what anti-semitism is. In light of this, how can we have a category when there is disagreement over what the definition is? The issues Doright and Drboisclair raise are new to me, and I haven't had time to study them and come to a decision, so my "conditional delete" vote is based largely on my feeling that the use of labels with loaded content have a tendency to reduce understanding rather than increase it. But now I'm beginning to think this category may also suffer from semantic problems as well. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 01:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think there are multiple definitions of anti-semitism. Anti-semitism is quite clearly defined in any dictionary -"hostility to or prejudice against Jews" in mine for example - and it is easier than people here seem to think to decide if someone should be included. Clearly Martin Luther fits the definition, to quote <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_and_the_Jews_9d61.html" title="Martin Luther and the Jews">Martin Luther and the Jews</a> <i>"he wrote that Jews' synagogues should be set on fire, prayerbooks destroyed, rabbis forbidden to preach, homes "smashed and destroyed," property seized, money confiscated, and that these "poisonous envenomed worms" be drafted into forced labor or expelled "for all time." [3] He also appeared to sanction their murder."</i> Clearly this is hostility to and prejudice against Jews! I think that what is happening is that people are changing the definition of anti-semitism in order to confound and obfuscate the issue of whether someone was an anti-semite. For example other editors argued earlier that Arabs couldn't be anti-semitic because Arabs are Semites, but this is simply not the definition of anti-semitism as it appears in the dictionary. I can understand why people do this - nobody likes having their heroes associated with racism. However, it runs counter to what wikipedia stands for. I would argue (see the compromise proposal section above for the whole argument which I made quite some time ago) that we should clearly spell out the definition of anti-semitism and a criteria for inclusion and judge cases based on that criteria. I think that if we do this we can clearly see that most of the listings in the category were in fact undisputably anti-semites under the dictionaries definition. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 04:20, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>GabrielF, thank you. I do find it remarkable with all the wild claims of abuse of this category that despite my request to identify articles that do not belong in the category, only two articles are currently being contested in this discussion, Lutheran Pastor <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Niem%C3%B6ller_4b7c.html" title="Martin NiemÃ¶ller">Martin NiemÃ¶ller</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>. I believe that anyone even marginally versed in the history of antisemitism would find them to be properly categorized here. However, I do welcome rational debate, but, as you point out, attempts to "confound and obfuscate" the issues are fairly transparent, for example, the title of this discussion section.<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 05:21, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your reply, Gabriel. When I spoke of semantic problems, definition of terms was exactly what was on my mind. As I've said above, what we need are clear standards of what anti-semitism <i>is</i> before we can go applying it as a label to people. Your definition, for example, seems fine to me. But I'm not yet convinced that a consensus definition has been arrived at, which is what I meant when I said there were semantic problems. To my mind there is a vast difference between a person who says a single nasty thing about Jews, and <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">someone</a> who ordered their mass execution - yet as far as I can tell (and forgive me if I'm mistaken), both people are equally likely to be included in this category due to the fuzziness of standards of inclusion. I'd say the public perception of what an anti-semite is, lies somewhere between these two extremes (meaning example 1 is underqualified, while as we all know example 2 is definitely overqualified). I really have a hard time believing that a single term can cover such a wide possible variety of behaviors and attitudes without misrepresentations.</dd>

<dd>I would only be in favor of keeping this category if a.) there were a consensus on <i>precisely</i> what anti-semitism is (and let me point out, I have absolutely no ego staked on <i>which</i> definition is eventually decided on, <i>as long as we pick one and stick with it</i>), b.) clear policies were decided upon for measuring people by that definition, and c.) multiple reliable sources were absolutely required in order to win someone a seat in this hall of shame. I understand that many have a desire to see a category like this exist, but I remain very worried about it. If it lacks clear standards for usage, it will eventually be used in order to slander and libel. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is one of the most important standards we have.</dd>

<dd>Of course, this is all included within my grudging willingness to go along with there being such categories at all. As I've already said, I think bio cats are a bad idea because they allow, even encourage, readers not to <i>think</i> about the people they are reading about. They are too blunt and generalized to convey any real information about a human being, and therefore they mislead. But I'm well aware no one agrees with me on that, so I'm willing to work to at least minimize this effect. Subjective categories definitely need strong guidelines.

<dd>Kasreyn, you suggest "a person who says a single nasty thing about Jews" is very likely to be included in this category, so much so that they are "equally likely to be included as someone who ordered their mass execution." If that is the case, prove it.

<dd>A preposterous notion. I am opposing weak standards as a matter of principle. Just because something bad may not have already happened is no reason for a thinking person to fail to put reasonable safeguards in place to prevent it. All I am saying is that there are not currently any consensus-based standards in place to prevent such a thing, and without such standards, I must vote to delete this category to prevent any possibility of such a thing occurring. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 06:44, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I tend to agree with GabrielF that the very structure of Wikipedia already provides significant checks and balances and that there may be no need to become "overwrought." Furthermore, I would like to point out that improperly including an article in the category is only one type of error we may make (i.e., Type I error). The other is improperly NOT including an article (i.e., Type II error). I believe the empirical evidence supports the notion that Type II errors are more prevalent here than Type I. For example, see <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>.

<dd>(sigh) Clearly you've misunderstood me. In your quote of my reasoning, you're leaving out the part where I said "as far as I can tell (and please forgive me if I'm wrong)", the exclusion of which gives a false impression of my statement. I have also never "repeated" it as you erroneously claim, and until now, that was the only time I'd said it. My statement was, indeed, based on the category's status "as far as I (could) tell". The Afd hasn't ended and I don't know of any change to the community's consensus regarding the article's standards, so, what I could tell "as far as I can tell" <i>then</i> hasn't changed, so it's <i>still</i> "as far as I can tell". This is the operative phrase which you keep glossing over.</dd>

<p>Kasreyn, you have to explain what you said only because you keep contradicting yourself and you donât seem to remember what you say from one paragraph to the next. You did not merely claim that a person COULD be included who "said a single nasty thing about Jews." You said, they are as âLIKELY to be included in this categoryâ as âsomeone who ordered their mass execution.â And yes, you REPEATEDLY make unsupported claims. First [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=53488969&amp;oldid=53068597" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=53488969&amp;oldid=53068597" rel="nofollow">here you say âsome of the names here seem to have been added to the cat on the strength of one sourced anti-semitic comment.â</a> ] AND THEN [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=55024265&amp;oldid=55021392" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=55024265&amp;oldid=55021392" rel="nofollow">here you say âsomeone who ordered their mass execution - yet as far as I can tell (and forgive me if I'm mistaken), both people are equally likely to be included in this category due to the fuzziness of standards of inclusion.â</a>]. My parsimonious deletion of your <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">Weasel word</a>âs had zero effect on the meaning of your statements. Really, I don't get it. You're a bright guy, I shouldn't have to explain what I've already said. Finally, regarding what you referred to as my âpreposterousâ âmistaken beliefâ was neither preposterous nor my belief. What I asked for was evidence that supported your claim. If your statement regarding the probability of a person of a certain class being included were true, surely the fact that you can not find a single actual case where it occurred suggests that your claim (or hypothesis) is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, I respectfully request that you do not burden the reader by making such claims in the future.

<dd>Kasreyn, thank you for your well thought-out reply. I agree with most of what you're saying. I added wikipedia's definition of anti-semitism to the top of the Category page, it is remarkably similar to the Oxford American dictionary (and probably every other dictionary in the world). I actually proposed a fairly strict standard for inclusion in this category some time ago (see Compromise Proposal above) and I addressed exactly the issue you brought up of including a person who might have made one anti-semitic crack. Now I think I should have taken the initiative and implemented it months ago. I absolutely agree that standards for inclusion are necessary, but I would argue that your fears about the category being used for "slander and libel" are perhaps overwrought. Given the extremely negative connotation of being labeled an anti-semite in our society in these days I find it hard to believe that an edit categorizing as an anti-semite would last very long if the evidence for that person's actually being an anti-semite was flimsy. Further, none of the names that I recognized in the category are disputable. Additionally, an advantage of categories over lists is that the debate over inclusion happens at the article page, where people who (hopefully) actually understand the subject of the article can discuss whether inclusion is appropriate, not at a separate list page which the most informed editors on the subject might not be aware of. I wish that categories were less black-and-white in their approach as well, but my approach would be to petition the developers to allow entries in categories to contain more information than just a name rather than to switch everything to lists.</dd>
<dd>Regardless, its an interesting conversation, and one I'm glad we're having. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 06:53, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed! I think we have a good understanding here. There is one example I can raise which seems to speak to the black-and-white aspect of the approach, which is Martin Niemoller. I certainly would not dispute that at one time in his life he displayed every sign of being anti-semitic, and if he had died during or soon after WWII, I wouldn't give it a second thought. But some of his actions and statements post-war - though these are disputed, as noted in the article on him, seem very out-of-character with the accepted notion of an anti-semitic person. His poem, "First they came..." (whose authorship has also been disputed) seems to me to express shame or guilt over his essential complicity in crimes against Jews. Expressions of shame and guilt are not part of the typical public perception of what an anti-semitic person is like. We don't have a category for "former anti-semites" or "reformed anti-semites", and with good reason: there are so few, and it's an <i>extremely</i> subjective thing to say. I know this is just my personal opinion; <i>I</i> believe Niemoller learned his lesson and reformed; I know others here don't. Let me just say I have a hard time seeing the author of such words given the same label as a man like Eichmann, who would have calmly executed Niemoller himself for writing them. I'm willing to come to a compromise, of course. And I think you're right, of course; here is probably not the best place to oppose such labelling, but on the individual pages, where one can find the editors who know the subject matter best. That being said, I should probably end this long tangent I've gone off on.

<dd>Not everyone shares your sanguinity or interpretation of âthey came for the Jews, and I said nothing, because I was not a Jew." Some realize that many of those that âsaid nothingâ said nothing because they are, in fact, antisemites, not merely because they are ânot a Jew.â Secondly, even if for the purposes of discussion I granted the claim that NiemÃ¶ller was a âformer antisemite,â how much of oneâs life has to be spent as an antisemite to meet your criteria? For example, is a deathbed conversion by Hitler sufficient to be excluded from the category? Interestingly, your argument for exclusion hinges on the claim that late in his life he reformed. Yet, others make the same argument for not including Martin Luther by claiming that he did not evidence antisemitism until late in life. So, whatâs the deal? If at any point in oneâs life they were not an antisemite they should not be included? By the way, I think you mentioned that you read a bio on NiemÃ¶ller.

<dd>My previous post in response to GabrielF was an attempt to sum up, close, and apologize for already having taken up too much space with my ramblings. I've already gone into more than sufficient detail about my beliefs. I can't think of anything I could add which wouldn't simply be repeating something I've already said. I'm not interested in being drawn into further debate when I have nothing more to say which couldn't be gleaned from what I've already written with a fair and impartial reading.

<p>(If I may return take the liberty of restoring the left margin)-- this has been a fascinating and stimulating dialogue on the part of both sides. I understand Kasreyn's concerns, but remain troubled by the effort to remove this category. I think that this dialogue actually shows how important it is to retain this category.</p>
<p>Also I would add that all of us have to take a realistic view of our heroes. Martin Niemoller is one of my heroes. I read once that others of his compatriots in the German resistance, including Stauffenberg, also held anti-Semitic views. I have no opinion upon whether that puts them in the category of anti-Semites. If indeed that is an accurate description of Niemoller, those of us who admire such people need to accept that.</p>
<p>That being said, there needs to be logical limits to inclusion in this category. If person X wrote a book that was anti-Semitic, I can see how one can argue in favor of his inclusion. However, I am sure that one can find anti-Semitic statements attributed to Oskar Schindler, if one looked hard enough. Should he be included? However, such concerns should not be used as an excuse to simply toss out the category.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 13:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mantanmoreland, I too am with you on this category in principle, despite the obvious epistemic problems. I created another category to address those problems. It included a definition and criteria for inclusion that did not include labeling the totality of a person's being as an "anti-semitic person." However, without commenting on the veracity of the arguments, my recollection of the reasons for its deletion included, a particular historical figure should not be included in the category, no one should be in the category, it could include many of the people already in this category, and it was premature to create such a category because creation of the category requires a consensus among editors of this category.</dd>
<dd>After the current vote to keep this category from deletion is over, I'll continue to monitor the discussion to see if the time has ripened to properly address what are in my opinion valid epistemological concerns raised by <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">User:Kasreyn</a> and others. I thank you for your thoughtfulness and your attempt to keep the dialog constructive. However, I'm not sure what you mean by "remarks addressed personally to other editors?"

<dd>I accept your apology without reservation as I have in the past. For my part, I'm sorry. And, I regret any ill feelings my participation has engendered. Scholarship and collegial discussion should be a joy, a shared pleasure. While I have no idea which of your religious convictions you refer to, I am pretty sure it's none of my business. I'm just glad you no longer feel you're in a religious battle against "Jews consumed with hatred" perpetrating a vendetta against Martin Luther. I hope you might consider this not a battle lost, but the end of viewing participation as a war. It should always be about rational discourse, not imposing our wills. This is all I ever asked for and will always insist upon. Barely a day goes by where I'm not attacked by someone interested in disassociating Luther from antisemitism. You ask me to reconsider providing links to your/their previous discussions. You characterize this as "singling people out for accusation by copying and linking things in a bill of particulars." I assume <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people#Martin_Luther" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people#Martin_Luther" rel="nofollow">this</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=55012876&amp;oldid=55010796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=55012876&amp;oldid=55010796" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>] is the most recent example of what you are referring to.

I'm sorry. I hope you can see the difference between merely providing a link to, or text of, what you actually wrote versus the libel of, for example, repeatedly and falsely accussing me of being a "sock puppet for a banned editor." I think it important to not personalize the vote to keep this category, or Luther in it, as "my cause." The "cause" is the cause of scholarship and the Wiki process of creating an encyclopedia. As far as Iâm concerned the only thing that should be personal is the personal respect we demonstrate for one another.</dd>

<dd>I delight in your offer to make a new beginning, and repair broken Wikirelationships. Towards that end, let's try to address one of the issues that concern you. You have argued that, among other reasons, Luther should not be identified with antisemitism because the term is modern, whereas Luther died a half of milenium ago. Regarding Martin Luther, you said, "I believe that <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_e96c.html" title="On the Jews and Their Lies">On the Jews and Their Lies</a> is Antisemitic," but because his antisemitism was based upon a different theoretical justification (i.e., religious) than that of the Nazi's, he should not be called an antisemite nor he or his writings associated with antisemitism. However, you have been provided with abundant evidence, for example, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=anti-Semitism" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=anti-Semitism" rel="nofollow">here</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=54443946&amp;oldid=54421864" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Anti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=54443946&amp;oldid=54421864" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Judaism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Judaism" rel="nofollow">here</a> and literally dozens of times elsewhere that your demand to limit the usage of the term to "racial" antisemitism does not comport with the generally accepted definition, usage or meaning. What say you?</dd>

<dd>This has been a learning experience for me. The religious convictions I was speaking of have to do with my considering Luther an important religious teacher of my faith when he is not spouting hatred, which is against our faith. Luther has done much good, but he let his emotions get the better of him.</dd>
<dd>At the bottom of all of this there <b>may</b> be a difference between antisemitism of Luther's day and antisemitism of Hitler's day. I am reading a study of Luther in context of ancient and medieval antisemitism. All in all we cannot whitewash the truth. People aren't perfect, but that is no excuse for evil and hatred. I agree with you that we have to examine everything we can to get to the bottom of the matter. Thank you for your kind reply. This is a new beginning.

<dd>Itâs a pleasure to address you in this collegial tone. I understand and respect the religious convictions youâve described. No doubt, aspects of our shared humanity (yours, mine, Lutherâs, etc.) can be a bitter pill to swallow, best followed with a large gulp of compassion and humility. Many great people have done much good, and have also done evil. Consider for example, King Davidâs dealings with Bath-Sheba and Uriah the Hittite. Torah says, âThe deed that David had done was deemed evil in the eyes of Hashem.â Torah and Jewish scholarly tradition embrace shortcomings in how we deal with our humanity as an opportunity to learn and improve. Of course, antisemites have taken advantage of Jewish self-criticism as a fertile source of gathering âdirtâ on the Jews. The same risk applies to Lutherans, when we discuss Luther.</dd>

<dd>Pointing to Lutherâs emotions, obscures what I think is the more useful direction of inquiry. That is, what beliefs and biases against Jews does Luther reveal about himself and the tradition of Christian Antisemitism that was his milieu? Further, what did Luther uniquely contribute to the history of antisemitism? It is sometimes only in anger that we are compelled to tell the truth. Thus, allowing our underlying hatreds to be revealed to others. Wikipedia is not here to make a moral judgment about whether Luther was a good or bad person.</dd>

<dd>Sure there are differences in antisemtism and varying excusing provided by antisemties throughout history for their antisemitsm. In any age, you will find that the rationalization for antisemtism includes whatever is considered to be most heinous at the time, whether deicide, refusing to convert to Christianity, blood libels, poisoning the wells, or racism (as in âZionism is Racismâ). Since you would like to examine everything and get to the bottom of the matter, I suggest an excellent book written by a Christian scholar titled, Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate, by William Nicholls, (ISBN: 1568215193).</dd>

<dd>You have posted in other places that you are a newbie to Wikipedia. I would have to say that since I started in June, 2005, I am a newbie too. I have sensed that you have mellowed to some extent, you have not tended to be the "lone ranger" in editing lately. The open invitation for all to edit sometimes gives one the impression that they can be a lone ranger. Of course, Wikipedia is not a democracy, and really anyone can edit, there is much leeway here. I realize that we need to be to some extent anonymous. That is why I have deleted some of my info from my user page. However, if you shared a little about your background, they might see that you should be valued more for you views. I do not mean to say this in a patronizing way. You have obviously done much study in this field, and I, for one, respect you for it. Thanks for the book suggestion. I will take you up on it.

<dd>I'm sorry you chose not to comment on the first three paragraphs that relate to the subject matter and only on the last. You respond by calling me a "lone ranger." Please do not characterise me as a "lone ranger." We are trying to mend and name calling doesn't help. The attacks against me by those interested in the Luther related pages started almost immediately after I stumbled onto them (after other editors indicated problems with it) shortly after my joining WP. This, no doubt emboldened others to pile on and do the same instead of addressing the veracity of my arguments. Indeed, anyone can edit. Now, with regard to my qualifications, I refer you both to my answer the last time you asked and also to WP policy on original research, Verifiabilty and NPOV. Does it matter that I have a Harvard PhD if my edits do not meet OR, VER and NPOV? Would it matter that I flunked out of the 1st grade, if my edits meet VER and NPOV? I think not. If you don't want to ask those attacking me to stop, that's your business. Therefore, I do not want to discuss it further. However, if you wish to address the subject matter of antisemitsm or the points I made in the first three paragraphs, I'm all ears.

<dd>I did not mean to call you a "lone ranger". I am not trying to call you names. What I meant to say is that there is a temptation for those who are new to Wikipedia to edit things as a "lone ranger" or a "lone wolf." I acted in this way on pages, but I soon learned to work with other editors. There is no reason to get snippy about this. Yes, you are correct about your competency. I am sorry that I touched a raw nerve in asking you to give more information. I respect anyone's right to be anonymous.</dd>
<dd>That having been mentioned, I will respond to your first two paragraphs: I agree with you that Luther's milieu, and what motivated him to hate Jewish people in the end are a legitimate field of discovery. Unhappily we cannot talk to him to find out more of what his motivation was. You will note that on the Luther page I have added a study of Luther and antisemitism, which does a job of psychoanalysizing him. This is an iffy proposal: psychoanalyzing the dead. Unfortunately, all we have is what he wrote and what his contemporaries have said about him. We are also limited in not having as much of what others wrote in Luther's time than what he wrote.</dd>
<dd>We know that some of Luther's hatred of the Jewish people was related to his MISinformation on the Jews supplied to him via Antony Margaritha, Paul Burgos, and others. To a large extent he was simply passing along the garbage he read from others. He was an intelligent man, he should have known better. I wonder, though, but I am not quibbling, isn't keeping this category making a "moral judgment" about Luther or some of the other people in this category? I would say that through this category Wikipedia itself <b>is</b> making a moral judgment. Maybe that is necessary, I don't know. I am satisfied that the category is here to stay.</dd>
<dd>I agree with your statement: <i>In any age, you will find that the rationalization for antisemtism includes whatever is considered to be most heinous at the time, whether deicide, refusing to convert to Christianity, blood libels, poisoning the wells, or racism (as in âZionism is Racismâ).</i> I will get a hold of the book you suggest.</dd>

I am sorry that I touched a raw nerve by using your NIC in identifying you as the editor that is removing Martin Luther from this category. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoright_eb98.html" title="User:Doright">Doright</a> 05:50, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How did the deletion vote go?</span></h2>
<p>First I want to say how very impressed I am with the level of the discussion and collegiality, not to mention the obvious intellectual sophistication of the editors involved. However, I hope that people forget past statements and move on.</p>
<p>I also hope the deletion issue is settled and that this category is restored. Oh, and off-topic may I suggest that one and all should come to <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watch_Hill%2C_RI_6233.html" title="Watch Hill, RI">Watch Hill, RI</a> this time of year.

<dd>I'm not sure if a consensus exists. Apparently last time no consensus could be found. If I remember correctly, Wikipedia is not a democracy and consensus is not necessarily established by a straight-up tally of votes on each side (though perhaps it could be). I also don't know who's supposed to "decide" what consensus there is or was - an admin? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 15:50, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In this instance it seems like a lopsided vote to retain, if my counting is correct. That's a consensus by any objective measure. Discounting the far larger number of "keep" votes for some arbitrary reason would be "subjectivity" in the extreme, if you'll pardon the expression. I trust that will not happen.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 19:41, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a backlog on processing of the deletion votes, so give it a little time. It seems that more people want to be admins than want to do admin chores.

<dd>Hello, I count 34 KEEP and 23 DELETE and 3 LISTIFY. By the way LISTIFY should not count as a vote toward DELETE&#160;!</dd>

<dd>I've had a talk with Vegaswikian and I agree with his/her reasoning. Consensus is not established in this manner at Wikipedia, which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not an experiment in democracy</a>. Admins are free to disregard the opinions of new and anon (IP) users, giving them little or no weight. Editors known to be particularly well-educated or particularly reasonable and fair on the given subject matter may conversely be given additional weight. This is one of the more overlooked powers that admins have on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 20:17, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yah. There's not a Wikipedia consensus to delete or keep, which means maintain the status quo. I don't know what there is to complain about; it wouldn't make any difference if there <i>was</i> a consensus to keep, other than perhaps saying "Hey! We considered this already!" next time someone brings it up for deletion, which they will. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">ââââ</a> 02:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, maybe it's easier to point out that ~60% doesn't count as consensus in the real world and it's still too low to consider consensus for Wikipedia. Especially when the effect of "consensus to keep" and "no consensus" are identical. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">ââââ</a> 03:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Jpg, now you having me wondering out loud again. By your statement above, its much harder to have something <b>removed</b> from Wikipedia than it is <b>adding</b> it to Wikipedia?? If the vote was 'should this category be added to Wikipedia' it would have failed due to lack of consensus?? I am getting to deep, sorry.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 17:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah. It's harder to get something removed than it is to add it. Otherwise, growing the encyclopedia would be awfully difficult. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">ââââ</a> 18:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Jpg, thats actually the problem, imo, with this project right now. My very unscientific research finds that 90% of the material on here is UNSOURCED. I am not saying it is NOT accurate, just saying there is a TON of stuff that just "arrives" here WITHOUT sources and then stays. Isn't that one of the big "prime directives" of this project, ie NPOV, sourcing, NOR, ect?? I find that alot of editors want to "add" to articles. I am in a phase where I am really trying to remove questionable material, especially from bios, that isn't sourced. I have found a number of biographies that have gotten "worse" when I compare them to how the article was presented say a year ago. Anyways, I am just a spec of sand on the beach in this project so I'll just keep chipping away&#160;:). Have a pleasant day! --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 19:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
