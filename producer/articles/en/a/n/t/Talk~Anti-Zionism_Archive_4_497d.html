<h2><span class="mw-headline">A shared state</span></h2>
<p>Would someone please explain how the following in the article makes sense:</p>
<p><i>A distinction also needs to be drawn between the anti-Zionism of those who actively seek the physical destruction of Israel and the death or expulsion of its Jewish inhabitants, and the anti-Zionism of those who argue that Israel ought to be voluntarily transformed into a state in which Jews and Palestinians live together as equals. While committed Zionists may see little validity to this distinction, it is a real one.</i></p>
<p>How is it anti-Zionist to support the expansion of Israel to occupy all of Palestine in a state incorporating both Jews and Arabs? That appears to be an objective of at least some Zionist groups, including the pre-independence groups which wanted all of Palestine for Israel, and it seems odd to describe as an anti-Zionist position something which includes those clearly pro-Zionist views.</p>
<p>Is it the policy of Israel today that Jews and Arabs are NOT equal within Israel? If it isn't, the equality portion also seems not to be useful, since it would be describing the official policy of Israel as anti-Zionist. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 10:19, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Anti-Zionism" logically has to mean "opposed to the objectives of Zionism," and there is no doubt that the objective of the Zionist movement today is the defence of Israel as a Jewish state, a state which Jews control by virtue of being a large majority of the population. It is true that Jews and Arabs are for most (though not all) purposes equal in Israel, but that is because Arabs are a 10% minority and they don't jeopardise the Jews' majority status. A reunited pre-1948 Palestine would have only a very narrow Jewish majority, and if the 1948 refugees and their descendents were allowed to return it would have an Arab majority. This is clearly contrary to the current objectives of Zionism, and to propose it is therefore in that sense "anti-Zionist." This is not to make any comment on the merits of the proposal. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 10:41, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely "While committed Zionists may see little validity to this distinction, it is a real one" is rather insulting to the intelligence of Zionists? I'm kind of curious - do you have any quotes from people who find it difficult to distinguish these two diametrically opposed positions? - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:23, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Thursday, 15 May, 2003: Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi renewed his calls Wednesday for establishing an Israeli-Palestinian state under the name of "Israteen" to resolve the Middle East conflict. Qadhafi said the solution was plausible on condition of allowing the repatriation of Palestinian refugees from wherever they were. Qadhafi first made his proposal at the Arab summit held in Amman in 2001. It was since made part of his "White Book" published on his private internet Web site. His suggestion "guaranteed the settlement of the Middle East conflict as the new Israteen state would become member of the Arab League," Qadhafi said.[UPI]"[1]</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Israteen", by the way, is a combination of "Israel" and "Filasteen". I suppose some would still interpret this as calling for the "destruction" of Israel, but clearly not for, as the article put it, the "physical destruction" of it. - Mustafaa 08:14, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

Before responding to the previous post, allow me to say that I am not an expert in either Zionist ideology or Arab nationalism. That said, as far as I can tell, the aim of Zionism is to create a Jewish state. Jewish identity as we know it is not a nationality, but rather a religious or perhaps ethnic association. This means that the creation of Jewish state entails a demographic reality quite unlike that which exists in Palestine-Israel, one that is composed primarily of Jews, which given the rhetoric of the Likud is a mainly a racial category. The Israel of today can never be a binational country because that would mean that it would have to lose the demographic qualities that make it a Jewish state. For these reasons, the Israeli government has deliberately employed policies which limit the expansion of the Arab portion of the population to maintain Jewish demographic hegemony, these policies include discriminatory immigration programs and deliberate neglect of the Palestinian-Arab municipal sector.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">should this article only present anti-zionism from the anti-zionist point of view?</span></h2>
<p>Since <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">zionism</a> is dealing only with the zionist POV, this article should be dealing only with the anti-zionist POV.</p>
<p>How about an introduction like this</p>
<p><b>Anti-Zionism</b> is a term that has been used to describe several very different political and religious points of view, both historically and in current debates. All these points of view have in common some form of opposition to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>.</p>
<p>Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination. It follows that anti-zionism is a form of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-racism.html" title="Anti-racism">anti-racism</a>."</p>
<p>This is of course not NPOV, but it states the POV of the anti-zionists, just like <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">zionism</a> simply presents the POV of the zionists as the only truth with no opposition. Should this be a fair solution to the problem? <a href="../../../z/w/_/User%7EZw_4a74.html" title="User:Zw">Zw</a> 22:37, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You just don't get it, do you? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:24, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the wikipedia as it stands is a little too biased toward the Zionist point of view. (For example, following the Zionist page it would lead you to beleive intellectuals like Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn held their beliefs only because they were "socialist liberals." Ha, as if that was the only intellectual opposition to Zionism. And as if there weren't Jewish Israeli citizens who also opposed Zionism.) I really only see this being resolved by separate articles from the moderate-Zionist and from the moderate-Anti-Zionist. Any extreme views do not belong, but naturally people are going to disagree on this one issue. I just don't want every article to sound like it was written from the POV of the ADL. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 07:28, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Neither <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> nor <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a> are written from <i>any</i> point of view. They are encyclopaedia articles, which present facts as objectively as possible. I am happy to debate the accuracy of any fact presented in either article, or any fact which anyone feels has been omitted from either article. But kindly spare us any more of this crap about what point of view the articles represent or ought to represent. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 10:17, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But the reality is that the articles <i>are</i> from certain point of views. They are moderate point of views, but we haven't reached the encyclopedia ideal just yet. For example, you can list nothing but objective truths, but even truth reporting can be "spun" and biased in one way or the other. Or perhaps you're in <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_philosophy.html" title="Objectivist philosophy">objectivism land</a> and believe your article ideal is actually achievable? <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 00:21, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you be a little more specific? You don't know what spin is? You don't know what facts are? You don't know how the presentation of certain facts can generate bias? Have you ever taken a social science course? Give me some clues here. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 05:24, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a PhD in history, so kindly don't patronise me. I believe it is possible to write an objective and truthful article about both Zionism and anti-Zionism, and I believe these articles come fairly close to being that. I am happy to debate specific issues. I am not interested in a philosophical debate about the meaning of truth etc. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:52, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So don't have a philosophical debate about truth, then. Anyway, you seem to have conveniently missed my "specific issue" I raised about the Zionism article acting like only socialist liberals hold anti-Zionists views. Perhaps you could change that, as you seem to be neutral enough. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 07:09, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article makes no such claim. It says that anti-Zionist views are widely and increasingly held in most western countries. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:17, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel this article is quite biased. It does not really represent anti zionism in a neutral fashion. For example, while the article states that anti zionism is not anti semitic, it gives an example of a soviet cartoon which clearly implies the opposite, why? The links I have added are key texts and articles for western leftist anti zionists....please do not remove them.</p>

<dd>"Anti-Zionism can be opposition to these objectives, and that any person, organisation or government that opposes these objectives can in some sense be described as anti-Zionist; or Anti-Zionism can be opposition to a specific implementation that meets these objectives. The most common opposition to Zionism of the latter form comes from disapproval of the treatment of the Palestinians."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I put in the above wording because I think it would really clarify things. I believe that most people I know who object to Zionism would not object to it if the Palestinians didn't have to pay the cost. For example, if Jewish settlers wanted to occupy a previously uninhabitated land, I doubt there would be any objection to Zionism at all. However, the implementation of Zionism is not only that there should be a Jewish state, but that is should be in Palestine. <i>That</i> is the critical difference, and it's a disservice to those who oppose zionism to act like they only oppose the abstract idea of it, when in reality virtually all oppose the specific way it's been done. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 09:27, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current intro already includes these concerns, in more eloquently-stated form. It says that Zionism is either support for a Jewish homeland, or support for the State of Israel as the Jewish homeland. Anti-Zionism, therefore, is opposition to either of these objectives. It is not necessary to redundantly say "or Anti-Zionism can be opposition to a specific implementation", because the State of Israel <i>is</i> a specific implementation. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 18:22, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We want to effectively communicate the ideas. Even though such results <i>could</i> be inferred from the shorter version, we cannot assume everyone is going to be reaching those conclusions. The purpose of the introduction is to explain the results of the definition; not just to define it. I think someone reading this article would be <i>very</i> confused without the high-level picture. Your disagreement that it's redundant is not enough, because it provides new and helpful information. Try to imagine yourself as a reader coming upon the word "anit-zionist" and looking it up in the wikipedia having no idea what it means. Our job is to help the person who goes to the encyclopedia in the first place. It is not our job to make the most mathematically terse article possible; which would only serve to confuse, not enlighten. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 22:08, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not what's being done though. A very clear statement is made: Zionism is either support for a Jewish homeland in general, or support for the particular homeland in the state of Israel; anti-Zionism is, then, opposition to either of these positions. Adding on more sounds a lot like you're trying to push a particular point of view, whereas a simple statement of facts is both more elegant and more neutral. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 01:42, Jun 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is now being turned into the same swamp of slogans and propaganda as all the other Israeli-Palestinian etc articles at Wikipedia. This is mostly Zw's fault. I am very annoyed about this, since weeks of work went into getting it into a state which was both intellectually respectable and acceptable to all the people then working on it. I don't have time at present to respond to all the current damage being done to the article, not do I enjoy redoing work which I have already done once. I may just take it off my watchlist and let it degenerate into the same useless mess as most other related articles.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zionist used interchangeably or as a code word for Jew</span></h2>
<p>This important point has been lost in all the edits. The reasons Jews see anti-Zionism as anti-Semitic has less to do with seeing "attacks on the existence of Israel as inherently anti-Semitic", and more to do with the fact that anti-Semites use the rhetoric of anti-Zionism to attack Jews, and the term "Zionist" as a code word for Jew. This fact inevitably muddies the waters in any pro-Zionism/anti-Zionism debate. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 14:47, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Do people really object to Zionism based on Church/State?</span></h2>
<p>The article states "Others may object to Zionism on the belief that religion and state should never be combined." Is this true? One could argue that "Church" plays a greater "State" role in Israel than in most industrial democracies, and many (particularly secular Israelis) see the religious establishments has having far too much power in the country. Nevertheless, Israel itself is not a theocracy, and the Zionist movement was started and run by secular Zionists against the opposition of most Jewish religious leaders the time. As well, I would be hard pressed to find a country in which religion was not supported in some way by the State (communist China being the obvious large exception). Finally, the largest numbers and often most vehement "anti-Zionists" are Muslims who themselves support theocracies in their own states, but ironically also in Israel itself (of course this would be a Muslim theocracy, and Israel would be renamed Palestine).</p>

<p>A second question occurs to me; are there any other international movements like "anti-Zionism" which oppose a country based on the notion that Church and State should never be combined? Against Iran, for example, or Saudi Arabia, based on Church/State separation? If there are, then it might support the notion that this is a reason for anti-Zionism. If not, it would indicate that anti-Zionism is probably not truly based on an ideal of separation of Church and State, and more on opposition to a specific State. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:52, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You need look no further than libertarians, atheists, and academics to see opposition to the combination of religion and state. This is actually part of my opposition to how the article used to be stated. While it says anti-Zionists can be anti-Zionist for many reasons, the focus seems to dwell on anti-semititsm, and not the legitimate human-right concerned activists. I'm an American, and in academic circles in America there's a huge feeling of responsibility for the Palestinians, because of America's continued support of Israel. Most of the people I know object to Zionism because they think it's similar to how America treated the native-americans so long ago. Based on the profiles I've read here, it seems like I might be the only American editing this recently. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 19:03, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, of course, people are opposed to the combination of religion and state, but that doesn't answer the question; are there any identified international movements in opposition to any specific states where religion and state are mixed (which actually includes many states), other than Israel? I can't think of any examples of such a movement, which suggests that the putative reason is not the real reason. Moreover, it seems that the claimed "opposition to any mixing of religion and state" is quite vociferous in the case of Israel, which, at the end of the day, is still a secular democracy; wouldn't those opposed to this mixing focus first on true theocracies, such as the aforementioned Iran and Saudi Arabia? Are these groups mentioned carying signs in rallies decrying (for example) Hamas and Hizbullah based on the stated desire of these groups to create theocracies in the region?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the part about Palestinians and native Americans, that has nothing to do with mixing of church and state. Please recall that the Zionist movement was secular, and based on the idea of Jews as a people, not Judaism as a faith. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I'm getting a very strong feeling that this objection to Zionism "on the belief that religion and state should never be combined" is a red herring. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 19:43, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, the Palestinian/native American thought I put down was a separate thread: of course it has very little to do with separation of religion and state. But to answer your concern, those I know in academia feel very strongly about separation of church and state no matter what the religion and no matter what the state. I feel the focus on anti-semitism is more the red herring. I would propose even that the anti-semitism content from this article be put in the anti-semtitism article instead, as it is not true anti-Zionism... but in general I get annoyed when people try move around helpful information, so the content might as well remain, no matter how distracting it is about the real reasons why <i>moderates</i> oppose Zionism. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 20:26, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fully understand that "libertarians" might oppose the mixing of church and state, but I'm not aware of any specific "Libertarians against Zionism" movement. In any event, Zionism was not a movement to create a theocratic state run under Jewish law, but a movement to create a secular democratic state for Jews. And in fact, this is what it has done. The whole "objection to Zionism on the basis that religion and state should not be combined" appears to have no basis in fact.</dd>

<dd>As for academia feeling strongly that church and state should be separated, I'm sure much or even most of American academia does feel that way, but they only seem to consistently and vociferously state these objections (and create boycott movements etc.) in the case of Israel. They certainly do not have the same kinds of reactions to the aforementioned Hamas or Hisbullah or Islamic Jihad, whose clearly stated goals are to create theocracies in place of the current secular democratic Israel. Given these facts, and the underlying fact that Israel is not a theocracy, it is quite clear that the statement regarding "objection to mixing of church and state" is irrelevant at best, and a red herring at worst.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The 2nd paragraph of intro</span></h2>
<p>Now it's confusing, long and wrong. How's this: The term "Zionism" was coined by an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> publicist <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Birnbaum_6965.html" title="Nathan Birnbaum">Nathan Birnbaum</a> in his journal <i>Self Emancipation</i> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> and was defined as the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>, or <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zion.html" title="Zion">Zion</a>.

In some cases, anti-Zionism stems from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a>, but not all anti-semites are anti-Zionist, nor can most anti-Zionist be considered anti-semitic. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 08:10, 20 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the relationship between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism is too complex to discuss in the intro, and making questionable statements like that is entirely out of place. Many people would argue that most anti-Zionists <i>are</i> anti-Semites, and there is good evidence for this viewpoint (just take a look at the ridiculous anti-Semitism coming out of most self-described "anti-Zionist" media outlets, especially those in Arab countries). The intro should give a more clean definition: Zionism is either support of a Jewish state in general, or support for the specific Jewish state of Israel, and anti-Zionism is opposition to either of these. The only possible anti-Zionism not covered in that definition is opposition to a specific implementation other than Israel, and as far as I know that's not an issue, as there are no other proposed specific implementations, at least currently. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 23:05, Jun 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately you are trying to inject false reasoning into the article to try to advance your own personal agenda. I understand that is it important to some anti-Zionists not to be lumped into the larger group of worldwide anti-Zionists, for whom anti-Zionism is simply a variation of anti-Semitism. It is clear that many anti-Zionists are not anti-Semites in intent, though I personally doubt whether they are a majority of the "movement". Nevertheless Zionism was not a movement to create a mixed church/state entity, so anti-Zionism cannot be an objection to that goal - the goal simply wasn't a part of Zionism. Similarly, the goal of Zionism is not to oppress Palestinians, though that may have been an outcome of a number of things, including the creation of the State of Israel, Arab instransigence, Arab terror, Jewish ethnocentrism, etc. Thus you have confused objections to the current formulation of the Israel government, or current Israeli policies, with anti-Zionism.</dd>

<dd>Actually, I haven't "confused" objections with the current formulation at all! My sentences were removed to further the agendas of Zionists; I'll specifically state that the agenda on the wikipedia editors right now (who delete my work) is to create a strawman argument: the false notion that the only opposition to Zionism is anti-semitism. I am not proposing anything radical here. I'm merely stating that <b>groups exist that oppose Zionism because of its results, and not its objectives</b>. Just so you know, I think Zionism was a noble goal, and perfectly understandable, but a complete failure in practice. That is why I oppose Zionism. However, the heavily POV article would lead you to believe that I don't exist! My sentences, clearly, elegantly, and fairly showed that people object to the implementation. You'll have to have a good reason for why these two sentences shouldn't exist. I'm getting really tired of being put in a box with anti-semities, as if you knew me you'd know how much it annoys me. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 20:14, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

This, in fact, is the strawman argument that <b>you</b> are trying to promote. Anti-Zionism is not synonymous with anti-Semitism, and the article devotes paragraphs to explaining why that is true, and why and when they are also often reasonably conflated. Your sentences were explained more clearly in the following section, and did not belong in the intro, were they were merely a defensive inclusion because you perceive your anti-Zionist stance as being confused with anti-Semitism. I understand your personal need not to be seen as an anti-Semite, but this does not justify inserting erroneous and defensive statements into the introduction. The introduction succinctly and clearly explains what anti-Zionism is, it doesn't need to also try to explain the many things it isn't.</dd>

<p>The introduction, as it stands, is concise, clear, and accurate; explains what anti-Zionism <b>is</b>, not all the many things it is <b>not</b>. Contrary to your claim, it makes no reference at all to anti-Zionism being equated with anti-Semitism; it does not even mentioned anti-Semitism. Your "two simple sentences" injected inaccuracy and confusion into the opening. The point that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are not synonymous is made clear <b>in the very next section in the article</b>, as is the point that much of the movement today in the West is fuelled by perceived mistreatment of the Palestinians. And your suggestion that "there's no point denying their mistreatment" again betrays your lack of NPOV; whether or not their treatment is "mistreatment" is, again, a matter of some debate. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 14:15, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um, yes, this is the talk page, but it's not the "lets debate the whole Israeli-Palestinian issue" page. The problem is that you keep trying to inject your obvious POV into the article page. Regarding the terminology itself, "perceived treatment" is the most NPOV, as it neither confirms nor denies the treatment, but merely explains the fact that many people perceive it that way. As for me, I haven't taken a stand on it at all, I'm merely trying to keep the page neutral. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 21:21, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not seeking to debate "the whole issue." I've shown flexibility here. I've revised my sentences repeatedly and defended the case to Adam Carr enough that he stopped editing me out. Change it to perceived if you like, and I will not change it. But please stop deleting something that must belong in the introduction. You cannot even dare to discuss anti-Zionism without first mentioning those who oppose it due to the treatment of the Palestinians. That's the <i>only</i> non-anti-semetic protest I've heard from groups specifically opposed to Zionism.</dd>

<dd>So, please, leave my sentences intact. The earlier versions were fine, and I've already conceded more than what I should reasonably expect. I've done so only because this important protest to Zionism must appear in the introduction if a clueless reader is to have any idea what the greater issue is about. Also, I don't care for your semantics game of "anti-Israel"/"anit-Zionism". But seriously, from the point of view of a clueless reader, they are going to be very confused about this article unless we are upfront in the beginning about all groups. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 23:42, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And just to backup my claim about the Orkut group this is from a group titled "Anti-Zionist Jews":</p>
<p><i>"We are Jews who believe Zionism was an understandable and forgiveable error, but one which continues at a great cost to the Palestinian people, who deserve to have full political enfranchisement, as political equals in a binational unitary, secular and democratic state; and it continues at great cost to the Jews, because it fosters renewed anti-Semitism and forces Jews in Israel to adopt postures that are contrary to centuries of Jewish values of pacificism, pluralism and cosmopolitinism; and it continues at great cost to the world as the origin of much of the conflict in the Middle East, which has led to world-wide terrorism, which has in turn led to repressive political prerogatives internationally. We are NOT self-hating Jews. We are just not narcissistic enough about our Jewishness to think that as Jews we have a special dispensation from God to deny a colonized people the political equality to which it is entitled."</i></p>
<p>If I wanted to make the article in my POV, I would probably say something much closer to the above. As it stands, the reasonable and englightening text I propose is a far cry from the above, just because being NPOV is important to me. So, I've demonstrated my point and will continue to remove any bias that acts like such inconviences don't exist. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 23:51, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Humus Sapiens is right. The introduction should be short and to the point; it should not have discussions of either anti-Semitism (which many people believe is the real reason for anti-Zionism) nor the Palestinians (which Mshonle believes is the real reason for anti-Zionism).

If anything, you are the vandal, deleting valid points of view because it's inconvienent for you. I want to have a civil discussion about this, but if you, Jayjg, continue to be inflamatory and result to cheap name calling, I'm likely just going to bow out and the wikipedia will have yet another biased article that could not be corrected due to narrow minds. At least Humus has shown reasonability by at least conceeding that it's not just the objectives, but the implementation, that people object to.

It simply does not belong in the Introduction, as has been explained many times. But the good news for you is that it gets into the <i>very next section</i>, so there is no doubt your point of view is being expressed. As for your accusations vis a vis my own motivations, your point of view is not "inconvenient" for me in any way; that is merely a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> argument on your part (please see the link for more detail). And regarding my "deleting valid points of view", I did not delete them, I merely reverted to the earlier NPOV version of the article into which you had (yet again) inserted your own personal agenda. Finally, in response to your threat to bow out, I hope you do not do so, as Wikipedia articles benefit from multiple points of view. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 16:20, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These paragraphs are about Orthodox Jewish anti-Zionism. Many anti-Semites try to justify their anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism by claiming "Anti-Zionism can't be anti-Semitic; after all, even Orthodox Jews are anti-Zionist!" The problem is that they are just plain wrong; While many Orthodox Jews used the phrase "anti-Zionism" to refer to some of their beliefs, they had an entirely different definition of the term. Some opposed the return of Jews to the land of Israel before the messiah arrived, but otherwise had no problem with the idea that Jews had a right to live in the land of Israel. Others opposed the idea that a Jewish state should be led by agnostic and atheist socialists, but otherwise had no problem with the idea that Jews had a right to live in the land of Israel. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:29, Jun 22, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many 19th century and early 20th century Orthodox Jews objected to "Zionism" because they rejected secular and atheist attempts to build a secular and socialist Jewish state in Palestine. Orthodox Jews in this group did not reject the right of Jews to move to Palestine and reconstitute a Jewish nation within its borders, but instead hoped that if any such state were to be created, it would follow to some extent Jewish law and tradition, and that its leaders would be religious Jews. Other Orthodox Jews of that time objected to any creation of a Jewish state in Palestine before the arrival of the messiah, though they accepted the right of individual Jews to move to Palestine. However, following the events of the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel, this position is now only held by a small minority of Orthodox groups. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:22, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's common, but who doesn't consider it pejorative, those who use it, or those to whom it is directed? The groups in question don't call themselves "ultra-Orthodox"; the tend to call themselves a number of other things, including Orthodox, Chassidic, Haredi, and simply Jewish. Well, as the Jewish FAQ points out regarding the term "Ultra-Orthodox"
<dl>
<dd>In practice, the term is usually used as a disparaging synonym for Orthodox or Chassidic. What passes for an unremarkable level of observance is inaccurately elevated into a form of "fanaticism". Many people outside the Orthodox community mistakenly identify those who wear Chassidic garb (long black coats, earlocks for men, wigs/kerchiefs for women) as "ultra-Orthodox." In fact, the Chassidic groups are no more or less observant than other Orthodox groups who do not dress so distinctively.</dd>

<p>One might imagine that the term could be applied to groups or sects that are "more Orthodox than Orthodox" so to speak. This is the phenomenon noticed in the phrase "post-post-Modernist".

Now, that calls into question just what the hell Orthodox is meant in relation to, but that's a seperate issue. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 20:26, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have raised this issue with Orthodox Jewish friends. Their view is that the term "ultra-Orthodox" is based on a misunderstanding of Judaism by non-Jews, who use the faulty analogy of Christian denominations to understand variant traditions in Judaism. "Orthodox" (from the Greek, meaning "of the right teaching") is a Christian theological term, but there are no theological differences among Orthodox Jews, only differences of observance and ritual. What matters for Jews is not theology but rigorous observance. What non-Jews call "ultra-Orthodox" Jews are really only ultra-observant Jews, or members of Hasidic sects who are distinguished by traditions of dress etc. I therefore agree that the use of this term in an article which is not about Jewish theology is misleading and should be avoided. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:12, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the idea that "ultra-Orthodox" is a phrase primarily used by non-Jews is simply false and I doubt it was coined by non-Jews either (etymological sources welcome). I'm not too conversant with the US scene, but in Israel one says <i>haredi</i> if speaking Hebrew and <i>ultra-Orthodox</i> if speaking English. Everyone does that, from the guys in the street to the academics in their journals. However, the ultra-Orthodox tend to call themselves just <i>Jews</i>, consistent with their self-image. To quote Noah Efron: "In their view, they are not a <i>sort</i> of Jew, they are simply Jews, the ideal from which all other Jews deviate." (<i>Real Jews</i>, p16). The ultra-Orthodox in Israel form well-defined communities; it is not a label attached to individuals according to their personal degree of observance. As I said, it is possible that the terminology popular in the US differs from that in Israel. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 16:09, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I have cut and revised the "Soviet anti-Zionism" section, most of which was irrelevant to this article and the rest full of tendentious statements and bad English. I have cut the Martin Luther King statement which seemed to be of no relevance at the point where it was inserted. Possibly it would be relevant somewhere else.

<dd>It's vaguely important in a provincial sense, as it's been an influential quote in the US, where blacks on the whole do not tend to be very Zionist. So it's not important for Zionism or anti-Zionism per se, but it is important as a prominent and influential reaction to anti-Zionists in the US. Not sure where it'd best go, but this article does discuss reactions to anti-Zionists and controversy over whether they're anti-Semites, so it doesn't seem completely irrelevant. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 17:33, Jun 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding your points in order, 1) What distinction do you feel is relevant? 2) What is an "a-historical" focus on anti-Semitism, and why is it "particularly offensive" in the case of the Palestinians? and 3) Where in particular do you see the section treating Arab anti-Zionism as "a pathology"? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:18, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(1) There is actually a 2-dimensional distinction, between Palestinians and others and between pre-1948 and post-1948, making 4 cases which have their own characteristics. It is obvious that the Palestinians were directly affected by Zionism in a way that no other Arabs were, so their reaction to it has to be separately treated. (2) The charge that Palestinian anti-Zionism pre-1948 was largely anti-Semitic is an absolutely false libel designed specifically to demonise the Palestinians. It is not borne out by an examination of the evidence (which I have done in some depth). There is no reason to believe that the <i>Protocols</i> were more influential in Palestine than in, say, the UK. This article is going to keep an NPOV tag until mention of the Protocols is removed from this section. (3) This is my feeling about the section, agree or not. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 13:05, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not asking you to write the article for me, Adam, and I wonder how you inferred that. The question was whether the article is still disputed: it appears several Wiki contributors still think so, and that answers your question, meaning the tag has to stay on. I wouldn't mind rewording the article myself but it appears from the edits that there's a troupe around here that keeps reverting sense into nonsense (which would drag me into another edit war) - and for some reason they consist of the same members I deal with on other articles. I wonder what the connection is. It couldn't possibly be a shared <i>bias</i>, right?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To be marginally more specific, the problem starts right at the beginning when you say one of the definitions of Zionism is <i>a movement to support the development and defense of the State of Israel</i>. Once you add "defense" then you can tag absolutely everything to anti-Zionism: criticism of Israeli foreign or military policy, or simply criticism of Israel, and then extrapolate from there to the charges of anti-Zionism being anti-Semitism, with such baseless propagandist comments like these in the article: <i>Moreover, the term "Zionist" is often used interchangeably or as a code-word for Jew, leading to a further blurring of the distinction</i>. Yeah, right - stellar example of NPOV editing. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 10:42, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jayjg, you seem to exhibit either a great degree of difficulty or a great degree of disingenuousness when it comes to very simple concepts. One does not say with a straight face "blacks are currently often referred to as ni--ers" and point to the hundreds of sites which do so - you have to be able to establish that it is mainstream or widespread enough to merit attention; similarly "Zionist as a synonym for Jew" does not occur "often" because you can point to three, five, or ninety-five websites written by fringe elements - you should be able to establish that it is a common usage. Is it all that frequent? Are people aware of it? Does it turn up in newspapers or daily parlance? By the way, since you are so fond of quotes and hearsay as "evidence", this FYI might be useful - <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/story.jsp?story=540658" class="external text" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/story.jsp?story=540658" rel="nofollow">the "anti-Semitic" attack you posted about yesterday was a hoax</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 03:57, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simonides, you seem to exhibit an overwhelming need to use ad hominems in your debates; for example, your first sentence added nothing of value to your paragraph, aside from reflecting negatively on you. Other contributers here seem to be able to debate the issues without lacing their statements with insults and invective, and I have often encouraged you to do the same, as yet to no avail. If you continue to be unable to control your emotional outbursts, I will simply have to ignore what you say and discuss these issues with the more dispassionate members of the board; it's just not worth my time trying to pick some value out of the insulting rhetoric. Regarding the common use of "Zionist" to represent "Jew", you will only concede that one is a code word for the other if used that way in common parlance. However, as we both know, it is only commonly used that way in the West only by anti-Semites, who are a relatively small percentage of the population; yet it is precisely those anti-Semites to whom the article is referring! Thus you have created a requirement which a priori cannot possibly be met.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the article, yes, this woman perpetrated a hoax; are all the incidents listed in this article: <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=12163" class="external free" title="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=12163" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=12163</a> also hoaxes?</dd>

<dd>It was not an ad hominem but an observation of a recurring approach you use in arguments: blink and stall; and your flippant appeals for detachment are quite unconvincing, given that I have looked at your contributions one more than one article and they amount to partisanship. Next, your statement <i>in no way</i> indicates you are speaking specifically of anti-Semites - it is a blanket statement and clearly refers to the populace as a whole, so you need to reword it. Finally, I think you never did look up <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">ignoratio elenchi</a>, ie arguing or providing proof for an argument not made - I did not say there were no anti-Semitic incidents, only reminded you that you are not very critical in picking your "evidence" - and that does bear on your contributions to any article. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 18:59, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Simonides and straw-man arguments against Jews</span></h2>
<p>I am becoming very concerned about the behaviour of Simonides; he has already declared himself an enemy of "Zionist" contributions to Wikipedia, (although he has little idea of what this word really means; he uses this word as slur word.) Simonides's distortion of the content of the anti-Zionism article (and others), and his distortion of the views of Jewish groups, are straw-man attacks. As you know, no mainstream Jewish denomination, organization or group has ever claimed that a criticism of an Israeli policy or government is anti-Semitism; no on here on Wikipedia here is saying that either. Simonides' repeated claims to the contrary are Jew-baiting strawman attacks. They are not only factually false (and thus have no place in an encyclopedia), but will only serve to encourage open anti-Semitism. This isn't about a disagreement on how to phrase facts; this is about his manufactoring of <i>false</i> "facts" in order to hurt others whom he disagrees with. This behaviour is out of line. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 13:39, Jul 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi. Not being a regular to these sorts of articles (that is, articles on Zionism, Anti-Semitism, Judaism, the Israel Palestinian question, etc), I don't have an opinion on Simonides one way or another and for all I know your accusation may be entirely correct. However, as someone who "just surfed in" today (July 19th, 2004) I must say I too found the Zionist/Jew bit confusing. I actually don't know very much about this subject and was looking to Wikipedia to educate me on it, and I have a habit of looking through Talk: after reading a controversial article to see who is saying what. When I read that 'Zionism is often used as a code-word for Jew' in the article, I took this to mean in mainstream use. I live in Asia; we don't talk about Jews much here, so I actually had no reason to doubt this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simonides was concerned that people like me (i.e., not knowledeable about the issues) might interpret this equivalence as being in broad use, rather than spouted by fringe anti-Semitic groups. Jayig seemed to think the text did not imply this, and stated that it was not what he meant to imply, at any rate:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>I have not referred to "society as a whole", nor have I said it is "mainstream"; those are your inferences, and they are not implied by the text. See Straw man. Jayjg 19:08, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess, getting around to the point, is that reading the text as worded currently, I did make the assumption that the term Zionist was in mainstream (read, not anti-semetic) use as word for Jew. If this is not the case, I think the wording ought to be changed, especially since both Jayig and Simondes seem to agree on its non-mainstream use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In an unrelated way, I can imagine it would be deeply frustrating for non-anti-Semitic or even Jewish anti-Zionists (whatever they may take the term to mean) to have people assuming that by anti-Zionist they mean anti-Jew. Since, as you yourself point out, RK, no Jewish organization or indeed editor on Wikipedia wishes to make the claim that criticism of the State of Israel equates anti-Semitism, it would seem benefitial to make the distinction between anti-Jew (anti-semetic) and anti-Zionist (prehaps anti-Israel? -- what a muddled word this one is).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I'm sure you all understand what I mean.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I not only understand, I thank you for summing up the discussion so astutely. Thank you for the clarity you bring!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jews and Arabs did not live in peace in Palestine</span></h2>
<p>As in most Arab lands, Jews in Palestine were dhimmi, and, as such, second class citizens who experienced periodic oppression and violence. Attempts to whitewash this are revisionism of the worst kind. My first edits were simply to remove the POV lines, and leave the factual material; now I have replaced them with more accurate statements which, I suspect, will not be at all pleasing to those who look at history through rose coloured glasses.</p>
<p>And by the way, there was no objection among Arabs to "other immigrant populations"; please find me any record of such. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 16:21, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Second-class <i>dhimmi</i> inhabitants" is correct, and so is "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> enjoins Muslim respect for <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> as a fellow monotheistic religion". "Jews and Arabs had lived together in Palestine for centuries with little if any mutual conflict" is correct; "had experienced only sporadic violence directed at them by Arabs" may be correct, though I would like to see documentation of that. The original version (which, incidentally, I did not write) is factually correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would you say that in the early to mid 20th century "Whites and Blacks had lived together with little if any mutual conflict"? The sentence implies that the status of the two communities was more or lest equivalent, as opposed to the reality, that the Jews were in no position to create any "conflict". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:12, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Jewish or any other immigrant state" is trivially correct; their opposition was to Jewish immigration, not to the existence of a Jewish community in Palestine. For a parallel, witness Algerian opposition to the pied-noirs' efforts.

<p>Oh, and "the majority and superior status of the Arab population" is incorrect; Palestinian nationalism joined Arab Christians and Muslims together. Nor is the use of the term "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a>" to refer to Arab Palestinians at all anachronistic; see that article. The idea that "Palestinian" was some sort of neologism is itself a piece of pro-Zionist revisionism, spread by the likes of Golda Meir. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:05, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you can find any evidence of Arab Christians opposing late 19th/early 20th century Zionism, I'd like to see it.

<dd>Khalil As-Sakakini, an Arab nationalist and Palestinian Christian, also pointed to the dangers of Zionism in regard to the Arab World in his diary on 23 February 1914. He stated that his hatred of Zionism had not evolved from a hatred of the Israeli people and their prosperity, but rather from his opposition to the doctrine itself and the Zionist attempts to built a nation at the expense of others. By conquering Palestine, Zionism had conquered the heart of the Arab World, since Palestine is the linking point between the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt and Africa. The Jewish occupation of Palestine would end the Arab contact, especially between the African and Asian Arabs.<a href="http://www.passia.org/publications/research_studies/books/arab_nationalism/arabresist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.passia.org/publications/research_studies/books/arab_nationalism/arabresist.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>Concerning the <i>dhimmi</i> status of Jews in Palestine, it is almost an irrelevant issue for this article because very few of the Zionist immigrants were <i>dhimmis</i>. Most of them were not Ottoman subjects and therefore, due to the concesssions known as the Capitulations, were under the protection of various foreign consols. The Jews resident already in Palestine before the main Zionist immigrations were a mixture of Ottoman subjects (mostly Sephardim) and foreigners. So some were <i>dhimmis</i> and some were not. In general, the Jewish Ottoman subjects did not support the Zionists and some openly sided with the Arabs against the Zionists (this should be mentioned in the Jewish anti-Zionism section). Many in the present Haredi community in Israel see themselves as representing an unbroken anti-Zionist (or at least non-Zionist) tradition stretching from the old Yishuv to themselves. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 15:38, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more comment, rather off-topic. The actual situation of a <i>dhimmi</i> depended very much on the whim of whoever was in charge at each moment. The difference between a kind ruler and a cruel one could literally be one of prosperity versus starvation. In this respect, Palestinian Jews fared better than most. With some exceptional periods they had lower taxes and fewer hassles. For example, the head (poll) tax was in theory imposed on every adult male at three rates according to income, but in practice was imposed only once per household at the lowest rate. An illustration of how the Jews saw their situation occured in the 1830s when the Ottomans were temporarily displaced by Egyptian invaders. The new ruler abolished the dhimmi status of Jews and Christians, instead imposing equal (but severe) taxes and obligations on everyone. These obligations included serving in the army. The Jews regarded this as a terrible disaster and demanded their previous status back again (eventually succeeding). This is not say that there were no bad times. Of course there were many (but let's not rely on known forgers like Joan Peters for our examples, eh?). --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 15:38, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A case of forgery I found in her book was a "quotation" formed by taking parts of two sentences a few pages apart in a report and joining them together in the wrong order.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nationalist narratives</span></h2>
<p>"Local nationalist narratives, outside of Palestinians, emphasize the idea of Israel as a threat to the nation (commonly citing extremist Israelis' dreams of a nation stretching "from the Nile to the Euphrates"). Among Palestinians, these emphasize other issues - such as the Palestinian refugee problem, and the fact that almost all the land that would form a prospective Palestinian state is either annexed by or controlled by Israel - and are best treated separately."</p>

<dd>The first link refers to Stern's 18 Principles, but doesn't quote them in any way, so I have no idea if he said that or something else.

I do not think the third site is Israeli at all, but represents American Christians, though I could be wrong. The fourth article points out that Eldad has moderated his views greatly. I personally believe that "Nile to Euphrates" is a strawman perpetuated in Arab propaganda, and something that is not found in the platforms of any Israeli political group.

Of course, the British Mandate borders were arbitrary both before and after (you've no doubt heard the story of "Churchill's hiccup"); the traditional boundaries of Palestine as given by medieval Arab geographers have more geographic sense to them, being essentially restricted to the fertile north and east.

<dd>It's true the borders were somewhat arbitrary, but it's also true that the Balfour Declaration (as an example) still referred to the original (significantly larger) mandate. And if I'm not mistaken, it's actually around 30% of the original mandate. In any event, my next concern is with the words "annexed by"; the implication here is that even, for example, the parts of the Jewish state included in the 1947 U.N.

<dd>As to the Balfour Declaration, if so, so much the worse for it; Britain promising twice as much land that it had no right to in the first place is even worse than it promising Cisjordan alone (having already promised Transjordan to Faisal in 1915), even if most of that land is empty desert. However, what it actually says is considerably less specific, and no doubt deliberately so: <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. It not only does not state the boundaries of Palestine, it doesn't state that any such national home would encompass the whole of Palestine either. Nor was there any "Mandate" for it to refer to; the British Mandate was formalized by the San Remo conference itself<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1922mandate.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1922mandate.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, before which it was a mere occupation. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 05:42, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If your contention is that Tel Aviv is "annexed" land, then the phrase is highly POV.

<p>I have little time to work on this article, but I'll make a start (despite and not because of Adam's bad manners). The Faisal-Weizmann agreement is placed in a passage that starts "Towards the beginning of Zionist settlement in Palestine", but in fact it was a whole generation later. The quotes give detail beyond what is necessary here since there is a whole article on the subject. Anyway, it has to be separated from the narrative of the Palestinian situation. In Palestine there was never any significant welcoming of Zionism; that is just a myth of the traditional Zionist narrative. There was opposition right from the start. Standard works on this subject include Mandel, <i>The Arabs and Zionism before WWI</i>, and the books of Muslih, Porath, and Kimmerling&amp;Migdal. However, <i>outside</i> Palestine there were indeed a few Arabs, such as Faisal, who for a time saw Zionism as an opportunity rather than as a threat. See <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisal-Weizmann_Agreement_cca8.html" title="Faisal-Weizmann Agreement">Faisal-Weizmann Agreement</a> for a good article on this.</p>
<p>Here are a few paragraphs. They are very rough and I don't have time (today) to work them into the existing text.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The earliest tenuous Zionist settlements in the 1880s had minimal effect on the local Arab population and evoked little interest. However, around the turn of the century, the increasing scale of Zionist land purchases led to a sequence of bitter disputes mostly related to the increasing prices. While some Arabs benefited from being employed as laborers, others were dispossessed when their land was sold by its absentee owners. Many petitions, mostly in vain, were made to the Ottoman authorities, demanding that Jewish immigration and land purchases be restricted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the eve of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Zionists, whose intention of becoming the dominant population in Palestine was no secret, were seen as a grave potential threat by most the Palestinian public, but this threat was not widely accept as imminent until the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balfour_Declaration_73f0.html" title="Balfour Declaration">Balfour Declaration</a> made by the British in 1917. Palestinian anti-Zionism at this stage did not have the form of a nationalist movement, but rather expressed the fear that Zionism would disrupt the lives of the Palestinians in an unfavorable fashion. The Ottoman rulers had been foreigners too, but they did not try to populate the country with Turks and they shared the same religion, Islam, with most Palestinians. However, the agreements that the European powers made between themselves after WWI led to a separation of Palestine from the rest of the Arab world under British control and this kindled a genuine Palestinian nationalism. Initially such nationalism was restricted to (largely Christian) urban intellectuals; it had little input to the anti-Zionist riots of 1920 and 1921 in which dozens of Jews (Zionist or not) were killed. However, during the following few decades Palestinian Arab politics came to be dominated by nationalists, with public support, and by the end of the 1920s most anti-Zionist rhetoric was expressed in nationalist terms even when the proximate causes of particular outbursts (control of the Temple Mount in the case of the 1929 riots) were religious or economic.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The next thing to write about is the 1936-1939 Arab revolt against the Zionists and the British. Missing but important are the role of the "notables" in Arab society, the role of the British, and probably other things.</p>

<dd>The anachronistic language ("Palestinian" for "Arab" or "Arab Palestinian" or "Palestinian Arab") needs to be cleaned up. Your points about "shar[ing] the same religion, Islam" and "nationalism was restricted to (largely Christian) urban intellectuals" seem at first blush to be mutually contradictory. Why do you call the riots of 1920 and 1921 "anti-Zionist" rather than "anti-Jewish"? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:55, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Zero - this looks like a great start.

<p>I see what you mean - the missing link is that Christians were also the first advocates of non-Ottoman states in general (Levantine Christians were the main founders of both pan-Arabism and pan-Syrianism) - thus becoming nationalists in Ottoman times already - and were therefore natural early adaptors (or, more accurately, conceivers) of other localist ideologies. 1) is thus not totally true, although nationalist movements remained quite small under the Ottomans. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:31, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jayjig, your point (1) is not what I intended. The Palestinians had been under foreign rulers for many centuries and the question has to be asked why the Zionists were not seen as just the next foreign ruler to come along. The main reason is that the Zionists wanted to populate and not just rule, but another part of it was that the Zionists were not Muslims. Since most Palestinians were Muslims, they preferred to be ruled by other Muslims. It was not a point about nationalism. I'll try to clarify the passage. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 11:33, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Fait accompli" groups</span></h2>
<p>"While almost all groups agree in regarding Israel's creation as an injustice to begin with, some regard the 1949 armistice lines as a fait accompli which it would be impossible or unjust to attempt to reverse given the massive Israeli presence there. For instance, many Palestinian refugee "right of return" groups (e.g. Al-Awda) emphasize that they would be willing to live under Israeli rule, and would not wish to dislodge too many Israelis. In such cases, the goal is usually restoration to the 1949 armistice lines, with an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip."</p>
<p>What is meant by <i>many</i> Palestinian refugee "right of return" groups and "would not wish to dislodge <i>too many</i> Israelis"? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 18:31, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Al-Awda is a British group, not a Palestinian group (although it presumably includes British Palestinians). It advocates the "return" of all 5 million Palestinians to "their homes" in what is now Israel - even though the great majority of these 5 million have never set foot in Israel. This would of course "dislodge" most Jewish Israelis, both physically (to accommodate several million people in a very small country) and politically (in that such a state would no longer have a Jewish majority, and would thus cease to be Israel). The demand for the "right of return" for all the descendents of the 1948 refugees (most of the original refugees being now dead) is thus a covert demand for the destruction of Israel, which is why Israel will never accept it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:14, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I presume it is a transliteration of Al-Awda ("the return") which is a Palestinian organization whose mailing address on their <a href="http://www.al-awda.org" class="external text" title="http://www.al-awda.org" rel="nofollow">home page</a> is in California. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 13:36, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>My point here is not to debate the politics of Al-Awda, but to understand why the article states that <i>many</i> "ror" groups would not want to displace "too many" Israelis, and what "too many" means in this context. Neither point is clear; I suspect the statements may not be factual either, but I can't even figure that out until I know what they mean. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 14:46, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If al-Awda is representative of "RoR" groups, then the statement is bunk - it's quite clear from their website that they advocate the abolition of Israel. The statment should therefore be deleted. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:45, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You have a point, and the whole concept needs to be examined. I'm also concerned with the statement "under Israeli rule"; do they expect to come back as internal "refugees", living under Israeli control? Or would they expect Israeli citizenship, in which case "under Israeli rule" seems pejorative at best; for example, naturalized American citizens are not considered to be "under American rule". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 16:06, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The present wording is unacceptably close to unintelligible. However, Adam's comments are outrageous. This article should state what the opinions of important parties are whether we agree with them or not. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 01:48, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, but I am unable to find a statement at the al-Awda website which says that the 5 million Palestinians (al-Awda's figure), if resettled in what is now Israel, "would be willing to live under Israeli rule." In fact it says "We campaign for the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland." It is obvious that if 5 million Palestinians were resettled in Israel, they plus the Arab Israelis would outnumber the Jewish Israelis, and thus the question of "Israeli rule" would become meaningless. Can someone show where al-Awda has said that the resettled Palestinians would be willing to live under Israeli rule? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:54, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are right that it has no such statement, but then again there is nothing about "resettled in what is now Israel" (your words) either. What it says is "they are entitled to live anywhere in Palestine which encompasses present-day "Israel", the West Bank and Gaza Strip". Under the link "Factsheet" you can find an argument (doubtful or not) that this is possible without displacing most Israelis. It reads like a unitary state proposal, but the details are very unclear. There is a big rhetorical exaggeration about the number of Palestinians who would want to return to "their former homes". It suits them to claim that all the refugees and their descendants would make that choice, but of course they know that only a small fraction really would (as shown by surveys). It is reminiscent of the previous Zionist claim that all the Jews of the world would rush to Israel as soon as they were able. I'll finish with a question: did Fiji cease to exist when the Indian component of the population passed 50%? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 10:11, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The exaggerations extend further than that, specifically to the actual numbers of Palestinian "refugees" listed as existing around the world. As for the number wishing to return home, if al-Awda overestimates, I think you seriously underestimate. The Palestinians in question are typically currently living as second or even third class inhabitants of Arab states in which they are denied citizenship and many other fundamental rights regardless of how many generations have been born in the country (Lebanon being the most egregious example, and Jordan being the obvious exception). There is no doubt that hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, would wish to move to Israel and the territories, and that hundreds of thousands more would wish to move from the territories to Israel proper, where the infrastructure is better and in particular the standard of living higher, access to work easier, and economic prospects better. The comparison to Zionist claims and Israel is seriously flawed. To begin with, I don't think that most Zionists "claim[ed]" that "all Jews of the world would rush to Israel as soon as they were able"; rather, I think it was their fervent hope that Jews would do so, as indeed millions did. However, Israel has generally had a lower standard of living and vastly more difficult economic prospects for Jews contemplating movement there than the countries in which they already lived; this stands in marked contrast to the situation of most Palestinians vis a vis Israel.</dd>
<dd>Regardless, and more to the point, the fact that al-Awda calls Israel "present day" and puts its name in quotation marks would indicate that they, in fact, do not accept the present day Israel as a <i>fait accompli.</i> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 14:56, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe there is some of that, but its generally pro-zionists who blur the distinction in order to smear (usually left wing) anti-zionists as anti-semites. Leastways thats what I've noticed. I saw a documentary where they explained what "anti-semite"ment by showing pictures of anti-zionist left wing protesters w signs comparing Israeli policies to those of nazi germany. This was said to be textbook anti-semitism.

<p>It was a nightline (on ABC) episode maybe three years ago, so I won't be able to reference it very well&#160;;) On the other hand I am quite certain there are dozens of sources certifying that some consider the comparing of anything done by the state of Israel to anything done by Nazi Germany to be anti-Semitic. Considering this is a favorite tactic of protesters against certain Israeli excesses, it paints w a rather broad brush a group (left-wing anti-Zionist protesters in the west) who are largely non-anti-Semitic (in my crude estimation anyhow). As far as all this code word for Jew stuff, maybe. I'd like to see some evidence. The anti-semite web sites/propaganda materials I have seen just come out and blame the Jew, w no mincing about w code words. I remember when this "Zionist = code for Jew among anti-Semites" subject came up before on <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a>. I had a bit of trouble finding actual evidence for it, but I did come up w a couple links, <a href="http://www.gentileworld.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gentileworld.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and <a href="http://www.sweetliberty.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sweetliberty.org/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, but I don't know if we call what these guys are doing "code words". Their pretty darn obvious as anti-semites, a far cry from some long haired anti-global/anti-war/anti-Zionist "oppression" protestor who waves his "Sharon is a nazi" sign until the police knock it out of his hands and drag him off. I don't think it helps anybody other than the real nazi's to give these very dissimilar Anti-Zionists the same "anti-Semite" label. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 17:14, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you been following the discussion above? Did you read the whole section on "Straw-man anti-Semitism"? These topics are covered in both the discussion and the article itself. As well, links have been provided to sites of anti-Semites who do indeed use "Zionist" as a code word for Jew. If using "Zionist" instead of "Jew" is not a code word, then what is it? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 18:09, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its one of the most internationally signifigant things Jews are doing, thats what it is. Its also possibly the most controvercial issue internationally right now. There are a cornacopia of reasons one could be for or against it, and its entirely possible to be both anti-semitic <i>and</i> anti-zionist, or one, or neither, etc...

<dd>There is only one implication to the latter part of my statement? What nonsense. Yes, you would prefer to promote a particular implication, in order to besmirch me, but that implication is one you have invented. Anti-Semites are looking for allies, and they believe they might find them among Arabs, so they are reaching out to them; whether or not they can or will make an alliance with any particular Arab or Arab group is an entirely different question.
