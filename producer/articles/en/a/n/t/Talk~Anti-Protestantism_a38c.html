<p>For <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">User:Lankiveil</a>, good luck on keeping the catholics from reverting anti-catholicism to being an outrageous irrational psychosis, while anti-protestantism is "kept in its place" as a mere bias.</p>
<p>Votes are in to keep this page, but someone needs to clean it up.</p>
<p>I took a stab at it and removed the NPOV tag, chiefly because there was no explanation for the tag here on the talk page. If someone thinks the article is biased, they should explain here which way they think it is biased and what should be changed, at least in general terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>It =is= biased because "someone" refuses to accept that anti-protestantism is just as evil as anti-catholicism, witnessed by the anti-catholicism page saying that's "irrational" and evil, while anti-protestantism is just a "bias" and is in no way equated to the "racism" and "anti-semitism" that anti-catholicism is equated to. This is soooo pro-Catholic POV that you have to be blind not to see it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is something of an explanation for that. When I still edited here I really did look for sites that were as paranoid to Protestants as people like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Chick_19ea.html" title="Jack Chick">Jack Chick</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> are to Catholics. You may not believe that, but I remember putting all kinds of things like "Protestantism is a cult" or whatever in search engines in hopes of showing the irrational hatred some have for their faith/movement. I think I did find an Eastern Orthodox site saying it and a Belarussian news station which alleged Evangelicals sacrifice babies. I think I even put that in, but mostly I really just can't find stuff like that. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Protestantism+is+a+cult%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Protestantism+is+a+cult%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">This</a> is all I got for "Protestantism is a cult." <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Catholicism+is+a+cult%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Catholicism+is+a+cult%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">This is what I got</a> for "Catholicism is a cult." See that didn't get many results either, but it still got 27 times as many hits as the phrase for Protestants. Now the explanation, I think, is that "Protestantism" is not a single religious denomination. Instead it's a collection of denominations associated to a religious movement. Hence <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Baptists+are+a+cult%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Baptists+are+a+cult%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Baptists are a cult</a> gets almost one-sixth as many hits as "Catholicism is a cult" yet Baptists don't represent anywhere near one-sixth the population of Catholics. Anyway yeah I am Catholic and I have theological problems with Protestantism, but I think in the world today Protestants are far more religiously persecuted than Catholics. My Dad's side of the family are Baptist and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assembly_of_God_1b66.html" title="Assembly of God">Assembly of God</a>. I removed AoG from some "list of purported cults" many times as they had no real source and it was just meanness I think. Sure I don't agree with Protestantism, but I'm horrified by the treatment they receive in many parts of the world and sometimes receive by Catholics like me. If you can find sources or movements that express irrational or paranoid hatred of Protestants I totally support adding them to the article. Who knows maybe I even helped you do so? I won't do any editing myself as I've given up on Wikipedia as terminally flawed. Still if you want to fix it go for it. In fact I'd prefer it open by saying Anti-Protestantism is "opposition or hatred" as simple "bias" is something I feel about Protestantism.(But not Protestants themselves, any bias I feel is purely theologic and not personal.)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p><a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">User:Lankiveil</a> has made the two equal, for now, but we'll see how long it takes for some rabid pro-RCC POV to make its way back into the sister article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-catholicism.html" title="Anti-catholicism">anti-catholicism</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I intend to keep an eye on both, but I invite anyone to help try and keep the two balanced if bias slips into either. As neither a Catholic or a Protestant, I think I can keep a relatively neutral view of things. Unfortunately, it's a subject that some people can get very emotional about, and they lose sight of NPOV when that happens. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 12:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So much of this article discusses anti-evangelicalism, or anti-fundamentalism, that the focus of the article doesn't seem to be "anti-protestantism" in general at all. I'm not sure if the article should be split up into two separate articles on 1)anti-fundamentalism/evangelicalism and 2)anti-mainline protestantism, or if the article simply should have more information on beliefs that are clearly anti-protestant in a general sense. -- <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETemtem_be47.html" title="User:Temtem">Temtem</a> 00:02, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The section doesn't read very well, and from my US perspective seems to miss the point. In the US, some evangelicals fancy themselves persecuted because of laws or policies that prohibit religious displays or proselytizing on public property. They also feel that official policies, say, of non-discrimiation against homosexuals violates their religious freedom by forcing them to treat people they consider to be notorious sinners equally. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:16, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can answer your question for 1 group at least, SDA are definately considered protestant, they are a pretty traditional schism group from methodists and as such trace their roots back to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>. If you consider Seventh Day Baptists to be a protestant group then you have to include SDA. The dietary guidelines, and every other difference which I know of is voluntary rather than law. They are based on <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a> like all of the traditional protestant beliefs. And are not incompatible with other protestant groups.</li>
<li>However, I believe with Jehovah's Witnesses there is an incompatible doctrine problem with the concept of Trinity and Jesus's Divinity. But I haven't done any research.</li>

<p><i>In the Muslim world hostility to Evangelical Christians is widespread and arguably the most violent. In several Islamist societies converting to Christianity is deemed apostasy and can have legal reprecussions. These can vary from censorship to death. Hence in 2004 Eritrea began a crackdown that saw the arrests of several Evangelicals. In other parts of the Islamic world, however, anti-Christian feelings are admittedly more generalized. Christianity in general is viewed unfavorably in Turkey and Pakistan according to a recent Pew Survey.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>How is this relevant to Anti-Protestantism, as opposed to anti-Christianity, at all? Is there any evidence that any muslim society would be harsher to a muslim converting to evangelicalism (or other branch of Protestantism) than it would be to a muslim converting to Catholicism or Orthodoxy? -- <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETemtem_be47.html" title="User:Temtem">Temtem</a> 00:06, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>T. Anthony</b>: I tried to alter it some to make it more about Muslims versus Evangelicals. Although you have a good point in that it's often not clear that's what's happening.

<p>I have removed some references that seem unsupportable and some that have no citations. this article seemed very pov to me, not accepting that protestantism is disliked by many for its effects on socioty and not "hated" in any way. i have changed the first sentence thus. I have also changes the part where evangelicals were "hated". citing from the anti-clericalism article, much opposition to religion is opposition to the hirearchicle socioty that it produces. anti-protestanism is mostly just a variant of this opposition. specifically, hirearchy is easier to build when your religion is easy to convert to like protestanism and especially evangelicalism. also see the revolutionary communist party's stance on "christian fascism" --67.161.93.159 06:13, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Some Catholics indicated Protestantism was heresy, a crime similar to religious treason, and that without repentance the punishment for Protestantism should be death." This reads pretty POV to me. This seems to make claims regarding Catholics w/o support (the punishment=death part).</p>

<p>I have removed the pre-history section because it conveys and anti-catholic tone and mostly because it doesnt relate to modern protestantism. the idea that anyone who dissented from the catholic church was a protestant no matter what their beleif is fronted by people in the anti-catholic movement. christianity, similarly, cannot be discribed as a protestantism of judaism to be jumped toghether with all other splits from that religion. --67.161.93.159 06:23, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On May 4, User:24.2.52.199 has made some statements that are basically evangelical POV. While I welcome this user's perspective, some of the claims are quite clearly not suitable. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Evangelicals are one of America's most persecuted religious groups.", pure POV, that is not sourced or documented in any way.</li>
<li>"This view is shared by many non-evangelicals, like Catholics, Jews, Hindus, and some liberal Protestants(Epicopaneans e.g.)", not only poorly spelled, but possibly a veiled POV attack.</li>
<li>"there is no other Christian group more devoted to spreading the Gospel", this is what many evangelical Christians may perceive about themselves, but again, it's an unsourced (and unsourcable) piece of POV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Re the latest changes, a few pieces of clarification are needed here. The penal laws were first passed in 1609, first Jacobites did not appear until 1689. The xenophobia here refers to the Catholic rebels and was not perceived, it was unfortunately very real. James II did not institute "extreme discrimination" against anyone. What uthe penal laws first passed in 1609, first Jacobites appear in 1689. Thexenophobia here refers to the Catholic rebels. James II did not upset the whigs, covenanters etc was that he repealed the anti-catholic legislation and opened the military and public office to them. As part of this package of religious toleration, James was also prepared to offer toleration to the radical Presbyterians in Scotland, albeit after brutally repressing their armed rebellion - <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Killing_Time_4a0e.html" title="The Killing Time">the Killing Time</a>. What is says on the walls of Derry, that James was an, "arbritrary and bigotted monarch", does not stand up to the facts I'm afraid.</p>

<p>In several countries with a majority of the population identifying themselves as Catholic, there is a hostility to Protestantism as a whole</p>
<p>CITE</p>
<p>In more modern times, Catholic-Protestant relations have grown calmer. Nevertheless, in general the further a Protestant sect is from Catholicism in its doctrine, the more discomfort among many Catholic people arises. Anglicans and Lutherans are only sporadically viewed in a negative light in modern Catholic countries. However, a Zogby poll of American Catholics showed Catholics having a more hostile attitude toward Fundamentalist Christians than to any non-Christian religion</p>
<p>CITE This mixture of xenophobia and religious intolerance led to widespread massacres of Protestant settlers in the Irish Rebellion of 1641.</p>

<dd>There's a thing on Pew about Protestant/Catholic relations in Latin America. Exempting Northern Ireland this is the only place I've found with violence between the two groups and it's certainly less than the violence a century ago. Added to that people in the US have less problems voting for a Catholic then they did in the past according to Gallup. I can't get at the Gallup deal because you have to be registered to get their older polls.

<dd>I understand skepticism, but really? The polls on Americans being more willing to elect a Catholic than in the past are on several sites.

However American Catholics having a hostile view of "Fundamentalists" is supported by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001/11/15/poll-catholics.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001/11/15/poll-catholics.htm" rel="nofollow">Zogby 2001</a>. The poll did not ask views of Lutherans and Anglicans, but do you think it'd have been as negative. As for France or Ireland I didn't having polling data on them when I still edited here.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<p>I have reworded a number of sentences in the <b>Hostility to Evangelicals</b> section to give them some form of understandible meaning. I still have never heard of any evidence to prove that "In the Muslim world hostility to Evangelical Christians is ... arguably the most violent" and I would suggest that that be removed if nothing is cited. Overall, it seems like a pretty big claim and I would rather see it removed than justified in an unclear way.</p>
<p>As for the next section, Im not sure what "The most disliked protestant groups may include: Fundamentalists, Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Churches of Christ, Baptists and a few fringe sects" has to do with catholic and protestant disagreement. What was there before makes even less sense: "The most common objects of hostility among non-Protestants in general might be <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalists.html" title="Fundamentalists">Fundamentalists</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicals.html" title="Evangelicals">Evangelicals</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostals.html" title="Pentecostals">Pentecostals</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church_a1ea.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churches_of_Christ_04ac.html" title="Churches of Christ">Churches of Christ</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a> and a few fringe sects"</p>
<p>Either way, much of this article is poorly worded and/or irrelevent and should thus be clensed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that I deleted the anti-protestanism in britain section because the persecution of catholics there seems to be the only evidence of their bias against protestants. Although I recognize that this is a common trend in this article, this section went ridiculously too far. Information like that should go in an article concerning <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-catholicism.html" title="Anti-catholicism">anti-catholicism</a> if anywhere, and this article should be discussing the opposite of that. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 09:00, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure about all of it but the "Center for Religious Freedom" and a few other sources indicate Evangelicals face the most violence in Islamic countries. A recent poll showed people less likely to vote for someone described as "An Evangelical Christian" than for any other Christian group except Mormons. I think the poll was from a Los Angeles paper.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:37, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is a horrible mess! That's a crying shame because it is an important and interesting topic, and yet the points of merit in the article are sandwiched in between POV bleating and scarcely-hidden doctrinal posturing! Cite more REAL instances of religious discrimination, persecution or ridicule or whatever, preferably from historicial and politically or socially relevant contexts ... but stop blathering over and over that people hate Evangelicals because they "take the Bible literally". That is a blantant doctrinal statement, and it just makes you look like a silly meme-machine. For instance the Zogby poll cited has NOTHING to do with Catholics distrusting Evangelicals because they believe the Bible, but everything to do with political afficilations and agenda, etc. Please, get real, and make this article less embarassing to read!!!

<p>The phrase and concept 'anti-protestantism' seems to me mainly to refer to the inter-wikipedia dispute (or 'balancing act') with the proponents of the 'anti-catholicism' article. In the context of the UK most 'anti-protestantism' was between one protestant sect and another (this is how the USA started...). Historically there was a three cornered fight between Anglicans, Nonconformists and Catholics with the two latter having penal laws imposed on them by the former. Where 'anti-protestantism' comes into this is anyones guess... The most trenchant criticisms and satires on the (protestant) Nonconformists have come from the established (protestant) church (and vice-versa). The animosity between (protestant) church and (protestant) chapel was very bitter indeed till very recent times. IMHO 'Anti-Nonconformist' or 'Anti-Evangelical' or 'Anti-Fundamentalist' or 'Anti-Establishmentarian' have much more conceptual validity than 'Anti-Protestant'. 'Anti-Protestantism' might make more sense if it referred to doctrinal or theological disputes between Protestants and Catholics, but that doesn't seem to be the main sense of this article - which seems to have constructed its putative subject itself and is thus staking a claim to 'originality'.....<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 16:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My main beef with this article is the glaring omissions. The article only mentions the English persecution of Protestants under Bloody Mary in passing, and the persecution of the Huguenots isn't mentioned at all. What about the Protestant rebellions in Spanish-controlled Holland? What about the martyrdom of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer or Jan Huss? How about Foxe's Book of Martyrs? Although it was sensationalistic, to say the least, it also bears mentioning as the most well known book on the persecution of Protestants. Zach82 03:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess that those actions were anti-Protestant. The only trouble is that most of them have come to our attention and have been exaggerated through the writings of anti-Catholics involved in a propaganda war...Difficult to know how to approach this subject from the right angle...</dd>
<dd>What MIGHT be relevent was SOME samizdat anti-Protestant propaganda produced by under-cover Jesuits under Elizabeth 1: such stuff as 'Leicester's Commonweath' used to rubbish Eliza's chief minister, alleging that the Protestant establishment were really crypto-Machiavellian atheists....</dd>
<dd>What was the nature of the anti-Protestant propaganda produced in Catholic Spain etc? (I vainly wonder.....).<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 11:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it's rather easy to know what happened to Protestants in Catholic countries. The Huguenots were persecuted in France, and I saw the church they built in exile in Berlin when I went there on holiday. We do know Archbishop Thomas Cranmer was burned at the stake for Protestantism after he had recanted his Protestant beliefs. According to legend, when the pyre was lit he thrust his right hand down into the flames so the hand that signed the recantation would burn first. We don't have to resort to Foxe's Book of Martyrs to find examples of anti-Protestantism. Zach82 14:37, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and I've just remembered a little thing called the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_Reformation_3b8f.html" title="Counter Reformation">Counter Reformation</a>...This was the ideological and institutional basis of the anti-Protestant drive. And the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, I guess merits a mention. So basically the whole article needs to be re-written....<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 17:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am somewhat puzzled by the this lengthy section of the article. It seems to be looking at the situation in Ireland through the wrong end of the telescope. Much of the anti-Protestantism it details is merely an observation that the Catholics did not enjoy being under the heel of the Protestant Ascendency and reacted against it. It would make more sense to have it in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> article. Following a similar logic persecution of the blacks in the Southern States of the USA could be twisted round to 'shocking anti-White sentiments of blacks in Alabama when confronted with a lynch mob' or the persecution of Christians by the Romans to 'terrible anti-pagan feelings of Christians about to be eaten by lions'. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 13:20, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to be looking at this through the wrong end of a telescope yourself.. perhaps binoculars would be better for you!&#160;:) To explain, there is <i>definately</i> anti-Protestantism in Ireland, and there has been such a feeling here since the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> basically. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 18:25, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, yes, in the sense that the Jews and the Moslems had mixed feelings about Torquemada and the Pope back in Olde Sunny Spaine in Ye Oldeden Dayes. However I do grant you that since the time of Eamon de Valera ("don't listen to him!" - my Irish friends say.....) the Protestants have faced discrimination in the Republic of Ireland. But this is hardly the greatest hardship that Protestants have faced (not as bad as the Netherlands under King Philip for instance). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 22:19, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Protestants in Ireland have faced discrimination too. Also, Protestants in Ireland (and in Britain) have faced discrimination from the likes of William III &amp; Mary, James II and others at various times since the Refomation.. not to mention from specific groups. Whether or not this anti-Protestant sentiment was worse than or not as bad as in other countries is neither here nor there. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 03:05, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Protestants facing discrimination from King Billy! Don't tell that to Ian Paisley or the Orange Order...But, yes, confusingly for this article, there was a three corner fight in old Ireland (and England) between Anglicans, Presbyterians and Catholics. Is there a wikipedia article for Anglican Protestants vs Presbyterian Protestants I wonder?....not to mention Scottish Presbyterians versus Cromwellian Nonconformists which resulted in several major battles on English and Scottish soil during the Civil War...<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 03:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
