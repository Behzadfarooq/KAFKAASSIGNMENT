<p><b>António Joaquim Rodrigues Ribeiro</b>, (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>) was a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> singer and songwriter. Despite his short-lived career, due to his premature death at the age of thirty-nine, he would, under the stage name of <b>António Variações</b>, become one of the most culturally significant performing artists of recent Portuguese history. His recorded works blended contemporary music genres with traditional Portuguese rhythms and melodies, creating music which for many is symbolic of the liberalization that occurred in Portuguese society after the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnation_Revolution_6ec0.html" title="Carnation Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.

<p>António Variações was born in Lugar do Pilar, a small village in Fiscal (<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amares.html" title="Amares">Amares</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braga.html" title="Braga">Braga</a>), the fifth of the ten offsprings of Deolinda de Jesus and Jaime Ribeiro. As a child, his love of music often took him away from his field work chores and towards the local folklore celebrations. He completed his basic education at the age of eleven and soon after took up his first job making small trinkets in the neighbouring village of Caldelas.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve he left the interior to the capital, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, to work at an office. He served the compulsory army duty in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angola.html" title="Angola">Angola</a>, returning home safe and sound, but almost immediately departing to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, to work as a dishwasher at a school, for the duration of a year. Returning once again to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> for a brief time in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, António Variações roamed to <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> where he took up hairdressing, profession which he would continue to exert when returning to Lisbon in the following year, opening the first <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unisex.html" title="Unisex">unisex</a> salon in the country and afterwards a barber shop downtown (among his clients there would be several people from the music industry, who would help launch his career).</p>
<p>Parallelly to this day job, he started working the local club scene at night, along with a group of musicians dubbed "Variações" (translated, "Variations", a word which suggested the diversity of the singer's influences, sound and style). His garish visuals and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_%28style%29.html" title="Camp (style)">campy</a> fashion accessories, uncommon for a man at the time in Portugal, soon started to become noticed.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, António submitted a demotape to Valentim de Carvalho, one of the most important record labels in Portugal, but, despite signing a contract, he would not be allowed to record anything for another four years because the executives were unsure about the genre that best suited his work, <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> music, and therefore could not come to a consensus as to what should be done with the unusual artist. In February of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, he appeared with his band in a popular TV show presented by Júlio Isidro, called "Passeio dos Alegres", billed as "António e Variações" and performing two unreleased songs ("Toma o comprimido" e "Não me consumas"). Following this appearance, he would be a guest a few times on "Febre de Sábado de Manhã", a radio show on Rádio Comercial presented by the same host.</p>

<p>In July <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, his first single was released, this time under the name of <b>António Variações</b>. This recording featured a cover of the seminal <a href="../../../f/a/d/Fado.html" title="Fado">fado</a> "Povo Que Lavas No Rio", immortalized by the diva of the genre, <a href="../../../a/m/%C3%A1/Am%C3%A1lia_Rodrigues_9290.html" title="Amália Rodrigues">Amália Rodrigues</a>, and an original song of his own authorship, "Estou Além". The cover song of the untouchable fado caused controversy among many, but over time became accepted as a heartfelt tribute of Variações to Amália Rodrigues, to whom he dedicated his first <a href="../../../l/p/_/LP_album_4c13.html" title="LP album">LP</a>, "Anjo da Guarda", released in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, to great critical and popular acclaim.

<p>After a series of concerts, António returned to the studio and, between the 6th and 25th of February of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, recorded his second and final LP, entitled "Dar &amp; Receber", which would be released in May of the same year and received once again with great enthusiasm on all fronts (having in the song "Canção de Engate" one of the artist's biggest hits). In April he would make his last public appearance at the TV show "A Festa Continua", hosted by Júlio Isidro.</p>

<p>On May the 18th of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, Variações was admitted to the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital_Pulido_Valente_4226.html" title="Hospital Pulido Valente">Pulido Valente hospital</a> with symptoms of asmatic <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronchitis.html" title="Bronchitis">bronchitis</a> and later transferred to the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> Clinic. At this time, the health of the artist was severely debilitated and rumours about his condition being brought on by <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> started to circulate, which, given the prejudice towards the disease at the time, made him a target of some discrimination. Save for his family and closest friends, he received few visitors during his stay at the hospital. In June the press released news that his health state had deteriorated considerably.</p>

António Variações' coffin is carried away, at the Estrela Basilica.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the dawn of the 13th of July, António Variações passed away due to a bilateral bronchial <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, on the day consecrated to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Anthony_of_Lisbon_8f4d.html" title="Saint Anthony of Lisbon">St. Anthony of Lisbon</a> (in Portuguese, <i>António</i>, like himself). His funeral was held on the 15th at the Estrela Basilica, where family, friends, fellow musicians, barbers and fans paid their last respects. The funeral stirred some controversy, due to the fact that the authorities ordered that his coffin be sealed for public health concerns, which further fueled the rumours that he had died as a result of <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>-related complications. The family of António Variações doesn't acknowledge that this was the actual cause of death (or that he was a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a>), but it's assumed by most that he was one of the first public victims of the disease in Portugal. His former manager, Teresa Couto Pinto, has claimed that, prior to his death, Variações had received clinical test results performed in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> confirming that he was indeed <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> positive. His remains were buried in the cemetery of Amares, where they still rest today.</p>

<p>António Variações had no formal music training. His first musical influence was his father, who played <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accordion.html" title="Accordion">accordion</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaquinho.html" title="Cavaquinho">cavaquinho</a>, but never had the chance to become a serious musician. From his travels abroad, Variações was able to get in touch with artists and genres which were not widely known back home and began fusing genres such as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">new wave</a> with his Portuguese <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/d/Fado.html" title="Fado">fado</a> roots.</p>
<p>Not knowing how to play or compose music did not stop António from making music by himself. He would, using a tape recorder, mimic sounds and rhythms while he sang, using his own voice or even tapping his hands on different objects. These recordings were then used by his supporting studio musicians as the basis for the song arrangements. Variações' music is characterized by the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthesizer.html" title="Synthesizer">synthesizers</a>, to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_guitar.html" title="Portuguese guitar">portuguese</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_guitar.html" title="Classical guitar">classical guitars</a>, to accordions and more. Defying genre definition, he created his own description for his sound: something between Braga and New York, reflecting the cosmopolitan, yet down to earth and rural aspect of his eclectic style. He was intent on becoming a popular artist in the true sense of the word and he managed to reach audiences which were very diverse, from the blue collar to the white collar workers, to the uneducated and the intellectuals, to young and old alike.</p>

<p>Despite having only the minimum education (at the time, four years of basic instruction, although he also attended night school classes in Lisbon for some time) and no music training, Variações had a deep sense of rhythm and a keen mastery of the written word. Variações' lyrics are often a mix of proverbs, popular wisdom and personal experiences and he had a notable ability of spinning commonplaces into original and compelling imagery. This popular character of his words made it easy for most of his listeners to identify with the themes of the songs, which often speak about restlessness, feelings of escapism or the deceitful nature of love affairs. A few of his songs have an autobiographical resonance (such as "Olhei P'ra Trás", where he describes the sorrowful but hopeful departure from his small village or "Deolinda de Jesus", dedicated to his mother).</p>

<p>António Variações was a fervent admirer of the Portuguese poet <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_Pessoa_e0aa.html" title="Fernando Pessoa">Fernando Pessoa</a> (dedicating the LP "Dar &amp; Receber" to Pessoa, in a cryptically unfinished sentence, and using one of his poems on the song "Canção") and some of his lyrics share similarities with the feelings expressed on some of Pessoa's poems. Another of the artist's major influences was <a href="../../../a/m/%C3%A1/Am%C3%A1lia_Rodrigues_9290.html" title="Amália Rodrigues">Amália Rodrigues</a>, a <a href="../../../f/a/d/Fado.html" title="Fado">fado</a> singer of international renown. Apart from dedicating his first LP to her and covering one of her songs, he also wrote an ode to the singer, recorded as the song "Voz-Amália-de-Nós", in which he sings "All of us have Amália in our voice and we have in her voice the voice of all of us" (Amália Rodrigues is a Portuguese national icon). Both artists would only meet on stage once, a concert at the Aula Magna of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Lisbon_22c3.html" title="University of Lisbon">University of Lisbon</a>, on May 26 <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Amália paid back homage to António by attending his funeral celebration.</p>
<p>From his extensive travels abroad, he got acquainted with the work of foreign artists like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Ferry_b902.html" title="Brian Ferry">Brian Ferry</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kinks_a7b7.html" title="The Kinks">The Kinks</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. This encounter with a different musical culture left a deep impression on him; a testament to this is the fact that his first song experiments were written in English (although he soon abandoned this approach, in search of a more authentic and personal style of writing, in Portuguese).</p>

<p>Because Variações did not have the knowledge to properly compose music by himself, collaboration with other musicians at the writing, recording and producing stages was necessary. He would first collaborate with the musicians Vítor Rua, Tóli César Machado (both from the band <a href="../../../g/n/r/GNR_%28band%29_01cf.html" title="GNR (band)">GNR</a>) and José Moz Carrapa on his first LP, "Anjo da Guarda", and then with Pedro Ayres Magalhães and Carlos Maria Trindade, at the time, part of the band Heróis do Mar (and later, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madredeus.html" title="Madredeus">Madredeus</a>) on the recording of "Dar &amp; Receber". The five members of Heróis do Mar acted as António's studio band; they would become close to Variações, especially Pedro Ayres Magalhães, who speaks fondly of him on the liner notes of "Dar &amp; Receber": "I thank you António, for your enthusiasm and trust, and I would like to write here that I've gained a friendship".</p>

<p>At the time of his death, Variações left behind a box containing over forty tapes and studio reels, which were forgotten for a long time, at first in the possession of his brother, Jaime Ribeiro. These were then kept for over ten years by David Ferreira at EMI-Valentim de Carvalho, until journalist Nuno Galopim took up the enterprise of listening to and transcribing them, which would become the beginning of the musical project known as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanos.html" title="Humanos">Humanos</a>.</p>
