	    <p>Hi, and thank you for registering. I had to revert <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finno-Ugric_languages_1153.html" title="Finno-Ugric languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a> to the previous version since your version did not mention any academic sources. Furthermore, I must say I have some trouble with the way you are participating in the ongoing discussion on the Talk page. Please adress the serious doubts that are raised, instead of repeating the same questions. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 20:55, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think, your reverting is absolutely not correct. My serious doubts in the existence of the group are compressed in those two simple questions. Our brain is there, that we use it. I repeat the simple questions, because they are the absolutely key thing for the existence or non-existence of this artificial mini-group. Please think about this. As soon as anybody can satisfactory answer them I will stop asking them. So simple is that. Does it irritate you so much, that the emperor is naked, that you call other "trolls" for not thinking the false way?

<dd>Dear Antifinnugor, your questions have to come in the second place. First you have to understand and appreciate how Wikipedia works. To produce articles of encyclopedic quality, contributors have to provide reliable sources. To be honest, the matter does not irritate me. I am not a Finno-Ugricist. I'm am just a linguist and a Wikipedian concerned with the quality of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, assuming, somebody writes, the earth is a round tray, and an other person proves it is not, you then revert to the plan tray article? That's what you are doing here. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" title="User:Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> 18:57, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>On a sidenote, I do not think your assertions are correct: your simple questions are not 'the absolutely key thing' for the existence or non-existence or this grouping.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Mark, you simply negate what I state, without any argumentation. This is really senseless. Those two questions show the unjustifiedness of this artificial group. No common features, no common vocabulary, and the single common feature, agglutination characterizes a lot of other languages. This is absolutely a key thing. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" title="User:Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> 18:57, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>dear Mark, I do not shift anything. I just want to illustrate, that ANYBODY, who uses his head to think, will very soon see, that these mini, unatural groups are non existing. It is that simple. ~~</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is ridiculous to expect <i>me</i> or any other Wikipedian to prove that <i>your</i> unsubstantiated additions to Wikipedia articles are not correct.</p>

<dl>
<dd>They are not unsubstantiated. If they were, you could answer the 2 simple questions. ~~</dd>

</dl>
<p>As repeatedly stated, you should back up your claims by reliable, academic sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I named one source, Dr. Maracz article, and another,professor Angela Marcantonio's one. I also cite it long. Did you read them and understand them? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" title="User:Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> 22:53, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>You refuse to do that, resulting in others 'cold bloodedly reverting your additions'. You might call it incorrect behavior; but in fact, it is simply how Wikipedia works. You should look out for another place to ventilate your personal opinion if you do not like it that way. No hard feelings. This is not a personal matter. I just happen to like the quality of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 21:48, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Antifinnugor. I first reverted your last changes to the <a href="../../../u/r/a/Talk%7EUralic_languages_184c.html" title="Talk:Uralic languages">Talk:Uralic languages</a> page since they were personal attacks and as such completely irrelevant to the discussion. Then I changed my mind and un-reverted, since I think it was not correct to delete your statements which were directed to <a href="../../../n/y/e/User%7ENyenyec_b0aa.html" title="User:Nyenyec">Nyenyec</a>. I am sorry for the possible confusion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>well, if you did not write, I have never noticed it. Do you understand, why Nyenyec requires a linguist for Hungarian grammar, when he states on his page, he is a Hungarian? Endings are teached in the 6-th class. If we stop thinking, forget what we learned, and simply reduce us to waiting for opinions of others, this leads to a very low level. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" title="User:Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> 17:40, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And to use your incorrect grammar again, I am about to make sure that you are <i>teached</i> a lesson. Don't mess with the Hungarians. --<a href="../../../p/i/s/User%7EPistolPower_0ab2.html" title="User:PistolPower">PistolPower</a> 00:29, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Regardless, I must urge you to stop from making personal attacks. Please refer to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines</a> and in particular to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. Wikipedia is a better place if we try to cooperate in peace, whatever differences there are between our views.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who attacks whom? I just ask him, to use his Hungarian grammar. I do not think, he treats this as an attack, and if he does, there is something very problematic with him. Would you? If yes, why? Anyway, your incorrect behaviour by reverting my correct remarks on the finnougric page is really wrong behaviour. I hope, you read the policies and guidelines. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" title="User:Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> 17:40, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I urge you to look again, and this time very closely, at the version of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finno-Ugric_languages_1153.html" title="Finno-Ugric languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a> you just reverted. You can find it in the history of that page, or for your convenience, here is a link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Finno-Ugric_languages&amp;oldid=7691906" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Finno-Ugric_languages&amp;oldid=7691906" rel="nofollow">Finno-Ugric languages, version before revert</a>.</p>
<p>Now look at the Bibliography section. What does it read? Marcantonio, <i>three times</i>, and one of them has a link to an 'online version'. <b>Yes, that's right. I added them for you.</b> And I updated the 'External links' section to reflect that. In other words, I moved the reference to the Marcantonio (2001) article up a section since is was no longer only an 'external link'. In other words, I not only provided you with sources but I also spent time thinking how to present them in the best way.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Now professor Marcantonio is really on both pages. Since you reverted me so many times, and treat my person instead of the subject, which I find disguisting, also your permanent teachings about wikipedia and other general things don't please me at all, please do not wonder, and do not be disappointed, that I do not trust you. You cannot expect better treatment from others, than as you treat others. I also find it strange and unacceptable, that you refuse to think yourself about two such simple questions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, in this case, thank you for your work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some explanations. Probably we are (or we were) not on the same knowledge level in this subject. I think and research about these strange language groups for years, and probably you see this all for the first time. Dr Marácz-s article also assumes, that the reader knows other linguists works, like professor Marcantonio's one and others. For you all this is new, and you needed the level of Marcantonio, while for me Marácz level is perfectly enough, since I have the background for that. I hope, I could explain you a little bit the way I am thinking. I now understand you a bit better. Not your revertings and personal art, but your way of thinking.

<p>You are right, I am sorry. Your list is appropriate on the Talk page. It does make sense, that such-and-such a percentage of the 200 Swadesh words in Finnish and Hungarian are <i>not</i> cognages. It is also true that the relationship between the two languages is rather remote, and you can point this out, no problem. I also encourage you to create a "criticisms" section where you can list povs of researchers who dispute the theory. It will not do to say that the theory is "nonsense", though, because the majority of experts thinks it is at least probable. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 16:45, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are no 200 similar words. That is a main point in the critic. There are maximum 10, that are slightly similar. That is the achilles angle of the theory. I do not doubt the similarity of Hu-Fi languages grammatically, but I doubt the existence of this artificial group, since it is nonsense, no matter, how many "experts" think, it is right. It is wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I once created a critic page, but it was (full hate, like pasquale) voted to be deleted. Now mustafa and pasquale delete all critic.

<dl>
<dd>I will support the creation of an article, or a section, on criticisms of the FU-hypothesis. However, let me say that I am not surprised that your effort met with little success, because your approach is very unscientific. You say you <i>know</i> the theory is nonsense, and discredit the serious linguists (yes, experts) who support it, evidently on political, not linguistic grounds. If you want your criticism to be heard, I suggest you study the critical references Markus has collected for you, and try to summarize those (just their arguments, without interjections of "alien nonsense" or similar). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 10:56, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Antifinnugor,</p>
<p>Why do you keep replacing ín with ér in the list of cognates at <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finno-Ugric_languages_1153.html" title="Finno-Ugric languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a>? Although ín doesn't mean vein, as you've pointed out, it's still <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognate</a> to the other words on that line, whereas ér is not. Do you understand what cognate means? --<a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">Dbenbenn</a> 20:59, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi,</dd>
<dd>Probably you have heard the anecdotes showing that translating a text twice or more time can change the meaning of the whole.</dd>
<dd>What happens here? The english word vein means ér in Hungarian. There is also a word véna for that. This is the tube, where blood flows. ín means sinew/tendon, that is the intermuscular connecting organ. Wikipedia is going to be erroneous with wrong words, don't you think?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other cheat word is father, it is clearly apa in Hungarian, ős means ancestor, which could be also listed, but as a different word. The level of the word list is goung more and more lower, if we put in wrong or incorrect words on the wrong or incorrect place. What do you think? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" title="User:Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> 09:33, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll ask again, do you understand what <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognate</a> means? Please go read that article. <b>ín</b> is cognate to Finnish <i>suoni</i>, and <i>ér</i> is not. The fact that <i>ín</i> doesn't mean the same thing as <i>suoni</i> is irrelevant. Do you understand what I mean? The same goes for <i>ős</i>, which is cognate to Finnish <i>isä</i>, while <i>apa</i> is not. --<a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">Dbenbenn</a> 18:12, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, two words are cognate if they derive from the same original word. Did you see the examples at <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognate</a> about how two cognates don't necessarily have the same meaning?</dd>

<dd>I read the article cognate, you mean probably starve (English) and sterben (German). They are tightly related words, while ín has absolutely nothing to do with vein. Besides that suoni and ín do not sound too similar, either.</dd>

<dd>Hi, Antifinnugor. Speaking of the Hungarian word 'ős', I'd like to point out that both 'father' in English and 'isä' in Finnish can be used in the meaning of 'ancestor'. <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiffey_996a.html" title="User:Liffey">Liffey</a> 12:04, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>French <i>lait</i> and Greek <i>galaktos</i> are cognates, as are the English words <i>cow</i> and <i>beef</i>. These are examples of cognates that don't look at all similar.</p>
<p>As you don't claim that <i>suoni</i> and <i>ér</i> are cognate, I think you should not put <i>ér</i> into the table of cognates. It doesn't help to replace one mistake with another.</p>
<p>"who says they are cognates, should prove": You're right that <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finno-Ugric_languages_1153.html" title="Finno-Ugric languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a> should attribute the list of cognates to a source. Citing sources is one of the biggest problems with Wikipedia. I've mentioned that problem on the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Talk%7EFinno-Ugric_languages_d37b.html#References" title="Talk:Finno-Ugric languages">talk page</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say it, but you have to hold to a higher standard here. If you aren't very careful about backing up your changes, they are likely to get reverted, simply because most people involved have concluded that your changes aren't trustworthy. I know it's frustrating, but that's just the way it is.</p>
<p>Here's what I suggest: Concentrate on one particular change, for example the "ín" cognate issue. Find a <i>trustworthy</i>, <i>mainstream</i> souce that justifies your change. Then put it on the <i>talk page</i> for review. Wait a few days, then put it in the article. I think if you do that you'll have better success.</p>
<p>Also, you have to be honest about what a trustworthy source is. This is a difficult issue, since evaluating whether a source is trustworthy is very subjective. But here's an example: Angela Marcantonio is not, to most people here, a trustworthy source, since the <a href="http://homepage.univie.ac.at/Johanna.Laakso/am_rev.html" class="external text" title="http://homepage.univie.ac.at/Johanna.Laakso/am_rev.html" rel="nofollow">Linguistic Shadow-Boxing</a> article by Johanna Laakso says that Marcantonio "shows several fatal misunderstandings that finally leave [her] central claims completely unfounded." When you cite a source, you have to convince everyone else that your source is valid. Try to find sources you aren't already aware of. Try to find sources that don't (appear to everyone else to) have political agendas. Again, that's unfair, but that's just how it is.</p>
<p>By the way, another possibility would be for you to add a Criticisms section, as <a href="../../../f/i/n/Talk%7EFinno-Ugric_languages_d37b.html#Disputed_article.3F.3F.3F" title="Talk:Finno-Ugric languages">dab has suggested</a>. I think this strategy is a lot more likely to be successful.

<p>This was a personal attack, and is frowned upon on Wikipedia. As for your link, as I told you before, I support the creation of an in-depth article about FU criticisms.

<p>Because of that, the revert was justified. As for "Critic of Finno Ugric and Uralic language Groups": The existence of the article is warrented (as I will say on VfD), but it isn't even spelled correctly.</p>

<dd>I am not militant at all. I am trying to give a fair representation to FU criticism, but all of any notability that has turned up so far can be summarized in two sentences. If you would follow my suggestions rather than edit warring (i.e. reversing things that are in the article by consensus), you would have a better chance of advocating your views. You are militant. That is fair enough, but accusing people patiently trying to keep your militant edits at bay is also paranoid. We are all ready to give informed linguistic criticism a place. Since you are not a linguist, it is your job to <i>find</i> linguists who criticize the theory. Angela Marcantonio has been harshly criticized by her peers, and yet we cite her views in the article. Find more linguists like her, and we will include them, it's as simple as that. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:50, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Antifinnugor, I voted to delete because the article appears to be original research without sufficient peer-review. The references seem circular, the discussion doesn't appear to be linguistically rigorous or detached and there seems to be some sort of political agenda hidden between the lines. I'd need to see more scholarly references on this before voting to keep it. Please remember that my opinion is just one vote. If sufficient wikipedians think the article should stay, it will!

<p>The references are not convincing. Also, your characterization of any relationship as <i>nonsense</i> is generally problematic, and your strong remark affirming that there is a political agenda confirms that the motives behind this article are not really related to linguistic science.

<p>Have you read the article on <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognate</a>? Have you understood that a cognate is not the same as a translation? Then you understand that <b>nobody</b> thinks that <i>ín</i> means vein.</p>

<dd>bachman, if ín is in the row where the corresponding English word is vein, then people think, that ín means vein. Understood?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>bachman, why should they think that? Those words have in meaning very little in common, and sound very differently. It is pure phantasy, that they are cognates.</dd>

<p>Hi there -</p>
<p>Thanks for the message. I was just helping out with a requested page move: there was a request on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a> to move Critic of Finno Ugric and Uralic language Groups to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_Groups_1e24.html" title="Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language Groups">Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language Groups</a>.

<p>Here is my reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first article, Critic of Finno Ugric and Uralic language Groups, is wrong for three reasons: it should be "Critique", not "Critic" (wrong word); it should be "Finno-Ugric" (with a hyphen) not "Finno Ugric"; and it should be "groups" not "Groups" (no capital);</li>
<li>The second article, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_Groups_1e24.html" title="Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language Groups">Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language Groups</a>, is also wrong: it should be "groups" not "Groups" (no capital);</li>
<li>The right place for the article, if anywhere, is <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_groups_174c.html" title="Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups">Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also an argument that the material should be incorporated into <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finno-Ugric_languages_1153.html" title="Finno-Ugric languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a>, or as a separate main article but summarised in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finno-Ugric_languages_1153.html" title="Finno-Ugric languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a>. There is definitely no need for the same material to be in two or three places at the same time: that is what redirects are for. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 20:50, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried to put my reason for reverting in the edit field, sorry it wasn't clear. I haven't contributed, but I've been following the discussions on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECritique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_groups_fde6.html" title="Talk:Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups">Talk:Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/n/Talk%7EFinno-Ugric_languages_d37b.html" title="Talk:Finno-Ugric languages">Talk:Finno-Ugric languages</a>, and I've had many interactions on other pages with the linguists I see discussing the conflict there, so I think I have a good basis for understanding what's involved. I understand that you believe strongly in the views you put forward, and that you must feel very beleaguered, with everybody joining forces against you like this. Believe me, I don't take any pleasure in contributing to that feeling. On the other hand, doesn't it <b>tell</b> you something that you're in a minority of one? It's an encyclopedia, it's supposed to be for consensus. The whole Internet's out there, nobody's going to revert you if you start your own website, or contribute to one that already exists for the purpose of propagating your take on the Finno-Ugric language question.<br />
I have a question for you in return. Why do you persist in breaking the rules of this place, after being warned?

<dd>PS: Please also note, before you ask, and before it gets you in trouble, that the community consensus (see <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Three_revert_rule" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Three revert rule</a>) is that a reversion with an edit added into it (e.g. adding some categories, or cross-language links) is still a reversion, and still counts against the 3RR. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 22:07, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

This will give you a chance to return and hopefully work out a compromise with the other users on the talk page.

<p>Hi, I just now got your email (the power failed at my house after a large blizzard, and it only now came back one, so I'm just back online now). I'm not sure what the problem was with your block, but it was probably the result of a bug in the Wikipedia software we've been having trouble with, where blocks expire but are not automatically lifted (as they are supposed to be). I see several people (including <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a>) have unblocked your account, so it should be working now. If not, please send me more email and I will investigate.</p>
<p>As to how to protect a page in the main article space, you can make a request at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>, but please note that there is no guarantee that the version that will be protected will be the one that you want! Administrators aren't supposed to pick a particular version, and prefer that one. If you want to make sure that a page with the content you like is available for people to look at, you should create it as a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpage_5405.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpage">Wikipedia:Subpage</a> of your User: page (e.g. User:Antifinnugor/Finno-Ugric languages). It is against Wikipedia policy for anyone else to edit such a page, and so if anyone does change it, you can <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">ask the administrators</a> to come look at the situation, and take action. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:43, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point of the article is that everyone who complains about protection thinks their version is the right version, and protected version is the wrong version. There is no way you can get the version you prefer protected, as the comments in the section above also indicated. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 18:10, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know how to make this any clearer; just because you asked for protection, that is no guarantee that the version you want protected will be protected. You were apparently warned about this (above) by Noel. Noel also suggested you create a subpage of your own page with the information in question, which I think is a good suggestion. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 18:24, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
