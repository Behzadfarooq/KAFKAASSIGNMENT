<p>I'm somewhat suspicious of this claim, recently added:&#160;:<i>In this work [the 9th symphony] he used elements from american music like Spiritual and indian music (pentatonic) but also czech elements.</i> I don't know a very great deal about Dvorak, but I do seem to remember that he denied using any American Indian or spiritual tunes in this work, and as far as I know there's no hard evidence that he did. Personally, I've never seen anything more "American" about this symphony than any of his others. Still, I'll leave this in for now, pending some sort of evidence, and/or a spot of further research on my part. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p>You are right. It is a common legend, but it is wrong. Dvorak never stated, that he was inspired by Native Americans. If you hear the music, there is absolutely no evidence for such an assumption. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, Dvorak explicitly stated that the thematic material in his "American" compositions (such as the 9th) was Bohemian in origin. On the other hand, he also made known his admiration for Amerindian and African-American folk music --he thought it would make an excellent basis for someone else's compositions. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">H.K.</a> 06:20, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmmzzz .... Its a bit more complicated I guess. He was asked to write an opera on a real American theme. He thought Hiawatha was really American, and he liked the story. So he started sketching even before he had a libretto, which was also before he started the ninth symphony. Also Miss Thurber wanted him to do an opera on Hiawatha, but never gave him a libretto. The exact reason why he did stop sketching the opera I'm not sure about, probably because waiting for a suitable libretto took too long, so he used sketches from Minnehaha's funeral in the second movement, and the scherzo was based on sketches probably for the feast at which the indians dance.

<dl>
<dd>I've only just noticed that you replaced it with "In this work he described landscapes that he had seen while visiting the USA." Is that actually true? I wasn't aware he was trying to describe anything - I thought he just went to America, felt inspired for some reason, and so wrote a symphony (maybe he was inspired by the countryside, I don't know, but I don't think he was seeking to describe it). Still, I'll leave it be for the moment in case you know better (I'll have a poke through a couple of Dvorak biographies to see if I can come up with anything). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I had a poke around and found an interesting article by Dvorak published in the NY Herald 1893. I'll add a summary of what he says to this page, and some more detail at <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._9_%28Dvorak%29_f8c8.html" title="Symphony No. 9 (Dvorak)">Symphony No. 9 (Dvorak)</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../m/g/o/User%7EMgoetze_c227.html" title="User:Mgoetze">mgoetze</a>: Keep in mind that Dvorak had just recently arrived in the USA when he started writing the piece and had had no opportunity whatsoever to explore the music of Native Americans; some Czech musicologist (forgot his name but I believe the initials were OS) has done a lot of research and pretty much proven that the themes of the New World symphony are very much original and in fact influenced by Czech folk music...</p>

<p>A few questions about this new "symphonies" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Unlike many other composers who shied away from the symphony until their mature years (notably his mentor <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Brahms_a544.html" title="Johannes Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a>)...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Were there really "many" who left the symphony for a long time? I can only think of Brahms. Maybe I'm forgetting somebody obvious (I usually am...).</p>
<dl>
<dd>mg: Beethoven, Franck, Bruckner come to mind... Some 20th Century composers were so much in awe of the symphony that they didn't write one at all...&#160;;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, Beethoven first was premiered in 1800 when he was 29, so I don't think he counts. I'll let you have Franck and Brucker, though I don't think either of them wrote anything very much until their later years. Anyway, this isn't a very big deal. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>mg: Well, Beethoven had already had 20 works published at the time... Dvorak none... but as you say it's not a big deal. The main contrast here is to Brahms, who was for many years absolutely terrified of writing a symphony...&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>There could hardly be a starker contrast to</i> Symphony No. 8 in G major <i>(published as No. 4), a very modern work which could almost have been written by <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Mahler_fb2a.html" title="Gustav Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This seems quite a bold claim to me - Dvorak 8 sounds nothing like Mahler to me. Can we attribute this opinion to some noted writer?</p>
<dl>
<dd>mg: Karl Schumann argues the case in his essay which comes with the Kubelik cycle. Particular mentions: "The linear instrumental writing, the many and sometimes bizarre solo passages, the technique of development and the songlike shape of the melodies all point forward to Mahler, who was to be a great admirer and interpreter of Dvorak" ... "It anticipates Mahler's practice of linking motifs" ... "A solo trumpet fanfare heeralds the finale, which combines the principles of variation and development in a manner anticipating that of Mahler".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting. I must admit, I don't buy it myself, but we can stick Schumann's name next to it, and I'm happy&#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are quite a lot of other things similar to this which I sort of doubt we can express as fact. I'm OK with the "this shows the influence of Beethoven" stuff, but things like "Clearly the scherzo [of the first symphony] is the strongest movement, but the others are not uninteresting" bother me. If these views are widely held then it's better, I think, to say something like "the scherzo is considered to be the strongest movement". If, on the other hand, there is no general critical consensus on these things, I think we just have to pass over them in silence - we can't go expressing an opinion on something (as per the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy).</p>
<dl>
<dd>mg: It's quite clear in the case of Dvorak's first IMHO, unlike say Bruckner's 00th where Tintner considers the scherzo the selling point whereas I personally prefer the first movement... but I would be interested if you can come up with any opposed viewpoints here...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I definitely can't - truth is, I barely know the first symphony at all (I heard it once a few years ago when I "did" Dvorak, but never since, and I don't have a recording). My point, I suppose, is that if a view is widely held, it's better to make it clear that it is by saying "the scherzo is generally considered the strongest movement", rather than just say "the scherzo is the strongest movement", which sounds like an opinion. I'll fiddle with this now. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not going to edit any of this myself just now, because I don't know Dvorak as well as I might, but I do think we could be a bit more neutral here. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>mg: Sure, I'm a very opinionated kind of guy... but I felt the page was a bit lacking so I just went ahead and added some info, looking forward to the revision process.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, thanks for adding it - the page was indeed rather lacking, and as you say, it'll get revised into shape over time&#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All's well that ends well, and the page is looking good, team. Nice work. BTW, I happend to see the 8th performed live last weekend (first time I've seen it live) and came away buzzing. Wonderful stuff! It's almost a cliche to say that much of the 19th century was essentially an extended period during which composers sat around asking themselves "what do we do after Beethoven?" - quite often not coming up with any answers. Not Dvorak. 4 hours driving to see the 8th, and worth every minute</p>

<p>I've removed: "(pronounced Vojak)". I admit, I don't know exactly how Dvorak himself pronounced his name, nor how modern Czechs would pronounce it, but I would pronounce "Vojak" to rhyme with "<a href="../../../k/o/j/Kojak.html" title="Kojak">Kojak</a>", and that's definitely wrong. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p>It would be nice to have a pronunciation of his name. Does anyone know what it is? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:55, Apr 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know how to pronounce it (as well as a non-native Czech speaker can be expected to), but what's the accepted way of representing pronunciations here? Do we use one of the IPA-in-ASCII schemes, or something else? Tim Bell</dd>

<dd>According to a CD I have of Dvorak the presented pronounciation is ("dah-VORE-zhahk"). I would think this is pretty accurate, it's better than refrencing another on-line website. Reference: Dvorak: The Greatest Hits, Reference Gold. I have changed the main page to reflect this but not the .ogg sound file (I don't know how to open such a file anyway) -MarlonG</dd>

<dd>That may be the most common English pronunciation, but the previous version (dvorzhak) was closer to the authentic Czech pronunciation. The word presents two problems to English speakers: the consonant cluster "dv" and the sound [r̝] (a trilled "r" and zh pronounced simultaneously). I believe the .ogg file was made by native Czech speakers. The most precise way of indicating the pronunciation is IPA; I will attempt a transcription. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesgles_b335.html" title="User:Lesgles">Lesgles</a> (<small><a href="../../../l/e/s/User_talk%7ELesgles_4345.html" title="User talk:Lesgles">talk</a></small>) 02:13, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The IPA transilteration given (['dvor̝aːk]) indicates stress on the first syllable. This is also how I'm used to hearing the name borrowed into Hebrew (['dvoʒak]). But listening to the recording, I hear stress on the second syllable ([dvo'r̝aːk]) both times. Is there a mistake in the IPA transliteration? Is my concept of stress different than that of native Czech speakers? Or maybe stress is not phonemic in Czech at all? --uv 18:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That the Fourth is regarded as the best of the early Symphonies comes as a surprise to me. I love its excessively repetitive Finale, but the overall impression I get from the criticism of this work, (not that I have read much on this particular work) is that its troubled by pointless repetition and following textbook definitions too closely. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDel_arte_df03.html" title="User:Del arte">Del arte</a> 20:32, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re Wagner influence almost lacking - Penguin Guide 1991 reviewer believed the scherzo trio theme a Wagner quote, if I remember. (The second theme of the main part of the scherzo- the march theme- reappears in- I believe - <i>From the Bohemian Forest</i> (4-hand piano work), in a completely unrelated tidbit.) <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a> 23:56, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed it is a bit strange, especially concering the second movement, that's almost literally Tannhäuser, and Wagner's influence always stayed a part of his musical style, like in Othello, or the later symphonic poems. But of course his own voice grew stronger and stronger, though even in his third he is quite personal: cyclical form; three part symphony. It's quite an experiment of its own!

<p>" <i><b>Not very remarkable, but not of low quality either,</b> is Symphony No. 2 in B flat major, still looking up to Beethoven. But Symphony No. 3 in E flat major clearly shows the sudden and profound impact of Dvořák's recent acquaintance with the music of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt.</i></p>
<p><i>The influence of Wagner was not lasting, however; it can hardly be heard anymore in Symphony No. 4 in D minor. This last of Dvořák's early symphonies is also widely regarded as the best. Again the scherzo is the highlight, but already Dvořák shows his absolute mastery of all formal aspects.</i></p>
<p><i>Dvořák's middle symphonies, Symphony No. 5 in F major (published as No. 3) and Symphony No. 6 in D major (published as No. 1), are happy, pastoral works. They are not as famous as their later cousins, though many consider them just as good. The Fifth is the more pastoral work, although there is a dark slow movement which borrows (or, rather, steals) the first four notes of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto for the main theme. The Sixth shows a very strong resemblance to the Symphony No. 2 of Brahms, particularly the outer movements.</i>"</p>
<p>All of that seems very POV-ish to me-- anyone see it the same way I do? I added emphasis to the part I thought demonstrated the most point of view, but all of that seems to have tones of opinion in it. Also, that seems slightly below the writing quality of other articles, especially in the last paragraph. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthwest_6ad3.html" title="User:Southwest">Southwest</a> 10/7/2005</p>

<dd>It's the common view. Lots of people think that Dvořák's First isn't of the standard of Tsjaikovski's First, but the Second surpasses that, and it's true in the case that there is a better structure. On the other hand, the intro of Dvořák's first is very strong, as is the theme of the second movement, though he loses lots of votes on the fugue. The second symphony might be better structured, but I think the fourth part is the only interesting part. It's so self-identifying, that I even think you could almost see it as a symphonic poem. But .... who am I ... Basboy</dd>

<p>I'm quite unhappy with the one but last sentence in the biography&#160;: "At the end of his life Dvořák was in serious financial straits, as he had sold his many compositions for so little he had hardly anything to live on"</p>
<p>In New York he ended his fight with Simrock, and sold quite some music. Indeed his prices weren't very high, and would have been lower if that had been up to him. Luckily his wife took care of most of this business. Still I wonder if that was a main income. Most income he would have had from all the concerts worldwide presenting his works ..... And he was also director of the Prague Conservatory. During these last years, he wrote the musical poems that were performed at lots of concerts. Even more important, he wrote his most famous operas which were hits in Tsjechia: Kate and the Devil and Rusalka, that even went abroad. So I have no idea where this line comes from ... Basboy</p>

<dd>I have found no source calling these three Bohemian and one Moravian composers 'The great Four'. moreover this is an article on Dvorak and not a picture gallery.

<p>Hello, I've just tweaked the final sentence of the introductory paragraph, changing "combined folk melodies with symphonic and chamber music" to "combined melodies of a folk idiom with...". The implication of "folk melodies" seemed to be that he borrowed existing folk melodies, as Bartok for example sometimes did, whereas in truth it was just the style and spirit of this folk music which he adopted in his writing.

<p>a little trivia i found out doing a research project on him was that the fourth movement in his ninth symphony (allegro con fuoco) means "fast with fire." i put that in the trivia section because wikipedia does not offer a translation of "Fuoco," and i thought if anybody wanted to know i should put it in. But after I put it there it was deleted. i dont know why, so could someone tell me please?? Conman090 19:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are probably dozens of movements in the symphonic repertoire with this direction. I don't see why this particular article should offer a translation, or why you have chosen to translate the tempo marking of this particular movement above all others; Dvorak did, after all, write at least nine symphonies. An autobiography of a Czech composer is not the place in which to give English translations of Italian musical directions.
