<p>There was a section under "antisemitism in islamic texts" and was about teh treatment of non-muslism within muslim states which had nothing to do with antisemitism, so i removed it.</p>
<dl>
<dd><s>Please sign your comments). I confess I agree. I have always seen in the internet obviously anti-semitic trash collecting so called Talmudic phrases (either out of context of made of plain cloth) showing prejudice of the Jews against Goys. It is easy to ignore history and put together a number of anachronica aphorisms and then call it antisemitic or islamophobic or anticristian. See the whole debate on what the Pope said, some months ago. At the very least, I would like to see some authoritative reference for that part. It wouldn't hurt if it were written by a scholar on Islamism, who could actually put the phrases from the Koran within their context.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 23:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>
<dd>Correction. Reading better the part that had been deleted (and now reinstated)--I agree even more with the anonymous user. These are rules for non-muslims--it is NOT anti-semitism. Christians, animists, whoever, were also subjected to the same rules. Many Christian countries had rules for non-Christians. Definitions of "us" and "them" exist accross time and culture--and not all may be ascribed to anti-semitism. Even the biblical Kingdom of Israel and Judah had restrictions for non-Jews. If not deleted, that paragraph needs at least a better introduction to distinguish between treatment of "others" and anti-semitism.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 02:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More or less. First, it is not discrimination against Jews <i>in particular</i> (which would be anti-semitism), and definitively not because they are "dangerous" or "inferior". Second, I can make an argument that most countries in the world have a conditions and rights that apply differently to citizens and not citizens. Citizenship is a modern concept, but in pre-modern times (which is the part of the edit), being Muslin in Islamic countries would be the criteria for this sort of citizenship. But the strongest argument is really the following: it may be discrimination against non-Muslims, but it is not discrimination agains Jews, therefore, it is not anti-semitism.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 08:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If I understand your logic correctly, you are saying that if Jews were persecuted along with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a> and gays (an example), then one cancels another and such persecution doesn't count as antisemitism.

<dd>Antisemitism, <b>as explained in the article (have you read it???)</b> is prejudice towards Jews BECAUSE they are Jews. If I went and bombed a bank in the United States, and 10 Jews died, along with a few non-Jews, that would NOT be antisemitism, because I didn't target the Jews because they were Jewish. The same logic applies here. The Muslims had rules for non-Muslims. They didn't care if you were Jew, Hindu, Christian, Zoroastrian, whatever. If you were non-Muslim, then you had less rights. It had nothing to do with being Jewish, except for the fact that Jewish = non-Muslim. --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime"><font color="red">Ķĩřβȳ</font></a><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam"><font color="green">♥</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirbytime_d8cd.html" title="User talk:Kirbytime"><font color="pink">Ťįɱé</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirbytime_b7f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirbytime"><font color="blue">Ø</font></a> 11:05, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Humus, just to confirm Kirby's point. If the Nazis had persecuted ALL non-Aryans (however they defined it) in the same way, we would have identified general prejudice, xenophobia, but NOT anti-semitism. But there was specific persecution of the Jews BECAUSE they were Jews. It was not "cancelled" because there were ALSO specific persecution of the Roma BECAUSE they were Roma. In the case of this paragraph, the laws seem to apply to Jews, Christians, animists, budists, whoever. And to none of them if they convert to Islam. Anyway, I moved one paragraph to the bottom of the section and I believe the problem was partially solved. Now a discussion on the treatment of dhimmis is followed by the debate on how Jews received the worse treatment as dhimmis--therefore, it is prejudice specifically against Jews. I STILL think the section has some bias, and too much weight is given to authors who support the thesis of antisemitism in "pre-modern" Islam, and I am not sure those are the ones with the best evidence or better reputation among other historians. (And I can recall more than a couple of situations in which Jews had more priviledges than Christians in the Islam). But then this is a can of worms I am not ready to touch.

<p>I think the confusion here arises because editors are assuming they are to interpret the content of the Qur'an. That can't be done in this article. It must be written up from recent scholarship interpreting what the Qur'an says. There is thus no point at all in falling out over whethe the Qur'an has bias against Muslims or not. All that needs to be done is to identify the important secondary sources that discuss the question, read them, and summarise fairly what they say. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 18:54, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Proabivouac, I have not studied this issue in details, so I might get back to you sometime later. But I know that there were no racial motivation. In fact, Muhammad was willing to accept Jews as believers(while keeping their own religion) on the basis of monotheism. It was odd to him that the Jews prefer polytheists over monotheists. I am in any case sure that none of these happened because Muhammad was a Jew-hater or antisemitic whatsoever. Similarly, I don't think the Qur'an is an antisemitic text as this article tries to implicitly say. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 10:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nina, I completely agree. I think that, without a doubt, Jews were persecuted. But the persecution was not antisemitism, because it wasn't done to them because of hatred for Jews. It was done to them, along with Hindus, Christians, etc. because they weren't Muslim. Just because Jews are persecuted does not make it antisemitic. They have to be <b>singled out and targeted</b> in order for the persecution to be antisemitic. But there is NO evidence, nada, that Jews were treated that much differently than all the other <i>nâmosalmân</i> (non-Muslims) that were living under the Caliphate at the time.

<dd>Your problem is with semantics rather than content. You're trying to redefine the definition of antisemitism so that at least some hostility to and persecution of Jews does not count as antisemitism. There is <i>one</i> scholar who agrees with you, but the majority opinion is that persecution of Jews is still antisemitism, even if people of other religions suffer together with Jews. Your position is furthermore inconsistent. In the Christian world, the position of those who did belong to the dominant faith did not differ much from that in the Muslim world. They were also discriminated and persecuted, for example, Catholics persecuted Protestants and Orthodox Christians no less than Jews. Jews were accused of <a href="../../../h/o/s/Host_desecration.html" title="Host desecration">desecrating the host</a>, but so were others, for example, dissenting priests.

<dd>Beit Or, please read the opening sentence of this article "Antisemitism (alternatively spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is hostility toward or prejudice against Jews as a religious, racial, or ethnic group". Discriminating against all non-Muslims =/= "hostility or prejudice against Jews as a religious, racial, or ethnic group". Antisemitism is <b>more</b> than just persecution of Jews. It has to do with the persecution of Jews to specifically target and destroy both their culture and way of life. The holocaust, for instance, can be correctly described as antisemitism, EVEN THOUGH gypsies, blacks, homosexuals were targeted. Jews were deliberately targeted because of their Jewishness. <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Ewige_Jude_3462.html" title="Der Ewige Jude">Der Ewige Jude</a></i> is antisemitism. There was nothing the Jews could do to appease the nazis. But the Muslims just wanted the Jews to convert to Islam, along with Christians, Hindus, etc. They did not actively publish propaganda, they didn't send them to death camps, etc. Jews that converted to Islam were left alone (for the most part). And that last point is the precise reason why the description of "antisemitism" is not applicable. Persecution? Yes. Injustice? Yes. Disgraceful? Yes. Antisemitism? No.</dd>

<p>Beit Or, I will try to explain again. I don't doubt that you can find instances in the Islam where Jews were persecuted for being Jews. Targeted as Jews. With particular portrait of Jews as lazy, or greedy, or whatever. In these cases, we can call it antisemitism. But general exclusions of non-Muslims are NOT antisemitism. In the Christian world, there were several limitations for non-Christians. These were not antisemitic. There were specific limitations and persecution of Jews--<b>these</b> were antisemitic. One case (general exclusion) does not prevent the other (particular exclusion), but they are NOT the same thing. You may keep guessing my excuse motives to "single out Islam as an object of apologetics" (???) Or you may try to consider that maybe, just maybe, it is a good faith disagreement. Regarding scholarly sources, a brief search to <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> took me to Ben halpern, "What Is Antisemitism?" Modern Judaism, Vol. 1, No. 3. (Dec., 1981), pp. 251-262. <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0276-1114%28198112%291%3A3%3C251%3AWIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0276-1114%28198112%291%3A3%3C251%3AWIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> He wrote quite explicitly: "to note that antisemitism is "essencially" related to "the Jews" as its object suggest much more than a simple tautology, or its logically corolary, that antisemitism is a form of group prejudice." For Halpern, antisemitism is not only persecution of Jews, but the perception of "THE JEWS" as this collective being, different from others. Therefore, the name does not apply to general prejudices or persecutions, but to prejudices and persecutions that assume "THE JEWS" as a group with certain characteristics. It is not simply semantics. It is the concept itself that can be completely watered down if it applicable to anything in which Jews are ALSO involved, but without distinction from other groups.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 10:02, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ninarosa, bringing some scholarly sources is a good idea, but Halpern's definition of antisemitism does not in any way support your argument; if anything, it refutes your position. Muslim antisemitism rests on a strong theological basis. The Qur'an portrays Jews as perverters of scripture, killers of prophets, people who incurred the wrath of God and so on and so forth; you can read the article for more of that. This image fits nicely in Halpern's definition of antisemitism. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 10:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, this article is POV. Aside from that, we should not decide whether something is antisemitism or not. That would be original research. We need to find a secondary source which connects particular ideas to antisemitism. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 10:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Arminz, which article is POV? Beit Or, perfect: if you want to say that the Qu'ran's portrays of Jews are antisemitic, on base of these images, or that the Qu'ran has been used for antisemitic persecution, also on base of the description of what "the Jews" (not the dhimmis) are, be my guest. The discussion then would be on other basis. But you CANNOT say that sharia restrictions to *non-Muslims* are antisemitics because simple does not fly.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 15:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ninarosa, I don't see any consitency in your approach. For example, <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_badge.html" title="Yellow badge">yellow badge</a> and other vestimentary regulations imposed on Jews in Europe are universally considered to be examples of antisemitism. The yellow badge, however, originated in the Muslim world. I am at a loss why one and the same thing should be considered antisemitic in Europe, but not antisemitic in the Muslim world. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 21:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is POV because it tries to say that the Qur'anic image of Jews is uniform. It is infact far from uniform. Jews are both accepted as believers and rejected as unbelievers.

<dd>I see, Beit Or description of Qur'anic image of Islam is POV. Well, if this is the case, I see no reason not to include a paragraph in the part for Islamic text, for instance, saying exactly that. Like, for instance, "Some scholars hesitate to identify anti-semitism in the Qur'an since there are contradictory images of Jews in the book. Scholar X, for instance, remind us that side by side with the depiction of Jews as killers of prophets, they are also nice, tree-huggers and love to smell the flowers" with the references to the special passages. It is important however that you don't look at the passages of the Qur'am by yourself: this would be primary research. You must find a scholar who supports this view. It will be harder to make the case, however, that the negative images of "the Jews" in the Qu'ram were not used as basis for anti-semitic persecution.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 20:46, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whether the Qur'an is antisemitic or not is the subject on which the article reserves its judgment. Your continuing claims that the article says the Qur'an is antisemitic have no basis in the text. However, no matter how you view the attitude of the Qur'an towards Jews, it is impossible to understand Muslim antisemitism without the image of Jews in the Qur'an.

If the Encyclopedia of the Qur'an is another point of view, I should be there as well, but it does not mean that the vision of the Qur'am having antisemitic images should be deleted. But, hey, it is my opinion, and you all have been fighting about it much before I have even shown up for this page. At this point, I just want a) that dhimmi restrictions are not presented as antisemitic, which DOES NOT EXCLUDE presence of antisemitism (as it has been defined by the article) in pre-modern Islam; and b) that someone fix this section in a way it flows with more coherence and better transitions.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 21:23, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Because there were specific restrictions on Jews, not only on non-Christians. But it is not the role of wiki editors to give their opinion on what was or was not antisemitism.

<dd><b>Nowhere</b> in that study is there a claim to the effect that 11% of Danes are anti-Semitic .. and for any reader to come anywhere close to drawing that conclusion, they would have to make the remarkably flawed assumption that anyone who happened to think that modern “<i>Zionism is comparable to Nazism</i>”, is an anti-Semite (a claim that the Simon Wiesenthal Center would no doubt be proud of, but that is hardly a glowing reference, is it? .. especially given the number of prominent Jews who themselves make that very claim and assert that political Zionism is racist).<br />
In fact, the report highlights what it considers to be a far greater cause for concern: widespread Islamophobia (according to the definition of Islamophobia that has been laid down by the Runnymede Trust).<br />
Assuming good faith, I can only deduce that the claim results from a rather ham-fisted attempt to translate the report title: ELEVERNE SKAL LÆRE AT SKELNE, which means “'<i><b>Pupils must learn to differentiate'</b></i>” (not <b>Anti-Semitism in Denmark</b>, as stated above .. and where “<i>elverne</i>” means ‘<i>pupils</i>’, as opposed to “<i>elve</i>”, which means ‘<i>eleven (11)</i>’; and where “<i>skelne</i>”, in this context means, “<i>differentiate</i>” (not “<i>discrimnate</i>”, which would be its meaning in certain other contexts)<a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> 11:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dude, don't be so hysterical. Ninarosa did not claim the report says that 11% of Danes are anti-semitic, only that there is a report on anti-Semitism in Denmark available in Danish. Which is true.

<p>A recent very interesting study, widely syndicated, and to be published shortly in Kyklos, the Review for International Social Sciences, puts the rate of "bigotry" against Jews held by Danish citizens at only 2.5%. The countries with the most prevalence of bigotry against Jews appear to be Spain and Greece. It is notable that among five targets of bigotry studied (racial bigotry, anti-Muslim bigotry, anti-Jewish bigotry, anti-immigrant and anti-homosexual bigotry) anti-Jewish bigotry ranked fourth in prevalence while anti-Muslim bigotry ranked a close second in prevalence behind anti-homosexual attitudes. By the way, the report states that "the lowest proportion of bigoted persons was in Sweden (13 percent), Iceland (18 percent), Canada (22 percent), and Denmark (22 percent).

<dd>I disagree, because the restrictions could be as well called "anti-Christians". Or "Anti-Animists". Or "Anti-Candomblé". But since it is not against Christians per sé, or animists per sé, or candomblé praticioners per sé, it just does not apply to any of these. Keep in mind that I am not saying that because they are general restrictions to non-Muslims (and not anti-semitism), it excludes the existence of real anti-semitism (i.e., the low status of Jews, as Jews, among other dhimis, as suggested by Jane Gerber)--which is exactly the focus of the following paragraph.</dd>
<dd>But by now I have read the whole talk page and it seems to be a recurring theme, so I am not sure we will get to an agreement on this point. Let me try in another way: for style, it makes more sense a general statement (legal treatment of dhimmis), followed by a more particular statement (treatment of Jews within dhimmis), without an unrelated sentence in the middle. I am not even proposing to eliminate that sentence. I have proposed to put it before of after the discussion on Jews as dhimmis--but not in the middle.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 02:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It may be anti-Christians". Or "Anti-Animists". Or "Anti-Candomblé" as well but that doesn't change the fact that it is still anti-semitic. If restrictions to non-msulims are demeaning to Jews it is still anti-semitic, even if it is anti-other religions as well. Being anti- things other than just Jews as well as Jews does not make you exempt from antisemitism.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 02:56, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Being anti- things other than just Jews as well as Jews does not make you exempt from antisemitism." Of course it does not--but not because of those rules. The KKK is not antisemitic because they have delusions that "Aryans" are superior to other groups; they are antisemitic because BESIDE being white supremacists, they also target Jews in particular. And Catholics in particualr. And Blacks in particular. Since they preached the superiority of the "white race", you could also presume they are Islamophobic. But hatred against Islam is not, as far as I know, a particularly important part of the KKK credo, so you won't see "Islamophobia" associated to their description (at least not yet). It is just included in the general racism. Jews, Blacks, Catholics and foreigners however, are singled out in their ideology--and therefore, they can be described as anti-semitic, anti-Catholic, racists and xenophobic.</dd>

<p>It seems that we are at an impasse because I disagree on both counts: because of the argument and because of the style. The original version is not fine. This paragraph...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-Jewish sentiments usually flared up at times of the Muslim political or military weakness or when Muslims felt that some Jews had overstepped the boundary of humiliation prescribed to them by the Islamic law.[49] In Spain, ibn Hazm and Abu Ishaq focused their anti-Jewish writings on the latter allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the massacres of Jews of Granada in 1066, when nearly 3,000 Jews were killed, and in Fez in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed. [50] There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465. [51]</p>

<p>is preceded by one about Dhimmis in general, and followed by another on the status of Jews as Dhimmis. As it is, it just does not belong there.

It has already been discussed multiple times in this talk page, and we will keep going back and forth. So be it. My <b>second</b> objection is regarding style and clarity. This intermediary paragraph stands like a sore eye and the transition between the earlier one (where the restrictions to dhimmi are explained) and the later paragraph (where the status of Jews as dhimmi is discussed) are just unclear. I suggested three possible changes--to put the paragraph at the end of the section, as example of antisemitic events in the Islam; to place it earlier in the text, as a prelude to the discussion on dhimmis; or to edit it by connecting to the earlier paragraph, where the restrictions on the dhimmis are explained, and the perception that Jews disregarded those restrictions in certain situations caused/or was used as an excuse for persecution/massacres against Jews. I am not suggesting to cut or delete anything, just to improve the way the information is presented. If you have another suggestion on how to improve it, please let me know, because the more I read it, the more I am convinced it does not work as it is.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinarosa_b5d2.html" title="User:Ninarosa">Ninarosa</a> 08:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arminz, it MAY be relevant if you explain that, according to some authors, Jews were treated worse than other dhimmis; or that breaking of dhimmi restrictions was cause for actions against Jews but not actions against Christians, for instance.

<dd>At least in Medieval times, according to some scholars, Jews were not treated worse than other dhimmis. <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> writes: <i>"there had been scarcely any difference in the treatment accorded to Christians and Jews (at most they were distinguished by prescribed differences in dress); but it later came about that some categories of d̲h̲immī s were looked on as friends of foreign powers and were worse treated, and naturally some Christians were in this respect more of a target than the Jews.

<dd>If it is so, Aminz, it means that there is disagreement regarding it. The place to add this information is in support of the Bernard Lewis' statement, which is later challenged by other authors. I would use the name of the scholar who wrote the entry, instead of simply <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a>. My fear, however, is that the article will become a name-dropping war: you add an author who supports the inexistence of anti-semitism in pre-modern Islam; Beit Or finds other two authors who say otherwise; you find a third author to support your view, and pretty soon the article is just a ping pong of oppinions. There must be a way to give due weight to both schools of thought.

<dd>Well, true. There are other POVs as well. S. D. Goitein, a preeminent scholar in the areas of Jewish-Arab relations and Islamic culture: "Still “anti-Semitism,” that is, hostility directed against the Jewish community, was not entirely absent from medieval islam, as has been assumed."(<b>Footnote to Encyclopedia of Islam</b> )..."Although the term [antisemitism] is perhaps inapprorpiate in medieval Islamic setting, it is used here to differentiate animosity against Jews from discrimination practiced by Islam against non-Muslims in general. The Genizah material confirms the existence of a discernible form of anti-Judaism in the time and the place considered here, but that form of 'anti-Semitism', <i>if we may use this term, appears to have been local and sporadic rather than general and endemic.</i>" --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:18, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section on Sweden is really poor. While it's terrible for the individual to be verbally attacked it is hardly interesting for an international audience to read about these minor incidents, especially when there have been much worse examples of antisemitism in Sweden. For instance, the attempt to burn down a jewish building in Malmö in 2003 and the existence of Radio Islam etc. Any Swedish speaking people around here that wish to comment on this? 212.105.37.165 09:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a fluent Swedish speaker, I find the idea that the existence 'Radio Islam' somehow equates to anti-Semitism, to be as preposterous and fallacious as claiming that anti-Zionism, opposition the state of Israel, or opposition to the barbaric policies of the government of Israel, somehow equate to anti-Semitism.<br />
Nor in fact does the attempt to burn down a Jewish building in Malmo necessarily equate to an act of anti-Semitism. If it did, then you would have to assume that any crime ever committed against a Jew, or a Jewish institution, is motivated by anti-Semitism .. and conversely, that any crime ever committed by a Jew, against a non-Jew or non-Jewish institution, is motivated by racial prejudice against non-Jews. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> 10:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

At first these prejudices only found a reception among Arabic-speaking Christian protégés of the Europeans in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt and <i>were too new and too palpably foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims.</i> However, with <i>the ever-increasing conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine</i> during the period of the British Mandate, the language and imagery of European anti-Semitism began to appear in political polemics both in the nationalist press and in books."</dd>

<p>The dispute is over inclusion of Cohen's quote attributed to him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=111431822&amp;oldid=111340229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=111431822&amp;oldid=111340229" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. It was removed based on the arguments that "This is simply Cohen's belief that the majority of scholars support his view". Those users who want to include this argue that 1. the quote is explaining the view of majority of scholars on antisemitism in Muslim lands 2. the whole section on Islam is arranged and written with the aim of supporting the view of a minority of writers who believe Antisemitism has roots in the Qur'an and has been there from the beginning. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 04:37, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. The view of the majority of scholars that Cohen is writing about for example matches with what <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a>, a prestigous academic source on Islam, that writes:"Increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities within the Muslim world during the 19th and 20th centuries introduced anti-Semitic ideas and literature into the region. At first these prejudices only found a reception among Arabic-speaking Christian protégés of the Europeans in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt and were too new and too palpably foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims. However, with the ever-increasing conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine during the period of the British Mandate, the language and imagery of European anti-Semitism began to appear in political polemics both in the nationalist press and in books."--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 04:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well as its a quoted source it seems difficult to remove it. If there is an alternative point of view, it should also be sourced and presented as an alternative. Maybe a compromise would be to have an expanded section including more of this point of view(!) but as a seperate subheading. The view currently comes before all the other sections, elevating this point of view above all others and discrediting the (also sourced) material below. Also it could be included in the criticism worked into the other sections. I suspect the problem is not just it's inclusion, but the way in which it is included. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.138.46.155_f079.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.138.46.155">137.138.46.155</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.138.46.155.html" title="User talk:137.138.46.155">talk</a>) 09:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I agree that something along the lines of "Some writers have perceived antisemitism to be inherent in the religion itself, even in the Qu'ran and that there have also been elements of anti-semitism in Islamic history; and among Muslims in the modern world." should be added if we can source it (which I think it should be possible). I guess Bat Ye'or should have probably said something to that effect but that group is a minority (as the above quote indicates). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

[In Sijilmasa] One hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith. ... One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh. The Jews in all [Maghreb] localities [conquered] ... groaned under the heavy yoke of the Almohads; many had been killed, many others converted; none were able to appear in public as Jews."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>I am not a regular editor here, and not well-aquainted with the literature. It looks like the two views are that antisemitism is 1) built into Islam; and 2) a modern artefact.</p>
<p>The section <i>Antisemitism and the Muslim world</i> says the main article is <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_antisemitism.html" title="Islam and antisemitism">Islam and antisemitism</a>, and to see also <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_and_antisemitism.html" title="Arabs and antisemitism">Arabs and antisemitism</a>. Cohen's view is presented near the top in both of those. If this section is to summarize those more detailed pages, then it seems to me that Cohen's view should be similarly presented here. That said, the section is already quite long. Repetition should be avoided, summary style is good, etc. Might we put at the beginning of the section two succinct paragraphs summarizing the two views, and then go on to the chronological account? To keep the length down, we might shorten the paragraph of citations to the Qur'an, shorten the paragraph on dhimmis, and condense all the 'Cohen says/Goitein argues' into the first two paragraphs, moving the rest of it to <i>Islam and antisemitism</i> and/or <i>Arabs and antisemitism</i>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with including it at all. We should be consistent with the "Christianity" section.

<dd>I don't know exactly though I have some ideas. I searched and found Jewish Encyclopedia saying: <i>"The term "Anti-Semitism" has its origin in the ethnological theory that the Jews, as Semites, are entirely different from the Aryan, or Indo-European, populations and can never be amalgamated with them. The word implies that the Jews are not opposed on account of their religion, but on account of their racial characteristics. As such are mentioned: greed, a special aptitude for money-making, aversion to hard work, clannishness and obtrusiveness, lack of social tact, and especially of patriotism. Finally, the term is used to justify resentment for every crime or objectionable act committed by any individual Jew."</i> --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Aminz comments speak to the heart of the matter, the relationship between Muslims and Jews of different creeds pre-Israel is also crucial to the antisemitism terminology. To be honest i think the term is oversubscribed and sometimes is confused and replaced with anti Judaism because as we all know not all Jews are Semitic ( I don't want to go into numbers) and the use of the (antisemitic) label against Muslims (which most are not Semitic) is sometimes out of context. This fixation on racial purity is a sad relic from centuries of European oppression of the Jews. It is common knowledge that Jews in the Arab World are still regarded as Arabs. I acknowledge that while there was discrimination at times on the whole the treatment of Jews in Muslims lands were exceptional for those times. It has to be said that the STATE OF ISRAEL and Zionism confused the lines greatly when it came to Judaism and Ethnicity. --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestine48_bab9.html" title="User:Palestine48">Palestine48</a> 06:27, 04 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This article seems to be long, also it seems to me to have some overly long sections duplicating content in other articles. It would be much punchier and better with a work through. Personally, I also think that an attempt to prove a point about something as exegetically complex as the New Testament by citing isolated verses isn't very clever (try reading them as you read the article: as isolated verses they are incredibly hard to follow, and it uses the New Testament like a cruddy tele-evangelist): it would be much more convincing to quote a couple of top tier Biblical scholars on the issue, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>On this other discussion, I think it is too much to ask for there to be a consistent definition of anti-S across the vast range of people who use the term so trying to tie down the article content based on definition is very difficult. Again, acknowledging the variation has to be a good start. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

If you want it to be about correctness change it to "should be used exclusively..." . If the usage exists, even incorrectly, then it is straight dishonest to deny the usage exists. The sentence with "almost" in reflects the comments later in the article that some people use the term to mean anti-Arab.

<p>I know that the dictionary tends to define "Antisemitism" as being "Anti-Jewish" but in a real life example, I think this is an error. Some years ago when I was on the student council of my university, a group of Palestinians came to the council in order to get funding for an event that they wanted to put on. Being the hardcore pro-Israel guy that I am and knowing full well that these people would in almost complete likelyhood going to use the event to spew anti-Jewish venom, I stated that the council should not fund any event that was antisemitic.</p>
<p>Well, it was at that point that the leader of the Palestinian group started screaming that they were not antisemitic because as Arabs, they are Semites themselves. Of course, this is true so I had to re-state and make the argument that the council should not support "anti-Jewish" events.</p>
<p>Sadly, since the student council was overwhelmingly left-wing, I was out-vote and the funding for the Palestinians went through.</p>
<p>But most importantly, I don't understand why the dictionary and people in general use the word "antisemitic" in relation to Jewish people even though it would appropriately be referring to Arabs as well. It's like saying that someone is anti-European and thinking that means it only refers to Albanians. Jewish people are a small part of the Semitic world yet this phrase is thought of as only applying to Jews. I think that trying to take the lead and correct this syntactical error would be a worthy undertaking for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 21:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Humus, yes, I'm well aware of the Original Research rules and I wasn't suggesting that I take the lead and try and change the meaning as it is used in the dictionary. Only that something be stated regarding the misuse of the word in that both Jewish people and Arabs are Semitic and the word "anti-semitic" is really not really the best word to be used when describing "anti-Jewish" actions. I noticed that the article touches on that but it would helpful if some Arabic sources are included to explain their perspective on why they feel the word should be used to describe all antisemitic actions as including other Semities as well.</dd>

<dd>My previous experience with that Palestinian group underlines a need to better explain their perspective.

<dd>The dictionary is right. While semites are arabs, antisemitism is not against all semites as a whole (see above link).

I am trying very patiently to explain why I think you need to think a little more about the words you use.

<dd>Hmm. I think on this I am somewhere in the middle on this. I don't think the lack of this in a dictionary is relevant; Wikipedia is not a dictionary and examples of wilful misuse cited in dictionaries are very rare. At the same time this long passage on misuse is out of proportion in my view with the topic: it undermines the importance of antisemitism (to be fair, as does every instance of misuse). I think that the section on modern antisemitism should acknowledge (in the light of a reasonal set of notable sources) that there is no perfect definition and that some parties are accused of using allegations of AS as a cynical political ploy. Please bear in mind I am not pretending to know anything about anti-semitism: just about what is reasonable in WP. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 08:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

AFAIK Harvard research papers never reflect anything other than the views of its authors. It may be that they were more than usually embarrassed about it but that doesn't mean it wasn't from Havard. Regardless of this accusation, you have been successful in convincing me that notability is a question rather than a foregone conclusion.

<dd>Okay, but the tone is still rather personal and I haven't seen the "not a description of someone who hates Jews" bit.... besides it clearly IS a political epithet in some contexts, e.g. used as an attack by the non-Jewish Evening Standard on Ken Livingstone who "hasn't got an antisemitic bone in his body" according to most British Jews. I was wondering whether the content he/she proposes was already in the intro to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">New antisemitism</a> article; perhaps with these other references added. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 17:11, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Livingstone, the guy who told a Jew that he was like a concentration camp guard? In any event, people accused of antisemitism inevitably insist that they are not antisemites, but merely aren't liked by Jews. The latest scam is to pretend that they are actually just "anti-Zionist", "Zionist" being the latest code word for Jew. It's pretty much the same across the board; whether it's right-wing antisemites, left-wing antisemites, or Islamist antisemites, they all claim that they couldn't possibly be antisemites, they're just being maligned for their political views. It turns out there aren't any antisemites in the world at all, just internal political refugees being unjustly persecuted by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">the jooooz</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Livingstone didn't know that the journalist was of (loosely) Jewish origin and a huge right wing hate machine tried to turn it into an antisemitic attack. Livingstone's credentials on race are second to none. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 17:36, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Liftarn, please don't keep adding this. All words and phrases can be misused. Anyone who claims that someone is antisemitic only because they criticize Israeli government policy is misusing the term; that this misuse is allegedly common is a propagandistic strawman argument spread by antisemites, and by very virulent critics of the right of Israel to exist (as opposed to critics of the particular policies of a particular government), who want to deflect the suspicion that they may be antisemites by reducing the word to a misused political epithet. By trying to add this to the article, you're aiding and abetting that effort, which I'm sure you wouldn't want to do.</dd>

<dd>FWIW I agree it shouldn't go in this article, and with your first paragraph SV. On "all men are rapists" that's not just some early feminists, I have heard that claim advanced far more often and more seriously than antisemitism (although I've been really shocked by finding an AS website today, I didn't really believe these things existed). Jayjig, you are more in danger of deciding everyone is an antisemite than Liftarn is of saying no one is. And to add a final remark about Zionism every Jewish friend I have ever had (and I have plenty, I went to the only UK school with its own synagogue at the time.... but I agree they probably aren't representative) told/tells me they condemn Israeli policy in Palestine. Are they all antisemites too? --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 17:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is a familiar strawman. Many Jews feel that political criticism of Israel is antisemitically motivated. In that sense it is not an epithet but a very real accusation. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 18:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no doubt in my mind that many people abuse the term anti-Semite in very much the way that Liftarn is alleging (there was even a Seinfeld episode poking fun at this phenomenon). That said, the term anti-Semite is hardly unique in that regard. I'm somewhat ambivalent about including that use of the term in the article -- however, I feel very strongly against adding a category tag reflecting that usage. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 18:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. here's a <a href="http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheShowerhead.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheShowerhead.htm" rel="nofollow">transcript of the Seinfeld episode</a> I was referring to. Search for "anti-Semite." Very funny stuff, actually... Perhaps a compromise would be to work a mention of something like this into the article? I can see how mentioning that "anti-Semite has been used as an epithet against those who oppose Israeli foreign policy" could be a very divisive assertion -- but a Jewish comedian acknowledging that his people's paranoia regarding anti-Semitism sometimes gets out of hand, that seems much less divisive to me... Of course, just coming right out and saying it would be pretty unencyclopedic, heh... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 18:34, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another idea: The intro paragraph to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">Racist</a> includes the text "The term racist has been a pejorative term since at least the 1940s, and the identification of a group or person as racist is often controversial." Perhaps some similar text would be appropriate here as a compromise?

<dd>I think the problem is largely that the word "Pejorative" simply has a strong potential for sounding POV. Usually, calling something "pejorative" is to dismiss it as rhetoric, like you would say "<a href="../../../l/i/m/Limousine_liberal.html" title="Limousine liberal">limousine liberal</a>" is a pejorative, or "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_tax.html" title="Death tax">death tax</a>." Even with a different word, though, isn't it better to discuss these debates in the contexts where they actually arise? That seems more sensible to me. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 19:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some has argued that the charge of antisemitism is being misused as a way to silence critisism of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;“Partisans of Israel often make false accusations of anti-Semitism to silence Israel’s critics. The ‘antisemite!’ libel is harmful not only because it censors debate about Israel’s racism and human rights abuses but because it trivializes the ugly history of Jew-hatred.” (Handleman, Scott, "Trivializing Jew-Hatred," in ''The Politics of Anti-Semitism'', ed. [[Alexander Cockburn]]. AK Press, 2003, p. 13.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Apologists for Israel’s repression of Palestinians toss the word “anti-Semite” at any critic of what Zionism has meant in practice for Palestinians on the receiving end.” ([[Alexander Cockburn|Cockburn, Alexander]] and St. Clair, Jeffrey, preface to ''The Politics of Anti-Semitism'', ed. Alexander Cockburn. AK Press, 2003, p.vii.) &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"More importantly, Finkelstein exposes the nastiness of smearing the label of anti-Semitism on Israel's critics. Mostly, he tells us what we already know." (Paul, Ari. [http://www.tikkun.org/magazine/reviews/article.2005-10-11.0538333315 "Norman Finkelstein's ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Antisemitism and the Abuse of History''"]. ''Tikkun'', October 11, 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Instead of seriously engaging with the issues raised (e.g. to what extent are Israel's current policies similar to those of apartehid and to what extent are they not?), the Jewish establishment and media responds by attacking the people who raise these or any other critiques--shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms. Knowing this, many people become fearful that they too will be labeled "anti-Semitic" if they question the wisdom of Israeli policies or if they seek to organize politically to challenge those policies." ([[Rabbi Michael Lerner]]. [http://baltimorechronicle.com/2007/020207LERNER.shtml "There's no New Anti-Semitism"]. [[Baltimore Sun]], February 7, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The lack of debate is, of course, a measure of the power of the Israel lobby to suppress discussion of its role, and the fear the lobby stirs among American writers, especially non-Jewish liberals who cannot afford to be tarred as anti-Semites, a death sentence in the profession." ([[Adam Shatz|Shatz, Adam]]. [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/adam_shatz/2006/03/post_9.html "Dialogue of the Deaf"]. ''The Guardian'', March 24, 2006.)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"'I’ve been hurt — and so has my family — by some of the reaction,' Carter said. 'It’s the first time in my life I’ve ever been called a liar. A bigot. An anti-Semite. A coward. A plagiarist. He paused after each epithet. 'This has hurt,' he said." (Cohler-Esses, Larry. [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=13589 "Carter Faces, and Disarms, Jewish Crowd"]. The Jewish Week, January 26 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Silencer: No discussion of how the Lobby operates would be complete without examining one of its most important weapons: the charge of anti-Semitism. Anyone who criticizes Israeli actions or says that pro-Israel groups have significant influence over U.S. Middle East policy – an influence that AIPAC celebrates – stands a good chance of getting labeled an anti-Semite.” ([[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John]] and [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]]. [http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/Research/wpaper.nsf/rwp/RWP06-011 "The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy"]. KSG Faculty Research Working Paper Series, Harvard University, March 2006.)&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Jimmy Carter]] published his book ''[[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]]'' he was labelled an antisemite.&lt;ref&gt;“The charge has been leveled at Jimmy Carter over his recent book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid." I, too, didn't like the book...Still, Carter's overall point about Israeli occupation of the West Bank is apt, and calling him all sorts of names does not change that...It's astonishing that in the 60 years since the Nazi extermination camps were liberated, anti-Semitism has revived and thrived. Still, it hardly makes sense to fight it by promiscuously throwing around the word "anti-Semite" so that it loses its punch or to flay Jewish critics of Israel." ([[Richard Cohen|Cohen, Richard]].

<p>Reset indent. It's not a "point of view" that some people claim accusations of antisemitism are used to silence debate. There is no question that some people make that claim. What is controversial is whether the claim has any merit in terms of the effects or the motivation. The issue is how in the world it's relevant to an article about antisemitism.

I am not sure how to structure such an article, though. Rhetoric may, after all, be based on true or untrue assumptions (and usually it rests on assertions that can't be proven or disproven).

<dd>Not a bad idea, but that is a much broader subject and there is also the risk it goes the same way as the list of political epithets article with unsourced additions and blanking of terms editors disagree with.

<dd>Well, it is okay to mention major pogroms, but as "pogroms" not "anti-Semitic" incidents, unless majority of scholars hold that they are "anti-Semitic" incidents. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 20:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, give me a break. If antisemitism is defined, inter alia, as hostile acts toward Jews, and pogroms against Jews take place, it's not original research to label such a pogrom as antisemitic. Personally, I'm ok if we call it "systematic murder and pillage of Jews," but we have this umbrella term for this kind of thing. I also think the argument that discrimination against Christians and Jews is somehow different from antisemitism is novel and intellectually interesting, but I think we can easily find scholars who would characterize it as antisemitic. When crusaders butchered Moslems and Jews and some Christians if they got in the way, there is no question that this was motivated by antisemitism as well as anti-Islamic hatred and some sociopathic tendencies thrown in; but I have no problems citing all of them. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 22:17, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jonathan Tweet, nobody here has ever meant to cover persecution of Jews; we even have a separate article called <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_d2ab.html" title="Historical persecution by Muslims">Historical persecution by Muslims</a>. The point is that as most scholars understand it, antisemitism wasn't there in classical Islam because Jews and Christians were treated in the same way, not that there was no persecution. Further, the conspiracy theories against Jews or attribution of cosmic evil to Jews arose pretty recent in Muslim world. Muslims were looking at Jews and Christians with contempt but not with hate. For all these reasons, most scholars think antisemitism arose recently among Muslims(please see the cohen quote showing the view of majority of scholars). As usual, HS as usual is probably going to say to me (See <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial.html" title="Denial">denial</a>). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 10:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that Lewis and Cohen talk about <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_antisemitism.html" title="Racial antisemitism">racial antisemitism</a> of the 19th-20th century. In fact, there is no such requirement in the definition: prejudice, hatred and/or hostillites towards Jews constitute Jew-hatred, for which the most common term is <i>antisemitism</i>. It is not a special "technical term" as you were trying to imply on this talk page.</dd>

<dd>H.S. there is one difference between you and me. All your arguments are like "See this, and conclude that". On the other hand, I provide secondary sources for the conclusion rather than doing original research in making such conclusion. My problem is that you don't even buy the views of Zionist scholars such as Lewis. Lewis says there is little sign of any deep-rooted emotional hostility directed against Jews, or any other group, such as the antisemitism of the Christian world. He says there were clearly negative attitudes, which were in part the "normal" feelings of a dominant group towards subject groups (which exists in virtually any society). In part, more specifically, the contempt of the Muslim for non-believers who willfully choose to remain in their disbelief, while they had the opportunity to accept the truth; in part, certain specific prejudices directed against one or another group and not against the rest.</dd>

<p>The relationships between the Jews and the Arabs throughout history have been the subject of numerous studies over many centuries. However, as long as the continuous Arab-Israeli conflict has not found a solution, historians will search through the past in order to find new evidence to prove the antiquity of the tension between the two communities and to illuminate its causes. The vicissitudes which have marked the lives of the Jews who lived under Arab rule or side-by-side with Muslims add to the complexity of the issue, and a great many of the assertions about Arab-Jewish relations made by scholars and amateurs alike are sheer speculation. This is particularly true of writers who strongly identify with either camp and have become emotionally involved in the subject. Consequently, the views they usually hold are often unbalanced, if not biased.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The present work, which comprises fifteen articles written in Hebrew by some eminent Orientalists, covers a kaleidoscope of topics and views whose common denominator is to portray the Muslims' reactions to Jews from the advent of Islam to the present time. However, after reading this interesting collection one can reach another surprising conclusion: in spite of the fact that most of the contributors are Jewish or Israeli Orientalists they have nevertheless provided us with well-balanced and usually well-argued accounts. This is no doubt due to the efforts and experience of the editor, Professor Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, one of the leading Israeli Orientalists, who has recently died.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>In her introduction to the book the editor emphasizes two major points: (1) the conflict between the two communities has never been immanent and (2) in spite of the existence of discriminatory laws against Jews and Christians, such as 'the Pact of 'Umar', the prohibition against learning Arabic and reading the Qur'an, or laws compelling Jews to dress in distinguishing clothes, they have rarely been applied. Hence, the status of the Jews as ahl al-dhimmah normally enabled them to lead safe and peaceful lives under Islam, only occasionally disrupted during the times of certain rulers or their vizirs, or when conditions in general began to deteriorate within the Muslim empire.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>In his important contribution entitled 'Islam and the Jews: Myth, Counter-Myth, History', Mark R. Cohen stresses the polarity of views among scholars in respect of the attitude of the Muslims towards the Jews. The author rejects the myth about inter-religious Utopia and the counter-myth which highlights the Jewish tragedy across history (named by S. Baron the 'lachrymose conception'). To prove this thesis about the coexistence between Jews and Arabs — as he prefers to see it — he analyses very skilfully some of the available sources and draws comparisons with Europe's often negative, if not disastrous, attitude towards the Jews.</p>

<dd>Would it have killed you to have said that in the edit? Before I get people too confused, let me say that I support Israel's right to exist. What I find interesting, however, is the issue of whether questioning that right or denying that right is, by itself, antisemitism. Either it is (worthy of mention) or isn't (worthy of mention).
