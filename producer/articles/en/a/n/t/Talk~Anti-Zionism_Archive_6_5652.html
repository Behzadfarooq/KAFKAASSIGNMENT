<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Far right" anti-Zionism</span></h2>
<p>Quote: 'Western far right anti-Zionists see the state of Israel as something Jewish, therefore evil. From late 1990s, most of far-right parties looking for political presence had to abandon anti-Zionism platform to distinguish themselves from far-left and even moderate left parties that took this platform over.'</p>
<p>This sentence is ungrammatical and logically pernicious. It presumes a) The far right is racist, and supposedly used to be anti-Zionist out of hatred of the Jews b) The far right is capricious, and supposedly is now pro-Zionist to spite the left. Does not deserve to be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalian_03c0.html" title="User:Ralian">ralian</a> 06:04, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Equal citizens</span></h2>
<p>A question to the editor who pushes the word "equal" in one-state solution: is this equality guaranteed? The history of dhimmitude, the UN Arab Human evelopment Report and the Covenant of HAMAS are not convincing precedents of equality in the Arab world. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 07:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Biased_Definition" id="Biased_Definition"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biased Definition</span></h2>
<p>Look, that quoted paragraph in the "Definition" section really has to go. It comes from a totally biased source and doesn't merely define, but also casts aspersions upon so called "anti-zionists." By talking about "existence," the cited paragraph taints "anti-zionists" by association with the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should not be using a definition provided by such an unapologetically zionist website, let alone featuring it so prominently.</p>
<p>Example: When discussing anti-free trade advocates, we don't define them by pasting an extract from a pro-free trade website characterizing them as, say, "leftists hostile to economic liberty who would like to see our right of absolute free enterprise cease to exist." Now it is possible that some anti-free traders are indeed opposed to the very existence of free enterprise, but that is a special case. More generally, an opponent of free trade opposes the existence of international free enterprise IN ITS CURRENT FORM.</p>
<p>Can anyone really defend this defintion or its high position in the text? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hazel Rah (<a href="../../../h/a/z/User_talk%7EHazel_Rah_28d1.html" title="User talk:Hazel Rah">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hazel_Rah_0d35.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hazel Rah">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Example: Should Wikipeda define the word "pornography" by copying and pasting the partisan perspectives of a Feminist or Evangelical Christian website?

<dd>All I'm asking is that you at least attempt to defend this definiton of "anti-zionism." Just because it "looks fine to you," doesn't mean it's NPOV. That isn't a valid defence. Do you belive that your point of view subsumes everybody elses? Clearly the definition provided does not look "fine to me." If you to want keep that section, you need to give real reasons.

<dd>For this particular def. we honestly provide the source and say that this is one possible way to define it, without taking sides. You are saying you don't like the <i>source</i>; it seems you simply don't like the <i>text</i>. Let's keep on-topic: what exactly do you object to? Do you have an alternative definition in mind? Without a good explanation your personal preference is not a reason enough to change or remove it. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 02:09, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But your selective choice of an admitedly biassed source does reveal a POV when you ignor the other equally biased "sides" who define/characterize "anti-zionism" in a positive light. I agree that the page looks better after someone apparently rearranged that section so that the quote is featured less prominently. Don't you agree? I think it's just more productive to get rid of this paragraph rather than starting a tit-for-tat war between two "sides." That's just my opinion though.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Peace encyclopedia"</span></h2>
<p>I removed the following from the definitions section for the time being:</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to the <i>Peace Encyclopedia</i>, "Anti-Zionism is the conviction that Israel, of all the world's countries, does not have the right to exist. It is the conviction that the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-determination.html" title="Self-determination">determination</a> of what constitutes Israel's "secure and defensible borders" should not be made by the Israeli people, either directly or via representation." <a href="http://www.yahoodi.com/peace/antizionism.html#whatis" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yahoodi.com/peace/antizionism.html#whatis" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The website this is taken from, yahoodi.com<a href="http://www.yahoodi.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yahoodi.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, has a quite right-wing pro-zionist agenda and is is obviously pretty POV. There's nothing wrong with this in and of itself - but in order to balance it out we would instead end up getting into explaining this bias. Succinctly, there are better ways of "defining" anti-zionism without getting bogged down in explaining POV stuff.</p>

<dd>With all due respect I'll have to disagree. There were complaints earlier that we are defining <i>Zionism</i> here instead of <i>anti-Zionism</i>. Now that we are defining anti-Zionism, one of the definitions gets removed because some deem its source as "right-wing pro-Zionist". Even if this is true, surely it is only fair for "pro-zionists" to have a word in an article on Anti-Zionism. I think Peace Encyclopedia qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a>: it claims to be (no affiliation here) a collective effort by technocrats who have "a doctorate in the sciences, have belonged to a recognized skeptics organization, have submitted a patent application...", etc., and we mention their definition attributed, without embracing their position. As for "better ways of "defining" anti-zionism", removing a definition just because some personally don't like it (or its source) won't work. Let's keep in mind, this is a very polarizing conflict in general. If you see any error in the definition itself, please discuss it. If you find an alternative encyclopedic definition, feel free to add it. Thanks. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 23:18, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My problem is that the title 'peace encyclopedia' is misleading as this website bears a greater likeness to a blog entry, rather than some authoratitive and balanced work.

<dd>Hi Humus &amp; TreveX. I don't want to stir up anything, now that you've reached a compromise. <b>:)</b> I just have a question, as a new Wikipedian: Why even cite a website? I realize that this is in a section about various definitions (of a hot topic, to boot), and that there is another section on dictionary definitions.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">clarification needed: Anti-Zionism in Japan</span></h2>
<p>From main article: Antisemitism in Japan</p>
<p>"Originally Japan, with no Jewish population, had no anti-Semitism but Nazi ideology and propaganda left an influence on Japan during World War II, and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were translated into Japanese."-I can see the validity of that statement, but one must realize that not all books published in Japan are as the result of Nazi ideology.</p>
<p>In the early Imperial Japan, Japanese scholars have studies cultures comparatively by discussing things in binary manner. 1)"Japan vs China" 2)"The West" vs "The East" 3)"polytheism" vs "monotheism"</p>
<p>Just like the way Western anthropologists/sociologists/psychologists are fascinated by the foreign culture of "animism", It is natural for the Japanese scholars to objectify, "what is monotheism". Japan,a polytheistic country which never had history of being a Christian empire/state, is particularly interested in the shift from a polytheistic community to a monotheistic community. In order to theorize this question, they take the example of Mozes initiating monotheism.</p>
<p>Japan, which fought the Russo-Japanese war with a American Jewish sponsors who were against Russia (and as the result Japan won) knows what the economical status of the Jews can affect the political game.</p>
<p><br />
I would like the following points to be clearly: -Japanese culture "others" monotheism. -Japan had its own understanding of "Jewish gold" before the Nazi influence.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
<p>I currently do not have a wiki account, but I am wondering if somebody is willing to reflect some of my perspectives to the main page.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: the <i>Defining anti-Zionism</i> section</span></h2>
<p>The second to last paragraph of the <i>Defining Anti-Zionism</i> section states that: <i>The Society for Rational Peace contends on its website that "Anti-Zionism is the conviction that Israel, of all the world's countries, does not have the right to exist. It is the conviction that the determination of what constitutes Israel's 'secure and defensible borders' should not be made by the Israeli people, either directly or via representation."</i></p>
<p>I believe that this statement should be followed by something like this paragraph (an edited sample from the <i>Western anti-Zionism</i> section further down the page): <i>Most Western anti-Zionism advocates coexistence rather than expulsion: very few western intellectuals actively desire the physical destruction of Israel, and most would welcome any settlement if it was acceptable to the Palestinians.</i></p>
<p>As it now stands, I think that the <i>Defining anti-Zionism</i> section leans too far toward radical anti-Zionism. Any thoughts? --(<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMingus_ah_um_497a.html" title="User:Mingus ah um">Mingus ah um</a> 01:58, 21 April 2006 (UTC))</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">False anti-zionism</span></h2>
<p>This section completely begs the question as written. As written it assumes there is a distinction between anti-zionism and anti-semitism. I'm rephrasing to remove the POV <a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJbolden1517_d5f6.html" title="User:Jbolden1517">Jbolden1517</a> 02:44, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whether or not there is a distinction in fact between the two concepts is open to debate; however, the essence of each is distinct: disagreement with the state of Israel's current existence vs. discrimination against Jews. They <i>may</i> be the same thing, as many will argue, but the underlying concepts from which each is derived are different. Additionally, for it to be "begging the question" it would have to making logical argument based on fact, when an encyclopedic article is merely (in theory) stating fact with minimal accompanying judgement. The article shouldn't be taking sides as to whether anti-zionism and anti-semitism are distince, anyway. Define book as "a set of written pieces of material" is not begging the question. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoodog_7c34.html" title="User:Loodog">Loodog</a> 21:08, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">defintion</span></h2>
<p>The definition of anti-zionism:</p>
<p><i>In addition to a conventional definition of anti-Semitism ("hostility toward Jews as a religious or racial minority group, often accompanied by social, political or economic discrimination"), the unabridged edition of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, originally published in 1961 and reprinted in 2002, gives a controversial second and third definition to anti-Semitism, defining the word as "opposition to Zionism" and "sympathy for the opponents of Israel".</i></p>
<p>I don't mean to start up a whole debate on whether there is a distinction between anti-semitism and anti-zionism, but as an encyclopedia, when concept A is defined, the writing doesn't abruptly jump to defining concept B without providing transition. (e.g. Define electron: the definition of electricity is ...) Without a transition sentence (e.g. "Because little distinction is made between anti-semitism and anti-zionism, it is convenient to instead define anti-semitism" would be such a sentence, not that I agree with it), the defintion part of the article fails to make sense to the reader seeking information.<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoodog_7c34.html" title="User:Loodog">Loodog</a> 21:16, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

The Russian church is and always has been doing quite well - bigger attedance that the US and certainly Europe. Anti-religious, no, they just didn't invite Billy Graham to bless their wars - the politicians blessed them themselves. Liquidated Jewish organizations - this may be recently true not historically. They, Putin, is probably trying to trace their GNP losses. Putin is hot on the trail of recapturing Russia's assets that seemed to have been sold ( stolen? - who had the authority to sell Russian oil wells to the US, etc ) by people who left for NYC and ........let's say elsewhere.

<p>The author wrote that the Kaplan and Small article stated that "Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism flourish among the few, but those few are over-represented in Europe's newspapers, its universities, and its left-wing political parties"</p>
<p>However this is not in the article (see also &lt;<a href="http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/jcr_antisemitism.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/jcr_antisemitism.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/jcr_antisemitism.pdf</a>&gt;).</p>

Perhaps that section could be used for improvement of this article?:</p>

<dd>In fact, the statement is a plagiarized from one Diana Muir (references: &lt;<a href="http://www.think-israel.org/jul06bloged.html" class="external free" title="http://www.think-israel.org/jul06bloged.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.think-israel.org/jul06bloged.html</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://hnn.us/articles/28503.html" class="external free" title="http://hnn.us/articles/28503.html" rel="nofollow">http://hnn.us/articles/28503.html</a>&gt;). This appears to be her summary/interpretation of the article. I myself admit that I have not digested the whole of the Kaplan article and I am not well-versed in statistics, so whether this is a valid conclusion based upon the evidence eludes me. Nevertheless I shall attribute it to her shortly, since A) It is her opinion and B) To plug it without citing her is plagiarism.</dd>

<dd>On another note, the Kaplan paper's methodology seems somewhat questionable. The questions purported to gauge Anti-Zionism are skewed in such a way as to correlate more strongly with Anti-Semitism. For example, (paraphrase) "Do you think Israeli soldiers intentionally target civilians," is but, "Do you think that the IDF are butchers?" writ large, and the question about whether you think Palestinian suicide bombings are OK is even worse. But then again, this depends on your opinion of what Anti-Zionism is, and in my estimation Kaplan et al. believes that it is the desire for the destruction of the Israeli state (and is thus identical, or nearly identical, to Anti-Seminitism), or else he would have asked different questions. Perhaps this should be stated? <a href="../../../e/m/o/User%7EEmoticon_a621.html" title="User:Emoticon">Emoticon</a> 19:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have reworded the following sentence for grammar, but it seems to me that it either needs a) references (which will be hard to find), b) more weasel words (which are to be avoided), or c) to be removed. It's not a completely worthless point, but it needs support.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gandhi</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the statement on Gandhi from the intro. It seems like a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> to point to a bunch of excerpts from Gandhis comments about the Jews and conclude that he was anti-zionist. He certainly didn't support the actions Zionists took in the thirties but I also get the impression that he would have supported a binational state had such a thing been feasible. The point, however, is that looking at primary sources and drawing a conclusion is OR, a wikipedian can't do that, there has to be a reliable source that does that job. Of course a secondary argument is whether statements made before Israel's creation are relevant to a discussion of Anti-Zionism. Zionism after all changed dramatically after the war of independence and listing a guy who stated his opinions mostly before the 48 war in an introduction to anti-zionism doesn't seem like the best idea. Regardless, lets keep the discussion here at the talk page rather than descend into an edit war. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:05, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>My sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions. Through these friends I came to learn much of their age-long persecution. They have been the untouchables of Christianity. The parallel between their treatment by Christians and the treatment of untouchables by Hindus is very close. Religious sanction has been invoked in both cases for the justification of the inhuman treatment meted out to them. Apart from the friendships, therefore, there is the more common universal reason for my sympathy for the Jews.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice. <b>The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me.</b> The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after return to Palestine. <b>Why should they not, like other peoples of the earth, make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood?</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct.</b> The mandates have no sanction but that of the last war. <b>Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home.</b></dd>

<p>I guess I'd like you to state, quite simply, that you deny that Gandhi was an anti-Zionist, and then we can argue that. I will state quite simply that he was an anti-Zionist, that his contemporaries recognized it, that his writings reflected it, etc., etc., etc. If there is no denial of the claim that he was an anti-Zionist, then I think it is appropriate to balance the introduction's accusation from Martin Luther King with a comment that another important civil rights leader stood on the opposite side of the question.</p>
<p>I dislike, I have to say, the tone of your "secondary arguments" sentence. It gives the impression that you have decided, regardless of what is appropriate, that you want the reference to Gandhi suppressed, and that you will make whatever argument you feel you need to make in order to accomplish that goal. Can we not decide before we discuss facts how exactly the matter of including the reference should be decided? I'm sorry if it leans toward failing to assume good faith, but I don't want to have the rules repeatedly changed on me in discussing this matter, and your "secondary arguments" sentence gave me a bad impression.</p>
<p>Again, and more clearly this time, I think the determining matter should be whether or not Gandhi was by any reasonable interpretation an anti-Zionist. If he was, then the statement from MLK to the effect that all anti-Zionists are really anti-Semites should be balanced with this information.</p>

<dd>First, don't accuse me of suppressing information when I was the one who asked to discuss it on the talk page. Second, the rewording is better since it doesn't claim something the citation can't back up (that Gandhi was one of the moral leaders of anti-zionism) but it still needs to date Gandhi's statement. (Although I would prefer a link to a scholarly source on Gandhi's anti-zionism) I will date the MLK statement as well. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:03, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please be clear about what the original wording said: that Gandhi was a moral leader, and that he was an anti-Zionist. Not that he was a moral leader of anti-Zionism.

<dd>I see someone else noticed this, before I did. I checked the reference and as far as I can see there is no such quote. Its stems from that notorious faked speech and letter. MLK never said that. The other problem was that it gives too much prominence of that controversial fringe POV that equates Anti-Zionism with Anti-Semitism by putting it in the introduction. It should be kept in its own section under New Anti-Semitism where this POV can be extressed--not in the intro. If you are not convinced think about the Zionsims article having mention of the POV that Zionism is regarded as a form of racism, in the intro! Ofcourse that would not be correct. For the same reasons this fringe POV should not be part of the intro.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 03:11, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word "interview" seems misleading, it appears as if the alleged words were spoken in a meeting with media and became recorded on the occasion.

There is a short description of muslim anti-Zionism under defining, and a longer one under types.

All I want to do is cover muslim anti-Zionism together in one place, bi-national anti-Zionism in another, and eliminate reptitive comments. I have no interest in changing the intent of the content, just straighten it up. What do you think?

<dd>If I understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Uncle.bungle&amp;oldid=80908053" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Uncle.bungle&amp;oldid=80908053" rel="nofollow">your version</a> correctly, the first and third paragraphs are essentially repetitive. In addition, the old version gave context and definition first, then delved into specific examples, whereas your version did the opposite. The former would seem preferable for understanding. It seems to me your purpose would be better served by simply removing the phrase <small><i>for instance by those who advocate a binational state comprising the territories of the State of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in which both Jews and Palestinians would be citizens. Other "Anti-Zionists", such as some Palestinian militant groups, call for the total elimination (by whatever means) of the Jewish presence in the region of Palestine, which includes the territory of the State of Israel.</i></small> from the introduction, and removing the section header "Anti-Zionism dictionary definitions". I'll show you what I mean in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Jayjg. It looks great, thank you for your help. The only other thing I would like considered is mentioning the AAADC opposition to the definition of anti-Semitism, and the ADL response to it. It seems irrelevant to me since neither organization actually publishes a dictionary of their own, or has exclusive rights to represent the feelings of a particular ethnic group. In my opinion, both statements could be removed and the article would lose nothing. Let me know what you think. Thanks. --<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 22:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just as a quick follow up, there are two statements in there about Miriam webster reps caling the definition a "relic". Only one is necessary, I think. I'll let you decide how to best re-work it.
