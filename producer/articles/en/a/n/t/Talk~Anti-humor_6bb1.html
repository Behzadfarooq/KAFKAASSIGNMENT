<p>Andre Please read my edits before you revert. I cleaned up and sectioned many inappropriately grouped paragraphs and revised the list of jokes which subject traditional humour. 'How many babies does it take to paint a barn?' is not a subversion of a traditional joke.I have also added much technical description on the jokes. Perhaps we should include a section on 'Sick Humour' or 'Dead Body humour' to this end in the page, but I feel that the point of subverted jokes is less about jokes such as 'Because she had no legs'. The edits I made to the opening paragraph were because I felt that the style was inconcise and ambiguous. Many subjective phrases such as 'This is extremely funny' were removed for the sake of neutrality. I also heavily edited the section on the specific comedian because it seemed out of place. Again, perhaps a new section in 'Anti-humour in stand-up comedy' is called for. In all I have made made some big superficial changes, but the essence of the article remains the same. Please could we come to a compromise on this?<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinglex_50ee.html" title="User:Minglex">Minglex</a> 19:57, 23 February 2006 (UTC)Minglex Please keep the punchline of the apple joke the same.

<p>I removed the chicken jokes, as people said, they'e not anti-humor.

<p>I can only think of one at the moment, but an example is <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hislop_1212.html" title="Ian Hislop">Ian Hislop</a>'s joke (told on <a href="../../../h/i/g/HIGNFY_d683.html" title="HIGNFY">HIGNFY</a>: "Doctor, doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains."

<p>But there are probably other jokes like that that use part of a "real" joke in order for the punchline to make a political point; if there are, is that worth putting in?</p>

<p>Also, what about puns? I often hear appalingly bad puns but people laugh (or groan) anyway because they're so bad. And Ted Chippington is mentioned here and a lot of his act was awful puns like "Do you want to buy some grass? No thanks, I haven't got a garden" and the humour derived from the awfulness and the audience reaction.</p>

<p>The "Nonsense jokes" seems to be suffering a lot of list creep from anyone who passes by and realises they can add whatever they feel like making up off the top of their head.
