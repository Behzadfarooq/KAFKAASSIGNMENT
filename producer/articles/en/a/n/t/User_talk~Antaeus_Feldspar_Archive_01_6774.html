<p>I agree with you on the removal of the inappropriate section, and have reverted to your version twice now. If it is reverted again, I will list this on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>. However, I would ask that you please tone down your comments on the talk page. Yes, the anon is being childish, but your comments come across as unnecessarily acerbic. This simply fuels the "flames." I think if you deliberately restrict yourself to neutral-toned comments and refuse to stray from <i>content</i> related aspects, you'll steal his fire. Just think of how you would write if you were *discussing* this with your mother instead of *arguing* with a stranger. It might be a good idea to archive the talk page and start fresh. Just remember to stay on topic (the topic is the article, not the other user) and friendly. Logic is on your side, so don't let it get emotional. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 03:05, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh; since my mother isn't the kind of person who would vandalize talk pages or litter even the most heated discussion with insults to the family of the person she disagreed with, it's hard to picture this being a discussion with her. I do agree with you -- the discussion <b>should</b> be about the <b>content</b>, not about the personalities. However, when you articulate numerous reasons, based on the content and the article, why the content should not be in the article, and the response you get is not any actual answer to those points, but "I see you've decided to pick on little semantic things, to make yourself appear to be in the right" -- honesty, as</dd>

<dd>I have very little doubt about the reasons for this anon's actions or methods. &#160;;-) That's why it is even more important for you to take the high road. I expect he'll revert again and then I'll be listing the article for RfC. When that happens a lot of eyes will be trained on the article, the article's talk page and this talk page. Let's make sure they see sane, rational discourse. Your version has logic going for it, but others coming into the middle of this need to see that you are focusing on logic. I expect the anon(s) will continue using flame bait for argument, which will only show his "C of RCC" section for what I believe it to be -- a deliberate attempt at disruption. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 09:25, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

As I made a second edit to the page straight afterwards, I thought I should mention it, in case you wanted to object and/or discuss it. Why'd you remove it, as a matter of interest?

<dl>
<dd>Because I really cannot fathom how it reasonably <b>can</b> be described as a love story. Coppola's film, yes. Certain other renditions of the story, yes. Stoker's novel, no. Dracula is at best a seducer in Stoker's novel, and not in a way that has anything to do with love.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, I asked the question how the original novel could be described as a love story back on July 21, 2004. That was two months ago, and no one who believed in the "love story" interpretation bothered to answer the question in those two months. To ignore the question for two months and then revert the edit <b>still</b> not having answered the question strikes me as very rude. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:44, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Rudeness really wasn't intentional. If noone else has justified it either, then evidently <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> is against me (I put the link in in the first place), though I would still assert that it is, in part, a love story between Dracula and Mina. Sure, the Coppola film amplifies that beyond recognition, but I never got the impression he was <i>just</i> a seducer. Maybe I've seen the film too many times and not read the book recently enough. I'll put it back on my list of books to read and get back to you if I still care…&#160;:o) — <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenBlacker_920f.html" title="User:OwenBlacker">OwenBlacker</a> 12:57, Sep 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the film is <i>highly</i> revisionist. Which is not, in and of itself, a bad thing -- except if you then go on to name the film "Bram Stoker's Dracula", as Coppola did, and was roundly criticized for. Coppola turns all Stoker's heroes into fools and hidebound squares, and brings in the "Dracula seeks Mina because she's the reincarnation of his lost love" aspect, which is <i>nowhere</i> to be found in Stoker's novel. The original novel really doesn't show Dracula as having any capacity to feel for another living being -- perhaps because <i>he</i> isn't a living being! -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:32, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is, to put it bluntly, a lie. The matter has not been "debated and resolved" on the talk page. What you probably mean is that <b>you</b> have already "resolved" what you will believe on the subject and have decided to ignore further debate on the subject; however, this is not binding on myself or upon anyone else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, looking at the article, I see the following paragraph:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sherwood previously worked for former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, whom George W. Bush subsequently appointed as the first Secretary of Homeland Security. In 2003, the Bush administration chose Sherwood to create and manage a new federal website aimed at first responders (police officers, firefighters, etc.). While working as a Ridge administration official, "Sherwood directed then-Gov. Ridge's award-winning broadcast TV and radio operations in Harrisburg". [4] (<a href="http://www.insiderpa.com/archive/insider6-2003.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.insiderpa.com/archive/insider6-2003.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.insiderpa.com/archive/insider6-2003.htm</a>) He currently works as an executive vice president of the WVC3 Group, an anti-terrorism, security firm headquartered in Reston, VA.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Who added that to the article? You did. To quote you, "Stolen Honor article is not about Sherwood". Yet you decided that this information was relevant to the article. If Sherwood's employ under Tom Ridge is relevant, if Sherwood being picked to manage a federal website is relevant, if his direction of Ridge's media operations is relevant, if his current employment in the private sector is relevant, then surely <b>the previous praise and criticism for his jounalistic activities</b> is relevant -- seeing as how the article is about <b>one of his journalistic activities</b>, not about himself, a fact <i>you</i> seem to frequently forget.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now if you would like to debate this further, I would recommend doing so on the talk page of the article itself, rather than my user page. Perhaps they would be interested in your claim that the issue has already been "debated and resolved"; they might find that information interesting, and just possibly surprising. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:30, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of the pending arbitration proceedings against Rex, the first one has become so piled high with evidence that I don't know how anyone can sort it out, while the second has a fairly limited focus.

<dd>Hey, Rex! Remember me? I'm the one that you listed on "Vandalism in Progress", <i>after</i> you already <i>had</i> an RfA opened against you for that exact same offense! Strangely enough, this cannot be blamed on JamesMLane; you were the one who knew the consequences and went ahead and did it anyways. If you do get yourself "hard banned", it would not be undeserved and it would be no tragedy; everyone else abides by certain rules and receives certain privileges, and there is no reason <i>you</i> should get only the "privileges" half of the equation. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:43, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A small correction: The first time Rex abused the ViP page, an admin deleted his improper listing and explained the correct procedure to him on his talk page. No one started an arbitration based on his first mistake. The pending arbitrations arise from other matters. With Rex's earlier listing, though, he used up his free shot. Thus, his listing of you and Sahara could no longer be excused as the mistake of a newbie. For that reason, it was an appropriate basis for a Request for Arbitration. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 17:06, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Since two Arbitrators have already put in votes to incorporate this into the open RfA, should I bother answering any of his accusations there, or is the existing RfA the place for that now? (As we both know, Rex tries to argue that an accusation that isn't answered within twelve hours is a charge admitted to. Cause it's not like the person could have been <i>away from Wikipedia</i> for twelve hours, right?

Rex's lengthy response is to the effect that, in the edit dispute over <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Honor_0dcd.html" title="Stolen Honor">Stolen Honor</a>, he was right. Of course, what he's nominally responding to isn't the charge that, in that edit dispute, he was wrong. The charge is that it was an edit dispute. I think his response <i>strengthens</i> the point I was making, namely that his "Vandalism in progress" listing was improper. Therefore, I don't know if it's worth your taking much time to get into detail about what should or should not be included in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Honor_0dcd.html" title="Stolen Honor">Stolen Honor</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 22:09, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps you will consider including some of my work in your solid foundation? Maybe take another look at it? Scottcraig 03:46, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry, again. I am still learning the protocol. And you are right about the clean-up page. I would never have found this page without it. Since I can't find where the suggestions for improvements have been going, I'll just put some here.<br /></dd>
<dd>I still think my version is better for a few reasons. The main one is that the article jumps right into an example, which it then interrupts with a discussion. I think it is better to start with an analogy describing the method. Follow this with a complete example of the simple static case. Then discuss the adaptive case. And those diagrams in the history looked interesting, too. It was a shame to discard them.<br /></dd>
<dd>And in general, the prose is too wordy, with too many asides within sentences. Go for simpler sentence structure, with fewer words. I don't have the page in front of me, but I remember the first sentence had these flaws. There was no need to define a message within the definition of arithmetic coding. A separate sentence would flow better.<br /></dd>
<dd>And finally, I feel it would be better to do the examples in binary rather than decimal. It is just as easy, and that's really how the algorithm works in any implementation I've seen. To do it in decimal is analogous, but needlessly confusing. And speaking of analogies, your algorithm is an analogy as well. The real algorithm doesn't calculate all the interval endpoints; it just calculates the two it needs at each stage. And the decoding works more like how I described, by scaling the intervals to [0, 1) at each step.<br /></dd>
<dd>I know my version was not finished, but it had some of the elements I describe here. Could you look at it again and see if it may be possible to work some of it into yours? Scottcraig 08:08, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Find an expert whose <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">authority you can appeal to</a>, and cite the quote in a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> way, and it'l be fine. Outside of that, your "critics" are much the same as the "most scientists" who always seem to agree w random editors POV's, until we discover there is no documentation handy on what scientists think on the subject. I understand how you feel, my point is, are you a critic of encyclopedic status? If so, adding your <i>own</i> opinion to the article would be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.

<dd>This is bizarre logic, that I, as a moderate leftist being tarred by Protest Warrior's broad brush, must find some sort of "authority" to cite in order to support the claim that moderate leftists object to being tarred with Protest Warrior's broad brush. I'm curious, must gay people find an authority to cite before they can talk about gay people's objections to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a>? Must black people Google for an official statement from the <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a> before they can state word one about black people's reactions to the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>? I will remind you that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> states that "we should <i>fairly represent</i> all sides of a dispute"; I am sorely puzzled why you think requiring the targets of Protest Warrior's activities to cite an "authority" in order to have their side represented at all is in any way, shape or form "fair". --</dd>

<p>Please look carefully at this article, and at the other contributions from that editor. I do believe this is vicious anti-Japanese "blood libel", and I'm not sure how to treat it -- vfd? speedy? report as vandal and let someone else deal with it? -- The fairly new <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a> {<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 05:29, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that's in part why I put the substub tag on, to attract attention that might include someone who can confirm or deny it. VfD or speedy seem to be overkill for what is basically suspicion without proof, at least no proof at this time. You might ask at <a href="../../../r/c/_/Wikipedia%7ERC_patrol_419c.html" title="Wikipedia:RC patrol">Wikipedia:RC patrol</a>, though; I believe they frequently handle cases like this one.</dd>

<dd>Google reports no hits for "Kirisutan Holocaust". It suggested "Kirishtan Holocaust", however, which returns 151 hits. That's not a huge number, true, but the hits seem to stick with consistency to a basic set of very specific facts, which blood libels usually don't. Refining the search to sites in the ".edu" domain seems to indicate that if it's a blood libel, it's one which <a href="http://newton.uor.edu/Departments&amp;Programs/AsianStudiesDept/japan-history.html" class="external text" title="http://newton.uor.edu/Departments&amp;Programs/AsianStudiesDept/japan-history.html" rel="nofollow">fooled the Asian Studies Department</a> at the University of Redlands.</dd>

<dd>So, I think that it's probably correct information. I've created a redirect to it under the better-known spelling as well. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 06:28, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ugh. I had hoped he'd go away. Before listing him/her on ViP it'd probably be best to warn him about the three revert rule and explain that the removal of large chunks of an article without reason or discussion will usually be reverted. I'm not knowledgeable enough about the article's subject to really judge, but most of the text the anon removed had been there for some time, so <i>some</i> of it should probably stay. -- <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 05:58, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
