<p>Moved from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>One has to also consider the aspect of what antipodes means, which is literally "under one's feet", back when the Earth was flat. This caused great consternation in the church at the time because there was the issue of whether Christ had saved these people, as well. This is very explored in the brilliant Umberto Eco's <i>Island of the Day Before</i> as well as in Rennaissance Encyclopedias.</dd>

<p>If you were to take the lattitude and swap North for South or vice versa, then take the Longitude from 180 and swap East for West or vice versa, that would work.</p>
<p>The Lattitude and Longitude of where I live (Whitehaven, Cumbria, England) is about 54.5° North, 3.5° West; so the opposite point would be 54.5° South, (180-3.5=)176.5° East, which is about half way in the ocean between New Zealand and the Antartic, and it's probably isn't surprising that there's nothing good on the other side of the world to me given that about 70% of the Earth's surface is water!</p>
<p>Alternatively you could use Google Earth, put it on measure mode, select the starting point, go to roughly where you think the Antipodal Point to it is, and move the mouse around it and as you circle round the Antipodal Point the measuring line will itself go around the world like a skipping rope.</p>

<p>I've edited away text concerning the singular form <i>antipode</i> arising from the "mistaken belief" that <i>antipodes</i> is the plural of <i>antipode</i>. At best, this is badly put. If you back-form <i>antipodes</i> (plural) to <i>antipode</i> (singular) without knowing that it's the Greek plural of <i>antipous</i>, you are not asserting that the Greek singular is also <i>antipode</i>, you are simply following the normal pattern of English plural forms. Believing that the English singular of <i>antipodes</i> is <i>antipode</i> is perfectly correct. It clearly is, and etymology be damned.</p>
<p>There is a school of thought that holds that any usage that does not strictly follow some historically-based argument is incorrect. E.g., <i>decimate</i> must always be used to mean "reduce <i>by</i> one-tenth" and not, as it is nearly universally used, to mean "severely reduce." The problem with this is that any attempt to base this on a consistent general rule such as "words must always be used in senses they had when they first appeared in the language" results in practically all usage being "incorrect."</p>
<p>In any case, to be really sticky the Greek words should be in Greek letters. I'll leave that to someone who knows Greek. -<a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmh_6fde.html" title="User:Dmh">Dmh</a> 19:39, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The belief that that singular form was already in conventional use was indeed mistaken at the time when the form originated in that way. Perhaps it was not explained clearly enough and could be misunderstood, so it's badly put, but not incorrect if the intended meaning is followed. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:21, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I follow that. My main point is that we're only guessing what was in the minds of the first people to use "antipode" as a singular in English, but we can say for sure what the Greek singular is. -<a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmh_6fde.html" title="User:Dmh">Dmh</a> 18:15, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on a second. From what I can make out (and again, I don't know Greek), "antipodes" means "under/opposite the feet". It seems more like an modifier than a noun, and the entry for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipodes.html" title="Antipodes">antipodes</a> seems to bear this out. If that's right, then the putative singular "antipous" would just be a different (and probably unused) modifier, meaning "under/opposite the foot". The entry on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipodes.html" title="Antipodes">antipodes</a> also states, plausibly, that the word shifted in meaning when it came from Greek to Latin, from "under/opposite the feet" to "person with feet opposite". It's not clear to me whether it was considered singular or plural in Latin, but by the time it comes to English it's clearly plural, setting the stage for the back-formation. All this drift in form and meaning is quite normal; characterizing any particular usage as a mistake borne of ignorance considerably distorts the picture. -<a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmh_6fde.html" title="User:Dmh">Dmh</a> 21:29, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The arcticle says that if it's Midsummer at one point it must be Midwinter at it's Antipodal point, but what if the original point is on the equator? (which would mean the Antipodal Point is on the equator, too)</p>
<p>In fact I didn't think they had Summer and Winter between the tropics? Should that bit be scrapped as it's from the POV of someone who isn't in the tropics, not to mention that it's true for any points outside the tropics on the opposite hemisphere to one another, if it's Midwinter in Oslo it's Midsummer in Cape Town, even if they're not even close to being anti-podal.</p>

<dd>Since it's never summer or winter at the equator, the statement that <b>if</b> it's summer at one point, <b>then</b> it's winter at the antipodal point is <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuous_truth.html" title="Vacuous truth">vacuously true</a>, i.e. (roughly speaking) true but uninformative.

<dd>I categorically state that there will be no contract for your assassination — at least not from me. &#160;;-) However, it doesn't really seem to be particularly related to the subject. In fact, I'm inclined to suggest that since you're really just explaining the meanings of words, you should be putting them in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a>. <i>Diametrically opposed</i> isn't really a subject for an encyclopedia article. — <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohantheghost_a1e6.html" title="User:Johantheghost">Johan&#160;the&#160;Ghost</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohantheghost_a875.html" title="User talk:Johantheghost"><sub>seance</sub></a> 11:56, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
