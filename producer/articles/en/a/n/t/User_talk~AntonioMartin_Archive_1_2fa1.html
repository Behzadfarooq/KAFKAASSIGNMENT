<p>Hello there AntonioMartin, welcome to the 'pedia! I hope you like the place and decide to stay. If you ever need editing help visit Wikipedia:How does one edit a page and experiment at Wikipedia:Sandbox. If you need pointers on how we title pages visit Wikipedia:Naming conventions. If you have any other questions about the project then check out Wikipedia:Help or add a question to the Village pump. Cheers! --maveric149</p>

<hr />
<p>This is just my opinion, but I find that some of your articles about popular culture (for example, Bananarama and pre-edit Mary Kay Olsen) are written in a style that is more publicity brochure than NPOV. It is rather tiring to edit all of these articles to remove the kvelling and stick to the facts. You may wish to review other articles about famous people for style tips. -- user:Montrealais</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Please, read the NPOV article. It is one of the main characteristics of this encyclopedia, and you don't seem even trying. We need facts, not opinions. Speaking of people as "great" "excellent", etc. is not NPOV, its opinions. When opinions are put, we have to say who has that opinion. Also, try to check your facts. Eg. Don Francisco was not born in Germany.:) Other than that, have fun!--AN 06:15 Sep 26, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Antonio, I've been modifying many of your articles because of the point AstroNomer mentioned above. In addition, when you use such terminology as "the 80's", you're linking to the Year 80, not to the 1980s. I've had to change this over and over again in your work. Use "the 1980s" instead. -- Zoe</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for your words, Antonio. I noticed how your entries improved over time. I'm glad you considered my advise useful. Another advice, this time technical: when you are signed in, you can use <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Martin</a> and it will be autimatically replaced by your user name and link to your page.

<p>I answered your question on my talk page. Oh, by the way, I'm sadly not the most important Admin. I don't think such a person exists. --mav</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Antonio - no it wasn't that the Sgt Pepper page was written by me, but the article you made was spelt slightly incorrectly: it was at Sgt. Pepper Lonely's Hearts Club Band instead of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (note the place of the apostrophe). Not your fault, though, you just followed a badly spelled link from heavy metal. Don't worry about it, it happens to us all&#160;:) I'll try to integrate the articles in a moment. --Camembert Hi again - I've merged the two articles to the best of my ability, but I had to leave out one paragraph, because I don't have the knowledge to weave it in. I've added it to Talk:Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - you might want to have a look and see what you can do with it, and also check that my merge is OK. All the best, Camembert</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I'll see what I can add to the 1980s film article. My point, though, was that the definition might be a bit broad, and that there might not be any unifying characteristics between French and American and German films of the 1980s.&#160;:-) --KQ</p>
<hr />
<p>I moved Conspiracy Theory (Movie) to Conspiracy Theory (movie) in order to reflect our capitalization naming convention. I've also noticed that some of the other page titles you have created are also capitalized maybe where they shouldn't be. When you have a moment, a quick read of the above naming convention page will explain why this isn't such a great idea. The wiki awaits....&#160;:-) --mav</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi again. I noticed that you uploaded a .art picture. I have no idea what is that, and it is not among the recommended formats (jpeg for pictures, png for graphs). I you can convert it to jpeg it would be great. About the authorization, you probably could put "courtesy of ...." in the article under the picture to comply with his request. The note you put in the description page looks fine to me.--AN</p>
<hr />
<p>Don't be angry at tarquin for deleting your page on Donna Karan. As you can see in my answer on my user page, what he deleted was not your page but another version that was really junk. Your version for whatever reason seems not to have been saved at all. Andre Engels 08:10 Nov 11, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Nice work on the airport and boxing articles.&#160;:-) --mav</p>
<p>I concur, very good work. Antonio, I'm not the end all and be all on the project, but normally we're only interested in birthdates for famous people. If you're some sort of celebrity, then go ahead and put your birthday in, but otherwise, people are pretty much going to want to know, "who is this person"? -- Zoe</p>
<p>I disagree. The more facts the better.&#160;:) -- Oliver Pereira 21:27 Nov 20, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, I see - that was in answer to the question he asked on your talk page! Well, in that case, I agree with you after all. (Sorry, I'm a bit slow.) But why don't people put answers to questions after the questions themselves!? That would seem more sensible to me - otherwise no-one can know what is in answer to what... -- Oliver PEREIRA 03:01 Dec 8, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Isis: Hi! Thanks for readng my page about diabetic Chocks. I have to tell you, thru, that the word chock needs to be changed back on the title from shock to chock. Believe me, I unfortunately have found out more times than I wanted how doctors like spelling the word that describes a sugar reaction. Ive had 7 chocks to date, and Im praying my dear Lord I dont get any more. doctors have told me that the word Shock means something different to them, like the shock from seeing something big happen, I guess.</p>
<p>Other than that, thank you for reading my article, I appreciate that someone is kind enough to read them. I hope to read from you soon! God bless you!!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>AntonioMartin (ps: Welcome back!!)</p>
<p><br />
Hi, hope you don't mind my popping up here. I have made a comment on this issue on the Talk page for the Diabetic shock article Talk:Diabetes_shock which I hope might help a little. Nevilley 08:57 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>I thought I remembered hearing the term, which is why I didn't change it in the article, but I knew it was an alternative term for something, because I got no hits at all for it on Google, and I'm on deadline to get some copy in a few hours from now and didn't have time to do anything more myself, so I simply moved it and marked it for someone else's attention. Thanks to you both for your attention to it, and I'm happy to leave it in your capable hands. -- isis 11:37 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>

Scottsdale, Arizona already has an entry! The content of your Scottsdale entry appears to be very POV!!! -- RTC 06:52 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
It is quite simple, I left Phoenix because when I graduated I already had a job offer with a company in Palo Alto, California. Since then they have moved to San Jose, California, been bought by Rockwell International?, and following the Rockwell split last year are now owned by Rockwell Collins?. I still work there (at the end of February I will have worked there 25 years).</p>
<p>BTW, you might see if you can merge some of the stuff in your Scottsdale article into the main Scottsdale, Arizona article (but reduce the POV content), there is some good stuff in your article that the main one doesn't have (especially if you can expand it some). Then either change the Scottsdale article to a "redirect" or put it on votes for deletion as an old "mistake". -- RTC 05:48 Dec 7, 2002 (UTC)</p>

On another subject --- use the Upload file function on the Wikipedia menu to upload images. It is actually fairly obvious once you get into it. -- RTC 06:02 Dec 7, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good job on Mary Kelly.Ill give the writer credit because he is new, so Ill cut him some slack, but he didnt even put the name of the movie where Heather Graham played Mary Kelly to Johnny Depp's (I believe it was him) Jack. Unfortunately, I didnt know the name of the movie either. He should have written a page about the movie and put that information there.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>AntonioMartin Don't cut him too much slack -- look at what he did to List of famous Australians on 3 December. I didn't know what movie it was either and so just deleted the info on both pages (and deleted the other page entirely), figuring someone will write it up properly someday if it warrants inclusion in the 'pedia. Please keep an eye on this contributor, if you have time. Keep up the good work. -- isis 09:31 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Antonio, where do you get all the great information to build your articles? The rate at which you seem to write such great stuff is really amazing. I'm a very active Wikipedian and I'm lucky to create half the original text you do per week. Please don't ever leave.&#160;:-) --mav</p>

<p>I've unblocked IP 205.188.209.14 for you. Somebody else on your same internet provider (AOL?) was using this IP to vandalize pop star articles. I know it wasn't you and so does the sysop doing the blocking. You were an innocent person caught in the crossfire. Sorry about that. If this wasn't the right IP then just email me by using the 'Email this user' feature on my user page while you are logged-in. --mav</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind words and for fixing the List of famous people who have suffered from or died of cancer. --Mrwojo</p>

<hr />
<p>You forgot to mention which IP Isis blocked. I assume it was the last one she did (194.145.59.170) so I unblocked that one. I'm pretty sure that is an AOL or other ISP proxy so please don't take offense at being blocked since many people use the same IP number. We have been having a good deal of trouble from these proxies for some time now so when you get blocked again just email me to have the block removed. --mav</p>

<p>I have nothing against John Casablancas. I never heard of him before yesterday. I was annotating the Biographical Listing/C article, clicking on every name that didn't have any information. I came across his page and considered that it had no encyclopedic interest and was an advertisement. I said so. Others disagreed. I looked into it further and found that most people in the modeling world consider modeling schools a scam. As for the article being an advertisement, it is incorrect to call Casablanca's business a "modeling agency". It is not. Items I posted on Talk:John Casablancas state that calling a school an agency is a common ploy for modeling schools. The article states that Casablancas "has contacts with the Elite Modeling Agency". Well, he used to be the president, but he hasn't been there for three years. He had a very good reputation as a model and as president of Elite, but his reputation has suffered with the modeling school venture as far as I can tell. I personally don't care anything about him, but I do care about the reputation of Wikipedia. His modeling school operates by marketing heavily to teenagers, telling them they have talent, then charging them a couple of thousand bucks for "training". They do not place models, nor do they have any particular reputation for success in training models. I hope the article is removed, or, if not, that it is changed to reflect more of the reality of his operation. Ortolan88 15:33 Jan 21, 2003 (UTC) I made minor corrections to the article and withdrew my statement that it should be deleted. Coca Cola is a world wide cultural phenomenon with political implications. John Casablancas is an ex-model who runs some schools. I hope you get more acting jobs and do well at it. Ortolan88 23:14 Jan 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I answered your question on my talk page. --mav</p>

<p>Hm, you must be on dialup, or an ISP that rotates proxies. You should be unblocked now, sorry about that. Best, Koyaanis Qatsi</p>

<p>Hi Antonio. About Autograph collecting do's and dont's?. I don't think merging it with Autograph is a good idea since the first is really a personal essay. Perhaps in a very condensed and NPOV form? (But I'm not a candidate for doing that: I'm not an autograph collector and I wouldn't have a clue of what's important). However, the complete article could be sent to meta as stated on its talk page. Have a nice day (...even if I don't know what time zone you're in:-) D.D. 20:55 Jan 27, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Antonio, I will try to notice who the champs are, but I am sometimes confused about various boxing authorities, weight classes, and the like. You are more knowledgeable than I am (although I did once see Joe Louis fight in an exhibition and shook hands with Ingomar Johansen?), so maybe you can fill in a few of those too. I think all lists benefit from a little additional information. This is particularly so when the subject matter is unfamiliar (like performers from the Dominican), so I'd suggest than when you are making lists like that, a few identifying or explanatory phrases can be a big help. Best regards, Ortolan88 Antonio, I think what you call a holding bridge, we would call a suspension bridge. -- Zoe</p>
<p>It wasn't me fixing the page, Antonio, it was "Someone else". -- Zoe</p>
<p>Hey, there Antonio - no te puedes usar "famoso" para todas las paginas - esto es el razon. Tambien, quien sabemos que no es famoso? - this is conventional naming - I know its odd, but proper sentences arent the best titles for pages... --Stevert</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Antonio, Glad to help, it's always nice when it's agreed that a change is an 'improvement"!. -- Someone else 22:50 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Answer for you on my talk page. --mav 08:14 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC) Hi Antonio, nice to see another Tony around the place. I guess my drugs question was a sort of fishing expedition - I always struggle to tell any sensible difference between, say, marijuana and cocaine on the one hand, and alcohol and tobacco on the other.</p>
<p>I'm not very good at famous people I'm afraid. I tend to remember events much better than the people involved in them, but if I think of anyone I'll be sure to add them in. I guess there is probably room for a companion list of famous people who died of smoking-related diseases or had alcohol problems. But this gets tricky as I'm sure there are places in the world where marijuana or betel nut is legal and alcohol is not - in other words, the "drugs = illegal drugs" categorisation soon breaks down. Whatever - I'll leave that to the people chiefly concerned with doing the list.</p>
<p>As for aircraft, yes, wonderful things. I like anything that flies, from 747s to honeyeaters (sort of the Australian equivalent of a humming bird) to dragonflies. (Well, not blowflies or mosquitos, but just about everything else.) Oh, and speaking of drugs, I rarely drink but I consume tea by the gallon, probably 20 or 30 half-litre mugs of it a day. Hence my nic. -- Tony (Tannin)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Hey, I don't like editing others' user pages, so I thought I'd point out that the movie is called How Stella Got Her Groove Back, not When (unless you're talking about a different movie). Just trying to prevent an article being written at the incorrect spot in the future... Tuf-Kat</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>About that "Run Away" song - do you mean the one by the Real McCoy? It seems to be "run away and save your life", rather than "run away and say goodbye", at least judging by the pages that Google throws up. Erm, not that I take that seriously as an indicator of truth, or anything... -- Oliver P. 23:16 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for the reply! I see that the above link is red... No article! How terrible. I've just tried to look up some stuff about the Real McCoy on the Web, but I can't find much. Okay, I've attempted a stub, but I must admit, it's a pretty poor one.&#160;:( -- Oliver P. 23:52 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I responded to you on my talk page. Stephen C. Carlson 15:39 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again Antonio. For me, it's in the blood. My father flew for TAA for ... oh .. 30-odd years I guess: DC-3, DC4, Viscount, Friendship, then a spell in Alice Springs flying the DH Dove for the Flying Doctor (I just barely remember that, I was about 5 at the time), back to Melbourne to start at the bottom again, but as a captain this time, not a First Officer: DC-3 again, Friendship &amp; Viscount, then onto jets with the 727 and the DC-9. He retired then, and spent the next 10 or 15 years as an aviation safety consultant, working for the RAAF and most of the Australian airlines. My brother flies too: he is in the UK now flying 757s for an American freight company.</p>
<p>People often ask why I never took it up. The reason is simple: I was never interested. I love aircraft (and birds too - birds even more than aircraft, really): reading about them, looking at them, travelling in them, even the smell of jet fuel (which is something I grew up on, of course). But, for some reason, I've never had the slightest urge to want to actually fly one. Why should I? There is always a family member who can do the tricky stuff with throttle and stick, leaving me free to look out the window and enjoy myself!</p>
<p>Cheers-- Tannin</p>

<p>Moved from Netesq's Talk page:</p>
<p>Arrested for getting on a car's front hood?? Dear Netesq: Hi! I see that youre the most knowlegeable person at Wikipedia about laws, just like I probably am about boxing, which is basically my department. After a night out playing pool Friday night, I went onto my brother's car and got on the hood. I wasnt screaming or anything (yet). A cop saw me from afar, and screamed to get off the car and I, not recognizing it was a cop of course, said 'But its my brother's car!!<i>, ....he said 'I dont *F*ing care, get down from that car! Ill arrest you!' after that, I screamed and told my friends (mimicking Muhammad Ali) 'who are the pool champions of the world??" and then he said 'Get off the F*ing car Ill have you arrested!!'</i></p>
<p>Now, because of the way he was acting towards me in the first place, I think he wanted to arrest me cause I was on my brothers car, something Im not strange to doing. As far as I know Im not breaking any laws in the penal code when I do that, or am I? On the other hand, I wasnt drunk, cause Im a Diabetic, I dont mess with drinks, and if he suspected I was he couldve carried out a alcohol test before offering to arrest me, right?</p>
<p>thanks for listening to my question, and God bless you!!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, Antonio IIIIII Almost Got Arrested Tonight!! Martin</p>
<p><br />
Greetings, Antonio. And welcome to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Thank you for noticing my legal scholarship. It's something in which I take great pride. Even so, I do not practice law, nor do I offer legal opinions or legal advice. Rather, I take great care to qualify any opinions that I give as being my personal opinions. If you need a legal opinion or legal advice, you should retain legal counsel.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer fully in place, let me set forth what I call "The Rule of the Gun," i.e.:</p>
<p>Those with the guns make the rules.</p>
<p>Simply put, I can't remember the last time someone I know won an argument with a peace officer as to whether said peace officer had a right to tell them what to do, Terence Hallinan's recent indictment of the SFPD's top brass for conspiracy to obstruct justice notwithstanding. So, within the confines of what is offensive to my personal moral code, I think it's a good idea to obey the orders of someone whose sworn duty is to uphold the law. Granted, one can't always tell when one is talking to a police officer. But once it becomes clear to me that I am dealing with a police officer, I become the essence of cooperation, and I would urge you to do the same. -- NetEsq 04:41 Mar 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanx! Dear Nes: Thanxs for reading and answering my question. It's true, we should always obey law officers. He didnt show a badge or anything, thru, I think he should have shown it before threatening any arrests. I figured out he was a cop after he threatened with arresting me...but then again, I mean, I actually like cops, most of the ones Ive met have been pretty decent. But there are some who think they are God I guess. We need to watch out for those. Recently, near where I live, a cop shot a woman to death as she was looking for her driver's license. This in front of her baby and without doing 'standard procedure' of like , pointing the gun at her without shooting or something. Hes on trail for murder now, and it's not the first time he shot someone without a threat. So, yeah you are right, we need to obey those with guns...</p>
<p>On the other hand, I still dont see how I was breaking the law by getting on top of my brother's car without making a sound, (which I later did).</p>
<p>Well, thanks man, and God bless ya!!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, Antonio Exentric Martin</p>
