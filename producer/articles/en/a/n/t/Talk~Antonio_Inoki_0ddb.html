<p>This article needs some clean-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Wrestling Career" section is highly unstructured. It should either be chronological, or broken up into sections, e.g., JWA, Tokyo Pro, NJPW wrestler, NJPW lead booker.</li>
<li>The last paragraph which accuses him of lying should be re-written to maintain NPOV</li>
<li>No citations at all in the article</li>
<li>The trivia section is way too long, and a lot of it is political trivia. Why not just make a "Political career" section? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 10:21, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Did Chris Benoit really train in the Inoki Dojo? I thought that Benoit trained in the NJPW Dojo, but not the modern Inoki Dojo. Please correct me or the article. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 10:45, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I'm not mistaken the Inoki Dojos are the Japanese NJPW Dojo and the NJPW LA Dojo which I don't think began till the late 90's. I would suspect that you're right and Benoit simply trained in the NJPW Dojo in Japan. That whole part may cause problems because in some cases it may be hard to tell who trained where. Samoa Joe definitely trained in the LA Dojo, I'd suspect Sakuraba only trained in Japan.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shamrock is hard to say, I would have thought he would have been too well established by the late 90s to have trained in LA and the Dojo probably opened too late for his move into wrestling, it is possible he may have trained in the Japan Dojo while he was fighting in Pancrase though. It may be best to remove every expect Joe until there's evidence for the rest. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKiltman67_4127.html" title="User:Kiltman67">Kiltman67</a> 16:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Went to the <a href="http://www.njpw.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.njpw.com/" rel="nofollow">LA Dojo website</a> and it refered to it as the Inoki Dojo in places. Don't know if we can take this as meaning it's the only Inoki Dojo. I'd suspect that since Inoki ran New Japan and no doubt had some input in the Japanese Dojo, it may be difficult to clarify which one in particular is being talked about. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKiltman67_4127.html" title="User:Kiltman67">Kiltman67</a> 18:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed the suggestion that the last paragraph mentioning his claims was not NPOV, anybody have any ideas how to change this? It's quite well known by anybody who follows the business of Puroresu that Inoki says a lot of wild things that don't come true. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKiltman67_4127.html" title="User:Kiltman67">Kiltman67</a> 16:10, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Secondly, when it comes to the Wrestling section it should probably just be rearranged in some chronological fashion, any attempt to divide it into new sections will probably reveal a lack of material there to work with. There is a lot out there to write about but it's all spread across many sites and finding reputable sources rather than comments on news sites might hard. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKiltman67_4127.html" title="User:Kiltman67">Kiltman67</a> 16:14, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>With the exception of the Ali match it might be hard to find evidence that his fights (outside the Final Countdown) were legit. Not necessarily because they weren't, but rather that there isn't much written about them. It might be worth saying the Ali match was legit, since there's plenty evidence, but avoiding this issue with other matches. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKiltman67_4127.html" title="User:Kiltman67">Kiltman67</a> 16:17, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have read that Ali at first wanted the worked fight, but then altered his mind because he did not wish to deceive his fans (the first fight being a loss to Inoki, the worked sequel being a win)(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 12:59, 15 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Though many of inoki's matches were dismissed by the skeptics as worked by some, there has been little or no proof at all to suggest the validity of the worked theory and Inoki's mixed martial arts opponents have never stated that the matches were "fake", till now he has confirmed of engaging in only one worked MMA match, that being Antonio Inoki vs Renzo Gracie.</p>
<p>Yet later in the article,</p>
<p>Inoki's other MMA-style matches are widely thought to have been worked, although many believe them to have been legitimate.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to word this because it sounds contradictory to me.</p>

<p>This is just a kind of suggestion, i found it would be nice to have this kind of information, even it´s not that important for puroresu in general.</p>
<p>It would be nice and quite... fun for the user to read a list of famous people that got blessed (slaped) by Inoki. What do ya think?</p>
