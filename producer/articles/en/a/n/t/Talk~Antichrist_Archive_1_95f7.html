<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early comments</span></h2>
<p>Somebody look at the list of people that might've been antichrists. 50 cent... Bob Saget..</p>
<hr />
<p>I've removed this section because it's factually incorrect:</p>
<p><i>The age of Israel in relation to the references in both Eziekiel and Daniel would place the appearance of the anti-christ to be sometime in the next 10 years because a generation in Jewish tradition was a period of forty years. Israel starting in 1967 would therefore place the arrival of the anti-christ before 2007.</i></p>
<p>The modern state of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> was founded in 1948, although it did win a major war in 1967. <a href="../../../b/d/r/User%7EBdrasin_1e4e.html" title="User:Bdrasin">Bdrasin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That is a view held by some. When 40 years came after the founding of Israel, some who believed the antichrist would come to within 40 years after the founding of Israel decided that the beginning of the 40 years should start with the 1967 war. If 2007 passes with no appearance of the antichrist, it's quite possible that some other starting date will be chosen.--RLent 15:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A variation on the view "this generation shall not pass away until" is that people that were alive in 1948 (or 1967) would still be alive when Christ returns. This could be anywhere from 70 to 120 years from that date. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossnixon_c5b8.html" title="User:Rossnixon"><sup><font color="green"><i>ross</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossnixon_14dc.html" title="User talk:Rossnixon"><sup><font color="blue"><i>nixon</i></font></sup></a> 00:48, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has anyone ever heard of '686' being used as a rare variant for '666' in Rev.? I'd only heard of '616'. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacquerie27_0129.html" title="User:Jacquerie27">Jacquerie27</a> 16:03 Apr 26, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the identity of the antichrist, the bible itself says that it is human beings (plural). 2 John 1:7 says "Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh; any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist!" (New Revised Standard Version), or "For many imposters (seducers, deceivers, and false leaders) have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge (confess, admit) the coming of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) in bodily form. Such a one is the imposter (the seducer, the deceiver, the false leader, the antagonist of Christ) and the antichrist." (Amplified Version).

<dd>If you're talking to me, I'm done. &#160;:-) I just noticed a most wanted that had been hanging around for a while, and filled it. I'm neither a Christian nor a student of Christian theology, so the amount of factual information I can contribute is limited. <i>(Thanks to <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> et alii for working on it!)</i> Your text above would certainly be relevant to the article. <a href="../../../p/g/d/User%7EPgdudda_fb58.html" title="User:Pgdudda">Pgdudda</a></dd>

<dd>There are two main lines of Christian theological thought concerning the Antichrist. The original, which seems to be in fashion today, identifies "anti-Christ<b>s</b>" (plural, note) as, broadly speaking, teachers of false religion: those who deny or oppose Christ. The other idea -- Antichrist as an individual, a diabolical deceiver and tyrant who pretends to be Christ -- is a medieval invention. Much of it comes from two books: <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-Methodius_15b8.html" title="Pseudo-Methodius">Pseudo-Methodius</a>, an apocryphal 7th-century text concerning the end of the world, and Abbot Adso of Montier-en-Ter's <i>Libellus de Antichristo</i>, a 10th-century "life of Antichrist". These portraits, in turn, draw on a large body of biblical material; some of the sources (the book of Daniel, for example) are considered canonical, but the greater part are completely apocryphal. (I am neither a theologian nor a religious historian, but this is my understanding of the Antichrist story). -<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a></dd>

<dd>There are, undoubtedly, many medieval inventions concerning this subject. However, the idea of <i>the</i> Antichrist is not one of those inventions. My favorite, very early reference, is from Gregory the Great, who in numerous letters to bishops and to politicians warns them of the coming Antichrist. He hints that whoever he may be, he will be much like his chief opponent in the Church, the Bishop of Constantinople! Being a man of famous candor, with a reputation as no flatterer, he said nothing to others about his opponent that he didn't also say to his opponent. <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> 00:04, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I said was not entirely correct: the idea of a single Antichrist does have pre-medieval, even Biblical, origins, but, since Paul didn't bother with the fine details in his picture of the "son of Perdition", nearly all the finer points of the legend came later, from interpretation of Daniel, Revelation, and various apocrypha -- especially Pseudo-Methodius and the book of Enoch. --<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> 03:34, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This subject is really about two vastly different things: one in theology, and another in the tabloids. If editors don't want to see the theological meaning removed, they will have to do their homework and cite sources. The pop-culture topic is so much better known, that the student's version will sound false, and will be deleted. <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> 20:42 23 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps this article should mention the relationship between the Antichrist and Al-Dajjal.</p>
<p><a name="Nero_as_the_.22beast.22" id="Nero_as_the_.22beast.22"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nero as the "beast"</span></h2>
<p>This is a far more mundane answer to the question and probably of far less dramatic value, but for anyone who takes a serious, critical look at the book of revelation itself, they will find it to be nothing more than a coded message for the early church. I suggest everyone read F. Engels critical analysis of the text (<a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/religion/book-revelations.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/religion/book-revelations.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/religion/book-revelations.htm</a>). You will find an interesting study of the Hebrew translation of the name Nero, which comes out to 666 (Hebrew has been adapted to have a number correspond to each letter as in Latin). Simply speaking, the writer known to us as "John" feared that after Nero's death he would return to further attack the early Christian church. Needless to say this did not happen. I reproduce here Engels work with the Hebrew of Nero:</p>
<p>"About 300 years before our era the Jews began to use their letters as symbols for numbers. The speculative Rabbis saw in this a new method for mystic interpretation or cabbala. Secret words were expressed by the figure produced by the addition of the numerical values of the letters contained in them. This new science they called gematriah, geometry. Now this science is applied here by our “John.” We have to prove (1) that the number contains the name of a man, and that man is Nero; and (2) that the solution given holds good for the reading 666 as well as for the equally old reading 616. We take Hebrew letters and their values —</p>
<p>ב (nun) n= 50 ק (keph) k = 100 ר (resh) r = 200 פ (samech) s= 60 ן (van) for o = 6 ר (resh) r = 200 נ (nun) n= 50</p>
<p><br />
"Neron Kesar, the Emperor Neron, Greek Nêron Kaisar. Now, if instead of the Greek spelling, we transfer the Latin Nero Caesar into Hebrew characters, the nun at the end of Neron disappears, and with it the value of fifty. That brings us to the other old reading of 616, and thus the proof is as perfect as can be desired. [The above spelling of the name, both with and without the second nun, is the one which occurs in the Talmud, and is therefore authentic.]"</p>
<p>Much less interesting than Arnold Shwarzawhatever, Bill Gates, Adolf Hitler, or George Bush, but I'm afraid it's far more realistic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Samech is actually ס, but Wikipedia has problems with Hebrew. Feel free to make this change; I feel that the whole "identifications of the antichrist" needs drastic reassessment. This is trite on Wikipedia, but when I have more time, I'm going to give it a good scouring. <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Be bold</a>!--<a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgreenbe_c499.html" title="User:Mgreenbe">Mgreenbe</a> 21:42, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Numerology of Kotan or Kot(h)an Muhammad's birth name</span></h2>
<p>I'd be interested in a Hebrew numerological evaluation, of the name "Kotan" or "Kothan" which some historical scholars say was the name Muhammad's birth mother gave him before orphaning him and farming him out to his relatives. Later, his grandparents, who raised him changed his name to "Muhammad" it is claimed.(varaiations I've noted of Muhammad include Mohammad, Muhammed, Mohamed, Ahmed, Mohamad, Muhamed, etc.)</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if a 666 was found or even a 616 (I've even heard 636 claimed for the moniker of the anti-Christ.</p>
<p>The scholarship I've read says anti-Christ means instead of Christ which, at least to a Christian makes perfect sense.</p>

<dd>This is understood to mean that the antichrist will be a leader who deceives many people.

<p>I moved this article back to [[Category:Christianity]] instead of [[Category:Christian mythology]]. As the article in chief on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_mythology.html" title="Christian mythology">Christian mythology</a> makes clear, that topic is for legendary tales that supplement or illustrate Christian teaching and history; the history contained in the Bible is not "Christian mythology," howevermuch it may seem so to non-Christians. The existence or future existence of an Antichrist or Beast, by contrast, is affirmed in the Bible itself. As such, it belongs with Christianity rather than Christian mythology. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:21, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

How can an evildoer be an anti-Christ if all of these evildoers do not believe in God or the existence of God? Scripture clearly identifies the fact that the anti-Christ/Satan (formerly archangel Lucifer) acknowledges the existence of God and has since the beginning of man put forth great effort to undermine God's creation.... furthermore, demons (servants of the anti-Christ) have been mentioned in the Holy Bible fearing Jesus, Son of God.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">John Paul II due for demonic resurrection?</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>The 'Rising' or 'coming out' of the Antichrist allows the identifying by all persons of who the Antichrist is by his Bibilcally predicted death and resurrection the same as Christ after three days of being clearly dead. This Antichrist who rises from the dead (as Christ)is not the same person who died but a demonized person full of apparently miraculous power as Christ. Candidates for such "rising" would be Pope John Paul II dying 2:37 EST April 2 and rising 2:37 EST april 5. (Again understanding that the "thing" arising is the Antichrist and not saintly John Paul II, but his demonized body.)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article deficiencies</span></h2>
<p>There are two points of view that I don't find adequately represented in this article. Just adding my thoughts here; I may come back and make the edits, or someone may be able to adapt what I write here on the talk page and insert it.</p>
<p>I just added a link to bible.ca that expresses the view that there is no such person as "the Antichrist." Instead, arguing from passages such as the one that mentions that there are already "antichrists" in the world (in the first century CE) and from passages that say the one who denies Christ is the antichrist, they assert that antichrist means anyone opposed to Christ. This is more or less expressed in the article in the "Antichrist in the New Testament" section, but I feel like the leader is left with the impression that nobody believes that today. It might be helpful to explicitly say that there are those who do not believe that Antichrist is linked with other phrases in the Bible, such as the "man of sin and son of perdition" or with prophecies in Daniel, etc..</p>
<p>The other point of view is very significant historically. However, it is also quite inflammatory. This is the view that the Pope, in general, is the Antichrist. The article does mention that specific popes have had this accusation levelled at them, but this view refers to the office itself and all of its occupants throughout history rather than any specific Pope. I've heard it asserted that since the Bible says the man of sin and son of perdition will be destroyed with the brightness of Christ's coming and since it also says that Antichrists were getting started in the first century that this refers to the development of the church hierarchy culminating in the papacy. Believers of this view believe that hierarchy is completely foreign to the church autonomy they perceive in the New Testament. They would say that in John's day (the last apostle, at the close of the first century) that churches were beginning to go into the "great <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a>" and that one development was the beginnings of this hierarchy. They believe John identifies those participating as the "many antichrists," but still believe he referred to a singular antichrist coming, the Pope. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 14:18, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Picking up on this point - Stephen Baring-Gould, in his "Curious Myths of the Middle Ages" pub Longman, Green and Co 1894, provides pretty good coverage of the Antichrist and then goes on to deal with the links with the legend of Pope Joan who, according to some versions, gave birth to the Antichrist. The Devil is quoted as chanting, while hovering around the birth, the following verse: "Papa pater patrum, Papissae pandito partum / Et tibi tunc eadem de corpore quando recedam!". Baring-Gould comments that, since these lines are perhaps the only ones known to be of diabolical composition, they are deserving of preservation.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Identity</span></h2>
<p>When most Christians read of the "man of sin", the antichrist, most automatically think of a <i>flesh</i> man.</p>
<p>But <i>angels</i> have been called men (<b>Gen. 18:2,</b> three men, Elohim and two angels called men, but called angels <b>19:1, 15</b>. Compare <b>John 20:12</b> with <b>Luke 24:4</b>)</p>
<p>God is a "man" (Heb. <i>ish</i>) of war (<b>Exo. 15:3</b>).</p>
<p>Lucifer is called a "man" (Heb. <i>ish</i>) in <b>Isa. 14:16</b>.</p>
<p>"Gabriel" means "man of God", and the archangel is called a man in <b>Dan. 9:21.</b></p>
<p>Satan was sentenced to death in <b>Ezek. 28;</b> he was sentenced to perdition. That makes him the son of perdition.</p>
<p>(<b>Rev 12:9</b>) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>
<p>We have Average Joe Christian. One day he looks up, and sees the most beautiful cherub God ever created descending with <i>two-hundred million angels</i> (<b>Rev. 9:16; 12:7-10</b>).</p>
<p>What will he think?</p>
<p>Will he say to himself, "Ah! The adversary is here!"</p>
<p>Or will he sing out load, "Halleluiah, Christ has returned!"</p>
<p>This is why the Harlot declares, "I sit a queen, and am no widow" (<b>Rev. 18:7</b>), and why those that "kill" the elect will believe they are doing <i>God</i> service (<b>John 16:2</b>), not <i>Satan.</i></p>
<p>The devil has his own supernatural body that he is quite proud of (<b>Ezek. 28</b>). And he would never allow anybody else to do what he aspires to do, be God (<b>Isa. 14</b>). And NOWHERE is it written that he shall enter into a flesh body as antichrist.</p>

<p>"Adventist Dude" wrote: <i>Since you are drawing your educated assumption from different symbols of the antichrist, please tell me how Satan has seven heads, ten horns, and bear's feet</i>.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll give this a shot. (But note that I do not claim to be a Bible scholar or exegete. Just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill lay Bible expert.) The passage in Revelation does not indicate that Satan himself has those "seven heads, ten horns, and bear's feet", but that a human organization/government which effectively embodies/models his <i>spirit</i> and will does, though the animal characteristics used in the description are not intended literally. There are several possible "symbolic systems" which could be reasonably applied to them, and I personally prefer the following such "system": the "seven heads" represent (apparently) seven "kings"/leaders, representing their respective nations, which, in my opinion, claim a particular blasphemous relationship to Christ (specifically, it is my opinion [which could be wrong] that this "blasphemy" would be that they would claim to be physical descendants of Jesus through Mary Magdalene [the "Merovingian Heresy", currently widely popularized via Dan Brown's book, "The Da Vinci Code", and the movie by the same name]); the "ten horns" represent (apparently) those seven "kings"/leaders and their nations together with three other leaders and <i>their</i> respective nations, acting as a "unit" (the "ten horns" of the 4th beast mentioned in Daniel 7), though these latter three leaders would apparently <i>not</i> claim the "Merovingian Heresy" regarding themselves; the "bear's feet" would apparently refer to some aspect of the "seven head"/"ten horn" unitary entity (the Beast) having a relationship to the Medo-Persian Empire (the second beast of Daniel 7, described as a bear, or like a bear) - the symbolism of "feet" might refer to mobility (fast, like a bear, but somewhat ungainly and awkward), or to ferociousness and power in attack (the swipe of a bear's paw can crush the skull of a bull, from what I've read on the Internet [Wikipedia?]), or perhaps both (perhaps it even implies that this Beast derives its mobility and/or power from modern nations having a relationship to ancient Medo-Persia [Iran, etc.]).</p>
<p>Anyway, there it is. Not necessarily the correct interpretation, but possibly, thus showing that the symbolism can be reasonably and coherently applied.</p>

The confusion that reigns in this article is immense.</p>
<p>I would like to make a major revision of the portion "The expected role of the Antichrist" wherein I will distinguish the individual, Biblically named as "The Man of Sin" (ASV), from the plural antichrists which prefigure his eventual embodiment.</p>
<p>To identify or surmise that contemporary individuals contemporary or past as THE AntiChrist seems to be foolishness, in the Biblical sense, for if there actually IS such an individual who is identifiable, he would lop your head off if you do not proclaim him to be God Almighty, never allow even this WikiPedia to name him as the man of sin!</p>
<p>As for some of the edits, including the one immediately below, I think they lack subtlety, courtesy, or both.</p>
<p>The person who cites 1967, for instance, is likely to be basing his judgment not on the declaration of the state of Israel, but on its possession and control of Jerusalem, which occurred in 1967.

<dd>Welcome. This is one of those pages were editors tend to want to see some scholarly cite for any major revisions. For example, you may have a concept about the Antichrist lopping off heads, but it is a well-established fact that certain Christians have been claiming to know the identity of the Antichrist for many centuries. So your text in this case would be "original research" and is not going to be seen as appropriate as an editorial addition. Hal Lindsey dated the start of the apocalyptic clock to the founding of Israel, not 1967.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Antichrist</span></h2>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is, of course, the Antichrist. It's pretty obvious after you really take the time to study his life. Most people think of him as a big, dumb, joker who's fairly innocent and just out to have a good time. Please. Have you ever heard him speak in German? He doesn't sound so funny then. In fact, he sounds downright scary. The guy was born within one year of Israel becoming a nation again (one of the most important fulfilled prophecies of the Bible indicating the world is entering the End Times). He was born on the hottest day of the hottest month of the hottest year every recorded in Austria. He was born in the same country that spawned Hitler. He has rapidly risen to great heights of power. He's succeeded in everything he has attempted, as if his life is somehow charmed. The name Arnold Schwarzenegger can be broken down into a base form of ARNOLD SCHWARZ-NEGER. Which literally means; 'Strong Black Black'. It also consists of 18 characters (or 6-6-6). T4 stands for Tiergarten Strasse Number 4, the address of the organization the developed and implemented gas chambers in German concentration camps. ‘T4’ was widely known about in NAZI Germany, and it is incomprehensible that Arnold would not only associate himself with the acronyms T2 and T3… but also use them to make money. So we've had T1, T2, and T3... what is NEXT? I could go on, and on and on and on. Things like Arnold saying, "I've never wanted to be famous for hundreds of years but for thousands of years... like Jesus." You get the picture. Now just remember one thing. Arnold in his present state may not be the Antichrist yet. The Antichrist (Satan inside of and controlling a resurrected leader that was apparently assassinated) will not reveal himself until his human host has been wounded in the head and dies, or seems to die. So Arnold may just be a self centered Nazi creep with dreams of world domination at this point. He may need to be killed before transforming into the true Antichrist. Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase, "I'll be back." doesn't it? P.S. Did you realize that Arnold has been crucified at least twice in his movies ('Conan the Barbarian' and 'End of Days')? Yeah. What are the odds.</p>

<p><b>Why do you remove Hans Atrott's exposition from the list of external links?</b></p>
<p>I agree that most contributions on this site are more tabloid articles. Most Christians wage war on their fellow Christians by accusing the other one to be the anti-Christ. It is ridiculous to call Bush or Schwarzenegger the "anti-Christ". I agree that Bush is a dangerous brute but calling him the "anti-Christ" is nothing but slandering him. Presumably, hereby some Christians want to talk themselves into believing that Christians do not commit crimes and abomination. Bush and others try to being Christians like any other Christian. Hence, I do not understand why you remove Hans Atrott's <i>Jesus mon(k)ey-Christ versus anti-Christ on <a href="http://wwww.bare-jesus.net/e007.htm" class="external free" title="http://wwww.bare-jesus.net/e007.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwww.bare-jesus.net/e007.htm</a></i> from the list of external links. German philosopher Atrott (born in 1944) wrote the best treatise on the anti-Christ since his German colleague Nietzsche (1844-1900). Though it seems to be a harsh treatise, it matches the demands of scientific arguing. Atrott is very close to German philosopher Nietzsche and develops his arguing. The language of the latter on Christianity and Christians is not less harsh than one of Nietzsche. The anti-Christ is no jolly good fellow to Christians! Therefore, if you remove German philosopher Atrott from this list you also can expel German philosopher Nietzsche from here. Last not least the anti-Christ is no jolly good fellow but a very tough one with a though language. If you are afraid of the anti-Christ or if you do not want to speak about him, you shall finish this site. Listing Atrott considerably will improve the poor level of this website. Do you fight already the anti-Christ in Wikipedia by removing him?</p>

<p>Wikipedia is purportedly attempting to collect and make available the vast of human knowledge. Echoing the above sentiments, it's dangerous to call Bush or Schwarzenegger or even Hitler the anti-Christ. In doing so, the person or persons making these egregious claims is doing nothing to educate those about this religious figure, but instead is providing a slanderous, opinionated count of what they believe. As such, it's pretty clear that if everyone were to include their opinion in every article they create, Wikipedia would no longer be an encyclopedia, but rather a blog. Now, who wants that?</p>

<p>This section is definitely not "neutral" -- it argues that the Papacy <i>must</i> be the antichrist. I'm not currently clever enough to figure out how to rephase it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtually all of the early Protestant Reformers identified the Roman Papacy as Antichrist... Only recently due to such theories as the Secret Rapture, pre-tribulation rapture and other relatively new teachings has the identification been overlooked.</p>

<p>The Bible clearly states the actions of the Antichrist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel 7:25 says, "He will... try to change the set times and laws" (Which the Pope has done). The papacy changed the Seventh Day Sabbath (Saturday)to the first day (Sunday), creating a false day of rest. The papacy also changed the time a new day starts from the Biblical sunset to a false time (Midnight). The Pope has had influence on all modern calendars and all calendars of the past.</li>
<li>Throughout history, Rome has persecuted Protestants for proclaiming the truth. Daniel 7:21 says, "As I watched, this horn {AKA the Antichrist} was waging war on the saints". History has recorded and Pope John Paul II verified that over 100,000,000 martyrdroms have been performed by the Roman Catholic church. A true institution of Christ would not have murdered opposition, but tolerated them, as Christ did.</li>
<li>According to the Bible, the number 666 is the mark of the beast. The beast will control a man, and his name shall equal 666. The latin term for the Pope is <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> which means "Vicar {replacement}of the Son of God". These letters are also inscribed in the Pope's miter that he wears on his head. The funny thing about the Latin alphabet is that their letters are also their numbers. A grand total of the letters is <b>equivalent to 666</b></li>
<li>"There I saw a woman {representing a church} sitting on a scarlet beast {representing a nation}that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads {representing 7 mountains} and ten horns." -Revelation 17:3. This prophecy tells that a church upon a nation, sitting upon seven hills, will be the Antichrist. The Vatican is the center of the catholic <b>church</b>, and also the world's smallest <b>nation</b>, nestled in the city of Rome (called the <b>City on Seven Hills</b>)Rome rests upon seven hills.</li>
<li>Revelation 17:3 says that the beast is covered with blasphemous names. The Pope is referred to as many titles, such as Lord God the Pope, Vicarius Filii Dei (replacement of the Son of God), and His Holiness. Are these not blasphemous names? Blasphemy is claiming to be God or claiming the right to forgive man's sin as God does. The Catholic Church practices confession, meaning that they claim the right to forgive man's sin.</li>

<p>Mr. Cullen -- I couldn't read your contribution until I did an "edit page" -- the formatting you chose left everything in a fixed-width font that extended off the right side of the page.</p>
<p>It's not hard to find a Web page that quotes from Protestant founders saying the Pope is the Antichrist, e.g. <a href="http://www.historicist.com/articles2/delusion.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historicist.com/articles2/delusion.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>; that much belongs on this page, ISTM.

I originally wanted to think out a minimalist change but now believe a more major one is needed -- the proof should be by way of an offsite link, e.g. the one Mr. Cullen provides.

<p>Whether you deny the idea or not is immaterial. The view was virtually universal in Protestantism until about 100 years ago, and even a young kid popping zits in college could figure that out if he wasn't too busy finding clever ways to stick hieroglyphics into articles in order to impress himself. The purpose of external links is to allow the one doing research to determine if something is "meaty" or not.

<p>The point is, in matters of faith, it really doesn't matter what you think or whether you are convinced. It is entirely deceptive to say that "some" Protestants considered the Pope the Antichrist. With very, very few exceptions, the Protestant confessions of faith declare the Papacy as the Antichrist. Take the time to read the Westminster Confession:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>25.6. There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ: nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is that Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition, that exalts himself in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and the London Baptist Confession:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>26.4. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the church, in whom, by the appointment of the Father, all power for the calling, institution, order or government of the church, is invested in a supreme and sovereign manner; neither can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof, but is that antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the church against Christ, and all that is called God; whom the Lord shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.</i></dd>

<p>Protestants (or any people) shouldn't be caused to go bow the knee to some young college kid to have their position listed in what is clearly labeled EXTERNAL links. The subject is whether or not the Papacy was considered the Antichrist by the bulk of Protestantism, and factually it is true. Now one of the links you dismissed as irrelevent and "not meaty" is The Doctrine of the Papal Antichrist <a href="http://lazarusunbound.com/bunkp_doctrineantichrist.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://lazarusunbound.com/bunkp_doctrineantichrist.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which is part of a 3 part series. That link is full of references to Protestant works and quotes freely from both the accepted Protestant professions of faith, and from historical documents.

<p>It is merely your opinion that the links were indiscriminate, because the title "External Links" is used on many thousands of wiki articles and those don't seem to be "indiscriminately" deleted by people with an agenda. The topic <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> has some 40 External Links which don't seem to be attacked by you and JzG. The topic <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> has an "External Links" section that links directly to the Vatican. The term "indiscrinate" can be applied to the editing by yourself and the other user, and not to the links which were posted on this article. My point is that when any article becomes the private fiefdom of a select few with agendas, then everyone loses.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is there some reason why my edit, with a link to a page quoting many Reformation founders, was inadequate? I have no anti-theist agenda -- I'm a 51 year old Protestant (who would claim to be "born again" except for the fact that it wasn't part of the church vocabulary I grew up with) -- but I accept the "neutral point of view" agenda of Wikipedia. To be "neutral" there'd have to be a Catholic refutation, not a reference to the Futurist approach written by a Protestant. And probably another one by a Protestant I found on the Internet who analyses the Antichrist as Islam.</dd>
<dd>Mgreenbe's age and religion have no bearing on whether his arguments are correct; the reference to a "college kid" is a pure <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.alex.lamb_aa8c.html" title="User:David.alex.lamb">David.alex.lamb</a> 05:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see where anyone has advocated editing out Roman Catholic links, so if Catholics want to put external links to their materials - then they should, but that is really not the point. I have shown that there has been extreme measures taken to make this article unlike the other religious articles on Wiki (note the number of external links that I mentioned that are on the Judaism or Catholicism articles. Somehow, an agreement was made between a very few with agendas that those links were inappropriate here. And yes, your edit with a link to a page quoting from the Reformers was inadequate and let me tell you why... because the Protestant position on the identification of the Antichrist was an extremely important historical fact. It codified the difference and separation between the two belief systems, and brought about the Counter-Reformation. The attempt here by MGreen and others to edit this little tidbit out of history (ex. "Sure, SOME of the Protestants believed that", when in fact it was the uniform position in all the Protestant statements of faith at the time) has been duly noted. Now the "neutral" stance is all we are asking for. The uniform Protestant view at the time should be stated clearly and succinctly, and the Catholics should have every opportunity to place their own position and links on here. The two positions, heretofor have been misrepresented. The Protestant position is: IS TOO. The Catholic position is: IS NOT. So by deleting the "Is Too" information and proofs, we are not reaching "neutrality". That is like saying you can delete all the witnesses for the prosecution and still have a "neutral" trial. Now this information is important because the body count over this issue is in the order of more than ten times the deaths in the holocaust. That little piece of history ought not be swept under the rug. Are argument isn't "use Wikipedia to prove the Papal Antichrist", our argument is "Let's allow external links just like every other religious article on Wikipedia and not select a primary element of historic Protestantism in order to eradicate the traces of it from the minds of truth seekers.208.21.169.86 04:56, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please tone it down -- you'll convince people more easily if they don't have to wade through a lot of vituperation. It seems to me the remaining questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the current article adequately represent the Reformers' positions according to the anonymous angry person?</li>
<li>Is the Bunker citation the best? It doesn't have to be replaced, necessarily, but it would be better to have something that is more easily recognized as authoritative. A book with an ISBN would let people order it, or find it in nearby libraries.</li>
<li>Is there too much stuff, which should be moved to other pages? For example, dispensationalism has its own article; should some other segments, also, be separate?</li>
<li>It would be better if Sallman had a first name; what is it?</li>

<li>I believe that Reformers position is now properly portrayed.</li>
<li>Is the citation "the best"? Isn't that a bit subjective? A while ago we were having to campaign to have the Reformed position even accurately reflected or mentioned at all, now there is a concern about a subjective view of what is best? The book cited DOES have an ISBN which is listed in the Reference section with its ISBN.</li>

<li>The "too much stuff" argument is what started the hatchet job that was originally done on the article. I am confused as to why the fact that Dispensationalism has its own article would mean that it shouldn't be mentioned here, since it is so intrinsically important to the modernist view on the Antichrist. Virtually every article on wiki mentions some link or bit of information that is mentioned elsewhere. Would we consider removing all talk of Watergate from the Richard Nixon article just because there is a separate article on Watergate?</li>

Towards furthering a more complete article, I include here a link to an article describing an opinion regarding King Juan Carlos as a likely candidate for "Antichrist" (I point out that I myself am the author of the article [through the portion which reads, "I, personally, believe that he is"], but that the link was created by someone having no connection to me): <a href="http://vaulterjohn.tripod.com/King_Juan_Carlos.htm" class="external free" title="http://vaulterjohn.tripod.com/King_Juan_Carlos.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vaulterjohn.tripod.com/King_Juan_Carlos.htm</a> .</p>
<p>I added a brief reference in the Contemporary Identifications section to document that the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), which is one of the three major Lutheran synods in the U.S. issued a formal written statement that named the Pope as the Anti-Christ <a href="http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=795&amp;contentID=4441&amp;shortcutID=5297" class="external text" title="http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=795&amp;contentID=4441&amp;shortcutID=5297" rel="nofollow">"STATEMENT ON THE ANTICHRIST"</a>. "...we reaffirm the statement of the Lutheran Confessions, that “the Pope is the very Antichrist”." I documented this with a link to their statement on the WELS website. Despite this, the addition to the article was removed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vary" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vary" rel="nofollow">"Vary"</a>, who commented that "it's clear from the reference that they were not using the sense of the term that is discussed here)". It is clear to me at least that it is exactly the sense that they were using it. As it stands now, there is no documentation in the article that a major contemporary group has formally named the Pope as the Anti-Christ. I intend to re-introduce the reference to the article, but will give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vary" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vary" rel="nofollow">"Vary"</a>, and others a chance to comment here first.

<dd>A few minutes of searching found this Q&amp;A on the WELS website. Q: I have been reading several questions regarding the Pope and the Antichrist. Does this mean the new pope "IS" the Antichrist or that the Catholic church and a future pope may be the antichrist? Where would I find this information in the Bible? A: <b>It means that the pope is the Antichrist now, not just in the future.</b><a href="http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuItem_itemID=8929&amp;cuTopic_topicID=20" class="external text" title="http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuItem_itemID=8929&amp;cuTopic_topicID=20" rel="nofollow">"...the pope is the Antichrist now, not just in the future..."</a> This is explained in our statement concerning the Antichrist." This is a significant contemporary group who formally state this. It should be mentioned in the article. Repentance 16:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>more research...</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Wikipedia article states "Therefore, antichrist means opposed to Christ by being in the place of Christ." The WELS statement includes the justification "...the Pope put himself in the place of Christ..." and "...the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ...". WELS further explains on their website that "It means that the pope is the Antichrist now, not just in the future.". The WELS website claims 400,000 members. This is probably the most significant example of Contemporary Identifications of the Antichrist documented. It should be included in the Wikipedia article. Let us work together to present it in an accurate manner. Repentance 18:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I highly doubt its the pope. Firstly, the antichrist is not, as many people take him to be, opposite in a visual sense. Infact how can he be opposite when he's meant to be a deceiver. Wont that be a little too obvious for people to notice? There is biblical reference to that assumption when in genesis(when Jacob was blessing his kids). Hes refered to as the lions whip(possibly a Jew from the tribe of Dan), This is exactly how Jesus was referred to in the book of "Daniel?". This shows that by physical characteristics e.g. approach(he will declare he is God) the antichrist should appear similar to him. Many will argue that this is what makes the pope the antichrist but it is what makes him not. If the position of the pope is revised, he is to be the physical representative of Christ i.e. the image of christ on earth. He is the guide of the church. This fact is proved by Peter himself when he was kept incharge of the early church when christ ascended into heaven. Peter was the first pope, he led decision making and was the unifying factor in the church. In short was to rep. Christ on earth. The protestant churches have denied this and instead called him the pope, but that means that Peter was an Antichrist? However if the pope is to be Christs representative on earth then ofcourse he should resemble the antichrist. However, the difference is that the purpose will be different. However,because the pope is not the antichrist himself then not all Christ qualities are his (physical), so not all antichrist qualities are his and this is proved e.g. Vicarius filii Deiis not the popes title but its Vicarius Christii. If the antichrist is supposed to deceive by that image then it means that those against the pope will be immedeately drawn to the antichrist immedeately he surfaces</p>

<p>Matthew 23:15.</p>
<p>Saul (Paul) of Tarsus is not the Antichrist, he is the Antichrist’s false prophet, the second beast who was servant to the first beast and extended its authority everywhere, making the world and all its people worship the first beast (Risen Christ) that had the fatal wound that had been healed.</p>
<p>“Beware of false prophets who come to you disguised as sheep but underneath are ravenous wolves. You will be able to tell them by their fruits. Can people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? In the same way, a sound tree produces good fruit but a rotten tree bad fruit. A sound tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a rotten tree bear good fruit. Any tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown on the fire. I repeat, you will be able to tell them by their fruits. It is not those that say to me ‘Lord, Lord,’ who will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the person who does the will of my Father in heaven. When that day comes many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, cast out demons in your name, work many miracles in your name?’ Then I shall tell them to their faces: I have never known you; away from me, you evil men!” Mathew 7:15-23 ````John````<a href="http://john3-19.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://john3-19.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://john3-19.blogspot.com/</a></p>

We are writing an encyclopedia, not trying to impress other editors with our glib denunciations of a page that has obvious problems. It would have taken you 30 seconds to fix the page. So I fixed it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Could it be?</span></h2>
<p>I came here looking for info about the concept because Nostradamus is said to have predicted the third antichrist arriving in the near future. With things heating up in the Middle East, Nostradamus could be right. So I am reading all this stuff here and I need to know if I am the antichrist. The following is true, I promise you.</p>
<p>I am Hebrew. I am a member of the Kohainim, direct descendents of Aaron. I believe I was born at exactly the same time that Israel became a sovereign state. My full given English name is first, middle, last, each 6 letters. My Hebrew name means life and is equivalent to #18 (6+6+6). I have been clinically dead three times (toxic chemical levels in my blood twice and open-heart surgery).</p>
<p>The only problem with all this is that I am an ordinary nice person. You would not know me if I met you and kicked you in the shin.</p>
<p>Perhaps by reading this page and writing my story things will change. Who knows?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Daniel Quinn / B</span></h2>
<p>Daniel Quinn described in his book "The Story of B" an interesting idea of who the Antichrist is. Basicly it's based on John's statements. To make it short: according to Daniel Quinn the Antichrist is or are those, who love the world. Like John said that those, who love the world, don't have the love to God in them. Daniel Quinn also says that the Antichrist is more like an anti-saviour. If you wish, I could write something about all these ideas on the mainpage here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Emperor Nero</span></h2>
<p>It seems that scholars generally agree that the antichrist was the Roman Emperor Nero. It looks like this article doesn't take that well into account, and there isn't balance between the schools of thought that think that the Revelation account was about history versus those who think that Revelation is about the future. I'd put it in myself, but I really just don't know enough details to really contribute anything good. By the way, the name Nero does have some correspondence to the 666. J.J.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AntiChrist</span></h2>
<p>Antichrist is an exclusively Christian concept. One might argue for its inclusion into an article relating it to the Jewish faith; as many of the prophetic citations come from the Hebrew scriptures, but the Muslim concept of Dajjal, is exclusive to that faith. No christian would recognise the Dajjal figure as the Antichrist, as it is not part of any Christian canon. In addition, the muslim concept of the Madhi is not the same as the Christian messiah, as muslims do not accept that Jesus is the Messiah, ergo: they are not the same embodiment, as christians believe Jesus is the sole embodiment of the Messiah. The Muslim concept should be included under the Islam heading as it is specific to that religion.</p>

<p>The name I've heard the most (by far) as the contemporary anti-Christ is Bill Gates (including a 666 numerology for his name). It may not be a serious claim, but others in the article are (hopefully) not serious either. Why was the mention of him deleted? At present there is <i>no reference</i> to him at all in the article (though a whole section is devoted to "Contemporary identifications," and George Bush supposedly merits mention in the introduction. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 05:58, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
