<p>Wikipedia is very serious with the copyright issue. Please read carefully <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">wikipedia:Copyrights</a> abut image usage. You cannot put copyright tags on images arbitrarily. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:41, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You people are completely impossible. First you bitch about copyrights, then when I put them on you bitch some more. None of which in that link applies to these images, so I did the only thing that was allotted to me. Seriously, get over it. If you have a problem with the way i copyright it; help copyright it for me.</p>
<p>I cannot copyright them for you, whatever you mean. First, only the owner of the image can determine its copyright. When you take an image from somewhere, you must check what is the copyright. If it is unknown, this means you have no right to use it. Plain and simple. Since I don't know where you took images from, I cannot help you.</p>
<p>The second thing, you msut always indicate the source of the image.</p>
<p>Previously wikipedia was pretty lax with images. Now hundreds of people are working and cleaning up the mess. Please don't increase it. Just read the rules, as I said. If something is unclear, please ask a question. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:49, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The images I upload are constrcuted from many different images; all of which are freely distributed on search engines. Most search engines I know of do not distibute copyrighted images that can't be used, since it would make no sense to do so. Therefore it's likely that all these images are copyrighted but free for distribution. Hence most of my tags are right.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The search engine do not "distribute" anything. It just points to webpages. Or are you speaking about something else? If a webpage doe not give a copyright notice, then you don't have a right to take the image. You can take only what is allowed <b>by the owner</b>. If you don't know whether the owner allows you to take it, this means you <b>cannot</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 02:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting many images in lists slows down page loading enormously.</p>
<p>Please take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_illuminated_manuscripts.html" title="List of illuminated manuscripts">List of illuminated manuscripts</a> and Gallery of illuminated manuscript images for a proper way of doing this. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:48, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's no way I'm letting you delete all that just because some people's computers can't handle it. Look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Austrians_d8a4.html" title="List of Austrians">List of Austrians</a></p>
<p>there is no way we will allow you to behave in this noncooperative way.

<p>There's no reason not to include what I have editted, as many other lists have it. I don't go and en masse revert your major edits. Criticism without reason creates noncooperation. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 01:41, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I am not suggesting you to delete "that". I am suggesting you a proper way to organize things, so that even these "some people" will be happy. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:44, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then I'll make the images very small like they have on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Austrians_d8a4.html" title="List of Austrians">list of Austrians</a>. Is that fine?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your posts. It is very easy: just type four tildas: ~~~~, it will generate your sig.</dd>
<dd>Ideally every person in the list deserves an image. If you do this, the list will become unreadable and unusable.</dd>
<dd>I just posted the comment at the talk page with the same suggestion.</dd>
<dd>Please take a look at Gallery of illuminated manuscript images.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you don't want a separate gallery article, see how it is done in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_billionaires.html" title="List of billionaires">List of billionaires</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:57, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is wrong with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Austrians_d8a4.html" title="List of Austrians">list of Austrians</a>? It makes no sense to do it in the way the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_billionaires_%282005%29.html" title="List of billionaires (2005)">list of billionaires (2005)</a> page does it, and making a separate gallery is pointless since most of these images are already on the individual person's page. If I just make the images really small it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p><b>Please sigh your posts</b>. It makes sense, because it creates less mess. However small you make the image, you cahnot have an image for every line. People stare adding more pics, and the text will become very difficult to track. Just make an experiment: cut and paste the same image for every line in a section and hit the preview button. I doubt that you will be happy with what you see. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 02:05, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nearly all admins from sr: wiki elect Image:Srbi.jpg to be on article <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>. I don't see what you have about that image? What to mix.

<p>It is a horrible representation of Serbs. Putting Vlade Divac, a minor basketball player, on a list with men who don't even parallel his career in any way shape or form is just plain ridiculous. I did comment on the sr: village pump and so far no one has responded.</p>

<p>As one of the primary writers of the article on Bosniaks I'd like to inform you that I'm sick and tired of the false and inaccurate changes to the introductory paragraph coming from the likes of you and several anonymous ip adresses (Which, I suspect, are directly related to you as well). Either cease with the vandalism or me and several other users will be forced to take action and bring this issue up to the powers that be. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 23:22, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"Bosniaks are a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic.html" title="Slavic">Slavic</a>-<a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> peoples. No one will contend with that sentence, for it is true. They are a mix of Slavs who converted to Islam and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> peoples who turkified them, with frequent intermarriage due to religious connection. No history book will deny this, yet you seem to."</i></dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Where to begin? First of all, the closely related Croats and Serbs are Slavic-Catholic and Slavic-Orthodox peoples respectively, but their pages don't mention this. The logical conclusion is that pushing religion to the forefront of the Bosniaks article is the result of a clear Serb bias and historical ignorance. Your incoherent babbling about some sort of "Turkification" confirms this (Interestingly enough, today's Serbian ethnic culture is just as, if not more, influenced by the Turkish element. This is clear in linguistics, folk-rituals, dress, etc.). Second of all, "Slavs" are not some ethnic group but a linguistic group, so, by virtue of simply speaking the Bosnian language, modern day Bosniaks are no less Slavic than their ancestors, even if they had "mixed" with non-Slavs. Speaking of which, I don't know what history books you're reading, but all credible modern histories of the region have confirmed by way of Ottoman military census analysis that there was never any significant influx of Muslims from other regions of the Ottoman Empire into Bosnia. In fact, converts from existing non-Muslim peoples, such as Vlachs and Hungarians, were probably far more prominent. Recent genetic studies have reconfirmed this. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 00:20, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Jewish people are a diaspora and ethnicity just like African Americans. If you do not think that African American lists should be deleted then please change your vote on these lists. Arniep 18:19, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thanks for your rude message. Actually it was someone asking me how to contact an administrator. Sorry to bother you. Arniep 18:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I am just upset that these lists are being nominated. The point I was trying to make was it is not right that people are equating jewish lists with lists of other religions as other religions are not an ethnic group or diaspora. Jewish people feel that they are a nationality as they have been rejected and discriminated against by many nations. Also some people argue they are deleting these lists because being Jewish may have little to do with the occupation or achievement, but what has being an actor to with nationality really? I really do not see fair treatment here, in peoples paranoia against anti semitism they are actually being discriminatory themselves. Arniep 19:06, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have noticed that you voted to delete lists such as Jewish publishers, criminals, and bankers, but chose to keep the list of Jews in the Royal Society, and in the National Academy of Engineering. I implore you to reconsider your votes (either staying neutral or voting delete) for the following reasons:</p>
<p>I understand you see that religion may influence a person's work in science, but that is not what is under debate here. Most people want these lists gone because they are the ONLY ones of their kind on all of wikipedia; many of which do not even have primary articles: such as List of Fellows of the Royal Society, or List of Members of the National Academy of Engineering. Whoever started these lists most likely did so because they were not aware of categories, or how selective wikipedia is. The specificity of these lists is what makes them unfit. We cannot end up having these because they would spark a revolution of PCness and listcruft where list of Amish Members of the National Academy, and list of Left-handed Members of the National Academy would arise. Though I agree with you that, sure, religion has an influence on the scientific work a person does, these lists don't reflect that in any way. These votes are getting very personal to some people, whereas they are registering new names just to keep them here. I ask you to please abstain your vote, for it would aid us unimaginably. Thank you for your consideration. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 19:11, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't oppose deletion if the existence of those lists was documented somewhere for easy inclusion when the main lists get written. Until then, I err on the side of caution and vote to keep. Just because the list is not complete in listing Academy or Society members, is not enough reason to delete it. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:37, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>P.S. If you blank your talk page, it's a good idea to note it in the edit summary, so it's easier to check through the history. Personally, I prefer the use of archive pages, but I know not everyone likes those, so I won't push that. However, if you get a lot of messages, it makes looking up old messages a LOT easier. I do recommend it. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:37, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess the real question is, if you knew that -- why didn't you add it? I practically made the entire page for Danes, including much of the statistics, and COULD have used some help, not just criticism. Also, I never said I was right (that's why I put EST next to it - plus being 14,000 off isn't necessarily a tragedy - so I'm sure you can get over it). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 05:52, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, the real question is, why not use three minutes to find the proper numbers directly in the CIA World Fact Book? Claiming my inadequacy to help out with the page doesn't excuse your own errors. I don't care as much for the content on the page as you appearently do, I just care about the sources - citing 20,000 (40% Danes in Greenland), and then be 14,000 off (12% Danes) is a pretty unqualified estimate, without regard of any real numbers. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 15:48, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And also apparently wrong on the US number: it's about twice the official census number. It was first changed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Danish_people&amp;diff=25262413&amp;oldid=24448356" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Danish_people&amp;diff=25262413&amp;oldid=24448356" rel="nofollow">1.4 to 2.5 million</a> by an IP similar to the one you were using before.

<dd>What, now you're investigating me? Jesus Christ people, chill out. US census numbers are almost always grossly underrepresented, especially for old settlers like Danes, Germans, and Brits - many of whom register as American or not at all due to location. If this doesn't come as obvious to both of you then there's a serious problem here. Doubling the number is being plain prude. I originally thought adding a million was enough (hence the 2.5 million change) but later realized that it was being overly cautious (see census report we quarrel about on Germans page), hence 3 million change. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 05:52, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have yet to see WHY you can't find the number - it's rather easy, but since I do want you to see it, I'll guide you through a step by step process:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1) Open link: <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf</a></li>
<li>2) Find Population Statistics on Chart (1990 on left, 2000 on right)</li>
<li>3) Find <i>Germans</i></li>
<li>4) Look at 1990 --- 57 million ---- exactly what I put</li>
<li>5) Look at 2000 --- 43 million</li>
<li>6) Look at population change --- 15 million in 10 years</li>
<li>7) Think - No mass exodus back to Germany - No low birth rate - No possible adimixture that destroys German identity</li>
<li>8) Conclude that best thing to do in this case is keep 1990 census as the 2000 one does not make sense, resulting from a multitude of circumstances - many influencing surveys (as this is what it was)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good enough I hope. Also, please find something better to contribute to Wikipedia than investigating my work. thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 06:09, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I can assure you no one is conspiring against Jewish lists. I don't like lists in general unless they are lists by country, and prefer categories for almost everything else. All I wish to do is clean up all the extra lists that we have and then have a mass categorization of Jewish professions in categories if possible. I will gladly contribute to that as much as I can (though I don't see the need for categories that are TOO specific). I have no problems with lists as indexes, or lists that specify a specific sector of a peoples (like in the case of Jews, Orthodox ones or nonreligiou ones or anything like that). I also have some experience with Judaism as a religion/culture, as my mother was born in the Jewish faith - so it's not like I'm editing things I have little knowledge of (if you see that as a possible problem) <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_historians_02a3.html" title="Category:Jewish historians">Category:Jewish historians</a> you'll be seeing as my next project. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 04:42, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Why the hell would I admit to something that ISN'T true?! There's nothing on wikipedia that says I cannot edit with acquantances and friends - and that is exactly what I've been doing - much in the same way that you edit with some of the user's on the Jewish pages. There is no reason I would be so adamant about my denial of this - for having extra usernames is utterly pointless for me and gives me no advantage over anything! I admit I was rude to some users (but so were they to me), and I admit I was in many edit wars (who isn't?!?!). I am frankly upset at your uncalled for drill of my image uploads though, but that's another story. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 22:00, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for answering. Looking at the image, the given source is just a URL: <a href="http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/sep108/pli/wep.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/sep108/pli/wep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/sep108/pli/wep.htm</a> , which is fine, except that the webpage says at the bottom: "Copyright by AJM &amp; Piotr Marusak". Now, the image looks like a old image, so it may not be in copyright, but just the URL where you found it doesn't show that at all. So more source info is needed; something making it clear <b>why</b> you believe that the image is in the public domain. That's the problem. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 04:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well I doubt the image is copyrighted by the webpage holders - I think they just took it from a book or something since it looks more like an old picture - like you said. Seeing as it can be used in a webpage of the like - it seems no stringent copyright rule may be imposed upon it. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 04:53, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Dzamonja.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<dd>I've investigated that picture, Image:Dzamonja.jpg further and it turns out to be pretty funny, in a sad way.

However, before this could happen, the article, including the picture, was copied by wikiverse, and placed at <a href="http://dusan-dzamonja.wikiverse.org/" class="external text" title="http://dusan-dzamonja.wikiverse.org/" rel="nofollow">this URL</a>.

<p>Lists certainly do have usefulness. Categories are limited to the number of people that can be shown on one page, whereas lists can be scanned easily. Lists allow you to see names in context with descriptions and explanation, categories do not. I hardly see how your "ethnic battling" argument holds ground when you yourself recently created <a href="../../../s/l/o/Category%7ESlovak_inventors_6b98.html" title="Category:Slovak inventors">Category:Slovak inventors</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Category%7ESerbian_inventors_9e67.html" title="Category:Serbian inventors">Category:Serbian inventors</a>. Regards Arniep 20:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't make the categories. Besides, I said before that I AGREE with categories - they are helpful - and I will gladly make one for that list for deletion. What I meant by ethnic battling is that LISTS on the other hand do not have a basis since they are all separate articles - made to explicitly highlight themselves. Categories on the other hand are PART of a larger category. You don't expect that if a list of Jewish inventors survives the Germans, the English, the Catholics won't want to make their own lists and TONS of other peoples with specific adherences?!

<p>Nationmaster is a website mirroring Wikipedia. As for the Factbook - Eurostat, the UN and the Bulgarian national statistics give completely different numbers for the population of Bulgaria as at 2005. So we are going to include five different numbers or what? Third of all, the Factbook does not state the number you keep posting - it is a number which you have calculated yourself. Thank you very much but estimates by Antidote have no place in any article here. It's quite evident you are engaged in trolling and there are many other users who notice that. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 11:55, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Couldn't agree more - yet he still doesn't want to understand. A third of my talk page is full of whining about spiteful assholes trying to dig up "stuff" on him, when he simply has no idea of the RfC process and its purpose.</dd>

<dd>Instead of having a material discussion to determine which numbers and why should be included we are all just wasting time. Personally, I'd prefer most of the diaspora numbers gone - or placed differently. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> aside for a moment, there will always someone claiming that someone somewhere under or overcounted "Ebonians". Besides, the current numbers are like apples and oranges. Several articles include numbers from the German statistical office, which counts people by citizenship, not by ethnicity. Yet we also have US diaspora numbers, where most ethnicities have been largely assimilated. On average only 4-6% of European immigrants and their descendants speak language other then English in the US. Also on average 30% report a mixed ancestry, i.e. they are likely to be doublecounted. <a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbetak_984b.html" title="User:Jbetak">Jbetak</a> 16:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you actually agree with all those very very high numbers <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorbertArthur_ab3b.html" title="User:NorbertArthur">User:NorbertArthur</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a> are putting. They very clearly present themselves to be nationalists and continuously add only the highest numbers from the most random webpage they can find. A million Romanians in Spain and Italy? Those numbers are quite frankly unbelievable -- if there in fact were that many then information on them would be more readily available than just on those webpage and Romanian biased pages. I say we put a tag on the page concerning factual information. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 23:17, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I personally suspect that the numbers are too high, but agree that they are stated by citable sources (at least the US and Italy numbers; offhand I don't think I've followed through on the number for Spain). I was last in Spain in 2002 and Italy (other than changing planes) in 1996, so that if there has been a recent and enormous influx of Romanians, I wouldn't necessarily know. On the other hand, I find it very disingenuous when people use numbers like this to boost the <i>total</i> number of Romanians. Clearly, if there has been a recent and enormous flow of Romanians to Spain and Italy, it has corresponded to an equal reduction of the number elsewhere, mainly in Romania, Moldova and perhaps Ukraine. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:23, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any debate that results in no consensus automatically becomes a keep, unless the closing editor/admin makes an editorial decision to merge and redirect (which always can be undone). So the short and to the point "keep" is an accurate representation of the debate. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 19:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If people only glance at the top of an AfD debate, they really aren't qualified to be discussing the deletion of the article. Even a quick glance would show the article was kept because of lacking consensus. Anyway, I inserted the phrase "no consensus" in the debate already. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 07:12, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
