<p>Can please someone explain the relevance of Polonization to this article. But please do not use the "Polonization was against Orthodox, Russians were Orthodox therefore Polonization was against Russians" kind of logics. I would apprieciate the frank explanation, not ill-formed rhetoric figures. --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 21:56, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, what's wrong with this logic? Nevertheless it is not the case. "Polonization" is mentioned in a very specific context. Please read the sentence carefully: it speaks about conversion to catholicism, and Polonization is a example of such processes. Now, back to the suspected logic. Judging from your name I suspect you are a Pole, and I am surprized of your underestimation of the influence of religion on people's worldview. If ksiądz tells you that russians are heretics, what shall you think? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 08:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here's what's wrong with the above logic: <i>"Russians fought Germany in WW2, Germans were Europeans, therefore Russia was against Europeans"</i>. What I'm concerned about is that mentioning Polonization in this context suggests that there was a policy of Polonization targeted against Russians in medieval Poland. We are not talking about 20th century Polonization policies, are we&#160;? Medieval Catholic Church used Latin, not Polish. I believe this is simply a misunderstanding but if you insist, I would ask to support the Polonization of Russia claims to be supported with some reasonable sources. (I did not understand your remark about ksiądz telling me that Russians are heretics) --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 08:26, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"what's wrong with logic": Exercise: find the difference in logical structures of "Orthodox" and "Germany" examples. My daughter does such brainteasers at school. Also, there was no Polonization of Russia. And if you don't understand what happens with parafia when their ksiądz keeps telling them that Russians are heretics, then you are thoroughly underqualified to discuss the issue. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 10:19, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good, I'm impressed with your intellectual superiority. Now, could you please either explain your theory of medieval Polonization or remove it from the article. It could help the discussion if we both appreciated that we obviously come from different cultural backgrounds and things that seem obvious to you may not be so obvious to me and vice-versa. I'm sure you're aware that showing some minimal respect towards the others would help too. Anyway, are there any sources to support this theory of the influence of early Polonization on Russophobia&#160;? --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 07:32, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The issue is not my superiority. I have my own problems as well. There are sources (are you really claiming that Poles just loved Muskovites, Russians, Soviets? That they longed dolaczyc sie <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Mickiewicz_3265.html" title="Adam Mickiewicz">do przyjaciół Moskali</a>?). BTW, Polonization was not only medieval. The referred artricle is called <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonization.html" title="Polonization">Polonization</a>, not Medieval Polonization; yet another example of your attempts to skew the discussion to suit your goals.

<dd>Mikka, I beg you try to assume my good faith, even if you suspect me of the worst Russophobic intentions. As to whether Poles just loved Russians, obviously not. I think it's been some sort of love-and-hate relationship. An obvious but maybe useful stereotype oversimplification could be that Poles usually loved Russian people and hated Russian goverments. My concern here however is about the way that Polonization is mentioned in the article. No doubt there were different types of Polonization throughout history. We are probably best aware of (or first think of) the 20th century Polonization policies towards national minorities in Poland. The article however says "In the centuries following the East-West Schism of 1054", which suggests it does not refer to 20th century, but earlier times (of course someone could claim that 20th century is one of the centuries following 1054). Are you aware of any forced Polonization of Russians before 20th century&#160;? --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 22:41, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a passage referring to the events in 1836 - from (1911) Encyclopedia Britannica entry on Richard Cobden, referencing period text of "Soon after his return to England he began to prepare another work for the press, which appeared towards the end of 1836, under the title of Russia. It was mainly designed to combat a wild outbreak of Russophobia which, under the inspiration of David Urquhart, was at that time taking possession of the public mind"</p>
<p>The notion that anti-Russian sentiment existed (universal anti-Russian sentiment? any proof thereof? B The entry is on Russophobia, an actual word one can look up in English or French and so on and on dictionary; it is not on anti-Russian sentiment. The idea that existence of a sentiment or abstract conception invalidates human words is laughable. The concept of flight existed for millenia, it existed well before artificial word aviation was coined. Should the entry on aviation be removed even though ancestors might have dreamt flying on tree stumps ages before terms aviation or aeronautics appeared?</p>

<p>The article is not as bad as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonophobia.html" title="Polonophobia">Polonophobia</a> but still has much space left for improvement. Right now it is mostly a compilation of POV demonstating examples and personal theories of individual editors. The topic is of course quite sensitive and would benefit from more stress on facts and less on opinions and judgements. The major general problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of Russophobia in the article is very broad, ranging from dislike of Russians or CIS, through military conflicts to ethnic cleansing; It's quite misleading, unless it's clearly stated which of these is the case in different parts of the article.</li>
<li>It is full of questionable examples, aimed at proving disputable theories</li>

<p>BTW, as to the term <i>Moskal</i>. In 19th century and early 20th century it still was more or less neutral (apart from the fact that anything Russia-related smelled like <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russification.html" title="Russification">Russification</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_Praga_5c69.html" title="Massacre of Praga">massacre of Praga</a> and Muraviov). It simply denoted a person of Russian nationality, as opposed to the term <i>Rossyanie</i>, used to denote Russians by citizenship. It was not until the Polish-Bolshevik War that the term came out of use as a common name for the nation and was replaced by <i>Rosjanie</i>. It's pretty clear in Mickiewicz's poem <i><a href="http://univ.gda.pl/~literat/dziadypo/0017.htm" class="external text" title="http://univ.gda.pl/~literat/dziadypo/0017.htm" rel="nofollow">Do przyjaciół Moskali</a></i> from the Dziady. The exact translation would be <i>To my fellow friends the Russians</i>. Otherwise calling someone a friend and then offending him in the very same line wouldn't have much sense, would it. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 04:02, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mikka, I have no idea what is the purpose of your campaign. Yes, the comment was ironic, yet your own interpretation of a single description of the state of knowledge of Austro-Hungarian actors at the beginning of 20th century seems not enough to draw such a conclusion. As a matter of fact the fear of Russia (as a state, not as a nation or culture, for which there is a lot of love and fascination in Poland even now) did not start in 20th century and the knowledge of Russia was not limited to the actors of Vienna, Lwów or Kraków. There were also several millions of Poles who spent their entire lives in Russian Empire and I doubt their knowledge of the state was as stereotypical as the guy mocks. As to other issues: indeed, I was and I am offended by calling Poles <i>Polacks</i>, as the term is clearly offensive. Which does not mean that I did not accept Ghirlandajo's explanation that he spoke 16th century English rather than modern English and that his comments should be treated as such. Note that calling a Russian "Russian" (Moskal in 19th century context) is quite not the same as calling a Pole "Polack" (in modern context). Also, I'm not bashing the article, I might be pointing at its NPOV or lack of accuracy, but I try to be more specific and not generalize too much. Perhaps such a tactics would do you good as well... <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 08:16, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Will you excuse me... I was extremely specific with my example. And there were "several millions of Poles who spent their entire lives <i>outside</i> Russian Empire and I I am sure their knowledge of the state <i>was as</i> stereotypical as the guy mocks". That you don't like it and therefore you are trying to turn table speaks not very good of you. "Single description" is an example, to demonstrate the stereotype. Do you really want a thousand examples in an encyclopedia article? And I am not "drawing a conclusion", I am presenting a <b>fact</b> of prejudice, published by a notable person. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:43, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All right, I've looked for some research, and found this: Marcin Jóźko, "Stereoptypy narodowe Polaków i Ukraińców" in "Antysemityzm w Polsce i na Ukrainie. Raport z badan.", Warsaw 2004. The article presents the results of several sociologic researches. One of them is relevant to our topic, since it refers to the "stereotype profile of a Russian" in Poland. The research survey of 1992 gives this simple picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive view of Russians: 23.1%,</li>
<li>negative: 26.2%,</li>
<li>neutral: 22.2%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to the "well known facts" you claimed, this presents an overall fairly neutral picture. Here are the basic traits of a Russian in the Polish stereotype, according to another research:</p>
<ul>
<li>alcoholics - 24.9%</li>
<li>friendly, sincere people - 23.7%</li>
<li>not friendly, not sincere - 15.4%</li>
<li>good workers - 13.9%</li>
<li>joyous, optimistic - 10.5%</li>
<li>bad workers, lazy - 9.9%</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this gives a fairly balanced view, and you can see that "friendly" dominates over "unfriedly" and "good workers" dominates over "bad workers". What is disturbing however is that according to the same research of 2002, young Poles have less sympathy towards Russians than the older ones: over 50% (or 60%) have positive attitude towards Russians among people older than 24, but only 41% among those of 24 or younger. The sympathy towards Russians grows naturally with the level of education (56.5% for basic education, and 66.4% for higher education). --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 08:26, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Pochodną takiego stanowiska było dążenie do zatarcia granic dzielących obie religie....Zatem Rosjanie, jako niechrześcijanie, schizmatycy, nie zasługiwali na godne traktowanie, na zrozumienie swojej odmienności - można było ich bezkarnie poniżać i z nimi walczyć. Właśnie na bazie takich rozbieżności kształtował się przez wieki stosunek Polaków do Rosjan - często ze względu na religię, powszechnie uważaną za gorszą, także wschodnich sąsiadów uważano za gorszych"

<dd>Molobo: "Poland wants an independent and strong Ukraine".</dd>
</dl>
<p>The historic experience have shown what Poland really wants. It wants the territory of Ukraine to be Poland, or at least as much of Ukraine as possible. For a starter's review, I can recommend you several articles from 300+ years ago history (PLC, History of UA) and the 20th century history (articles devoted to modern Polish expansionism are <a href="../../../m/i/e/Miedzymorze.html" title="Miedzymorze">Miedzymorze</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev_Offensive_0056.html" title="Kiev Offensive">Kiev Offensive</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Ukrainian_War_c16c.html" title="Polish-Ukrainian War">Polish-Ukrainian War</a>, the latter needs work, to name just a few). The <i>second</i> best thing Poland wants for Ukraine is simply not to be Russia. And for Ukraine not to be Russia being just next to it indeed requires Ukraine to be strong. That's why Poland wants now Ukraine "strong". So, don't bring any selfless motives here for Polish desire in helping Ukraine to get out of the Russian control. Poland is taught by its own history to have every reason to be afraid of strong Russia. There is no stronger blow to Russia (geostrategically) than to make it, as you president said "without Ukraine". That what Poland supports. It has nothing to do with what's really best for Ukraine (which is to choose for itself what it wants rather than being told from the west for 300 years and from the east for another 300 years). --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:49, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Poland wants Ukraine's territory? Even the most extreme lunatic fringe of Polish nationalists do not advocate that. As for it being in Poland's self-interest to promote a strong, independent Ukraine, what the hell is wrong with that? In any venture, I would much prefer to have a partner who has a strong self-interest in assisting me than one who is doing it for "selfless motives", whatever that might mean. Common interests are the surest foundation of good relations between friendly states. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 03:29, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Balcer, I am not saying that Poland wants Ukrainian therritirry <i>now</i>. I am saying the geo-strategy exists in a longer than "now" realm. Poland and Russia are historic geostrategic rivals for whatever is between Moscow and Warsaw. And even not having any offensive plans <i>at present</i>, Poland knows where the greatest danger to itself is coming from, it is Russia. I don't blame Poles for thinking that because it is true as has been true for centuries. Poland is interested in weaker Russia. In that, it's interests coinside with those of US and that's why "New Europe" is a much stauncher ally of the US than the "Old Europe" which for one has reasons to oppose the US world-wide domination and (for two) is less threatened by a strong Russia (if at all). Sorry for going off topic, but this returns us to the main issue. Poland has every reason to beleive that weakening Russia is in its interest and this is simply an objective fact. This issue is impossible to view separately from the century old relationship defined by the geography and natural interests of competing powers in Eastern Europe. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 03:40, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I must say I am flattered that you think Poland could actually aspire to be Russia's rival for controlling all the territory between Warsaw and Moscow. For me even one look at the relative potential of the two countries shows that the idea is ridiculous. Besides, who in Poland would ever really be interested in acquiring more territory? Today, the poorest and most socially problematic part of Poland is the so called Eastern Wall or Poland B, the portion of the country east of the river Vistula. It is infamous for containing the poorest regions of the whole European Union. Now do you really believe that Poles would be interested in acquiring additional thousands of square kilometers of similarly poor and problematic territory? Do you honestly believe Polish nationalists dream at night of acquiring millions of hectares of Russian forests and swamps? Why on Earth would they want that? We no longer live in an age in which having a large territory is so important to economic well being. Look at <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Today Poland is mainly interested in achieving ever closer integration with Western Europe and slowly matching its living standards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Poland being afraid of a strong Russia, in my view Poland is not afraid of a strong Russia in all circumstances. It is mainly afraid of a strong Russia run by a nondemocratic, nationalistic government, obsessed with restoring Russia's imperial status as the dominant power in Eastern and Central Europe. Everybody in Poland understands that a truly weak Russia, unable to police its own borders and open to be taken over by its larger neighbours, would be a real problem for Poland and all of Europe. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 04:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Balcer, you misunderstood me. I am not saying that Poland is aspiring <i>now</i> to rival with Russia. I am saying that this is the old rivarly that <i>now</i> is out of the immediate picture, but history have shown repeatedly that two countries are destined to compete for what's betweem them. It is a historic fact. As for Poland is not being afraid of one stronger Russia and is afraid of another, this is a naive view IMO. All countries feel their geostrategic aspirations. These aspirations are in the very <i>instincst</i> of their political elites and the state apparatus. And all this nondemocratic/democratic bla-bla-bla is secondary to that. In my opinion, you very much underestimate the importance of geopololitcs. At least so I judge from your entries.

<dd>I must say my view of history differs radically. In my opinion we are not doomed to repeat behavior from the past. Consider France and Britain, countries which fought with each other for hundreds of years, from the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years_War_ada8.html" title="Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</a> to the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, yet which managed to be at peace for the last 200 years. I am sure one could find dozens of other examples to disprove your thesis.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, very distant future is very difficult to predict, in this age of rapid technological advance. Will Poland's <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">cyborg</a> soldiers finally conquer Moscow in the 24th century, thus finally achieving its geostrategic aspirations? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe the final battle between Poland and Russia will take place in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valles_Marineris_c742.html" title="Valles Marineris">Valles Marineris</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a>.

In the distant future, anything can happen.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>I am just kidding, of course, in order to illustrate the point that the distant future is likely to be quite complex and unexpected, and I hope in it Poles and Russians can find some more interesting things to do than fight each other.

<p>Balcer, I understand that his was good natured humor on your part but perhaps you indeed underestimate the importance of geopolitcal trends and being democratic or not means much less. Look at the US. Far from ideal, it is <i>rather</i> democratic and still ask any country in Latin America whether they have reasons to fear the US and you will hear a resounding yes. And not that the US are particularly bad natured. Any strong power has a huge pressure from inside towards expansionism. The idea that Poland may one day challange Russia again may seem ridiculuos now, nut no more than it was in 19th century when Poland was partitioned. Yet, in the 20th century Pilsudski succesfully challenged Russia in wrestling control on much of Ukraine and even being pushed back managed to get a hold of a significant part of it. Before and after that Russia partitioned Poland. And before even that the Poles were in Kremlin. The reality is that whenever Russia is strong, Poland suffers and whenever Russia is weak, Poland is first to take advantage of it. This was not set recently and technology affects the global trends much less than it seams to most people. Russia and Poland fought each other in Eastern Europe for many centuries. This is the hard fact. The reason of this is a long term one. I hope there will be no wars between France and Britain. But I cannot be sure that the current peaceful trend is an eternal one. The most sure way to err in the long-term prediction is to simply extrapolate the current trends. Such extrapolation, from the 19th century point of time, would have never predicted that Poland would even exist, let alone challenge Russia. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 06:12, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This attempt by you to paint the conflict between Russia and Poland as a conflict between equals rather disturbs me. Sure the Poles got to the Kremlin once, in 1610. It appears even 400 years later some Russians are unable to get over this trauma. But how many times since then has a Russian army approached Warsaw? The fact is that since about 1717 until 1989 Poland (or at least key parts of it) has been under almost continuous Russian geopolitical control one way or another (except of course for 1918-1939 and a few other short periods). So for roughly 250 of the last 290 years Russia has in one way or another controlled Poland. In return, Poland managed to challenge Russia successfully only once, in 1919-1921, and even then this was due to the collapse of the Russian state which was certainly not Poland's doing. Even then Poles certainly had no intention to advance on Moscow or to impose any regime on Russia. In fact they could have helped the White armies to overthrow the Communist regime in Russia but consciously chose not to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Needeless to say then, I see the situation as strongly asymmetric. The fact is that for most of the last 300 years it was Russia that has been almost uniformly dominant, with the Poles unable to threaten it in any serious way, except in the one case when the Russian state collapsed completely first. Now, trying to even out this basic historical reality by making predictions of supposedly "inevitable" <b>future</b> agressive behavior by Poland is, to say the least, difficult to justify. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 06:36, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>True, Poles had no intention to advance to Moscow and the reason is that Pilsudski had little desire to help the White Movement for good reasons (for Poland). I have no trauma over the fact the Poles were in Kremlin and even most Russians (I am not) don't think of it that much. I am not evening anything out. Right now, taking over Russia is not in any realistic Polish picture, but weakening of it is. Don't you agree? And this is exactly <i>due</i> to a fact, as you have correctly pointed out, that for 300 years Poland "has been under almost continuous Russian geopolitical control one way or another". This is unpleasant to be under someone's control and Poland's desire to see Russia weak is un understandable one. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 06:50, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can agree that, given their perception of history, some Poles might <b>wish</b> that Russia be weaker so that it could not threaten Poland. Some politicians might even imply this from time to time in unfortunate statements, which they often later retract. However, actually pursuing such a policy involving concrete acts towards accomplishing that end would surely not be in Poland's interest, as it would antagonize Russia. Therefore, I think it rather unlikely that any rational Polish government would pursue a serious policy like that. To my thinking, one thing the Poles have learned from history is that antagonizing Russia is something that should be avoided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now of course you might counter this by mentioning recent events in Ukraine. Well, first of all, Ukraine is not Russia, it is an independent country, so supporting its continued independence is not a weakening of Russia by any reasonable definition. Supporting fair elections and a peaceful resolution of a political crisis, especially in a neighbouring country, are surely laudable goals. Of course Poland had an interest in the success of Ukraine's Orange Revolution, but from what I read it would be difficult to claim that Poland played any kind of a decisive role in its outcome. Anyway, a much greater interest for Poland was avoiding destabilization and civil war in Ukraine, and objective which was in fact achieved. Overall, Poland's participation in those events did not greatly antagonize Russia, as can be seen by the fact that the relations between the two countries did not worsen in any significant way because of it. I hope every reasonable person in Russia understands that Poland's role in those events was largely peripheral.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We must also remember that Poland's good relations with Ukraine should not be seen only as a tool against Russia. Unfortunately, Poland has a long history of conflicts with Ukraine and Ukrainians as well. Surely it is in its interest that it maintains peaceful and constructive relations with Ukraine, to avoid any rekindling of historical conflicts. One way to ensure this is to make sure Poland is always seen as a keen supporter of Ukraine's independence. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 08:02, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Balcer, I was talking about <i>weakening</i> and not about actions aimed at simply <i>antagonizing</i> Russia. Such were the disgusting malevolence in Polish press during the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Beslan_school_hostage_crisis.html" title="Beslan school hostage crisis">Beslan school hostage crisis</a> or poorly concealed intrigues aimed at derailing the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_European_Gas_Pipeline_1119.html" title="North European Gas Pipeline">North European Gas Pipeline</a>. This is antagonizing and I agree that it is indeed silly. I am not talking about antagonizing here and I don't beleive this is what rational Polish government would do. I am talking about <i>weakening</i> and this is what any rational government in Poland <i>would</i> do. That it has to do it indirectly, is due to Polish limited political clout (for now).</p>
<p>As for the <i>weakening</i>, no other blow can weaken Russia more than it's "loosing" Ukraine. Now, put aside the moralistic issue that Ukraine is an independent country and Poland was just doing the right thing. If Poland was conserned about the common good, it could have helped the victims of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur_conflict.html" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur conflict</a> whose suffering from the genocide and famine is much more miserable than the suffering of Ukrainians due to the election almost stolen by a pro-Russian party. Poland had every reason of its own to help Ukrainians and it did all it could. True, it could not do much. The <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Revolution_51c9.html" title="Orange Revolution">Orange Revolution</a> is 99% a purely Ukrainian event, made by Ukrainians themselves and even most of the money on both sides were Ukrainian no matter how much is said about the Russian and US involvement. I do beleive that the O.R. may be good for Ukraine but in no way it is good for Russia and again, please no moralizing in geopolitcal issues. Getting Ukraine for itself is out of any realistic picture for Poland now and I beleive you that even the fringe nationalists there don't advocate it. Hoping that Russia won't recover and doing its small part to prevent a recovery, is a different matter. The famous "Russia without Ukraine is better than Russia with Ukraine" quote that slipped from Kwasniewski's mouth is telling of what he really was thinking. Nothing in this phrase mentions what's better for Ukraine itself. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 09:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>The famous "Russia without Ukraine is better than Russia with Ukraine" quote that slipped from Kwasniewski's mouth is telling of what he really was thinking</i> Well nobody here denied that Imperial nationalistic and expansionistic Russia that tries to conquer neighbouring countries isn't seen as desired in Poland. The desire for independent Ukraine is repeated over and over in countless government documents and statements by politicians: For example 30 March 2004: "nie ma niepodległej Polski bez niepodległej Ukrainy i nie ma niepodległej Ukrainy bez niepodległej Polski"."To jest najświętsza prawda. To obowiązek, aby to dzieło trwało i owocowało" - powiedział Aleksander Kwaśniewski." There is no independent Poland without independent Ukraine and there is no independent Ukraine without independent Poland. This is the holiest truth. Its a duty that is work endured and gave fruit-said Aleksander Kwasniewski. <a href="http://msz.gov.pl/file_libraries/44/5809/SERW29.doc?PHPSESSID=f1c7fe264d42ea827ecece0e79954efb" class="external free" title="http://msz.gov.pl/file_libraries/44/5809/SERW29.doc?PHPSESSID=f1c7fe264d42ea827ecece0e79954efb" rel="nofollow">http://msz.gov.pl/file_libraries/44/5809/SERW29.doc?PHPSESSID=f1c7fe264d42ea827ecece0e79954efb</a> Istnienie silnej niepodległej Ukrainy jest dla Polski równie ważne co przynależność do NATO-Jan Nowak Jeziorański. Existance of strong independent Ukraine is for Poland equally important as being in NATO-Jan Nowak Jeziorański.</p>
<p>"I do beleive that the O.R. may be good for Ukraine but in no way it is good for Russia and again" I'm saddened by your attitude, do you wish that Russia pursues an imperialistic policy that ruined it in the past instead of developing itself&#160;? But that of course is OT.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the belief that Poland wants to posses territories in the East speak rather more about the unfortunate conditions of perception of world politics and history by some people from former Soviet Union countries, rather then about Polish political goals. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 09:19, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Or, maybe, the Polish society supported Ukraine so strongly during the Orange Revolution not because we hate Russians but because we like Ukrainians? Many Poles have been to Ukraine as well Ukrainians in Poland and quite a few people in Poland, including myself maintain contact with Ukrainian friends. On the other hand hardly any one in Poland has ever been to Sudan or knows any Sudanees.</p>

<dd>Karemaa (1998) describes the emergence of anti-Russian sentiments and prejudices as a common feature in European society, dating back to the 16th century. In Finland, she claims, early sentiments towards Russians were directed against the Russian administration and its representatives, not against the Russian people in general. However, among the activist movement, the actual hatred of Russians was the rule rather than the exception. In everyday life, Russians were chosen for the role of rival, scapegoat, and enemy. This hatred was by no means directed solely against Russians, but also against native-born friends and mates of Russians; victims of harassment may have included Finnish women who were known to consort with Russian solders.

<dd>In 1918, stronger manifestations of anti-Russian sentiments followed with the return of the German-trained Jaeger corps to Finland. Alongside the activists, the Jaeger troops were the fiercest preachers of deliberate anti-Russian propaganda. The branding of Russians as scapegoats for every and any form of evil that needed explanation served at the same time as a rallying point round the White battle flag. In the 20s, the ideology of hatred against Russians finally spread widely among the masses of the Finnish population, regardless of age. The motives for younger people to incite ethnic hatred was manifested in the new Finnish Army - in the hope of finding a good status in society. By the 1920s, the Finns had become quite inclined to adopt the idea of 'Russky hating', specifically the seeds for racist thinking, and ancient Western stereotypes connected with Russians. However, it was the domestic scene - the independence struggle - that was needed to instigate the generation of a genuine racist hatred. Russians had become, in the Finnish view, foes forever, fiends eternal, and filthy vermin.</dd>

<dd>Eventhough the last census showed that there are barely any Orthodox people in Warsaw, we do have three Orthodox churches and a monastery here. As to the destruction of Nevski's cathedral in Warsaw, it was indeed a shame that it was destroyed as it was indeed a precious piece of architecture. However, after the Russian retreat of 1915 there were barely any Russians left in Poland and at the same time the church was indeed seen as a sign of Russian domination and a monument to times of forcible Russification of Poland and the times when people here had to name catholic churches after the ruling tsar in order to make their construction possible at all (as was the case of St. Alexander's church, for instance). The destruction of <b>a single</b> Orthodox church occupying one of the central points of Warsaw and dominating its landscape (it was the tallest structure in the city back then) was not aimed against Orthodox people of Warsaw (who were left with, if memory serves me right, some 10 churches altogether - not bad for a community of less than 10,000 people) but against Polish traumas and Russian 19th century imperialism. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 13:09, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>For example, the USSR was highly dependent on trains, yet the desperate need to produce weapons meant that fewer than 20 new locomotives were produced in the USSR during the entire war. In this context, the supply of 1,981 US locomotives can be better understood. Likewise, the Soviet air force was almost completely dependent on US supplies of very high octane aviation fuel. Although most Red Army tank units were equipped with Soviet-built tanks, their logistical support was provided by hundreds of thousands of high-quality US-made trucks. Indeed by 1944 nearly half the truck strength of the Red Army was US-built. Trucks such as the Dodge 3/4 ton and Studebaker 2.5 ton, were easily the best trucks available in their class on either side on the Eastern Front. US supplies of waterproof telephone cable, aluminium, and canned rations were also critical. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 09:23, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The population decrease during a span of 19 years (with a drop of 20%) compared to a span of 13 (drop of 70%). Most of the Caucasus-Russians during those years were actually encouraged to leave and settle in the Baltic.(Look in Latvian/Estonian/Lithuanian statistics - or follow census figures and you will not that the Baltic-Russian population trace most of their roots to the Caucasus).

<p>"The facts of genocide of Russian population have been carefully avoided by journalists in mass media and by scientific circles[citation needed], from what appears to be fear of physical elimination by the perpetrators of genocide. Hence, only personal accounts on various non-official websites offer a glimpse into the matter. [6] At the same time reports of hooligan attacks against non-Russians in Russia are widely picked up and analyzed often with an attempt to paint Russia and Russian people as intolerant and racist."</p>
<p>To me this seems an opinion and not a fact. Nobody can prove this is the way journalist think. I like Rusia, but you have to understand that lines like this are not gonna make Rusians verry populair. It looks arrogant and is verry hard to prove. I do know from Russian friends that Western reports about Russia are often one-sided but that (Western)-journalist make Russia look bad, cause they like that (!) is not true (ore atleast verry hard to prove), there sources of information are just poor ore they don't inverstigate that much, lack of time most of the time(I studied journalism for a while).

<dd>If we are to compare (which is obviously OT here, as most of the discussions above), then I guess the difference is that Poles usually arrive to Chechnya with humanitarian aid while Russians arrive there with tanks and missiles.

<dd>BTW, I wonder what was the number of Soviet state officials, Russian language teachers and military personnel who simply returned home after the fall of the USSR rather than were expelled by anyone from anywhere. In 1991 alone, for instance, the population of Russians in Poland dropped by over 100,000 people. One could say it was also an ethnic cleansing as the Northern Army Group of the Red Army (then Russian Army) was composed almost exclusively of Russians. Among the <i>expelled</i> were 53,000 soldiers, 7,500 civilian workers of the Soviet bases and roughly 40,000 of their families. In the preceding years additional 100,000 Russians were withdrawn from Poland - quite a huge number as for a non-Soviet state. I wonder what were the numbers for ex-Soviet republics. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 15:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well here you state the obvious, <i>returned home</i> they lived in a foreign country and returned home, probably not having that country's citizenship. In Chechnya, the 300,000 Russians were born there and that was their homeland. Don't mix salt with sugar, these are two different aspects. And if fact not that many Russians came to Russia from their homes that they legally moved into during the USSR times (one country) as examples with Latvia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine clearely demostrate this. Most of the people who did left were from Central Asian and Caucasus republics, but that was because of the appaling living conditions that their cessesion from the USSR brought (I would strain a point that they formed only a small fraction of the people who left those republics, most were actually those who represented their respective nationalities, but left for the same reasons) --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 18:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for the statistics, the raw numbers don't seem at all usefull, it could that those Russians were in fact Chechens and Ingush who during soviet times declared their nationality as Russian just in case or simply that Russians fled the poor and instable region while the native Ingush and Chechen population has no where else to go?</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all in the Soviet times nobody would have declared their nationality as someone elses that is absoloutely rediculous. Under Soviet law all birth cirtificates were handed out with the mother's nationality <b>automatically</b>, and nationalities were written inside all internal passports, which was the main document of all Soviet citizens. All of the Russians in the Caucasus are descendents of Terek Cossacks, who settled the area in the 18-19th centuries and particulary made themselves useful in the Cacasus war of the mid 19th century. As for refugees then you do realise that the majority of those Russians were ingnored by the state and received no support whatsoever. I remember perfectely how in 1990-94 several hundred people temporary placed their families in our stanitsa whilst the fathers went all over Russia to search for a place to live and work. In terms others in 2002 in Russia there are 1360253 Chechens and 413016 Ingushetians in Russia and the majority of them seem to be very well off in fact this migration into Russia proper seems to cause quite a few concerns, given the strength of their control on all Russian businesses. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 14:12, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Added "Many in Russia believe" and "it is speculated" too the part of the article "Ethnic Cleansing of Russians" to make it more neutral. I'm not a suporter of the Chechens rebels, I just wanted to make the article more neutral, because the less neutral this article is the more people who don't like Russian will say "Told you so!".

Western media does make Russian politicians look bad, but not the rest of the country. Thats the point I was trying to make.

<dd>Belarusians and those belonging to the Orthodox religion were deprived of the right to heir any property in Rzeczpospolita and Grand Duchy of Lithuania after Krew Unia and according to numerous privelij's of Polish king. Polonization refers not only to the creation of Uniat religion by Polish catholics in Ukraine and Belarus and depriving non-catholics of any rights, especially Belarusian and Ukrainian nobility, but also refers to the policy of Pilsudski government on occupied territories on Western Belarus, where belarusian schools were closed, Orthodox churches were made Catholic churchers, where all belarusian literature and press was forbidden, while Polish occupants, who were taking place of forcibly moved into Poland belarusian population, accounted only 20% at best times. Even now, students of law in Poland do not study three Lithuanian (Belarusian) Great Statuts of Great Duchy of Lithuania, who were the most complete codes of law in 16th century in Europe, and study only Court book of Kazimierz.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 10:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The Union of Krew did not forbid any Orthodox from anything. In fact it only mentioned the Pagans (in this context - the pagan Balts)</li>
<li>Nor did any of the privileges issued by Polish kings forbid anyone from the sacred law of inheritance. Otherwise there would be no Orthodox or Uniate nobles at all.</li>
<li>Belarusian schools were being closed down, just like Polish or Lithuanian or German or any other. Mentioning only Belarusian schools without mentioning the context is a gross understatement</li>
<li>Numerous Orthodox churches were not only made Catholic churches (see <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_Cathedral_of_the_Polish_Army_3043.html" title="Field Cathedral of the Polish Army">Field Cathedral of the Polish Army</a>), but also some were being demolished (see <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Nevsky_Cathedral%2C_Warsaw_a126.html" title="Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw">Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw</a>).

<p>Wrt to point #3, then you are forgetting that the Uniate rite in Russian Empire was not forbidden, but it was reunited with Orthodoxy by the efforts of a Uniate synod headed by a Uniate Bishop Joseph Semashko at Polotsk in 1839.

<li>Poles closing Polish schools? Fairy tales is another article of Wikipedia. Try your skills there. But your problem is that not only schools were closed, now try to explain why Poles forbidden the literature and press on Belarusian. War on communism? War on terror?</li>
<li>Who first began violently seize churches on Belarusian territory? Belarusians siezing their own churches? You have very good 'logic', pal. Or Polish occupants? So what's your problem? Hit me baby one more time? Jaki pan jest interesujacy...</li>
<li>Yeah... Who cares about a state made up of pagan orthodoxes, even you has union and actually live in one state? So you say Rzecz Pospolita?

<p>As this controversial quote comes from a rather obscure reference that is difficult to obtain outside of Poland, could the editor which inserted this quote provide the original text in Polish? I am concerned about the quality of the translation here. Was it a Polish to English translation, or maybe a Polish to Russian to English translation? At least the name of the translator of the quote would be quite useful. Even more ideal would be some link to an internet webpage which mentions this quote and vouches for its veracity. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 19:41, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

So, I guess my question can be made very specific. Ghirlandajo, given that you are quoting an original Polish reference, did you translate the quote yourself? In that case, give us an indication how good your Polish is. Or else did someone translate it for you? In that case, who was it? At any rate, I am assuming that you have the reference within reach, so if you would be kind enough to insert the text in the original Polish, it would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I provided reference, it's up to you to find it. Should I go to Warsaw to discover the book for you, scan the pages and post them online? There is no Wikipedia policy that allows to discard editions of historical documents as "dubious" only because one wikipedian failed to find the book in his local library. As for translation, I'll have to add similar tags to 90% articles of Soviet-Polish relations, as most of their content was translated either from Polish or from Russian and one can never tell whether "translation" was accurate. In short, your behavior may be classified as tag trolling with elements of vandalism (when you tried to delete the stuff that doesn't suit your POV) - we've been through it before with Piotrus and his buddy Molobo.

<dd>I know the book exists, so I am not accusing you of fabricating the very existence of this reference. However, the book is obviously in Polish, so if you were working with it directly, you presumably had to carry out a translation from Polish to English. Do you speak Polish yourself, and just did it personally? Or were you maybe working from a Russian translation of the text, in effect translating twice, with all the danger to accuracy that this entails?</dd>

<p>Yes, the book exists, like many Communist ones. There is a question, what is the value of a censored Communist book. I remeber books by Kowalski, who didn't know about the Soviet-German treaty or many books ignoring Katyn. It's not a problem to find a statement, there are millions Russian statements about anything. The problem is to select among the statements and to prove, that the statements were implemented. One may quote "The wise of Zion" to prove that "Russia" is antisemitic. It's the same level of manipulation. How many invested Poland to "destroy Russia" in 1938? 1 000 000 USD? 100 000 USD? The same quotation has been used in the Russian Wikipedia, as a reason of the Soviet aggression 1939. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 13:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could easily imagine this quote being from some WWI officer during the opening stages of the Polish-Bolshevik War, then quoted in that book and taken out of context by some Russian author who wanted to prove something with it. So yes, a citation could be nice.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks. This goes a long way to confirm my suspicion that Ghirlandajo never got his hands on the original «Z dziejów stosunków polsko-radzieckich. Studia i materiały», but instead copied the quote from some Russian translation, published in <i>Velikaya obolgannaia voyna</i> or a similar Russian book with a serious POV problem. This makes sense since obviously the original Polish reference would have been useleess to him, as I am assuming he does not know Polish.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, at the very least the quote has gone through two translations, from Polish to Russian and then from Russian to English, seriously diminishing its credibility. Furthremore, the source information given is grossly incomplete, as it does not mention the fact of double translation and the second source from which it was taken.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Overall, to have such inadequate and misleading information about such an important quote in a controversial article is unacceptable. I am removing it until Ghirlandajo, who put in the original quote, supplies <b>full</b> information about its origin. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 13:10, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are playing his game. The quote doesn't have any connection to Russophobia and shouldn't be here, even if perfectly translated. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 13:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even if it was, I guess it's fair to assume that it's been taken out of context, either by any of the authors who quoted it, or by Ghirlandajo himself. I could try to lay my hands on the book, but I believe there's no need to waste my time as the quote would be preserved through a revert war even if proved completely different in the original. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 14:09, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It might be a good use of your time. If you would find that the quote has been grossly mistranslated, due to double translation for example, then it could be considered as a blatant attempt at inserting false information into Wikipedia. There could be consequences to an editor who insists on doing that. You see, if Ghirlandajo correctly referenced the quote as "from Polish book A, cited in Russian book B", then any incorrectness in the translation could be blamed on the Russian author of book B. But no, Ghirlandajo insists on citing Polish reference only and provides no information about the translation. This can only lead the average Wikipedia reader to conclude that he had the book in his hands himself and can vouch personally for the quality of its translation. If that translation turns out to be wrong, then he is responsible for introducing errors, and inspiring false confidence in a quote which is obviously problematic.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 14:37, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Ghirlandajo insists on refusing to provide information on where and how exactly he got the quote, and keeps reinserting it via endless reverts accompanied by rude comments, I believe this is good grounds for an RFC procedure. This is not about this POV or that POV, but about following basic Wikipedia standards and supplying other editors with essential information. The answer "run to the library" is insulting and rude. Besides, most Wikipedia editors live on continents where Polish books are hard to find, even in university libraries. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 14:12, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, I will repeat my simple questions for Ghirlandajo.</p>
<p>1. Did you have the original Polish reference you are citing in your hands and hence the quote comes directly from it? If yes, what are your qualifications that would vouch for its correct translation from Polish to English?</p>
<p>2. If you obtained the quote from a Russian source, what was that source? Please include a reference to it. Provide an indication how reliable was its translation of the original Polish quote.</p>

<dd>Now our dear Irpen has added yet another Russian language source to mention the quote. I believe that the article Irpen provided is a particularly good example of manipulation. In all, the article is as biased as it gets.

<p>Our dear Halibutt, is missing the point, and obviously on purpose. The issue here is not the neutrality of the secondary source. The issue is that the citation is traceable and it is up to a challenger to disprove it. I can provide a number of other secondary sources that recite the same primary source. But I can't get a hold of the Polish book. I added the LOC identifier and anyone can get as a complete data of the magazine as necessary. The list of libraries that hold the item can be easily pulled out. Whoever thinks that the citation is false, or the tranlsation is manipulative is welcome to check it. The secondary sources cite the primary source very clearly, even with the page number. We will all be happy to see the report. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:38, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Irpen. That is all I was asking for. Now it is clear that the book quote comes to us second hand from a Russian source. Now Wikipedia readers can judge for themselves its reliability. It is only too bad this information was not provided at the beginning, when the quote was first inserted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, it is clear now that the quote has undergone 2 translations, putting its accuracy into question. With each translation one looses more of the original sense of the text. Maybe it is time now to take a look at the original source.

<dd>Belarusians and those belonging to the Orthodox religion were deprived of the right to heir any property in Rzeczpospolita and Grand Duchy of Lithuania after Krew Unia and according to numerous privelij's of Polish king. Polonization refers not only to the creation of Uniat religion by Polish catholics in Ukraine and Belarus and depriving non-catholics of any rights, especially Belarusian and Ukrainian nobility, but also refers to the policy of Pilsudski government on occupied territories on Western Belarus, where belarusian schools were closed, Orthodox churches were made Catholic churchers, where all belarusian literature and press was forbidden, while Polish occupants, who were taking place of forcibly moved into Poland belarusian population, accounted only 20% at best times. Even now, students of law in Poland do not study three Lithuanian (Belarusian) Great Statuts of Great Duchy of Lithuania, who were the most complete codes of law in 16th century in Europe, and study only Court book of Kazimierz.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 10:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact there were a number of Russians who got Polonized in the last 200 years. I personally met a girl who was a direct descendant of some Russian 19th century general named Orlov.

<p>I took Ghirlandajo's advice and I went to a big university library which had the original Polish book, to look up the quote. I happened to be attending a conference on that university campus and happened to have a bit of spare time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I expected that the quote has been mistranslated and wanted to see the original text. But there was a problem. The quote was not there! I checked the reference given and it was nowhere to be found. On second look, this was not suprising as the third volume of the 16 volume cycle "Z dziejów stosunków polsko-radzieckich; studia i materiały" gives documents about Polish-Soviet relations chronologically. In particular Volume III contains documents from between April 1920 and March 1921. Most of these documents are about the intense diplomatic activity leading to the Treaty of Riga. In fact the volume ends with a full inclusion of the treaty text.</p>
<p>Just to be sure, I checked other volumes which include documents from 1938, and no report from the Polish General Staff was found. This is again not suprising at all, as the whole book containts <b>diplomatic</b> documents. I could not see any secret reports of military intelligence in it.</p>
<p>I hope this lays the whole matter to rest. It also sheds light at the quality of research of Russian authors who listed this quote. Given their intense POV, that does not suprise me. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 18:08, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sad thing is that this quote false quote has been in the article for almost half a year, since Ghirlandajo put in in on November 9 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=27820055&amp;oldid=27818093" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=27820055&amp;oldid=27818093" rel="nofollow">diff</a>.

<dd>First of all, if anyone should be red-faced here, it is of course you, who put in the false information. Even now you are admitting that you got it from some Russian website and <b>NOT</b> from the original source, as the citation you put in was asserting. You have thus knowingly concealed information about the true source of the quote, with the resulting sorry consequences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am somewhat suprised and disturbed by your belief that this is a trivial matter. If you think including false information in Wikipedia is nothing to be ashamed of, that only exposes your true attitude to the entire project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is amusing to hear you accuse me of not having checked the reference, given that you are now admitting that you yourself have never even seen it. Fortunately, in this case the matter is quite straightforward, so that you don't even have to trust me. The Polish reference consists of 16 volumes, containing a chronologically ordered list of diplomatic documents relevant to Polish-Soviet relations, from 1918 to the time the books were published, i.e. the late 60s. Given that, it is simply impossible for volume 3 to contain documents from 1938, especially given the fact that there were such intense negotiations between Polish and Soviet government before the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Riga_0761.html" title="Treaty of Riga">Treaty of Riga</a>, accompanied by the exchange of dozens of documents which are all included in the work.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for Poland planning to invade the USSR, this is your pet conspiracy theory, yet you have never presented a shred of credible evidence in support of it. We are still waiting. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 17:22, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>А если пана Пилсудского послушать?</p>
<p>"Уже в 1918 году, независимо ни от кого, я поставил себе ясную цель в войне с Советами. Я решил приложить все силы к тому, чтобы сорвать любые попытки вновь навязать нам чужую, не самими поляками устроенную жизнь, причем сделать это как можно дальше от мест, где зарождалась и крепла новая жизнь. В 1919 году я эту задачу выполнил. Большевистские происки были сорваны так далеко, что Советы уже не могли препятствовать нам в возрождении нашей собственной жизни, хорошей или плохой - сейчас речь не об этом. Большое пространство, которым я отделился от "революции извне", имело в военном отношении и негативные стороны. При известном легкомыслии нашего народа, при, к сожалению, медленном и часто неумелом строительстве новой жизни были забыты законы, управляющие народом в военное время. Войну не видели вблизи, войну не принимали всерьез. Итак, намеченную цель я достиг в 1919 году." Пилсудский Ю. Война 1920 года. - М., 1992. - С. 263-268.</p>
<p>Видимо, легкая нажива не давала покою пану и в 1920 году? Если не так, то зачем нужно было втравливать свой "легкомысленный народ" в новую войну? Чтобы народ увидел эту войну поближе и принял в серьез? Или как?</p>

<p>Let me remind everyone who claims to be in the righteous rage over the quote that Wikipedia is not the collection of the truths but it is a collection of knowledge. The editor who placed it, didn't make it up. The quote is indeed easy to find at several Russian language web-sites. The way it is referenced in the ru-net sites with the volume and page numbers doesn't make an impression of the forgery. It might have been helpful to add "cited from..." to the reference under the quote but other than that, placing the quote in the article was totally appropriate. Personally, I doubt it is fake but I might be wrong. In any case, I am not inclined to go into trouble of getting the correct volume of the series and look through it for a quote, especially with my virtually non-existing Polish. As the particular reference points to nowhere (and I have no reason to think Balcer is not telling the truth), we should keep the quote out, at least until we find an original volume and page number. I think, it would be possible to find another Russophobic quote by the influential Polish politician of the time but I would leave this pleasant job to others.</p>
<p>The article is totally right devoting much space to Poland though. As <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushkin.html" title="Pushkin">Pushkin</a> put it in his poem addressed to Gustav Olizar:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Певец! издревле меж собою</dd>

    РУССКИМ ДРУЗЬЯМ
    Вы помните ль меня? Среди моих друзей,
    Казненных, сосланных в снега пустынь угрюмых,
    Сыны чужой земли! Вы также с давних дней
    Гражданство обрели в моих заветных думах.
    О где вы? Светлый дух Рылеева погас, -
    Царь петлю затянул вкруг шеи благородной,
    Что, братских полон чувств, я обнимал не раз.
    Проклятье палачам твоим, пророк народный!
    Нет больше ни пера, ни сабли в той руке,
    Что, воин и поэт, мне протянул Бестужев.
    С поляком за руку он скован в руднике,
    И в тачку их тиран запряг, обезоружив.
    Быть может, золотом иль чином ослеплен,
    Иной из вас, друзья, наказан небом строже:
    Быть может, разум, честь и.совесть продал он
    За ласку щедрую царя или вельможи.
    Иль деспота воспев подкупленным пером,
    Позорно предает былых друзей злословью,
    Иль в Польше тешится награбленным добром,
    Кичась насильями, и казнями, и кровью.
    Пусть эта песнь моя из дальней стороны
    К вам долетит во льды полуночного края.
    Как радостный призыв свободы и весны,
    Как журавлиный клич, веселый вестник мая.
    И голос мой вы все узнаете тогда:
    В оковах ползал я змеей у ног тирана,
    Но сердце, полное печали и стыда,
    Как чистый голубь, вам вверял я без обмана.
    Теперь всю боль и желчь, всю горечь дум моих
    Спешу я вылить в мир из этой скорбной чаши,
    Слезами родины пускай язвит мой стих,
    Пусть, разъедая, жжет - не вас, но цепи ваши.
    А если кто из вас ответит мне хулой,
    Я лишь одно скажу: так лает пес дворовый
    И рвется искусать, любя ошейник свой,
    Те руки, что ярмо сорвать с него готовы.

<dd>Getting back to the main topic of Irpen's comment above. There are two serious issues to be solved first:
<ol>
<li>What do we need a "Russophobic" quote for in the first place?</li>
<li>Who is going to decide whether the quote indeed is "Russophobic" and not anti-Soviet or anti-imperialist?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>While the earlier question is related mostly to style and quality of wikipedia, the latter is related to original research. Of course, we are free to add that "in this or that year John Doe said that (...), which Dr. Terry Murphy interpreted as a sign of russophobia". However, a quote by itself, and especially a quote that is hardly Russophobic, is not enough. Also, if we suggest that "Poles are Russophobes" and support it with a single quote, then we should also present the other side of the story here for NPOV: that Poles are not Russophobes (and support it with an equally funny quote). However, I believe that's not what wiki's for. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 05:20, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think, Irpen, that you are downplaying the fact of the quote not being properly referenced. As it was inserted (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=27820055&amp;oldid=27818093" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=27820055&amp;oldid=27818093" rel="nofollow">here</a>), it created the impression that the author had consulted the Polish book directly, thus adding to the credibility of the quote. The fact that it came from a Russian website really should have been added. Still, everyone makes mistakes, so I am not going to put too much blame on Ghirlandajo for this. What his true motivations were remains his business. The real problems with Ghirlandajo's behavior began once serious discussion about the quote's credibility started.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I raised the question of the quote's origin on April 14 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=48616345&amp;oldid=48415433" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=48616345&amp;oldid=48415433" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). This would have been an excellent time for Ghirlandajo to come clean about where he got the quote, and provide the full information. This was his duty as it was he who inserted the quote and it was his job to properly reference it. Ghirlandajo took a few days to think about the issue, then he reverted even the disputed tag placed on the quote, with an insulting comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=48835179&amp;oldid=48644370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=48835179&amp;oldid=48644370" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, then he threw in some more invective in his comment on this talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=48845953&amp;oldid=48828250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=48845953&amp;oldid=48828250" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After that came Ghirlandajo's claim that he forgot where the quote came from (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=48853024&amp;oldid=48851648" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=48853024&amp;oldid=48851648" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). At this point Ghirlandajo left the discussion. Irpen was kind enough to provide references to the Russian webpages which contained the quote. But Ghirlandajo could still find the time for a few more reverts, with more insulting or inaccurate comments: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=49281362&amp;oldid=49280005" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=49281362&amp;oldid=49280005" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=49292119&amp;oldid=49289926" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=49292119&amp;oldid=49289926" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=49294554&amp;oldid=49292415" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russophobia&amp;diff=49294554&amp;oldid=49292415" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, at considerable effort, I tracked down the book (not easy in North America) and found that the quote did not exist, at least not in the reference that was cited. Ghirlandajo's reaction was to insult me one more time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=49929022&amp;oldid=49701245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARussophobia&amp;diff=49929022&amp;oldid=49701245" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, and also admit that all of a sudden he remembered where he obtained the quote.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After this fiasco, did Ghirlandajo admit to any wrongdoing or apologize for his reverts and insults to well meaning editors? We have not seen it yet. In fact, far from apologizing, Ghirlandajo started a little campaign against me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=50225053&amp;oldid=50094835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=50225053&amp;oldid=50094835" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=50224808&amp;oldid=50215290" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=50224808&amp;oldid=50215290" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADmcdevit&amp;diff=50261158&amp;oldid=50237713" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADmcdevit&amp;diff=50261158&amp;oldid=50237713" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> which for now seems to have got nowhere. His latest angle of attack is that I am a new version of Molobo. Apparently Ghirlandajo misses him, and is looking for a replacement.

<p>This phrase: <i>The facts of genocide of Russian population have not been reported by journalists in Western mass media and by scientific circles, from what appears to be fear of physical elimination by the perpetrators of genocide. Hence, only personal accounts on various non-official websites offer a glimpse into the matter. At the same time reports of hooligan attacks against non-Russians in Russia are widely picked up and analyzed often with an attempt to paint Russia and Russian people as intolerant and racist.</i> is a typical propaganda statement clearly violating NPoV. There is no proof that the attrocities against Russians in the North Caucasus have any features of genocide. First of all genocide must have a planned character and there is no proof that the series of actions against Russian individuals was following any plan. It is also difficult to say which action was the example of anti-Russian resentiment and which was a common crime with no ideological backgroud. If you can prove that in all the cases it was clear that the actions were ideologically motivated - please explain it in discussion instead of reverting my contribution. the authors admit that the "genocide" has not been recognized outside of Russia and among scientific circles and the only source are only non-official websites. This is much like to say: "E.T. does exist, but scientific circles deny it". No information that is not recognized in scientific circles can be presented in Wikipedia as fact. In this case there are two solutions:</p>
<p>- delete controversial and not verified statements (as I tried to do at the beginning)</p>
<p>- write that these statements present Russian PoV and that there are also other interpretations (as I tried to do now).</p>
<p>I am reverting the text now, but I am open to suggestions if they are supported by rational arguments. I do not want to carry on any edit war. Regards, <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasra_3f4f.html" title="User:Jasra">Jasra</a> 14:03, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I first saw this section the entire thing looked like a joke. The sites that some of this material is based on appear very suspect indeed, as does the statement that Western journalists fear to publish the information because of the fear or "physical elimination". I am not that familiar with this particular situation, however the "evidence" presented is anecdotal at best, at least about the genocide. I fully agree with the removal of that part unless some credible sources can be found to support the information. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 14:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all yes there is proof, of genocidal reference. Second see the census figures published above. Third having personally taken part in the Chechen conflict I have come in contact with quite a few Terek Cossacks.

<dd>I am not talking about the issue itself, because as I have stated before I am not familiar with it, but about how it was presented here. Statements such as: "we have to rely on some random blogs because Western journalists don't report the information because they fear to be killed" seem to discredit the entire article. Can you really picture a Chechen holding an AK-47 storming the office of the BBC because they discussed the situation there?

You have not given any evidence to support it's authenticity. In addition, the Soviets did a lot of propaganda on exactly these kind of things, are you denying that...? That photo's purpose is to show Finnish prison camps as somekind of Nazi-style concentration camps which they were not: rather they were more comparable to the American internation camps for the Japanese.

<dd>High school books are almost per definition biased in favor of the country in which they are used. This is valid not only for Finland, but also for Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, the USA, Great Britain etc. Just an example I know: Every child in the Netherlands learns that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michiel_de_Ruyter_61cf.html" title="Michiel de Ruyter">Michiel de Ruyter</a> is one of the greatest Dutch admirals ever, and that his most brilliant endeavour was the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raid_on_the_Medway_d4f3.html" title="Raid on the Medway">Raid on the Medway</a>. This feat however, is conveniently downplayed in school books in the UK, whereas the merit is probably exaggerated in Dutch school books. And I guess there are many more examples where that's from. Now I suggest we let this bickering behind us, and investigate for real, using independent sources, if the picture is really a fake or not. In the meantime, I'd suggest displaying the picture, with the appropriate caption that states the dispute about it being a fake or not. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 14:09, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a different thing to exaggerate than to lie and I see no need to doubt the book for lying. I do not know where to find sources that these people demand (they won't be satisfied with any source, I think), but as it is now, I have a reference and they do not. And since it was they (or other similar people) who added the picture, they have the burden of proof now. The picture can be seen in the article under the subtitle 'History' as one of the three photos (it now has a note of doubted forgery in it's caption). --<a href="../../../j/a/a/User%7EJaakko_Sivonen_2a5c.html" title="User:Jaakko Sivonen">Jaakko Sivonen</a> 14:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the relations between Finland and Russia have been difficult in recent history. So have the histories of both countries. As of today, historians are still debating the role of Mannerheim in WWII, although it looks like it's gradually shifting to a positive view on him. In Finland however, there is no doubt at all about Mannerheim, and he is venerated as a great hero, with a large boulevard named after him and of course the obligatory equestrian statue in Helsinki. So high school books in Finland need not be objective, and could very well be trying to hide negative aspects of Finland's history. On the other hand, Stalin was very adept in faking photo's for propaganda purposes (one need only remember the Reichstag picture with the soldier with alledgedly two watches, which were photoshopped away avant la lettre). So the only way we might know for sure is to investigate. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 14:29, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, using a term like "Finn-hater" is very not CIVIL. Second, a book used in classroom study sounds fairly reliable. Unfortunately, as I can't read Finnish, I can't research the book. It might do well to solicit someone with a Finnish Babel box to come in and help. Third, at least temporarily, putting a disclaimer on the photo with something like "some sources believe this photo may not be authentic" will at least give a warning while the dispute is worked out. Finally, as a disclaimer, I am married to a Russian, but I don't believe that leaves me with signicant POV on this issue.

<p>The picture is <b>framed</b>, not a fake. There is a difference. I have never seen the book in question, but "lavastama" means "framed. "Fake" would be "väärentämä". Almost all of the war photos are framed. I see no problem with the picture. And the prison camp itself was authentic. Jaakko Sivonen has misunderstood the Finnish text. --<a href="../../../l/a/l/User%7ELalli_e273.html" title="User:Lalli">Lalli</a> 11:41, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah? Lavastama more like means <b>staged</b><a href="http://www.ilmainensanakirja.fi/?Q2=&amp;Q=lavastama&amp;P=36" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilmainensanakirja.fi/?Q2=&amp;Q=lavastama&amp;P=36" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, and therefore is not "reality". It's not "faked" 'väärenetty' by means that the Soviet Propaganda would have retouched the image, but is faked by means that it is taken for sure after the occupation, and is staged, therefore not reality in that case. But heh, is this needed, this is just playing around with words.. By the way, I fail to see what it has to do with anti-russianism directly anyway. Most of the labour camps workers were Ingrian Finns, and they were needed to work as farmers as people were dying to hunger. Remember Gulags, should they be anti-Baltic or anti-Ukrainian? The camps were not targeted to perish Russian/Ingrian population, but to get the much needed labour force and move them to East-Karelia from Finnish area <i>after the presumed victory in WWII</i>. If Finland would now get Karelia back, do you think Finns would want million Russians to their population? It would cause serious problems. Btw, on the recent news the Ingrian Finns' emigrating to Finland is being halted. The article doesn't even explain WWII, of which the Finnish actions is a minor issue, so I see very little relevancy. --<a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudeo_0b6c.html" title="User:Pudeo">Pudeo</a> (<a href="../../../p/u/d/User_talk%7EPudeo_9fb9.html" title="User talk:Pudeo"><i>Talk</i></a>) 12:27, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not a fake. "Stage" and "frame" are different terms in English language. The translation for both in Finnish is "lavastaa". Stage is a term used in theaters. You have misunderstood it. There were prison camps in Finland, too. But no concentration camps, which you seem to think are the same thing. As far as I know, there weren't any concentration camps in East Karelia, either.

<dd>It isn't "unknown", I have given detailed source on it: Muutosten maailma 4: Suomen historian käännekohtia (2005, WSOY), page 138 (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 951-0-27645-6</a>). I'll quote the entire paragraph (it is a caption of the picture), <b>in Finnish</b>: <i>"Suomalaiset joukot valtasivat Itä-Karjalan syksyllä 1941 ja seuraavana vuonna siitä tehtiin oma hallintoalueensa. Vallatulle alueelle jäi noin 85 000 paikallista asukasta, joista venäläisiä oli osapuilleen 65 prosenttia. Rintamalinjan läheltä siirrettiin väestöä keskitys- eli siirtoleireihin. Suurimmat leirit olivat Äänislinnassa (Petroskoissa). Leireillä oli enimmillään 20 000 henkeä. Suomalaisten leirejä ei pidä sekoittaa Saksan tuhoamisleireihin. On myös muistettava, että kuva on venäläisten sodan jälkeen ottama ja lavastama."</i> <b>A rough translation</b>: <i>"Finnish troops occupied East Karelia in Fall 1941 and the next year it was made its own administration district. About 85 000 local inhabitants remained in the occupied area, of them about 65 per cent were Russians. From the proximity of the front line (some) population was transferred to concentration i.e. transfer camps. Largest camps were in Äänislinna (Petrozavodsk). The camps had 20 000 people at tops. Finnish camps should not be confused with Germany's extermination camps. It must also be remembered that the picture is taken after the war and staged by the Russians."</i> As stated before, also another source mentions this as a post-war picture -&gt; forgery and there is no reason to doubt this. --<a href="../../../j/a/a/User%7EJaakko_Sivonen_2a5c.html" title="User:Jaakko Sivonen">Jaakko Sivonen</a> 19:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guys, what is the source for the image? (I know <a href="http://www.ravnenie-na-pobedu.ru/regions/10/history4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ravnenie-na-pobedu.ru/regions/10/history4.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> which seems to be "Russian heroes of WW2 website") There are 2 book sources and one "Russian WW2 heroes website". I could upload that image to Wikipedia and claim they're Finnish children in Russian death camp in Siberia (due to the fact the text in is Finnish also). All "sources" say it's taken in Petrozavodsk but no further facts, I rather believe the books than assumptions. And about getting Soviet sources to prove that it's forgery. That is very hard as it's just a very minor image, therefore I suggest using common sense and logic. Russia still hides a lot documents, and I doubt there is any document on this small image. There <b>isn't</b> any other possibility than it was taken by Soviet army (propaganda or other photographers) after the occupation. Do you really think Finnish troops would have let Soviet photographers to come at the camp? So, do you doubt it was taken after the occupation? And by the way, do you imply this "the author must say it's forgery" to Nazi e.g. Propaganda? Stalinist totalitarianism isn't that different. --<a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudeo_0b6c.html" title="User:Pudeo">Pudeo</a> (<a href="../../../p/u/d/User_talk%7EPudeo_9fb9.html" title="User talk:Pudeo"><i>Talk</i></a>) 20:34, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the photo was taken by a Finnish photographer (i.e. during the occupation), it would most likely still be under copyright. The sign and the fence are authentic.

<p>I do not understand the argument. A staged photo is not a fake photo or a forgery. Many of the pictures taken at Auschwitz, ... were staged after the "liberation" (quotation marks because soem people do not believe that we should say liberation) of the camps. Shall we ban those too, and only use those pictures which were taken by the German butchers who were so proud of their handiwork that they took pictures of the Untermenschen they had slain? Do those who say it is a forgery, mean to "deny" (another awful word, that one, maybe we should refrain from using it at Wikipedia too) that there were any children at the Petrozavodsk concentration camp? The problem with that one is, that the Finnish government (and the German one, by paying a small amount of compensation to the victims still alive) have confirmed that that was so.

<dd>First of all we must remember that it was the Russians who made the most terrible genocides in the 1930s, killing millions. Finnish camps were only meant as prison camps, there were no killings like the Russians and the Nazis had. Second, a post-war staged photo is a forgery: they made the children go behind the barbed wire and told them to look sad and maybe even made that sign themselves knowing the Soviet propaganda and lies... It can't say "Finnish run camp" since it was after the war: when the Russians made the children pose for the photo it was therefore a Russian run camp!

<p>It really would be helpful if exact date and photographer could be found, but I have nothing against using the photo in the article. To Jaakko: Almost every photo depicting fighting in WWII were staged, including that famous flag rising at Iwo Jima. So it is not necessary for photos to be authentic to be used in the article, well, that would result us looking only reconnaissence photos, which would become boring quite quickly. --<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_76ec.html" title="User:Whiskey">Whiskey</a> 22:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I digged some information about the picture and added it to the picture itself. Go and check it there. Also, the 9 year old girl right at the front row was recognized (The lady in the HS article mentioned above) and had given interviews about her time in the Finnish camps. --<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_76ec.html" title="User:Whiskey">Whiskey</a> 23:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As Jaakko continues his crusade against the picture in question, I'd like to point some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all pictures taken and published about the WWII were more or less staged. There are very few exceptions. And the published ones are those which produce the strongest emotional effect.</li>
<li>Almost 40% of prisoners in the Finnish camps were underage due to Soviet evacuation of able bodied adults. So the demographics is genuine: There were a lot of childrens in the camps.</li>
<li>The fence and the signpost are real ones.</li>
<li>Galina Sanko took the picture at the end of June after Soviet forces had reached the city. There is no evidence (or even a suspicion) that the picture has been retouched or modified after that. So the picture is genuine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the picture tell the truth? Yes. Does the picture tell the whole truth? No.</p>
<p>So, what the picture lefts out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The camps in Petrozavodsk were located in the town itself, six blocks of tenement housing where Russians lived already before the war, surrounded by the barbed wire by Finns.</li>
<li>The fence around the camps was in reality so shabby that Finnish commendant had to issue several orders to the prisoners not to leave the camp. This was easily seen from other pictures Galina took at the same time.</li>
<li>At the summer of 1944 there were around 13,000 prisoners, 6,000 of them refugees from Finnish and German occupied territories, 3,000 security evacuations from the southern side of River Svir, and few thousand security evacuations from the coastal areas of Lake Onega. Even when Finns left, they were not able to return home right away before the security situation had stabilized and necessary food was secured. So there wasn't a need to force people back to the camps right after the Soviets arrived to Petrozavodsk: That was simply the safest place to be before the Soviet authorities could take responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where does it takes us? The picture is genuine, but the situation it depicts is not but dramatized. (Sorry, Pan!) The children there are genuine. (Sorry, Jaakko!) But how they are located around the signpost is a work of Galina Sanko to get maximum emotional effect from the issue. Typical artistic stuff, and acceptable behaviour, not to mention it was used on the both sides of the frontline.</p>
<p>With the caveat that the picture is taken by Soviets after the occupation the picture is accepted also to the Finnish history books as we were told by Pudeo and Jaakko. So, the usage of the picture should be acceptable also in Wikipedia, but everyone should refrain extrapolating ideas from the picture or why the picture is added or claiming anything from the picture which is not supported by scientific research. Everyone should recognize the strengths and the weaknesses of the picture and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Jaakko, please drop your crusade. Instead of fighting against this picture, you should embrace it and the fact that it is the most emotionally charged picture Soviets have provided against the Finnish camps. Besides what is shown in the picture, it is equally important what is not shown in this or any other pictures published. --<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_76ec.html" title="User:Whiskey">Whiskey</a> 08:20, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problem with this caveat of yours. Except for one major thing: one of the other reasons why there was such a high percentage of children was that most of the babushkas and dedushkas died during the first months, because there was not enough food. Knowing how important babushkas and dedushkas are in Russia when looking after children, the fact that only at the end of the war they set up a school, and refused a 13 year old child entry there (had her work instead), is particular. One wonders what they would have done with these kids should they have won the war. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 03:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Major POV, unsubstantiated claims and sheer stupidity in <b>bold</b>. Some other simply weird ("foreign workers", "Christain groups" and what not), not to even mention unreferenced. One idiocy I disussed already, and no one disagreed (one person agreed).</p>

<p><b>The facts of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> of Russian population have not been reported by journalists in Western mass media and by scientific circles, from what appears to be fear of physical elimination by the perpetrators of genocide.

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Some Russian non-governmental sources allege persecution, and even <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>, of ethnic Russians in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Caucasus_6062.html" title="North Caucasus">North Caucasus</a> took place in early 1990s.

<p>It is, however, difficult to say which of the acts of murder or kidnapping were examples of Russophobia and which were the cases of crimes with no ideological background. Some observers also argue that most of anti-Russian resentiments should be seen in wider context of the Chechen conflict, <b>and experts estimate that more than 4 million ethnic Russians have immigrated to Russia from other former Soviet republics in 1990s.</b> <a href="http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2002/06/040602.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2002/06/040602.asp" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></p>
<p><b>The impoverished North Caucasian republic of <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingushetia.html" title="Ingushetia">Ingushetia</a> is stepping up plans to persuade ethnic Russians to resettle or settle there, but a spate of violent attacks is undermining the efforts.

<p>I've removed the unrelated Image:Merridien Web.png image from the article. To claim that it is Russophobic is plain speculation.

The surcharge is not limited to Russians only, but also applies to other guests from CIS states. If it was Russophobic, it would say something like "No Russians".

<p>This article is not the place to discuss unproved territorial claims of the Baltic states. Actually, this issue is discussed at the article of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_changes_of_the_Baltic_States_6265.html" title="Territorial changes of the Baltic States">Territorial changes of the Baltic States</a>. The conclusion there is that "...official governments of Latvia and Estonia do not support the issue, but it is supported by some, usually marginal, organizations inside these countries,,,,". But this is an issue with almost all bordering countries. Why not list the Karelian issue with Finland, or dispute over northern territories (Kuril islands) with Japan, or disputes with China? Actually the right place for information about these disputes is <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_disputes_of_the_Russian_Federation_1c0c.html" title="Territorial disputes of the Russian Federation">Territorial disputes of the Russian Federation</a>.

<p>Help? If you care and agree, that is - right now I think I'm quite alone in my belief here. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 01:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. I see, you're not interested - pity. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 16:47, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Ghirlandajo, This person may or may not be Russophone, but if you look the definition give at the first section of this artcile, I don't see how it could be example of Russophobia. Even more, I may agree that language is quite important topic related to the Russophobia, but I don't see any evidence, that in this case the violation of article 8 of convention is related to the nationality, origin or mother tongue of Mrs Natella Kaftailova. Also, I find the secondary reference in Russian from the Russian source not very neutral (not to say objective). If you like to make this reference, please refer to the primary source - most of decisions of ECHR are public and published in English or French.</p>
