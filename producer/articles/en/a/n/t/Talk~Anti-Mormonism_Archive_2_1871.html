<p>So, I tried to "be bold" and I did a complete re-write of the page. I chopped out a lot of material, I hope I don't offend anyone by chopping out their favorite part, but my main goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide a solid framework for re-integrating old material</li>
<li>provide solid sources for main claims</li>
<li>reference "main articles" wherever possible, sticking mostly to descriptions rather than specific debates</li>
<li>try to at least provide some semblence of NPOV (I realize this may be a fruitless task for this article in general, much less for one person to attempt)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please proof-read, give feedback, and let me know if you think this article is on the right track. Thanks! --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 21:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV tag</span></h2>
<p>I have placed the POV tag back on the article. It may have been a kneed-jerk reaction to ANON166's edits, but I think it best. I find the vast majority of his edits compeltely POV. Rather than get into an endless edit war, I felt it best to just tag.</p>
<p>Dlugar did an admirable job and was correct in stating that it may be a fruitless task on this article. We can always hope, but evidence is not seen yet. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:11, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article is not balanced, fair, and directly serves an opponent interest (explicitly against POV policy). It is an exercise in mind control and brainwashing, primarily because of its assumption that Mormons are entitled to label anyone they want as anti-Mormon to protect their bigoted and biased opinions of other races, religions, gender, and two-valued thinking about leavers and disbelievers. This is not a race or religious freedom argument they have ever honored for others. The either "for us or against us" mindset is harbored by this anti-Mormon label, and the persecution complex unofficially serves Mormon propaganda to hate Exmormons and other Christians who dare to disagree with Mormon positions against them.

<dd>Official doctrine may lend itself to this controversy, which does not discourage labeling those who disagree, offer criticism, or portray Mormonism in less than a faith-promoting way as <i>anti-Mormon</i>, thus stigmatizing sources of information. This reflects an institutional <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bias.html" title="Bias">bias</a> that explicitly does not allow one to <i>agree with any group or individual whose teachings or practices are contrary to or oppose those accepted by the Church</i>, if a member is to obtain temple-going status.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

<p>I'm snipping this part temporarily because I don't think it belongs in the "Mormon Views" section, but I think it's good material and deserves its own section.</p>

<dd>I think the article gives the impression that you can't be a good Mormon and read anti-Mormon literature, which I don't think is true. I've given church firesides on anti-Mormon literature, and have waded through tons of it sent by my brother. Some leaders may have discouraged people from reading such material, but I don't think you could call it church doctrine. The temple interview question basically asks if we *agree* with any apostate and/or anti-mormon organization, not if we are familiar with them. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 14:05, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point, although some people definitely think that it <i>is</i> true that you can't be a good Mormon and read anti-Mormon literature. (Not saying that's doctrinal; just saying that some people believe it.) On the one hand, I think all the Mormon apologist links on this page make it somewhat clear that Mormons are <i>allowed</i> to read anti-Mormon literature (how could you be an apologist otherwise?), but maybe we should try and find a quote/reference (preferably given from a talk from a 70 or higher) that basically says "you can be a good Mormon and read anti-Mormon literature"? --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 16:32, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, anti-mormon literature helped convert me to the church. I also remember reading in "No More Strangers"(?) about another person who was converted after reading anti-mormon literature. Essentially, if you take to time to check their claims, it becomes very clear that they are using a lot of deception in their materials. If the church wasn't true, and they had some legitimate criticisms against the church, then why would they use such deceptive approaches? It seemed to me that was a good argument that the church might be true. That is basically how I finally got my brother to quit reading anti-mormon material. I challenged him to prove one of the claims, and when he couldn't, he realized that the material couldn't be trusted. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 18:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was selected as the Mormon Collaboration of the Month for June 2006. There is no guarantee, but I hope this will be an opportunity to make a lot of improvements to the article. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 14:07, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Organization</span></h3>
<p>The article is already <i>somewhat</i> in this form, but I think it would be good to follow the example of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> as far as organizing into these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro</li>
<li>Use of the term</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Modern Anti-Mormonism</li>
<li>Criticisms of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</li>
<li>Criticisms of Anti-Mormonism</li>
<li>See also</li>
<li>Notes and references</li>
<li>External links</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, as was said earlier on this talk page, the focus of the article should be the <i>term</i> Anti-Mormonism and not a re-hashing of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">criticism of Mormonism</a>. The section on that topic should be brief and reflect this. In any case, if we can agree on this outline, then I suggest we expand the outline with general descriptions and then get to work. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup></p>

<dd>One comment--I don't think the "Sympathetic to anti-Mormonism" and "Unsympathetic to anti-Mormonism" are particularly good sections for this page. First, because <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">criticism of Mormonism</a> already exists, and second, because most people labeled "anti-Mormon" reject the term, so you won't find them saying things like "anti-Mormonism is good!" Hence I'm moving the links there to the section entitled "responses to Anti-Mormons". --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 15:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok, I lied.&#160;:-) One more comment. Looking through the article again, I'm trying to see what the difference is between your suggested outline and what currently exists. I'm happy with everything except for the "Criticisms of the Church" and the "Criticisms of Anti-Mormonism" headings. I think those names attempt to create more of a debating tone that exists on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">criticism of Mormonism</a>, not a descriptive tone that I think sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 create. I also think that "Latter Day Saint views on Anti-Mormonism" is better than just saying "Criticisms of Anti-Mormonism", because it gives us more freedom to talk about things like anti-Mormonism as "spiritual pornography", which isn't really a criticism per se, but is definitely a "view on Anti-Mormonism". "Responses to Anti-Mormons" fits well under there as well, much better than a "Criticisms of Anti-Mormonism", which kind of implies that Anti-Mormonism is a category which can be rebutted as a whole, rather than responding to individual statements and assertions. What do you think? --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 15:52, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think you make some good points. How about this revised outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro</li>
<li>Use of the term</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Modern anti-Mormonism
<ul>
<li>Christian groups</li>
<li>Ex-Mormons</li>
<li>Secular groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explanations of anti-Mormonism
<ul>
<li>Official views of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</li>
<li>Views among Latter-day Saints</li>
<li>Other views</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See also</li>
<li>Notes and references</li>
<li>External links</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's good to keep the "critical views" non-specific to be able to include all views. You may be correct about the "sympathetic" and "unsympathetic" titles, but the external links should still go in an "external links" section, and I think it's important to categorize them - but we can do that later. By the way, if you're interested, you might want to check out the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Wikipedia%7EMormon_collaboration_6778.html" title="Wikipedia:Mormon collaboration">Mormon collaboration</a> that I run. It's a relatively new thing, but we've done some <a href="../../../m/o/r/Wikipedia%7EMormon_collaboration_History_63a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Mormon collaboration/History">good work</a>. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 18:19, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Point taken regarding the external links. I think they're fine how they are now; if we need to categorize them later we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Regarding the revised outline, something is bothering me about the separation between "Ex-Mormons" and "Secular groups". I don't know of a single "anti-Mormon" group/person who is not either Christian or Ex-Mormon. And the latter group consists of Ex-Mormons-turned-Christian (typically your Tanner/Decker bible-thumping variety), or Ex-Mormons-turned-[unaffiliated? secular?] (your ExMormons.org-type folks). Any thoughts?</dd>
<dd>And finally, I'm still a bit turned off by the "Critical views" name--it seems like it's saying, "Anti-Mormonism is wrong because [list of reasons]", whereas the section is really more about "Here's what we think about anti-Mormonism" or "Here's why we think anti-Mormonism exists"--there's no real debate or argument in this section, nor do I think there should be. That may be a <i>sub</i>section (like the "Responses to Mormonism" subsection which I now realize has disappeared), although I'd prefer to keep that out of the picture (i.e. in a separate article) completely. In order to be inclusive of the sort of statements like Smith's and Nibley's, I think the section name should be something broader than simply "Critical Views of Anti-Mormonism".

<dd>I changed "critical views" to "explanations of," which I think accomplishes for what you were looking - and I agree it is better that way. I think "secular views" should stay as it will catch all anti-Mormonism that doesn't fit in the first two. If it turns out there isn't anything to put in the section, it's easy enough to remove.</dd>

<p>After reformatting the article, I realize that many of the references are of poor quality. Although this is a topic oft debated on the Internet, your average internet blog or debate doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. I removed a couple of the obvious places, but I think (for example) comments on LDS church doctrine shouldn't be referenced to unofficial sites - even if they are FARMS or FAIR. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 21:53, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On that note, I find Jeff Lindsay's self-published site quoting his own opinion on his reason for existence to be a triple no-no, almost a self-parody here.

Forcing a label as to non-beliefs is enforcing a POV labeling system, and suggests that the "anti-Mormon" label is just an extension of this mindset. It is not far removed from forcing people to wear armbands in Nazi Germany to designate people whose beliefs are blacklisted or not mainstream or pure.

<dd>I thought it would be easier to find consensus on a topic like anti-Mormonism, but you've got a wide range of Mormon opinion expressed here in just these three articles: live and let live; faith-killers are to be shunned; and exmormons still have testimonies.

<dd>One of the reasons I'm concerned about giving the impression that good Mormons don't read anti-Mormon literature is that one of the techniques used is to make it sound like most Mormons don't know about whatever deep, dark secret they claim to be exposing.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the fact that only three entries could be found by searching lds.org indicates that the topic really isn't discussed that often. I imagine that if you were living in Utah or some other location with lots of Mormons it would get discussed often, but I don't remember ever hearing anti-Mormon material being discussed in the Philly area. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 21:29, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that <i>most Mormons</i> <b>do</b> know the "deep, dark secrets". If you frequent exmormon bulletin boards, you constantly run into people who are like, "Did you know that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy?! I couldn't believe it! That's why I left the Church." I think this is especially true in recent years when the "deep doctrines" of the church are no longer generally discussed in most places. For older members of the church, stuff like polygamy and Kolob have been discussed and talked about for ages. But nowadays, you can be a completely active member of the Church for years without ever knowing about the priesthood ban.</dd>
<dd>It's a tricky balance, I think. On the one hand, there's a definite tendency for Church members to view anti-Mormon materials as being completely off-limits, avoid-at-all-costs, testimony-thieving Satan-inspired trickery--but on the other hand, simply reading anti-Mormon stuff [typically] isn't going to get you in ecclesiastical trouble. The problem is that (at least in my experience) there are far more quotes talking about the former than there are about the latter. --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 21:55, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've always liked the comment by Nibley in an article comparing different anti-mormon books that couldn't agree on what Joseph Smith looked like. He said something about if they couldn't get his physical appearance right, how could anyone trust their interpretation of his ideas? He then went on to say that the only danger was if you read only one anti-mormon article. As you read more articles, you find so many contradictions that they become less dangerous.&#160;;^) <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 14:22, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think it's particularly useful to have statements in the article like, "Mormon apologists claim that anti-Mormon material implies that the claims have never been countered by Mormons, while anti-Mormons believe that the claims have never been adequately addressed by Mormons." I mean, it's pretty self-evident that a Mormon apologist thinks anti-Mormon claims are bunk and that an anti-Mormon thinks that apologist writings are bunk. In addition, I think Lindsay's "Questions for Anti-Mormons" belongs more in the "criticisms of Mormonism" article than in a (what I think should be a primarily descriptive) article about anti-Mormons.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">In regards to the editing of non-Mormon belief of political pressure influencing abandonment of polygamy and racial priesthood restrictions</span></h2>
<p>First off, as I mentioned in the edit summary, this article is vastly improved lately. Excellent work, everyone who has helped bring this about.</p>
<p>I am offering this explanation (nearly) contemporaneously with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Mormonism&amp;diff=56775489&amp;oldid=56766270" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Mormonism&amp;diff=56775489&amp;oldid=56766270" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, since I think some people may question how it furthers NPOV. It was in the interests of furthering NPOV by presenting an explanation for the sentiments of the non-Mormons, in replacement of a previous, not-very-NPOV explanation that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Mormonism&amp;diff=56766270&amp;oldid=56709082" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Mormonism&amp;diff=56766270&amp;oldid=56709082" rel="nofollow">was edited out here</a>.</p>
<p>Only mentioning that "Critics of Mormonism believe that <i>opposition</i> to Mormonism that was labeled <i>anti-Mormon</i> has been politically responsible for the pressures that led to overturning the Mormon practices of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> and priesthood racial discrimination", without explaining any rationale for that belief, leaves the uninformed reader unable to tell whether those critics had any justification for their belief, or whether it simply illustrates their hubris and irrationality.</p>
<p>Explaining that there was a justification, which was "since these doctrines were abandoned after substantial political pressure, and without their former practice being officially repudiated", removes the onus from the critics to have some rationale other than hubris or cynicism; and these statements are objectively factual; both abandonments took place after substantial political pressure in opposition to the doctrines; and both were abandoned without the church authorities explicitly repudiating their former practice. In the case of polygamy, President Woodruff specifically said the Lord's motivation for revealing that the doctrine should be abandoned included the overwhelming practical difficulties that would be imposed on the church by continuing the practice (someone around here has that reference I'm sure), and the Official Declaration 1 is specifically worded in terms of not practicing polygamy out of respect for the laws of the land. With the former racial restrictions on priesthood, as my past discussions with <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> covered, it is generally believed in the church that the restrictions were right at the time they were practiced, so that this doctrine also was not repudiated.</p>
<p>Concerning one other little tweak, from "These <b>original</b> Mormon doctrines..." to "These <b>former</b> Mormon doctrines...", it is attested to by all sides of the issues that the LDS church did not practice either polygamy or racial restrictions on priesthood as "<b>original</b> doctrines" of the Church, i.e. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement_887b.html#Organization_of_the_Church_of_Christ" title="History of the Latter Day Saint movement">on April 6, 1830</a> or for at least a significant passage of time thereafter. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop"><b>Reaverdrop</b></a> <small><font color="green">(<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReaverdrop_ce3e.html" title="User talk:Reaverdrop">talk</a>/<a href="../../../../nl/r/e/a/Gebruiker%7EReaverdrop_a5b4.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Reaverdrop">nl</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPACE_cbae.html" title="WP:SPACE">wp:space</a>)</font></small> 04:54, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If someone doesn't describe themselves as anti-, OR if some quote doesn't specify their opponent as anti-Mormon in this case, then it is a POV label that is not agreed upon. The casual reader is induced to believe that people mentioned here are objectively "anti-Mormon" or refer to themselves as anti-Mormon when they may only object to Mormon claims of supremacy, or Mormon anti-Catholicism, or former Mormon racism or polygamy. It also seems this article tacitly assumes that Exmormons are anti-Mormon if or when they intellectually justify their reason to leave to defend against the character smear offered by Mormons who typically label them as a digruntled sinner. In my view, this article doesn't have the proper explanatory warnings to the reader that steer it clear of a pure form of religious <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigotry.html" title="Bigotry">bigotry</a>. The editors here seem to apologetical and biased to Mormonism, while very few of us here regard it as just another religion no better or worse than any other--I was even assumed to be anti- the day I dared edit it. Regardless, lacking any explanatory warning, I would go to the next level of POV warning, POV-check, for the interim. Having said that, I worry that the official LDS part to come will be a barn stuffer and bury the article in Mormon POV, which, by the way, this article is becoming a dumping ground for. <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologia.html" title="Apologia">Apologia</a> is the flip side of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemics.html" title="Polemics">polemics</a>.

<dd>The point is not whether the LDS Church is NPOV, but rather if the article is NPOV. This article is about the term "Anti-Mormon". It should be discussing how most / some LDS members use the term, as well as how non-LDS perceive and/or use (or not use) the term. That is not POV in and of itself. If the article were to present the information in a biased way, making prejudicial statements about one side or the other, then you could make a case about the article being POV. Your complaint, it appears, is more about the fact that you don't agree with the content of the article than the way the article is presented. The goal of an NPOV article is to present the facts in a manner that readers can understand both (all) sides of the issue. If it achieves that, then it is NPOV. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 15:18, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say that as if you aren't LDS. Either way, I'm more interested in balancing the article to prevent it from serving as persecution propaganda with Wikipedia's blessing. The LDS church does not live by its "live and let live" policies in regards to anyone else, especially leavers. Missionaries knocking on Christian doors and informing them of their error in belief is offensive to them and provokes the non-Christian accusation, by way of common sense. Another example: LDS Inc. just issued an anti-gay-marriage political platform calling on members to get involved whether they agree or not. So, if and when a gay person objects to this tax-free politicizing against their equal rights, they are listed as anti-Mormon, or so we suppose. Hopefully not because of Wikipedia, and I'm sure others who aren't sworn to build the kingdom would agree. Mormons obtain their morals from LDS culture, so they don't register the hypocrisy in attacking and crying foul at the same time. Anon166 01:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't really matter what religion I am; I'm just as dedicated to preventing the article from "serving as persecution propaganda" as you are. It does seem odd to me, however, that you seem to have such an axe to grind ... in the name of NPOV. Kind of ironic. In any case, I'm sure that given our motives, we should have no problem putting together a quality article. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 02:04, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rejection of the term</span></h2>
<p>I moved a section from "Latter-day Saint Views" to a new top-level section "Rejection of the term", because I think the material is important and even central to the topic, but as Anon166 was pointing out it was getting swallowed in Mormon apologia. I would prefer that apologist content remain in the "Latter-day Saint Views" section rather than attempting to drown out the voice of those who reject the term itself. --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 02:49, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the purpose of Wikipedia is to blacklist authors for the self-interests of the Mormon church. I would immediately place the POV tag on any booklist that could serves the purpose of DISRECOMMENDED reading in a theocratic environment. I wish editors here would read a book on prewar Nazi Germany and then acknowledge the danger in blacklisting a hate file on Wikipedia. Anon166 15:34, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how a list of the most prominent books <i>considered anti-Mormon</i> constitutes hate. In fact, using your Nazi Germany analogy, it would also be appropriate to list the books that the Nazis burned. That wouldn't indicate an acceptance of Nazi propaganda, only an objective representation of history. Similarly, a list in this context would only serve to inform the reader of the kind of material that is typically considered anti-Mormon without addressing the legitimacy of the claims in the books. What books are considered anti-Mormon is a matter of <i>fact</i>, not POV.</dd>
<dd>Getting back to the point, I think we should limit the list to ten, so I'll endeavor to pick out the ten most prominent works and then revamp the lists in the article. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 15:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blacklists serve the purpose of banning authors and censoring ideas, which stymies authorship and research, and silences critics from fear. It basically does what many churches in history have done and still try to do, but not with Wikipedia's blessing. The difference between listing the books that Nazi's burned in the past after a defeat, and making of list of books to be burned in the future after a victory are two very different lists. I see where all this going and will put the POV tag back if any book is framed as something to be denied reading, outlawed, or something that it does not purport to be. I might also note that if the authors are not given their own balanced treatment before the fact, then mentioning their work serves no purpose other than to smear with a label.

<dd>I included the books that I thought most prominent. I hope you can assume good faith here, as it is not my intention to smear or blacklist anything - only to list books that are commonly thought of as anti-Mormon, which is on-topic, worth mentioning, and has nothing to do with my own personal opinion.

<dd>You are including the books you think are anti-Mormon, and so you include your own criterion, and that would make it original research. A blatant no-no. Good faith has nothing to do with it, it is purely subjective at this point, or copied from Mormon POV sources with their religious agenda. If you can cite a respectable researcher who has made such a list, and his/her criterion, then that would be different. Anon166 18:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't about research; this is about prevailing opinion. I know hundreds of Mormons and have read multiple articles on the subject. My contention is that most all of them would agree that these books are anti-Mormon. If you'd like, I could probably find multiple witnesses and sources of each. Of course, all of them would include their point of view - <b>but that's what this article is about</b>. This is an article about a label usually given by Mormons as an expression of their point of view. We, as editors, should be able to objectively summarize the prevailing point of view out there, whether we think it is objective or not. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 19:38, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not true. If Mormon apologists want people to discriminate against a book for whatever reason, then they will say it is anti-Mormon even though nobody has read the book. Citing opinion is citing an apologist position, and you should cite them by name. Citation is needed, and just because you have a list doesn't let you off the hook.

<dd>I said "object by saying," not "object by deleting without support." If you feel Brodie's book cannot be considered anti-Mormon, then just say so. That would give me the opportunity to present support, such as the following opinions representing how <i>some</i> (not necessarily me or you) consider Brodie's book to be anti-Mormon:
<ul>
<li>Flanders, Robert Bruce (1966) "Writing on the Mormon Past", Dialogue, 1 (3), 47-61. <a href="http://www.lightplanet.com/response/brodie.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lightplanet.com/response/brodie.htm" rel="nofollow">Quotation</a>.</li>
<li>Nibley, The Myth Makers (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1961). Mentions Brodie's book in a general survey of anti-Mormon literature.</li>
<li>Included as part of an overview of anti-Mormon publications <a href="http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=206" class="external text" title="http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=206" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>The FARMS review of the book dubs it as anti-Mormon <a href="http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=373" class="external text" title="http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=373" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Quite enough to warrant inclusion in the article, don't you think? If this is going to be a problem, though, we can include a note after the listing of Brodie's book referencing these. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 23:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is getting closer to the issue. We need a list of authors, or a system, that tables the books, since the guilt by association is obviously targetting widely respected scholarship. By the way, in case you are unaware, academically speaking, you are quoting Mormon apologetic sources here which claim Brodie as anti-Mormon, which is natural to their pro-Mormon POV. You have proven that this is officially a POV issue now and the section must have either a tag or an explanation as to which Mormon apologists have listed them as anti-Mormon. It should be easy to do, and if you don't feel up to it, then don't post it. It would be misleading to say they are "considered" anti-Mormon without tagging the bias as to who considers it, certainly not the non-readers. Anon166 00:00, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that they sell Fawn Brodie's book in the BYU Bookstore doesn't mean it isn't anti-Mormon. The major complaint that people had about that book was that they claimed it took rumors and presented them as facts. Non-Mormon critics supposedly gave it a good review, but when Brodie did her next biography (Thomas Jefferson?), they complained about the same kinds of problems. Anti-Mormon books don't have to demonize Mormonism. Remember, some Mormons think anything that doesn't promote the church is anti-mormon.I, personally, wouldn't consider her book anti-mormon, but I could see why others might. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 23:48, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I finally helped him discover that you can't believe most of it, so I haven't gotten any recently. As a matter of fact, anti-mormon literature played a vital part in my converting from agnostic to Mormon. As for Brodie's book, I think it is more poor research / validation than actually anti-Mormon. The fact that she had the same kinds of problems in her next book indicates to me that it is just her style. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 01:49, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Others"?</span></h2>
<p>What is the point of the text in the "Others" section? and why is it in a section called "Views of Anti-Mormonism/Others"? It seems to be a quote from the Book of Mormon, not from "Others", along with some weird statements about polygamy, racism, and fundamentalists. It doesn't seem to fit in well with the article as a whole at all, and certainly not in the section it's in. If somebody finds the material in that section important, can we integrate it into another section where it would more properly belong? If not, can we just get rid of the whole thing? --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 15:44, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Citing your need to review all edits is not a reason to delete them. If something is poorly written you rewite it. You are censoring the part where so-called anti-Mormonism is responsible for making Mormonism politically tolerable by civil standards, and basically making a fool out of people who whine about anti-polygamy and anti-racism being anti-Mormonism. I can hardly believe the gung ho editors here didn't see this coming, but I guess that I shouldn't be surprised it never crossed their mind. Apprarently this knowledge is now an inconvenient fact to the pre-set agenda here. If you disagree with it then just say so and we can make an entire section devoted to the balance of both views. You will find most Mormon scholars arguing in favor of the political pressure and the timely change, and it won't need to be established as a cause, merely a researched position.

<dd>Off-topic because it wasn't called anti-Mormonism? It was, and it qualifies as a proponent view of so-called anti-Mormonism that rejects the term. It would be the same as someone defending anti-Mormonism by saying it was also legitimate opposition to disagreeable social conditions proposed by Mormonism. It is advised on the NPOV tutorial page that Wikipedia be written from the proponent perspective. Anon166 22:34, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dlugar, your sort of behavior gives Mormon apologists a bad name and I don't think good writing can be poor thinking. There is a major contradiction with this article that was more apparent in the original article. It assumes that the anti-Mormon label is often wrong, but then concludes otherwise. A section is required that offers balanced views of anti-Mormonism potentially changing Mormonism for the better, or mainstreaming it, from political pressure, which ironically made it seem normal, thus allowing articles like this to pretend that the persecution was invalid. Poorly written is a poor excuse for something that doesn't fit your slant agenda. It is either a fact or not that anti-polygamy and anti-racism were anti-Mormon and valid opposition, to be decided by the reader. Deny it or don't deny it. I note that your writing values are based on obfuscation or serving a preformed conclusion. Apologists tend to be stuck in the either/or fallacy that prevents them from seeing beyond us or them, black and white, in evidence by your label for me. Anon166 15:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

From the content of your edits, I am pretty sure you are very familiar with the church, but you are not a current member of the LDS church.&#160;;^) Thinking about "What would Sherlock Holmes do?", I came to the conclusion you were an ex-mormon. Perhaps I am wrong. Frankly, Scarlet, I don't care what you are. I am interested in creating a good article so that anyone who wants to learn about anti-mormonism can come here and get a fair and balanced view of all sides.

<ol>
<li>This fits in well under Views of Latter-day Saints, in general. Concerning polygamy and blacks holding the priesthood, there is one mention of a personal email that fits - but it would still be under the LDS views heading. I'll stick something in there about it.</li>
<li>This has a little about the anti-Mormon <i>government</i> views of Oconner maybe being of benefit to the Saints by connecting them more with the rest of the nation. I didn't find anything concerning priesthood policy, and although it discussed the fact that reversing the plural marriage policy was required for statehood, it doesn't attempt to argue this as a positive thing for the Sants - merely as a step towards the continental nation we have today. I'll add this to the "Others" (implying historians) section.</li>
<li>This mentions facts (Utah had to promise no plural marriages to become a state), but doesn't make a good reference for the claim that some argue this to be <i>good for the Saints</i>.</li>
<li>Would you mind pointing to specific place where it claims the anti-Mormon activities ended up benefiting the Saints?</li>
<li>I failed to find anything here, either, concerning the eventual benefit of anti-Mormon activities for the Saints.</li>

<dd>Uriah, you are crudely avoiding the fact that the articles are used as support for a specific statement relating to a critical point, ie, a cite for political pressure for whichever change mentioned. For example, number 5 contains a simple reference to dropping an oath under government pressure, ostensibly to avoid the suspicion of treason, in order to avoid government persecution. I'm slightly surprised you went looking for overall commentary in the quotes yet uncited. Normative and socially justifiable criticism could care less what a Mormon regards as a benefit, because it is their position of making a barbarism fit into their social milieu to become accepted from a values perspective. PS. I didn't expect you to write it, I don't think you understand the nature of the viewpoint. Anon166 21:49, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You speak as though you alone get to define constructive, more evidence of bias. The paragraph is not yet written. The articles relate to what YOU refer to as anti-Mormonism, ie, government action, etc, not necessarily what they call it obviously. Perhaps you are beginning to realize what a fraud the title of this entry would be IF it insists that critics adopt the term for themselves, essentially a strawman piece.

<dd>The prefix anti- simply means "against," while Mormon refers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is, of course, simply false to say that someone is anti-Mormon simply by virtue of believing something else; to be an anti-Mormon, they must be actively engaged in opposing. Anti-Mormonism is nothing more or less than opposition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Thus, a person may be intelligent, articulate, urbane, honest, degree qualified from accredited institutions, and employing reasoned, careful arguments; but if those arguments are in opposition to the truth claims and institutional aims of the Church of Jesus Christ, then they are anti-Mormon arguments; and if the person spends a significant amount of time actively opposing the Church, whether by making such arguments or otherwise, then that person is an anti-Mormon."opposition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints".</dd>

<dd>Middle sentence is topic related to criticism, while the last sentence is person related to the opponent. Casual criticism is rarely argumentation anyway. I would add that one refers to Mormons and the other to Mormonism, argumentation being appropriate to the belief, while more superficial criticism contrasts as a sentiment towards the believers.

Besides, a cite only needs to support a claim, not report a claim. I would add that you are denying the cited author's more valid point in favor of his least valid claim.

<dd>Without any time qualifier, you are definitely casting a much broader net, which results in a term that everyone fits within. Anyone making any type of critical comment is then made anti-Mormon. Using that definition I suspect a great number of active Mormons could be classified as anti-Mormon, which does not make sense. Ed Decker would more appropriately be defined as anti-Mormon, whereas Brother Jones isn't. Ed Decker put out movies, tapes, brochures, books, etc. Brother Jones just says he thinks wearing white shirts to church was too cult-like. Argumentation is always present, the difference is that one spends a great deal of time doing it and the other just when he is putting on white shirt in his home. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:22, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, argumentation refers an argument, not a subjective criticism. The time qualifier, as you put it, is non-existent, so referring to one to be "significant amount" is absurd. It obviously refers to a level of skill as a euphemism, which they are too embarrassed to admit there are levels of skill. Additionally, I'm not sure how anyone one can go from citing a source that represents a group sentiment very well, to cherry picking a non-fact, calling it the definitive qualifier, and then citing the source as authoritative. This is the first thing someone will notice when they review this article for bias. I suggest someone competent digest all the remarks on the former link, since it is a good one, and find the ONE word that applies to the most sentiments. Anon166 15:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The claim that "Some Mormons consider anyone who argues in opposition to Mormonism to be anti-Mormon," came from my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Mormonism&amp;oldid=55806272#_note-1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Mormonism&amp;oldid=55806272#_note-1" rel="nofollow">initial rewrite</a> of the article, with <a href="http://www.antimormon.keepright.net/areyou.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.antimormon.keepright.net/areyou.htm" rel="nofollow">this link</a> as the source. That reference has since been removed, my guess is because of the quality of the reference, but honestly I don't see a Fair Boards link as being any higher quality.</dd>
<dd>However, the claim is also made in the "Correspondence between James White and Dr. Louis Midgley" link; search for the text:
<dl>
<dd>Now before getting up in arms over the label "anti-Mormon," I suggest that you consult the entry under "anti" in a dictionary. This prefix simply means "against" or "opposed to." If you are not against or opposed to the Church of Jesus Christ, to the faith of Latter-day Saints, to the Book of Mormon, to the prophetic truth claims of Joseph Smith, then have I entirely misunderstood you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In any case, with regards to the broader net, there are some Mormons who do not hesitate to label anything critical of the Church "anti-Mormonism", and would happily agree that while Brother Jones isn't an anti-Mormon, his statement about white shirts is. And if Brother Jones makes a lot of such statements, maybe he's really an anti-Mormon too. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Order_Mormons_d5c4.html" title="New Order Mormons">New Order Mormons</a> get a lot of this sort of reaction--they are typically active members of the Church, but usually for family reasons only and do not believe some/many of the foundational claims of the Church. And they certainly get labeled anti-Mormon by some.</dd>
<dd>(Note for Anon166 ... I'm not saying they <i>should</i> be labeled anti-Mormon any more than Ed Decker ought to be labeled anti-Mormon. I'm just saying that there are certainly Mormons who think this way, and because of that I think it ought to be part of the article.) --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 15:57, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do get a lot of raised eyebrows, but I have never been called anti-Mormon by fellow LDS. I particularly enjoy making irreverent comments about the leadership in Salt Lake; that is where I actually get the most raised eyebrows. However, the difference is I am very active in the church, appreciate my testimony, and enjoy serving. Sometimes the segregations you guys attempt to make simply don't apply to real people. All of these new groups that attempt to define people by their degree of committment or lack thereof, IMO, are silly. People are seldom so easily categorized and not everyone needs to be associated with a named group to feel validated. That is my soapbox. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:11, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify here, I personally don't feel that everyone needs to be categorized, so I hope that you're not including me in the "you guys" who are attempting to make segregations. I'm sure you're a great guy, but I'm also sure that there are Mormons out there who would call your irreverent comments "anti-Mormon" in nature, and most likely call you to repentance. (Perhaps you've already met some of that type.) In an ideal world, there wouldn't be any Wikipedia articles that were labels or categorizations (and maybe that's the source of Anon166's continual opposition), but this isn't an ideal world, and there are people who call everything from Decker to the Tanners to disrespectful comments about the Lord's anointed "anti-Mormon." And so all the above, I think, belong in this article--along with Decker's, Tanners', and Bro. Jones' statements about why they think what they do isn't anti-Mormon in nature. --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 05:41, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Dlugar, and that the linked b-boards is THE authoritative source in regards/support of the claim being made. It refers to SOME Mormons as a common view. The claim is, and should be that some Mormons think anyone who "argues in opposition" is anti-Mormon, because it covers the gamut of sentiments without trying to make up a fake criterion that raises more questions than it answers. The source is therefore supportive and dovetails the "argument" claim. Nobody can really dispute that part, UNLESS, we are looking for something less to say. Either way, I think that citing the single author as authoritative (not representative), is missing the point, and missing it badly. Anon166 16:19, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still have yet to find support for the argument claim in any of the sources that have been listed. <a href="http://www.antimormon.keepright.net/areyou.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.antimormon.keepright.net/areyou.htm" rel="nofollow">This one</a> says, "You might be a considered an anti-Mormon if your bias is based on an antecendant assumption that Mormonism is a fraud," which qualifies the argument. <a href="http://www.shields-research.org/Critics/A-O_02.html" class="external text" title="http://www.shields-research.org/Critics/A-O_02.html" rel="nofollow">This one</a> defines an anti-Mormon as being "against or opposed to the Church of Jesus Christ, to the faith of Latter-day Saints, to the Book of Mormon, to the prophetic truth claims of Joseph Smith," which says nothing of argument. <a href="http://www.fairboards.org/index.php?showtopic=4805&amp;st=81" class="external text" title="http://www.fairboards.org/index.php?showtopic=4805&amp;st=81" rel="nofollow">This one</a>, as I said earlier, defines an anti-Mormon as one who "spends a significant amount of time actively opposing the Church, whether by making [anti-Mormon] arguments or otherwise," which again qualifies the argument.</dd>
<dd>All of these support the idea that it takes much more than just an argument to be anti-Mormon; it takes an argument with intentions opposed to the goals of the Church. I propose changing the intro statement to read: "Some Mormons consider anyone acting in opposition to the goals of Mormonism to be anti-Mormon".

<dd>I think that being "against" something either implies leaning against or argument against. Criticism is never against unless specified, because it may be criticism of people not being Mormon enough, which does oppose Mormon claims to validity. There is no other general interpretation of "against" that I know of besides legal or violence. If someone has a beer or only pays tithing on net income, then they are acting in opposition to the goals of Mormonism, therefore anti-Mormon. Anon166 18:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Is it a site to speak about mormonism from a more critical and objectiv stanfpoint than on the topic call "Mormonism", OR IS IT JUST ANOTHER THEORETICALLY POLITICALLY CORRECT SIDE TO LOOKS LIKE IF THE BALANCE IS WELL BALANCED ON ALL SIDES" when in fact it isn't at all and people here seems mor focused on defining the well defined -by mormons, of course - word of anti mormonism , than to take care of the real problem that occur in this encyclopédie when being absolutly uncritical toward a sect, as the mormon sect is, and even afraid to utter a falslihood of a critic towards it. The mormon church is a pyramidal source and bunch of lies, unhabited by well washed and brain washed youngster, and well slited older, repeating the same in the old oh same chorus, and going nowhere from birth to death. Smiling so hypocritically as ever possible for human to be, and lying as they were told to ly and misunderstanding all as they were educated to, and hindering themselves and their progenitures to ever think a thought on their own, totaly inable to reflect deeply on the eventual truth or falsewood of their believes. Mormonism, one more reason to forbid all kind of religions from the face of the earth. Renegate it all to a museum, and I am being nice. Chew that for a nigth or two, no monkey on wiki are writing a line about Darwin theory, so I dont see why a mormon should have the right to write it all about and against mormonism.</p>

<dd>I don't advocate Nibley's quote at all. It is libelous and stupid, but others here probably fell asleep as children listening to it on tape, they are that devoted, so they are trying to dress it up as valid. Speaking of Nibley, he probably taught, by example, all of the other would-be apologists on how to argue using bogus footnotes for lack of a proper presentation. As a result, apologists today write stilted and pompous pieces that begin with the footnotes, citing them as authority when they should be representative, and then taking something ordinary and common sense, and leaving it out for lack of a citation in order to believe it. It is a strange phenomenon, but Nibley should be credited with it more widely beyond the Sunstone and Dialogue crowd. I think that poor writing is pretentious writing, and it doesn't surprise when those authors admit they don't care for its validity so long as they were fooled by it.

<dd>The quote, in the book, is officially titled: "Excerpts from an Epistle of the Elders of the Church in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad" (assuming a faithful internet rendition). Nowhere does it imply Joseph Smith wrote it, and I would add that it may not matter to Mormons who wrote anything in Mormonism, but it does to Wikipedia and unsuspecting readers when people believe it represents Mormonism's founder. Included in the the JFS book are assorted testimonies of witnesses and scriptures, and things written by Smith and Cowdery, etc. It does not mean Smith wrote it, nor does it mean J.Smith wrote it if J.F.Smith believed he did by copying from a later tract. This requires an expert to say who did write it, but the quote is NOT attributed to Smith in the book and was first published in the newspaper account under Cowdery's and Williams collaboration. <a href="http://www.boap.org/LDS/Joseph-Smith/Teachings/T2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.boap.org/LDS/Joseph-Smith/Teachings/T2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boap.org/LDS/Joseph-Smith/Teachings/T2.html</a> Anon166 18:00, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wayne Cowdery's book is professionally critiqued by the FARMS review, cited here listing it as anti-Mormon, but I couldn't find a search word to "anti-Mormon" concerning the book itself--which would be the only reason to cite this source, not because it disagrees with it. Another book cited which lists Cowdery's latest book as anti-Mormon is dated in the 1980's well before publication. Even if one argues that Cowdery is Satan and that it doesn't matter, there were other authors involved. Yet another website listing the book as anti-Mormon is anonymous and has no criterion listed, and is completely uncitable as an authority source. In fairness, this book must be deleted from the list or else a factual tag is warranted. Anon166 02:47, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Polygamy - <a href="http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/polygamy-dilemma.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/polygamy-dilemma.html" rel="nofollow">The reference</a> does make the claim that political pressure led to the change. The source would be considered anti-Mormon material</li>
<li>Priesthood/Race - <a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither5.htm" rel="nofollow">The source</a> is ambiguous (an entire book). We at least need a page number to be able to check if it validates the claim.</li>
<li>Violence - First, <a href="http://www.exmormon.org/violence.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.exmormon.org/violence.htm" rel="nofollow">the source</a> is about Mormon Fundamentalism, not Mormonism in general. Second, the wording "temple covenants" has a whole different meaning in the LDS faith and is very misleading. Third, where in this reference does it claim that anti-Mormonism was a normative influence?</li>
</ol>
<p>So, it looks like we need an LDS scholar source on #1, a page number with appropriate info and a critic source on #2, and a complete re-do or deletion on #3. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 04:17, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Normative is the category of norms, which icludes social norms. Influence is probably not mentioned either as such, but that is the description of the theme. That's probably because a title generalizes the theme, delineated by descriptions, which the citations support, not in reverse order. Similarly, your cite of Nibley and "Smith" don't contain anti-Mormon, yet you cited them as such. Your special pleading is noted. Anon166 05:02, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/od/1" class="external text" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/od/1" rel="nofollow">the manifesto</a> as a reference for "LDS scholars" believing that "past government pressure towards Mormonism as politically responsible for overturning the doctrines of polygamy"? It seems to me like that stance is doctrinal, in fact.

<dd>It's reasonable to include the Manifesto, but I wouldn't categorize it as an LDS scholar source. It seems to relate more to the concept in church doctrine that "We believe in honoring, obeying and sustaining the law." It seems to me that concept should be included. Something along the lines of,
<dl>
<dd>"Past government pressure towards Mormonism seems to be responsible for overturning the LDS doctrine of plural marriage, as indicated by Wilford Woodruff in <i>Official Declaration 1</i>: 'Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.'"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think this is accurate and supported by valid references, but it seems like it should be included in the <i>Official views</i> section. For something to go into the <i>Normative views</i> section, we need sources that have this as the main topic. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 18:41, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think any scholar in the world treats it as a coincidence, excluding perhaps those whose education began and ended in Sunday School. I must be the only one here versed in Mormon history. The point to having critics (whether anti- or fundamentalist) and LDS scholars agree on government pressure, is being generous to Mormon persecution, else the leadership reversed itself on whim and is apostate itself. Every textbook in Utah has the same government pressure story on polygamy. <a href="http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/p/POLYGAMY.html" class="external free" title="http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/p/POLYGAMY.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/p/POLYGAMY.html</a> Anon166 23:12, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sheesh, Anon166, can we ditch the vitriol? You've made some good contributions but I'm getting a bit wearied by your antagonistic approach. Who on earth said that the connection between government influence and the polygamy change was "coincidence"?! Both Uriah923 and I both agree that the connection is "accurate and supported by valid references". Uriah923's only quibble was that he thought it should be noted that the connection was <i>Official!</i> And here you come waltzing in with statements like, "I must be the only one here versed in Mormon history"?!

<ol>
<li>Grant Palmer was disfellowshipped, making his book less approachable by most members. Why remove him from the list? He's a perfect example of this.</li>
<li>I think explicitly saying "members who wish to enter LDS temples" is unnecessary. First, it requires a relatively in-depth knowledge of Mormon doctrine on the part of the reader to understand what "wishing to enter LDS temples" means. It's not just a desire or a wish, it's an integral part of being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Secondly, temple recommend interviews are not just conducted when a member wishes to enter an LDS temple--even when a person lives too far from a temple to attend, they are encouraged to have a temple recommend interview regularly anyway. Finally, the temple recommend questions may be asked on other occasions depending on your ecclesiastical leaders, for example when being called to certain positions or being ordained to the priesthood. I don't think this article is the place to educate the reader about all these nuances, hence I feel that "Ecclesiastical leaders regularly interview church members" is a reasonable description of what takes place that is understandable by non-Mormons.</li>

<dd>I removed Grant Palmer from the second list since he was already listed earlier in the paragraph under ex-mormon. It seemed to me that he should be listed as either ex-mormons or current members, but not both. He is both, but why use the same person in both lists?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for mentioning temple interviews is that the current text implies that leaders regularly interview all members and ask that question. Actually, only the more active members are interviewed, and only if they ask to be interviewed. I'm not attached to my wording, but think that we should make it clear that the interviews are voluntary and only to those who are active members. In its current state, the article is misleading. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 22:12, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your contributions, Bill--I don't expect you to follow all the talk page discussions, but I figured you'd notice your edit was reverted and make your way here eventually.&#160;:-) Glad we can get some dialogue going.</dd>
<dd>With regards to point 1, Palmer isn't an ex-mormon; he's an active member of the Church (or at least he was). I agree that that whole paragraph is rather confusingly written at the moment. Probably the bit about ex-mormons being labeled anti-mormon should be separated out of that section, because it's primarily meant to be about active members such as Palmer or Todd Compton writing negatively about the Church (or Church history), being labeled as anti-mormon, and then getting disfellowshipped or excommunicated, making members less likely to approach their works.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the second point goes, I don't see the separation of "active members" from "non-active members" to be a useful one with regards to this section. First of all, the previous sentence already mentioned "active members" so I think it's clear from context which group it's talking about. Secondly, <i>all</i> members of the Church are expected and encouraged to be "active members", so I don't see it as a useful distinction here. Furthermore, I think it's a bit misleading to say that members are interviewed only if they <i>ask</i> to be interviewed. If an active member does not currently have a temple recommend, they are frequently contacted by the bishop and asked or invited to come in for an interview. At other times (e.g. priesthood ordinations, callings) the bishop may also initiate the interview and ask similar questions. In addition, I think in most any ward or branch, if an active member is known to "support, affiliate with, or agree with" any anti-Mormon group, that person will likely be subject to disciplinary action of some sort, whether that person asks for it or not. That's the sentiment I'm trying to get across with this paragraph. Does that make sense at all? --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 03:10, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Bill. To imply that church leaders hound each member for interviews is inaccurate. Those who want to enter the temple, receive a calling or ordination or do other things that require a certain level of worthiness are interviewed to ascertain such. Dlugar, you're correct that <i>all</i> members of the church are expected to be active, but so are all members of the world population, really.</dd>
<dd>To get back to the point, though, this sentence is included to show that Church members are expected not to be involved in anti-Mormon activities if they wish to receive a temple recommend. I think it should center on that and not try to make a larger point. A link to the section on <i>Requirements for entering LDS temples</i> in <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_recommend.html#Temples_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="Temple recommend">this article</a>, would be good. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 18:23, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Do both of you think this is an accurate statement?</dd>
<dd>I'm not trying to imply that church leaders hound each member for interviews. (Depending on your leadership, this may in fact be the case&#160;:) but it's orthogonal to the point I'm trying to make.) I just don't want the statement to get too watered down.

<dd>I have no problem with either version. Perhaps something like "may be subjected to disciplinary actions such as being released from certain leadership positions, being refused entry into the temple, disfellowshipment, or possibly excommunication."&#160;? That gives the reader an idea of the range of possible actions. There might be Bishoprics in Utah that hound people for temple recommend interviews, but I've been Exec Sec for half a dozen Bishops and have never seen that in the Philly area.&#160;;^) <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 17:53, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there is a real difference between Utah Mormon culture and Mormon culture elsewhere in the US. I think Utah suffers from the same problems when any relgion dominates an area such as Catholicism in France or Western Europe in general. My experience with Bishopric's in the South and in the Northwest is they don't go out of their way to discipline people. Inividual memebers have to become flagrantly, aggressively hostile to the church before discipline of any type is brought up. Releasing people from callings is also more complex. If someone is going to start teaching false doctrine, there will be other issues that develope. First, why would someone continue to attend a church with which they disagree. A gospel doctrine teacher is not going to be the calling they would have. However, it would not be surprising to find them teaching primary children. I would think this has to be soft-peddled more than anything. In the general church body we seldom see witch hunts. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:50, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The source of the quote is from <i>The Morning and the Evening Star</i> and edited by Cowdery and Williams, unattributed to Smith, and assumed to be from Cowdery and Williams, attested by their author pronoun throughout the text ("we..."). This is why Wikipedia discourages secondary quotes, to discourage people from using a bogus one to supersede the primary quote, as you are doing. W.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Nibley Quote</span></h3>
<p>Can somebody verify that the Nibley quote is correct? It doesn't sound like it is correct. I can't imagine him using "usually become sometimes ...". Also, I haven't read this one, but I have read several sarcastic articles by Nibley. Is this one of them? <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 01:37, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correct as in accurate? Don't know for sure, but I think it is. He talked that way all the time. He would routinely go off against other respected academics who didn't take him seriously because he was posing as an Egyptologist, which he was not. He was not good at much except combative Mormon apologetics, and I don't mean his footnotes in other languages from books where only a few copies existed. Look how his entire quote can be reversed to make a perfect projection of the criticism and judge his genius for yourself:</dd>

<dd>"<i>Apologists</i> usually become sometimes feverishly active, determined to prove to the world and themselves that it is <i>not</i> a fraud after all. What is that to them? Apparently it is everything—it will not let them alone. At the other end of the scale are those who <i>have nothing to prove</i> and <i>instead</i> retain a sentimental affection for the Church—they just believe in the gospel. I know quite a few of them. But how many of them can leave it alone? It haunts them all the days of their life. No one who has <i>never</i> had a testimony ever forgets or denies that he <i>doesn't</i> have it—that it was something that really happened to him. Even for such people who have it, a testimony cannot be reduced to a <i>delusion.</i>" Anon166 02:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you will find a range of beliefs within Mormonism regarding these two issues. Can a prophet change doctrine? It is possible, but it is not a question LDS think about. It is a foreign concept. Does a prophet receive revelation to guide the church today? LDS would say yes emphatically. Is it possible to change doctrine? Yes. However, I think you need to be very careful with teminology. Was it doctrine that Blacks could not hold the Priesthood? No, it was not doctrine, but rather policy. At the time of Joseph there were blacks that held the priesthood. Later it became formal policy. The Adam-God theory was mentioned by Brigham, but was it "doctrine"? No. Brigham mentioned it on several occaisions and it appears to have entered theology, but was rejected.</dd>
<dd>Second question regarding God being as man. We look at Lorenzo Snow's statement and the King Follet funeral sermon by Joseph and one might think so. However, we look at numerous scriptures and one might just as comfortably say no. Were they teaching the concept of eternal progression; i.e. that our Father in Heaven has created the possibility for us to become like Him? My hand would go up to support that. However, I have never been comfortable with the statement that he was a man, but it is said and taught by many people.</dd>
<dd>Interestingly, when we speak of these things we are speaking of mysteries. They are not part of scripture and are not doctrine, but are part of theology. I liken it to conversations about angels or Saints within Catholicism. At times it is fun to speculate, but at the end of the day seldom does the conversation bring us closer to the Holy Spirit.</dd>
<dd>Anti-Mormon literature specializes in sensationalizing the beliefs of Mormonism...Satan is the brother of Christ, God was once a man, etc. Not one of these concepts or beliefs brings one person to salvation. The problem is never once do they ever talk about why LDS believe some of these things. One might diagree with their interpretation of scripture, but that is the very best you can do; state you disagree with the interpretation.</dd>
<dd>Beliefs presented in context seldom come across as sensationalism, but take them out of context and we could all have a field day. For example, Christains are cannibals and they teach their children to eat the flesh and drink the blood of their God...weekly. Christians teach that all you have to do is walk down the aisle and accept that their God was murdered by Jews and thats it; they are saved. They don't have to do anything else. Both of these teachings are true statements of Christianity, but when taken out of context and sensationalized it sounds sort of odd doesn't it? There is a marked difference between criticism and anti-Mormonism and for that reason anti-Mormonism causes such a strong reaction. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:24, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I've made a couple more changes. The "so-and-so claims Mormons believe X" I think is rather wordy.

I've changed the "multi-tiered paradise" to the style of (b), and the "God was once a man" to the style of (a).

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Definition of doctrine</span></h3>
<p>To me the statement re changing existing doctrine depends on your definition of doctrine. What is the "doctrine" of the church? What is the difference between a revelation and a doctrine? etc. As the article on <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> discusses - the use of the word varies greatly. When used, by myself and Mormons I know, in common speech (i.e. sermons at church and common conversation), the context of the use indicates to me that most Mormons use the word to mean <i>core religious principles</i>. Thus the resistance from Mormons that the prophet can change existing doctrine - the prophet can't change the doctrine that Christ is the Son of God, the doctrine of the atonement, the doctrine of repentence, the doctrine of baptism, etc. However, Mormons do believe that revelation continues to this day, thus changes can occur - even to things that seem to be core to outsiders. For example, Mormonism was for a long time defined as "that religion that allows you to have more than one wife." Thus the active practice of polygamous relationships were seen as core by some, however, polygamy was always limited, the doctrine still exists, but its practice is not permitted at this time. So what changed - the doctrine or the behaviour? - thx for the links by the way. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 07:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps "doctrine" is a poor choice of words. "Receive ongoing revelation" doesn't convey to the average reader that the president of the Church can change things like the temple ceremony, whether polygamy is practiced, whether polygamy is essential for salvation, whether blacks will ever receive the priesthood, things like that. McConkie called stuff like this "doctrine" (or at least gave the title to a book containing stuff like this), but there are a great many Mormons who disagree that such things should be labeled "doctrine". Is there any way of phrasing it such that it conveys to the average reader that, as Trödel states, "things that seem to be core to outsiders" can change, without stating it in such a way that Mormons would disagree? I don't think the "clarify doctrine" thing really how significant the changes can be. I mean, the whole point of this section is to show how mainstream Christians consider Mormonism to be so different as to be non-Christian. Most Christians wouldn't have a problem with religious leaders "clarifying doctrine" or "changing practices", but they <b>would</b> have a problem with their religious leaders making such large changes to core practices. --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 06:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just read Storm Rider's long section above, and how it relates to this point here. I think my main question is: what do you call things like "blacks cannot hold the priesthood" or "Adam-God theory" or "polygamy is required for salvation" or "God was once a man" or the other multitude of things that have been taught over the pulpit but never officially canonized as doctrine? SR uses the term "theology" to refer to these non-canonical teachings which can be changed. Is that unambiguous enough to use in the article?</dd>
<dd>Also related is the idea of "practice" vs. "doctrine". The prophet can't change the doctrine that Jesus Christ is the son of God, but he can clarify what that means, possibly changing the beliefs of many members. The prophet can't change the doctrine of baptism, but he can change who can be baptized, when they can be baptized, and how baptism should be performed. The prophet can't change the doctrine of repentance, but he can change what qualifies as proper repentance and he can change what processes a person has to go through to repent of specific sins. So my question is: how do we convey in the article the idea that the prophet <b>can</b> change all the things I said he can change <b>without</b> giving the impression that the prophet can change the things he can't change? --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 07:07, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good points. I think "theology" would be a good way to go. IMO, the Mormon Church accepts the idea that the Prophet receives revelation from God that can change <i>theology</i> but not necessarily <i>doctrine</i> - at least in the way you outlined it above. We don't need to get into a complex discussion of this on the Anti-Mormonism article, though. In fact, what is on the page now looks decent: "the belief that the president of the Church is a living prophet with the ability to receive ongoing revelation and, as Jack Welch explains, to clarify doctrine and change practices related to that doctrine". <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 14:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree - good points. The difference is subtle. For example the I can't really imagine a change to the Jesus Christ is the Savior, the son of God that would clarify what that means since the docrine is very specific - seperate being, only begotten, etc. You make a good point about baptism, to be baptized, for example, one can't be on probation or in jail(in general), can't be late on child support payments, must attend church services, but these are more like policies - where the doctrine is that all men must repent, and be baptised by immersion by one having the priesthood authority to act in the name of God whereby one enters into a covenant with God to declare ones intent to follow Jesus Christ, always remember Him and covenant to keep His commandments).</dd>
<dd>With that said I think the wording as stands (even though some of it is mine☺) conveys this nuance pretty well. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 17:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With regards to clarification about Jesus Christ, I was thinking about stuff like Jehovah of the Bible ...

<p>I have mixed feelings about the links in the "critical" section. We need to be sure this remains an article <i>about</i> anti-Mormonism and not a summary of criticisms. Right now, the links under "apologist" are actually <i>about</i> anti-Mormonism, while the links under "critical" are just sites that many consider anti-Mormon. I think things should be modified so only articles <i>about</i> anti-Mormonism (from all viewpoints) are included in the external links section. The sites commonly considered anti-Mormon should probably be included in the Modern section, but not simply as a list. A short paragraph about the Internet being a very common local for what is deemed anti-Mormon activities, along with a couple of the most prominent examples and then perhaps a footnote with more.

<dd>I'm confused as to what the problem is here--the citation refers to the LDS-Mormon.com web site, which wasn't written by the Tanners.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Due to numerous requests from individuals confused about how to go about quitting the LDS Church, the Tanners felt it necessary to provide accurate information for those who they felt had the legal right to leave.

<dd><i>Within three months, representatives from the LDS Church's law firm served legal papers threatening them that if they didn't remove the material by 2 p.m. that day, they would be sued for copyright infringement. It was the first time the LDS Church had acknowledged the Tanners' existence. Though Sandra and Jerald didn't feel they had violated any copyright laws, they nevertheless removed the material by 1 p.m. and posted the church's letter to them in its place.</i></dd>

<dd><i>In reporting the story, the Salt Lake Tribune listed Internet addresses that contained the entire handbook, causing a rush of individuals to connect to the sites. As e-mails poured onto the Tanner's public web pages, several messages listed the same Internet addresses resulting in a complaint by LDS attorneys to the judge.

<dd>

<dd><i>News affiliates from around the country, including The New York Times and numerous computer magazines, picked up the story warning of a "chilling effect" and a "blow to a key feature of the Web."

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Finally, in November 2002, the LDS Church dropped the suit on the condition that the Tanners agree to destroy all copies and not print more than 50 words at a time from the handbook in any future articles. "It's ridiculous. We could eventually print the entire handbook, 50 words at a time," laughs Sandra. "The suit was just an obvious attempt to try to shut us down. To this day, other sites still post the entire handbook, and anyone can find them with just a simple search."</i></dd>

<dd>I've read that and the other articles - however, they don't contradict the fact that the Tanner's posted the entire manual before reducing to 17 pages. (note by Posting I mean providing a file for downloading and not necessarily converting all the text to HTML) And the links they provided also had the full text not just the 17 pages including a link to a website "chi" which continues to have the full text (based out of a scandinavian country) - and who hated microsoft so much that even if you wanted to see the manual you couldn't if you used internet explorer. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 00:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, the Salt Lake City Weekly article says , "Regardless of their compliance, the LDS Church filed a copyright lawsuit..." Unfortunately this is not a NPOV description of the situation as the Tanner's did not comply with the request since they continued to be a contributory infringer. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 01:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think they were infringing. Where does it say that besides in what you wrote in the main article? In every article I read, the LDS church had "sued them anyway." You seem to imply that the Tanner's did anything wrong. In fact, most observers think what they did was fair use, and experts offered this insight in articles I read. They often acknowledged that the suit was to put them under. Anon166 01:32, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Fair_use" id="Fair_use"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Fair use</span></h3>
<p>There is obviously a disagrement over whether the use was fair use or infringement; thus the lawsuit. Title 17, US Code, Section 107 four factors to be considered in determining whether or not a particular use is fair:</p>
<ol>
<li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</li>
<li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li>
<li>amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</li>
<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the US Copyright office explains, "The distinction between “fair use” and infringement may be unclear and not easily defined."<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Therefore to imply that they "sued them anyway" is not a neutral representation of the situation. Although 17 pages doesn't seem like much, in <i>Basic Books, Inc. v. Kinko's Graphics Corporation</i> use of a small percentages of the works were copied; however the court ruled that the copying infringed. So the answer is not as clear cut as you describe.</p>
<p>The case also got national attention because it was a case of first impression. The Tanners did remove the material from their website; however they continued to provide links to other websites which provided the material, and the Church sued them for contributory infringement. The courts had not looked at this type of case where the relationship between the initial infringment and the contributor infringement involved internet linking and downloading. Many commentators felt that the case could have a chilling effect on the internet if a website that linked to a second website could be held to be a contributary infringer based on the second's infringement. However, this was a sensationalistic view of the situation, as it ignored the initial infringement of the Tanners (contributory infringement requires actualy infringment - see <a href="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/12/cyber/cyberlaw/10law.html" class="external text" title="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/12/cyber/cyberlaw/10law.html" rel="nofollow">The New York Times article</a> that supports this view, but also provides information about the distinguishing characteristics - including Judge Campbell's analysis that it was the prior infringement that could give rise tothe contributory cause of action).</p>
<p>Finally, the last comment, "They often acknowledged that the suit was to put them under," is an interesting one, as it implies that someone else is accusing the church of using the suit to put the Tanner's under, and the Tanners are merely agreeing with that assessment. However, it ignores the alternative view of the situation, i.e. that the Tanners benefited financially from the publicity of the case, both in increased revenues to their bookstore and increased hits to their website. Unfortunately, despite "acknowledging that the suit was to put them under," the Tanners did not provide any evidence to support the view. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 02:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I note that your commentary implies that this case doesn't seem to blame them for providing it for download as you suggested. Finally, you may sit and worry about POV all you want, but the fact remains that they complied, and they got sued anyway, as most summaries concluded. The internet community followed this case, with many comments implying the legal mismatch, and the tactic, similar to Scientology, that uses the legal system for revenge. Just because you can't see it any other way, by way of sworn devotion, doesn't make anyone else guilty of POV. The Tanners are presumed innocent until proven otherwise.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>the fact remains they partially complied, they got sued, and a judge ruled they did not comply despite thier claim to the contrary. I can see it other ways - in fact if I was to argue the Tanners view I would argue that they could not be considered to be contributorily negligent because there was no causal connection between the initial infringement and the subsequent contributory actions since there was no proof that the sites they linked to originally acquired the copyrighted material from the tanners, but could have just as easily acquired it from the anonymous person who sent it to the tanners. Unfortunately, they settled the case, continue to claim they were persecuted, and just like much of their anti-mormon material - provide no verifiable evidence of their claims - just continued inuendo and self reference. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 16:28, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Presumed innocent until proven otherwise. I made no direct association to guilt, and you are the one talking about POV concerning statements made of the Tanners, which I defined as innocent until proven otherwise. It had nothing to do with law. Injunctions don't make your point either, which only made it "controversial" and that leads me to question your POV here. Anyone with NPOV would see it that way. I suppose this is a bad time to ask since you are apparently upset, but do you intend on removing the POV you placed in the article implying that they provided the source information for full download? Is there a reason you need the reader to presume their lack of innocence? Anon166 16:56, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not upset - just emphasizing my point - the injunction has a high level of proof - the judge must find that the party requesting the injunction is "likely to prevail" and will suffer "irreperable harm" - of course there is a trial to show otherwise; however, the Tanners felt it wise to not take that risk (as did the Church) so they found a way to settle the charges. The arguments you are making about the Tanner's lawsuits are those of the pop culture and the technology journals and do not reflect an understanding of the law or the case.</dd>

<p>What happened to this section? It's now poorly written, full of spelling errors, and in my estimation gutted. I realize that we don't want this article to be full of criticisms of Mormonism, but I think it's fair to mention some of the basic doctrinal differences. Also the phrase "Some of these anti-Mormon Christians" illustrates the primary difficulty of this article--trying to describe anti-Mormonism without labeling people as anti-Mormon. I don't like the turn this section has taken--does anyone else feel the same? --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 04:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dlugar, I agree with that and much more. There is very little balance in the article, which informationally serves the strawman view that anti-Mormon is anyone opposed to a purity of thought, rather than sincerely opposed to thought reform itself--including defending attacks on their own beliefs going unanswered. This strawman view serves the growing fundamentalist faction of Mormonism, that seeks to define loyalty as righteousness, never conscience. Utah would be a polygamous poverty zone opposed to the US government without so-called anti-Mormons.Anon166 16:42, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It should be objective and informative - just like the article on Mormons shouldn't be written from a Mormon point of view. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 04:58, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me be as clear as I can on my point of view. This article is on "Anti-Mormonism", but it is as neutral as we can write it from (as far as I can tell) Mormons writing it. We need someone who holds an opposing point of view to add more information from the "other side". We've had this discussion before but found no one who would admit to holding a view openly hostile to those of the Latter Day Saint movement and be willing to write about it with (supported) facts here on Wikipedia. Do we have someone now?</dd>
<dd>Or do you have another proposal to bring balance to this article?</dd>
<dd>I ask both of these questions not to be hostile myself, but because this article does need to be balanced. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 05:17, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually the problem is not that there haven't been those who are more familiar with that point of view being willing to write - the problem is that no one yet has been willing to suffer the pains of verification and scholarship analysis on their writing - and they have gotten frustrated with the rigors of the neutral point of view policy, classifying it as watering down the truth by the mormons - and some of them even going so far as to suggest consipiracies between mormon leaders and Wikipedia administrators.</dd>
<dd>I have yet to meet, in person or online, a person who firmly believes in all the anti-mormon literature, who can abide any challenge to their faith in Joseph Smith's accusers, ie who are willing to allow the same level of scrutiny to be applied to the motives and character of the sources they are trying to use to impeach Joseph. Of course, although that is my experience, it also is my POV showing&#160;;) --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 20:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking over the article as it now stands, I basically see mostly information that is negative about people who oppose the LDS Church. First it labels them anti-Mormon, then aligns them with murderers and mobsters from the 1800s. In the "Christian groups" section, the opposition is reduced to "Kingdom of the Cults" and General Conference street preachers, and then a paper with one Christian group admitting how crappy their anti-Mormon material is--all without any reference to <i>why</i> Christian groups would oppose Mormonism. Then there's the Tanners and Decker in the "Exmormon" section, again with primarily negative information about them. Then finally we get to a long section with quotes from Church leaders and apologists, until we finally get to the end--the "Rejection of the term" section, which is the only page in the entire article that isn't apologetic in nature (although several people have tried to add quotes from apologists to this section).</dd>
<dd>So ... what is to be done? I don't know. I don't think having an anti-Mormon rewrite the article will make it any better. I <b>do</b> feel like one of the major points in this article should be <b>why</b> people have opposed Mormonism, both historically and today, not just the actions they take. See <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> for an example.</dd>
<dd>One question: what do you (each of you) see as the primary point of this article? Who will come to Wikipedia looking for this article? What will that person want information on? What will that person <i>not</i> want information on? What will they be most interested in finding out about? I think focusing on that will help us gain a new focus for the article and a more coherent vision for its contents.

<dd>Thanks for the feedback - I will compare the anti-americanism article and see what I can do. For me there is a big difference between "anti-Mormons" and legitimate scholarly criticism - and maybe both should be addressed in this article and distinguished. It is difficult to do so: just look at the comments on this talk page you will see what examples of anti-mormon behavior.</dd>
<dd>For me it will be hard to write about why they opposed Mormonism - because it will have many of the same faults that you mention - you ask a good question "why" people oppose mormonism? --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 12:48, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you're saying now, and basically you're asking for more information, in which case I agree. As it is, however, I think the info is objective and fact-supported. I also think that we've created a good outline and organization for the article from which it should be able to grow. The only thing it lacks, in essence, is an "expert" - and by that I don't mean someone who is hostile to the Church, but someone who has done serious research on the issue. Hopefully one will come along and help the cause. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">uriah923</a><sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/i/User_talk%7EUriah923_c4a1.html" title="User talk:Uriah923">talk</a>)</sup> 06:03, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dlugar makes some excellent observations, and asks the question "why are there anti-mormons"? I think that would be an excellent section to add.</p>
<p>There are several major objections/justifications I have heard from anti-Mormons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They claim exclusively to be the "true church" (like Catholics)</li>
<li>The actively try to convert other christians (like Jehovah's Witnesses)</li>
<li>Their beliefs are radically different than traditional christianity. (Perceived lessening the status of Jesus and Heavenly Father)</li>
<li>Additional scriptures (and perceived treatment of Bible as "second class" scripture)</li>
<li>Rapid growth in membership and the tendency to stay and act together (like Nauvoo)</li>
<li>Tendency to break previous ties - early converts leaving home and travelling west; modern converts tend to not associate with former friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure we could come up with more as we think about this. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 05:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
