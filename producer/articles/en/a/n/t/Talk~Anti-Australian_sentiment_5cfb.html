<p>I removed references to East Timor's being communist, and the invasion happening during the Cold War, because they seemed likely to create the false impression that Australia's motivation for supporting the invasion was anti-communism. The Whitlam government was the most left-wing Australia's ever had, not given to Red-baiting; all I've been able to find on this topic suggests that Whitlam was motivated not by anti-communism but only by a belief that it would be easier to do business with Indonesia. If somebody can find a reference for anti-communism as a motivation for Whitlam, feel free to re-add this. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 01:56, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there is a small amount of truth in the allegation about fears of Soviet/Maoist type regimes. I recall the use of typical Cold War phrases like "another Cuba, on our doorstep". Not all of the strident anti-communists had joined the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Labor_Party_cf5b.html" title="Democratic Labor Party">Democratic Labor Party</a>. So, my theory is that in 1975, this "commophobia" dovetailed with the long-standing sympathy to Indonesian nationalism in the Labor Party (expressed, e.g., in the idea Indonesians were just doing what India had done in <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa.html" title="Goa">Goa</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pondicherry.html" title="Pondicherry">Pondicherry</a>) and a sense that E.Timor was "too small to go it alone". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 07:47, Nov 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is article tries really really hard to be relevant but doesn't quite make it. Australians are some of the "best-liked" people in the world, have a friendly, sports-based rivalry with Brits and Kiwis, though things sometimes turn "bitter." C'mon.</p>
<p>It's not badly written but at points turns into sop: <i>Australia's Western sensibilities often bring it into conflict with its less Westernised neighbours. Australia has a strong ethos of tolerance</i> (Uh, POV?) <i>and rights of the individual. This often leads Australians to object to human rights abuses in neighbouring Asian countries; these countries are likely to interpret such objections as an attempt to meddle in their internal affairs and lack of respect for their sovereignty.</i></p>
<p>I can vaguely see an Austalian-Indonesian relations article coming out of this as much of it deals with how the two countries fail to see eye-to-eye but his doesn't amount to a prejudice worthy of inclusion here particularly as it seems a largely bilateral thing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 07:44, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am inclined to disagree. Differing attitudes to human rights have, in the recent past, brought Australia into conflict with Indonesia, China, Malaysia. and probably quite a few other nations too, but those three are all recent and well-publicised, so I happen to remember them. The point of the para is valid. The expression, of course, is ... er ... how did Marskell put it? Sop. I suggest that we re-phrase the para in an NPOV way and then reinsert it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 10:55, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have excised from the article this recently added paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The treatment of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia is perhaps one of the earliest elements of Australian domestic policy to arouse a negative view of the Australian people. As early as the 1890s criticism and controversy occurred over the dwindling populations or abuses that the aboriginal peoples faced. Although at that point the issue was as much, or more, about Britain than Australia. Later however the policies that inspired events dramatized in films like <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit-Proof_Fence_b2a3.html" title="Rabbit-Proof Fence">Rabbit-Proof Fence</a> encouraged the image of Australians as virulent racists.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There may be something that can be taken from it, but as it was written, it wasn't entirely clear. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 09:12, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have excerised this peice of absolute conjecture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Some <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a> among Australians in regard to Indonesians — manifested, for example, in beliefs that Indonesians wish to annex Australian territory and that Australia should acquire <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>, to alleviate the risk — is also a factor in tensions between the two countries."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMHO most of this article is unsubstantiated conjecture and supposition. It is almost entirely unsupported by citations. I really seriously feel this page is a waste of space.</p>
<p>I have also removed this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Modern Australia's origins as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_colony.html" title="Penal colony">penal colony</a> have proved difficult to shake off in terms of the country's image overseas, especially considering that the most numerically significant wave of immigration came during the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_gold_rushes.html" title="Australian gold rushes">Australian gold rushes</a> of the <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850s.html" title="1850s">1850s</a>."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is factually incorrect, as well as badly written. See Australian Government, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs<a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/facts/04fifty.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.immi.gov.au/facts/04fifty.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for data on immigration. Specifically it says that the most numerically significant immigration to Australia was post World War II.</p>
<p>--Morgan Leigh 12:47 PM, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Numerically, yes, <i>proportionally</i> no. The white population increased from 400,000 in 1850 to 1.2 million in 1861.<a href="http://www.australia-migration.com/page/History/238" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.australia-migration.com/page/History/238" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> That is an increase of 20% per year. Roughly 2% of the entire population of the UK (which included Ireland at the time), emigrated to NSW and Victoria alone. The post-WW2 one million per decade, while significant, cannot top the 1850s. I am going to reinstate that passage. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 06:29, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where's the evidence for the supposition that some Brits can't stand Aussies because of their soaps&#160;?

<dd>I'm sorry, but conservative Britons are probably the <i>least</i> likely people in the world to be anti-Australian. For most conservatives, the image of Australia is connected far more to the shared institutions (the Monarchy, the Commonwealth of Nations, etc), shared history (particularly the World Wars), expatriates (both ways), and sport (particularly the Ashes), rather than to Kylie Minogue and Holly Valance 'corrupting' our youth. If we're discussing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservatives</a>, rather than conservatives, that observation is even clearer: <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynton_Crosby_de92.html" title="Lynton Crosby">Lynton Crosby</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Platell_6d2a.html" title="Amanda Platell">Amanda Platell</a> serving as strategy advisors at the last two general elections, and the Australian Liberal Party is the strongest ally that the Conservative Party has in international politics. Frankly, this seems as though either someone has blown out of all proportion Ashes-fuelled rivalry, or someone is trying to find incidence of anti-Australianism where none exists.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's not to say that anti-Australianism doesn't exist elsewhere. Besides that in New Zealand, there is quite considerably anti-Australianism in France (hitherto unmentioned in the article), due to competition with Australian vinyards, Australian membership of the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_of_the_Willing_c84a.html" title="Coalition of the Willing">Coalition of the Willing</a>, and French jealousy at the close ties that the UK retains with its former colony. If <i>that</i> needs to be articulated in the article (and it really should be), it would be a small task. However, crying wolf over a few Australian soap operas is hardly fair. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 01:01, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>What you have to remember is that the UK and Australia still have a pretty close relationship, for two countries so far apart, and while that reflects a continuing closeness, familiarity has created a certain contempt in both places I think. The point is not about <i>majority</i> opinion in the UK, or about political (big C)Conservatives. It is about "cultural conservatives". Things may have changed a bit in the last 13 years but I lived in London in 1991-92 and my experience was that there was persistent low-level sneering about the soaps and Aussie culture in general, from (e.g.) the likes of newspaper columnists and other people in the media. Of course these people were completely out of touch with the 10-15 million people watching Neighbours every day.... <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 02:30, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mention the Conservative Party because it is the best weathervane for conservative (and classically liberal) opinion in the UK. Whereas both William Hague and Michael Howard appointed Australians to manage their PR, Tony Blair complained (after the Crosby appointment) that the Conservatives were importing foreigners. In the resulting debate, the Conservatives proved themselves to consider Australians to be their brothers and sisters (using practically that exact argument), whereas Labour and Lib Dems pretended as though we shared nothing. Either it is the left-wing that has an issue with Australians (which is unlikely, given other factors) or Labour and the Lib Dems were being opportunistic (which is a certainty) and there is no anti-Australian sentiment worth noting.</dd>
<dd>I can also assure you that there is no contempt for Australian culture whatsoever. The British public and media readily accept Australians as their own. One only has to look at the list of prominent Australians that have set up base in London, or have achieved disproportionate success in the UK to see that. It also works the other way, with over a 800,000 Britons holidaying in Australia each year, and 200,000 Britons retired to Australia.</dd>
<dd>Yes, there is sneering, from some quarters, towards Neighbours and Home and Away, but only to the same extent that there is towards Coronation Street, Eastenders, and all other soaps. I can't imagine that anybody hates Neighbours or Home and Away simply because they're Australian (and, if they do, it can hardly be attributed to being conservative). Perhaps they aren't quite as appreciated as British soaps are because the cultural references don't transfer, the accents are annoying, and the situations, particularly sunny weather, are sometimes incongruous for the British viewer. Then again, that's not anti-Australianism, but the mark of a discerning audience that would just as readily discriminate against a British soap with those problems.</dd>
<dd>For the record, today, the idea that the country used to grind to a halt to watch Neighbours (as it did) is laughable. Nowadays, Neighbours might get three million or so. However, even that audience displays a deep appreciation of Australian culture. One only has to see a list of Australian singers that have achieved major success in the UK to see that.</dd>
<dd>All of this makes for a very interesting discussion in the article (and I'll be only too pleased to write much of it), but it also goes to show that any generalisations about the conservatives or Britons in general are out of place. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 03:01, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"The accents are annoying"? Ahem....LOL&#160;:-D. In fact, the sneering I referred to often came from left-leaning sources like <i>The Guardian</i> or <i>The Independent</i>. (I was so incensed by one article in the Indy that I wrote them a letter.) The origin/source doesn't make it any less "culturally conservative", and I suspect that had I been a regular reader of the <i>Telegraph</i>, I would have been more frequently annoyed. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 06:07, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>some British cultural conservatives dislike the supposed vulgarity and/or bad examples for young British people, demonstrated by Australian popular culture. The most common targets of such discontent are Australian soap operas shown on British television, such as Neighbours and Home and Away.</i></p>
<p>Is this for real? Can someone cite specific examples of such criticsm? <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastie_a178.html" title="User:Bastie">Bastie</a> 01:14, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Australia had an assortment of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trust_territories.html" title="Trust territories">trust territories</a> throughout the region. There wasn't any resentment in any of them at independence; IIRC, Papua was hopefull of becoming the seventh state. Anti-Australian sentiment in those areas is a relatively recent (and minor) phenonmenon, probably attributable to recent/current foreign policies. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 05:06, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article needs an intro that summarises the who, why and when. At the moment it consists of a theoretical definition, how <b>well</b>-liked Aussies are and stuff about convicts - whose connection with the article is not well explained. Once readers get over their astonishment at the existence of this article, they should be able to quickly get an idea of who the dastardly antis are, why they're anti and whether this is just a phenom that has arisen in the last 10 years or has existed since the convict era or whenever. <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 09:32, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the contrary I feel it lacks address of the prime points of anti-Australian sentiment and purposively allocates the point of view as external to Australia whereas most anti-Australian sentiment is held by people -within- Australia. This underlying issue is rarely addressed, however. <a href="../../../2/1/1/User%7E211.30.80.121.html" title="User:211.30.80.121">211.30.80.121</a> 20:08, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>POV about this section, <i>"Although Australian contingents have been much smaller"</i></p>
<p>Why is it defending 'the size' of the contingents anyway? Australian troops help the effort, whatever the effort is.</p>
<p>The text about people being anti-Australian because of ties with the USA and being the USA's puppet as far as the WOT, I always have a problem with this mentality, I think it is POV, and I seriously doubt Australian's PM -- or any other country's PM of which the citizens have this mentality -- believes he is acting on behalf of <i>anything</i> but his own country and world security. Australia makes its own decisions. Australia initiates its own actions. Australia is powerful country and can take responsiblity.</p>
<p>And to top it off, 'American Imperialism' is POV as well. <a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugplumxx_65e5.html" title="User:Sugplumxx">Sugplumxx</a> 03:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
