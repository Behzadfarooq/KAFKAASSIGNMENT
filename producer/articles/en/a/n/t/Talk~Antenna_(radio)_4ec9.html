<p>This article has grown by each of us throwing in a nugget until it is overwhelming textbook. Check out this TOC! I have seen some of this addressed better in other articles anyway. Someone please help list the mainstream stereotype antenna ideas that need to be put in front of someone who looks up the word "Antenna." Can we move or merge the esoteric issues that antenna experts want to know about into specialized articles? If we do this will everyone be hurt if we don't each get our favorite topic covered well enough? I propose the following outline; can anyone help make it 'good'?</p>

<dd>The amplitude depends on the desired power output. <a href="../../../f/r/s/FRS_5926.html" title="FRS">Family Radio Service</a> is limited to 500 miliwatts. 5 watts is considered to be the maximum safe power output for a handheld radio. 50 watts is considered to be the maximum safe power output for a radio with the antenna on a car roof.

<p>I came by here to add some material about arthropod antenna. But I noted in passing that the discussion of radio antenna focuses pretty much entirely on low-medium-high frequency resonant wire antennae. It seems to me that some additional material on the isomorphy between lenses, reflecting antenna and wire antenna might be appropriate as well as some mention of non-resonant travelling wave antennae like the Beverage and resonant magnetic field antennae like the ubiquitous medium wave tuned loop.</p>
<p>I might come back sometime and do the loop part which I understand. I'm not the right person to do the rest -- DJK</p>

<p><i>The electrically short antenna is far less than 1/4 wavelength in length. Unlike nearly all other antennas in this list, this antenna detects the electric field of the wave instead of the electromagnetic field.</i></p>
<p>I don't understand this statement. I'm fairly certain the distinction made between "electric field" and "electromagnetic field" doesn't make any sense, but could somebody please confirm?--<a href="../../../j/f/b/User%7EJfbolus_3a45.html" title="User:Jfbolus">Jfbolus</a> 07:11, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a difference since you can receive more or less completley only the electric component of the electromagnetic field. There are also antennas for the magnetic component for ex.: coil antennas, loop antennas, ferrite antennas. --Xnor 17:55, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you're trying to say that a short antenna is excited only by the electric field of a propogating wave, then you're correct, but the quoted statement still doesn't make sense. The electric field is part of the electromagnetic field. The whole "electrically short antennas" bullet point should probably be removed anyway, since its already covered in the <a href="../../../d/i/p/Dipole_antenna.html" title="Dipole antenna">Dipole antenna</a> page. --<a href="../../../j/f/b/User%7EJfbolus_3a45.html" title="User:Jfbolus">Jfbolus</a> 12:57, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What should the plural of antenna (in the sense of a radio antenna) be? Several sources give it as 'antennas' and the insect variety of antenna as 'antennae'. I have always used the latter for radio antennae. Are both correct, or, as I suspect, the 'American' spelling the one that prevails?</p>

<dd>The correct plural of antenna is, in the radio sense, <b>antennas</b>. The correct plural of antenna, in the biological sense of what insects have on their head, <b>antennae</b>. They are not interchangable, and antennae is wrong for radio usages (though still occasionally used within the industry by people who think they know better). <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 11:33, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the UK at least, engineers use the plural <i>Antennas</i> but as this is a little known fact outside the field you will hear the general public speaking of <i>Antennae</i>. I asked the BBC about this a few years ago and they agreed to change policy on their news web site news.bbc.co.uk and you will see (radio) <i>Antennas</i> used consistently these days.

<p>That sounds consistent with what I have heard. Also, Latin bases are very important in biology, but precise engineering and physics are in mathematics, so there is less need for classical languages. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<p>Someone added a comment that an antenna can't be designed for both transmitting and receiving. This is a false statement. It's something I do every time I make an antenna.</p>
<p>Transmitting antennas are really a subset of receiving antennas. If you design it to transmit well on a specific frequency range, it will also receive well on that range, and with the same radiation pattern. Designing and testing for optimal transmission also insures optimal reception.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between the two is that transmission antennas work best if impedance matched. With a receiving antenna, the receiver(radio) needs to be optimally impedance matched. (It helps if the radio and antenna are matched to each other, but the load is more critical--as already stated in the article.)</p>
<p>Also, most antennas desgined for receiving only are tuned for broadcast frequencies, where the transmitter uses extremely high power (KW typically), and so can be smaller and still get enough input power to be effective.</p>
<p>This type of info would be more appropriate for a real <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antenna_theory.html" title="Antenna theory">antenna theory</a> article that would go into depth in theory, rather than just glossing over it as I have in this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not quite true that transmit antennas are a subset of receive antennas (I give an example in the article, now) - a receive antenna may be designed to lose efficiency in favor of noise rejection. Such designs are common in amateur low-band setups. In fact, I've used one: we had a big delta loop and a 120ft tower, and the best configuration was to transmit into the tower and receive using the loop.</dd>
<dd>That said, I think an antenna theory article would be excellent - of course, it can't cover the whole subject, but a good introduction would be wonderful. I don't know nearly enough about it. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 03:44, May 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I'd rather leave this article for the practical parts of antennas (with just the minimum theory to make sense) and start a fresh article on the theory, otherwise it'll jsut get too long. I'm even leaning towards not adding more antenna models here, especially since the category is now there to collect them all.

<p>I don't clearly understand yet how Gain works. Imagine I have 1 Watt for my isotropic antenna. No i use a gain antenna. Logically, this new antenna won't have more than the 1 Watt provided by the circuit. So, how does the gain antenna get more power to send? Is the antenna amplified? That would need the antenna to be powered by another energy source additionally. Actually, are there antennas that can amplify a signal by using an additional energy source connected to the antenna? Thanks, --<a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdull_b6f2.html" title="User:Abdull">Abdull</a> 09:48, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there are setups where you put an amplifier on the output of your radio; sometimes it lives on the antenna. The opposite situation is actually more common: many antennas (especially for <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_telescope.html" title="Radio telescope">radio telescopes</a>) have a receive amplifier as close to the antenna as possible to reduce the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_noise.html" title="Thermal noise">thermal noise</a>.</dd>
<dd>But this is not what is meant by the gain of an antenna. In your example, the antenna still radiates only one watt. But there is normally only one (or a few) direction you care about - toward the receiver. So if the antenna is pointed towards the receiver and puts out all its power in a hemisphere (instead of a sphere) it will have a gain of 2 (3 dB). In practice, antenna radiation patterns are complicated, but a Yagi antenna (for example) puts out most of its power in one direction, so that the signal strength in that direction is increased compared to an isotropic antenna (at the cost of other directions).</dd>
<dd>This is complicated by the existence of "omnidirectional" antennas with gain. In fact such antennas are not omnidirectional; normally there are directions that are almost certain not to be useful to send signals to: stright up and down. For HF antennas, radiating at a low angle results in long <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skip.html" title="Skip">skips</a> and better communications over long distance, so (for example) a 5/8th wave vertical has gain because it suppresses radiation stright up. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 10:19, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is still only 1 watt radiated but it's concentrated like a searchlight in one direction, which makes it as powerful as say 5 watts spread in all directions. --Joe VK4TU</dd>

<p>Under the definition of gain seen here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain</a></p>
<p>"In electronics, gain is usually taken to mean the ratio of the signal output of a system to the signal input of the system. A gain of 10 would imply that a property of the signal (usually voltage or power) had increased by a factor of 10."</p>
<p>Which sounds an awful lot like amplification <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier</a></p>
<p>"An amplifier can be considered to be any device that uses a small amount of energy to control a larger amount, although the term today usually refers to an electronic amplifier. The relationship of the input to the output of an amplifier--usually expressed as a function of the input frequency--is called the transfer function of the amplifier, and the magnitude of the transfer function is termed the gain."</p>
<p>And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier</a></p>
<p>"An idealized amplifier can be said to be "a piece of wire with gain", as the output is an exact replica of the input, but larger."</p>
<p>Which sound like what the term "gain" should be.</p>
<p>Now this page is saying something completely different.</p>
<p>"An antenna has gain if it radiates more strongly in one direction than in another. Gain is measured by comparing an antenna to a model antenna, typically the isotropic antenna which radiates equally in all directions."</p>
<p>Here we are defining gain as the difference in signal strength in one area vrs another area for an output signal only. It considers nothing to do with an amplification procedure.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Correct. So there are two meanings of "gain" as used in electronics. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 18:27, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since an antenna has only one pair of terminals, a supplementary reference is needed for the generalization. This is usually taken as the gain of a perfectly efficient isotropic radiator. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R. Ingham">David R. Ingham</a> 19:34, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>An important point to note with amplifiers is that we are not creating energy out of nothing.. that is not possible. We will be having a DC supply which supplies the energy for amplification. A crude definition of antenna is it's a passive device which radiates energy.So the gain here is not the relation between the output and input but it tells us about the directivity of an antenna. that is maximum power transferred.</p>

<p>One of the two (bolded) statements below must be false. Which one? If you know, please correct it :)</p>
<ul>
<li>The small loop antenna, also called the magnetic loop antenna is less than a wavelength in circumference. (Typically less than 1/10 for a receiving loop, less than 1/4 for a transmitting loop.) <b>Unlike nearly all other antennas in this list, this antenna detects the magnetic field of the wave instead of the electric field.</b> As such, it is less sensitive to near field electric noise when properly shielded. The receiving aperture can be greatly increased by bringing the loop into resonance with a tuning capacitor. Due to the small size of the loop, the radiation pattern is 90 degrees from that of the large loop. The radiation pattern is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, with sharp nulls in the plane of the loop.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The electrically short antenna is far less than 1/4 wavelength in length. <b>Unlike nearly all other antennas in this list, this antenna detects the electric field of the wave instead of the electromagnetic field.</b> Its receiving aperture can be greatly increased by increasing the voltage; by adding an inductor or resonator tuned to resonance with the signals of interest. Electrically short antennas are typically used where operating wavelength is large and space is limited, e.g. for mobile transceivers operating at long wavelengths.</li>

<p>There is no contradiction. The loop antenna is just that - a closed loop of wire. The short antenna is NOT a closed loop - it is a wire with one end connected to the radio and the other in free space. They are two different things. <a href="../../../n/0/y/User%7EN0YKG_209f.html" title="User:N0YKG">N0YKG</a> 13:46, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely there is a contradiction, if there isn't it's not explained well enough for normal people (like me) to understand. Both paragraphs claim that "unlike nearly all other antennas in this list", they detect respectively the electric field rather than the magnetic field of the radio wave. So "Unlike nearly all other" must be wrong since that could only possibly be true for one of them.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsten_cf99.html" title="User:Horsten">TH</a> 13:56, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The difference may not be clear, but that does NOT make this a contradiction. However, see the rewrite, and see if that helps. <a href="../../../n/0/y/User%7EN0YKG_209f.html" title="User:N0YKG">N0YKG</a> 16:00, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The rewrite helped me understand the facts, and the new explanation about the electrically short antenna is much clearer. But I still see a blaring contradiction: The section about the small loop antenna claims that <i>"unlike nearly all other antennas in this list, this antenna detects the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave instead of the electrical component"</i> while the section about the electrically short antenna claims that <i>"unlike nearly all other antennas in this list, this antenna detects the electric field of the wave instead of the electromagnetic field"</i>. It follows from simple logic that either the majority of the antennas detect the magnetic fields, and the first statement is right and the second wrong, or the majority detect the electric field and the first statement is right and the second wrong. I think that the electrically short antenna is the exception here and that makes its description correct, while the description of the small loop antenna should be corrected. But I leave it to you or someone else with expertise in the field to actually do the change. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsten_cf99.html" title="User:Horsten">TH</a> 15:18, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, what I will do is change the loop to read "detect the magnetic component of the signal only" and the short antenna to be "The electrical component only" - the other types detect both aspects of the field.

<p>The term 'antenna' (pl. 'antennas') is used throughout the microwave and RF industry in the UK. 'Aerial[s]' is now only used colloquially (i.e. outside the industry).

<p>Just to say. The chapter on the large loop is wrong. Read the Balanis, it is the best book ever on antenna,actual and both practical and academic (It is not spam, it is true). A small loop has its maximum gain on the plane of the loop, but when you increase the size of the loop, this maximum shift until the circumference have reached the same size as the wavelength where the maximum gain is perpendicular to the plane of the loop (on the axe).--85.218.2.215 19:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't say I care for that. Time vs. Space is not really a valid separtaion of concepts, and I'm not sure that separation is needed. Also, mixing antenna models with theoretical discussion is not a good idea at all. Also, you have miscategorized the directional vs. omnidirectional antennas, which is just further proof that this heirarchial structure is inappropriate. (ex: loop can be omnidirectional, but is usually directional. The reverse is true for dipole.) Perhaps I'm missing the point of this reorganization?</dd>
<dd>Also, looking at the current list of antennas, I would object to any structural change that did not keep the isotropic and dipole antennas first. The yagi should probably be next, but I could be convinced that one of the others is more common. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 06:16, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Time is what every electrician understands (as it is 1 dimensional) and were many wiki links are possible. Space is very poorly understood by most readers and hard to show as I have not seen any 2d radiation pattern in wiki, yet. (small loops are omnidirectional, big ones are not. Same with electric dipole antenna, if you omit the coil and instead tune it to high frequency by a capacitor, it will not radiate a dipole pattern).--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 01:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../d/i/p/Dipole_antenna.html" title="Dipole antenna">dipole antenna</a> has a nice 2d radiation pattern diagram. Small loops are very directional. They are one of the classic direction finding antenans. Large loops can be omnidirectional if they are oriented horizontally. Any antenna, when used out of its rated frequency, will act differently, and is pretty much not the same antenna. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 07:06, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the <b>Antenna parameters</b> section you have an <b>overview of antenna parameters</b> subsection. This makes sense, but it's put in the middle of the other subsections, this does not flow right. Either put it first or put it last, but not in the middle.</p>
<p>One of the problems with this article is it's very hard to read. The concepts are very jumbled as it's layed out in general. Someone needs to go at this article with an axe and chop out 1/3 to 2/3 of the content... some of which could be farmed out to other articles on those particular concepts. Remember this is an encyclopedia, not a scientific text. The article needs to be clear and to the point, crossreferenced with supporting material. The article should not contain enough information to make anyone an expert on this subject, rather give a fair working concept of it. As it stands now, I have a hard time understanding the article while already knowing the subject.</p>
<p>The <b>A few basic antenna models</b> is anything but. I don't have an exact definition of the word few, but this ain't it. As it stands now it's just a list, it doesn't really support any content and is confusing in its layout. I would think a few antenna models would be more like: Those that detect the electro-magnetic field, those that detect the electric field and those that detect the magnetic field. -That's a few. I wouldn't call the section a few types of anything at all, it isn't very encyclopedic. But whatever it's called, it ought to be shorter!

<dd>I can't fairly address the antenna parameter section, but I still don't think time vs. space is relevant here; frequency is not really time. Bandwidth is not time at all. Impedance has nothing to do with time. Polarization is not space (it's shape or direction). None of the antennas should be categorized as "time" or "space" as they are both or neither. Organization is needed, but I don't think time/space is the right concept to organize on.</dd>
<dd>The basic antenna model section has run away with itself (I think we totally agree here), and most of the content there should be moved to individual articles. I think specific radiation pattern and methods of combining elements are much more important than E or M field. Perhaps, rather than this huge list, it should just list isotropic, dipole FAMILY, loop FAMILY, yagi, phased array (very different), and maybe synthetic aperture. Each of these should be very short; Yagi I think is perfect. Isotropic is long, but good for its significance. Dipole should be two sentences. The rest should probably be one sentence. All the removed material for the rest should go to individual articles. As they are removed, a mention is needed in the parent article for the family (some of the dipoles are already there), and make sure (as you say) it is in <a href="../../../r/a/d/Category%7ERadio_frequency_antenna_types_74d6.html" title="Category:Radio frequency antenna types">category:radio frequency antenna types</a>.

<p>Some antennas have dielectric or magnetic material. This may not be needed in the first paragraph, but to me it sounds funny to say they are composed of conductors. Less basically, there are structural materials and ray domes.</p>
<p>Now that Si can be used for LEDs and soon lasers, chips may have optical frequency dielectric antennas soon. (With lenses [or mirrors] to focus to and from the plane of another chip.)</p>
<p>When I was a kid, AM radio antennas had iron cores. Maybe some still do. For RAM coatings, and I think also for antennas, magnetic materials give better band widths to thin coatings or small antennas than can (theoretically) be obtained with only conductors and dielectrics. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<dd>Conventional antennas generally avoid dielectrics (as opposed to outright insulators) as they tend to introduce loss, but you are right anyway. The AM broadcast bands use a large wavelength, and so the loopstick is the most popular AM antenna. The "stick" in loopstick is a <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrite.html" title="Ferrite">ferrite</a> powder core (note quite the same as iron). Many commercial quality colinear antennas (very long stick) have a copper core for lightning conduction purposes. -<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 19:05, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anybody hv the idea about why an antenna length should be a multiple of the wavelength?? This is a question for which i hv not found an answer in any book ( as far as i hv seen).. Can anybody suggest an answer or a book..</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reasons is that the impedance of the antenna is resistive (with no reactive part) when the total length is near (but not exactly) a multiple of half wavelength. Adaptation to the feeder cable is easier as there is no capacitive or inductive part to compensate. This is a good condition but it is not necessary for an antenna to emit or receive. <a href="../../../l/p/f/User%7ELPFR_47d7.html" title="User:LPFR">LPFR</a> 12:28, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thank you very much. But i hv another query. Can we have a similar resitive antenna at some other lengths larger than half the wavelengths, say 1000 times the wavelength of the signal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>An alternating voltage applied at one end of a wire creates a traveling wave in the wire. This traveling wave is formed by an alternating current in the wire plus a tension on the wire. In an infinite wire, the wave travels down the wire and radiates power in the form of an emitted radio wave. Therefore, the current and the voltage attenuate as the wave progresses.<br />
When the wave arrives to the end of the wire, a new wave is created. This wave travels backward and, added with the forward traveling wave gives a zero current at the extremity of the wire. The reflected wave also radiates power and attenuates. When the reflected wave arrives at the feeder cable, some of it enters the cable and the rest reflects and goes back in the forward direction. And so on. The phase of the sum of all the reflected waves, at the feeder cable, gives the impedance of the antenna. If the phase is 0° o 180° the impedance of the antenna will be resistive (no reactive part). If not, it will be more or less capacitive or inductive.<br />
This is the reason why the impedance of an antenna depends on its length. However, when the wire length is too long, the amplitude of the reflected wave becomes negligible, and the impedance of the wire does not change with the length. In the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_chart.html" title="Smith chart">Smith chart</a>, as the length of the dipole increases, the impedance of the antenna describes a <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiral.html" title="Spiral">spiral</a> line closing to the point corresponding to twice the impedance of an infinite wire. This impedance depends on the diameter of the wire, but it is of the order of the impedance of free space (the wikipedia page on this subject is bad), about 377 ohms. Your almost infinite dipole, which is no more a dipole or a resonant antenna, will have an impedance of about 800 ohms (resistive), and a gain of 15-20 dBi (but this is just my guess). <a href="../../../l/p/f/User%7ELPFR_47d7.html" title="User:LPFR">LPFR</a> 08:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest putting a link to a new page "antenna models" containing a list with a brief description of several antenna types with links to pages dedicated to each antenna (if there is enough stuff). The idea is to keep in the Antenna page only the properties and aspects common to all antennas and send each type or family to a specialized page.</p>
<p>I do not think feasible to give a classification or an order for antennas. There are too many possible criteria: resonant/non-resonant, electric/magnetic, simple/composite, professional/amateur, linear/circular polarized, etc. I suggest using just alphabetical order.</p>

<p>Most (all?) of the formulae on this page use <span class="texhtml">120π</span> for the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impedance_of_free_space.html" title="Impedance of free space">impedance of free space</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>Z</i><sub>0</sub></span>. This is a very common convention to be sure but...</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not numerically exact. It comes from <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/e/3/ae35dd65a01870ba3347a26f66ddd229.png" alt="Z_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\varepsilon_{0}}} = \mu_{0} c" />, where <span class="texhtml">μ<sub>0</sub></span> is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permeability_of_free_space.html" title="Permeability of free space">permeability of free space</a>, and by the definition of the <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amp.html" title="Amp">Amp</a> <span class="texhtml">μ<sub>0</sub> = 4π10 <sup>− 7</sup></span>H/m (exactly). Then putting the speed of light <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i> = 300000000</span>m/s (approximately), so <span class="texhtml"><i>Z</i><sub>0</sub> = 120π</span> (approximately). But <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i> = 299793000</span>m/s is closer, so <span class="texhtml"><i>Z</i><sub>0</sub></span>=119.917<span class="texhtml">π</span> is better.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The units are wrong. <span class="texhtml">120π</span> is a pure number, whereas <span class="texhtml"><i>Z</i><sub>0</sub></span> has units of Ω, so the units of the various formulae don't come out right.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It obscures the fact that the formulae relate to what (at least in the SI view of things), is a universal constant of nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if nobody objects in the next couple of weeks, then I may go through and change <span class="texhtml">120π</span> to <span class="texhtml"><i>Z</i><sub>0</sub></span> --catslash 14:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right. The exactitude argument is not very important for antennas but the units argument is a killer. I will correct the formulas. <a href="../../../l/p/f/User%7ELPFR_47d7.html" title="User:LPFR">LPFR</a> 16:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote <i>Those elements are called – unfairly - <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parasitic_element.html" title="Parasitic element">parasitic elements</a></i>. I wrote "unfairly" because their usefulness does not deserve the pejorative name of "parasitic". If the name had been chosen in a recent past, they would have probably been christened "slave" instead of "parasitic". User <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> erased "unfairly". Although I appreciate his (or hers) English corrections, I think that this time it was a wrong correction. If the word "unjustly" is better than "unfairly", I agree to the replacement. For the time being, I reset "unfairly". <a href="../../../l/p/f/User%7ELPFR_47d7.html" title="User:LPFR">LPFR</a> 12:07, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think <i>parasitic</i> is a pejorative here. Adding a parenthetical "unfairly" or "unjustly" breaks the flow of the sentence and obscures the important meanings with irrelevant minor details. I don't think the feelings of those poor parasitic elements will be greatly hurt much by ignoring this issue. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 15:01, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In this phrase, "unfairly" had a physical (or electrical) meaning. As neither <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> nor <a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> seem to understood this. I put this meaning in a separate sentence. <a href="../../../l/p/f/User%7ELPFR_47d7.html" title="User:LPFR">LPFR</a> 08:03, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would very much like someone to add why when I touch an antenna with my hand the signal gets much louder and clearer on a VHF radio. Can that be put in the article about how/why this happens and why the body is so go and being an antenna etc. Thanks JulianHensey 21:00, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your body is an electrical conductor (not a good one, in fact). When you touch the antenna, the result is the same as to lengthen the antenna with a length of wire. In MW, all antennas are always too short and a long antenna works better than a short one. Your body is not an antenna, but it can be used as an antenna, a conductor and even as a heating resistance (but this last utilization is not recommended).
