<p>Sorry, but a "Comedy-Show" shouldn´t be a basis for a topic in a Encyclopedia. Or I am not right?</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw a Comedy-Show on polish Polsat. And they make fun of/in german (Also they said "Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles". Yes, this is the kind of polish humor.). Does German speak then of Anti-Germanism? Your guys are very funny when you are using a comedy as an example for "german media". Should I must remember some polish guys of this picture: [<a href="http://www.mdr.de/IT/67524-high.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mdr.de/IT/67524-high.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] (And this is not a Comedy-magazine!). Polish Media make too much panic and trouble, and some Polish make also too much panic. <small>Like the topic Erika Steinbach, nobody knows her in Germany. But every Polish does!?</small></p>
<p>Please remove this parts or change them. First of all it have nothing in common with the topic "Anti-polonism", or I'am wrong?. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonny84_5ae7.html" title="User:Jonny84">Jonny84</a> 11.55, 3rd September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right there. But the Harald Schmidt claim is already sufficiently exposed as nonsense (see some topics above). This page needs a lot of help so if you would like to stay and help with the mediation, I'd really appreciate it.

<dd>You cherrypicked and challenged two of Jonny's points jumping to another conclusion that he was wrong on all points. <small>Who is Erica Stainbach? Let's check the German wikipedia. According to the German wikipedia, <i>Nach anhaltender, äußerst kritischer Berichterstattung ist sie heute in Polen weit bekannter als in Deutschland. Eine Fotomontage des polnischen Nachrichtenmagazins Wprost präsentierte sie in SS-Uniform auf Kanzler Schröder reitend.</i> (= After continuous, exceedingly critical reporting she is today more well-known in Poland than in Germany. A photomontage of the Polish news magazine Wprost presented her in SS-uniform riding on Chacellor Schröder.) Of course she has meet with top German politicians as one of almost 600 members of the German parliament.</small> And as for your Harald Schmidt exaggeration: aren't there comedians in Poland who also sometimes make fun of other nations? Was Jonny wrong there? OMG the Guardian Unlimited has published an <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1551650,00.html" class="external text" title="http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1551650,00.html" rel="nofollow">article against football fans</a>, even headlined "Football fans are idiots", oh no, there'll be mass murders and persecution of hooligans... (btw also another example of how headlines should not be mistaken for facts). There's no harm in jokes. Laughing is healthy, so don't be in a huff when also Poland is sometimes joked about or do you feel that your honour is insulted then? Don't take it personally.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 20:51, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>Steinbach didn't meet with Stroiber or Schroeder or Merkel in Parliament.All of those people come regularly to meetings of her organisations and make speeches to them.As to your "there is no harm in jokes" there is if it reinforces negative stereotypes that led to mass murder and genocide of Polish people by Germans.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 02:07, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Do you know that the Harald Schmidt Show is defunct since 2 years? Do you know? And what is the common of an entertainer and the World War 2? You´re absurd. And you can be sure that this show is not representing and demonstrating "Anti-polonism". You´re making panic. Do you ever been in Germany? Who gave polish media the right to defame other countries, should they maybe forgot their own history? And if you like it or not, to say something (bad) about poland or criticising Poland or making jokes about Poland isn´t alike/even anti-polonism. And come on, the WW2 end 60 years ago, Todays-Germany isn´t Nazi-Germany. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonny84_5ae7.html" title="User:Jonny84">Jonny84</a> 22:54, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And I feel very ashamed, when I read opinions like yours. Poland and Poles are known in Germany as very friendly and hospitably. Many young people are very interested in Poland.

<p><small>My dear Molobo! It isn't Jonny who is wrong, it is YOU! You have showed us on more than one occasion that you do absolutely not know what you are talking about. First of all, Erika Steinbach is NOT a very importand person leading a huge political organization <b>she is just the chairman of a organization of a minority in Germany. And That's why she's visited by politicians. Our political leaders do also visit the chairmen of e.g. the organization of the slavian minority, the danish minority (which -by the way- is a member of the Parliament in Schleswig-Holstein) or the muslim minority.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested addition</span></h2>
<p>Since the article is protected, I can't add this myself. What I want to do is have a mention of Lufthansa's signing of a codeshare agreement with LOT Polish, which led the way to LOT being accepted into <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Alliance_2d03.html" title="Star Alliance">Star Alliance</a>. This shows German support of Poland economicly, something that isn't mentioned in the "in Germany" section. <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayerischermann_8eb2.html" title="User:Bayerischermann">Bayerischermann</a> 00:41, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do not get me wrong but was it Lufthansa that accepted codeshare with LOT or LOT that accepted codeshare with Lufthansa&#160;? According to IATA, Poland had the second most dynamic airline market worldwide in 2004 (with 40% growth rate if I remember correctly). A new promising market is not something to be neglected these days. I'm not suggesting that it's not nice to be in the same alliance, but the facts need to be interpreted carefully. Anyway, I appreciate the motion towards showing signs of friendship instead of hatred or dislike. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 19:09, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sure, but before that is possible, the article needs to change hands. Molobo's aim is not to give a fair picture of Germany... there ought to be <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">a resolving of the dispute</a> because once Molobo can edit the article again, there's just gonna be a new flood of slander, overstatements, misinterpretations, speculations etc. It just cannot go on like this, so we may well need your help too, Bayerischermann.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 12:12, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"In April, LOT and Lufthansa signed a preliminary strategic partnership agreement and a code-share agreement on joint operation of air services between Poland and Germany.

<dd>It could easily be implemented into the "Germans Polish Friendship" by saying:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Germany also frequently conduct business in Poland and with Polish companies.

<p>I fail to see how normal relations on economic plateau have to do with alledged German-Polish friendship.Furthermore I question if such thing exists at all.Public opinion surveys would be welcomed here as to perception of both nations towards each other, as well as public surveys of German knowledge about Poland.This however is beyond the scope of the article here.German-Polish relations or perhaps Attempts at eradicating traditional German antipolonism is a good title in my view for a seperate article which could be linked here. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 20:19, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You don't see how economic relations have to do with Polish-German friendship? While I would agree that perhaps German-Polish relations deserve a seperate article, I still fail to see why you don't believe economic relations have to do with general relations... <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayerischermann_8eb2.html" title="User:Bayerischermann">Bayerischermann</a> 03:32, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know this has been gone over on VfD and not to doubt the good faith and hard work of people editing this page but this is so absolutely and utterly a neologism something should be done.

<dd>!! Polish-German relations doesn't exist. That would be an obvious place to move much of this stuff. There are already five history of Poland articles from the 10th century to 1939. Surely much of this could be placed under headers there. I can understand a desire to highlight it with "Oppression of..." but I think relative scope needs to be borne in mind. If an existing article logically covers things, utilize it first.</dd>
<dd>As far as the Google test I don't think "many more" is quite accurate. There are less than 800 hits for the term. In Google terms that's nothing, and while Poles who speak English or academics may occasionally use the term it really isn't in currency. I think we're being overly prescriptive in placing it here; As the VfD noted, it admits it's a neologism in the second paragraph.</dd>
<dd>As for other precedents, there is an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-French_sentiment_in_the_United_States_2cfe.html" title="Anti-French sentiment in the United States">Anti-French sentiment in the United States</a> article, (Anti-Polish sentiment in Germany?) which actually existed long before the main <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francophobia.html" title="Francophobia">Francophobia</a> article which was just added yesterday. Brief articles for <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">Anglophobia</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobia.html" title="Russophobia">Russophobia</a> exist (50 000 and 25 000 hits respectively) as of course does <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> (1.5 million hits). <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Australian_sentiment_6365.html" title="Anti-Australian sentiment">Anti-Australian sentiment</a> exists as well but I question its inclusion here in the same way I question this article.</dd>
<dd>My opinion is leave anti-X or -phobia articles for current or former hegemons: U.K., France, Germany, Russia, U.S., China and Japan. These countries have excited negative feelings across the globe and across time. Smaller countries with "negative opinions of" that are essentially regional shouldn't be included in the same way; it really does open the door for soapboxes and dubious neologisms. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:51, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is still Jewish anti-Polonism, and in fact there are more documentation on the contemporary anti-Polonism among Jews than on German anti-Polonism. This is not included in the article though, since the editors are biased and I had very little chances to introduce suitable material to the article. Similarly, latest political events gave rise to occasional questions about Russian anti-Polonism.

<dd>This argument has already been exercised. Anti-polonism is not a <i>neologism</i>. Take a look at the page <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html#Google_bias" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test#Google bias</a>. It states that a few hundreds of google occurrences should be enough. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Anti-Polonism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Anti-Polonism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">This search</a> gives 785 hits (we should substract ca 100 for Wikipedia mirrors) and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Antipolonism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Antipolonism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this</a> for alternative spelling <i>antipolish</i> gives 277 hits. The section <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html#Foreign_languages_and_non-Latin_scripts" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test#Foreign languages and non-Latin scripts</a> suggests that we can also take into account searches in other languages, so <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=antypolonizm&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=antypolonizm&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this</a> search for the Polish equivalent gives 20,100 hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Antipolonismus&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Antipolonismus&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this</a> search for the German equivalent gives 158 hits.

<dd>I agree that the term <i>Anti-Polish sentiment</i> is even less represented, but this can partly be attributed to the fact that wikipedia mirrors boost the term <i>Anti-Polonism</i> in Google now. The aim of my proposal is to give a better justifiaction for the current wide scope of the article. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 19:37, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, after initially agreeing with suggestions for changes you seem to be backing away, so I don't know. Technicality not a neologism perhaps, but at least hard to comprehend. I stand by the fact that this article asserts a regional (and largely time-bound) phenomenon and that A-B relations articles and the already comprehensive Polish history pages can cover it. The suggestion of Anti-German bias has some merit. How many WWII pics you need? Doesn't this unintentionally verify the fact that this is parochial? I found nothing on Google images that would indicate a broader, modern range for the topic—no book covers, no signs, no editorial cartoons. Anti-French produces 265 images and some relevant ones off the top; Anti-Polish produces 8 none of which could be used here. Perhaps you'd find more searching in Polish or German but that would only confirm to me the regional character of the topic. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:43, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify. I agree that the phenomenon is regional and it concerns to much descent Polish neighbouring countries. It also concerns USA and Israel though, as many Jews emigrated to the countries from Poland. However, I think that you mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/History_and_geography&amp;diff=22964734&amp;oldid=22853297" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/History_and_geography&amp;diff=22964734&amp;oldid=22853297" rel="nofollow">somewhere</a> that anti-Polonism is a neologism, so I wanted to clarify it. I support the idea of the poll, but I think the current form is premature. Although, I think the questions you proposed should be included in the final poll. Moreover, I think the idea of the poll should be supported by all the editors around. If it isn't then ist results will be either meaningless or boycotted by some of the editors here and this will give rise to just another edit war. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 19:27, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Seems to me the problem with this poll is that its result might not matter. From the context and experience, it appears that some editors will not agree with <i>any</i> change to the article to make it NPOV, and may simply revert all such changes. Groeck 16:39, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I presume these three edits were a single user trying to create consensus for himself. Now, this is a no-go but the more I look at this page the more I sympathize with the general idea (however crudely pushed forward). I just removed Polish Black Legend from the lead. There is no Polish Black Legend. It wasn't properly cited internally or externally. And if, as the most recent edit after mine is true, Anti-Polonism does not appear <i>in Polish dictionaries</i> (anti-Canadianism does not appear in the dictionary of Canadian English as a point of comparison) then I do have to wonder about the validity of this page. Assuming the info on this page does deserve mention somewhere does the article title make sense? It would be nice if RfC generated an abundance of comment (it never does) so this question is directed to anyone still watching otherwise: take a step back and ask yourself "would this make sense under a different descriptor?" <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:13, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The phrase concerning the dictionaries states to be precise that <i>its Polish counterpart</i> antypolonizm <i>does not appear in Polish <b>major</b> dictionaries and encyclopedias either</i>. The dictionary you found is a really minor dictionary the intended audience of which are librarians so inclusion of the information does not falsify the statement. Moreover, if the editors decided to add information about the dictionary status of the word in English and the dictionary status of the word in Polish is so peculiar, the information must be included to the article. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 14:35, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not understand on which basis the information about Polish major dictionaries has been removed. The dictionary Molobo mentions - "Słownik Języka Haseł Przedmiotowych Biblioteki Narodowej" - is not a major Polish dictionary. It is not a major Polish encyclopedia either. I don't deny that the library is a major institution, but this dictionary is simply directed for librarians and thus has no wider audience. Once more, the term does not occur in the dictionaries and encyclopedias I mentioned above. It also does not appear in paper sources like "Słownik Języka Polskiego" by PWN (I've checked the 1994 edition), "Słownik Wyrazów Obcych. Nowy" by PWN (I've checked the 1995 edition) and in the recently published (2005) "Encyklopedia Gazety Wyborczej" (the material in which is just a big encyclopedia corpus from PWN). As these are the dictionaries that really have wide audience and good respect, I don't see reason why this information should be removed from the article. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 19:20, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"I re-removed "Polish Black Legend." There is no source—there is nothing. Prove it or lose it." Please read the article before tempering with it. Dr. Dariusz Łukasiewicz: Czarna legenda Polski: Obraz Polski i Polaków w Prusach 1772-1815 (The black legend of Poland: the image of Poland and Poles in Prussia between 1772-1815) Wydawnictwo Poznanskiego Towarzystwa Przyjaciól Nauk, 1995.

<dd><b>Polish Black Legend.</b> You're inclusion of this strikes me as OR which reading the summary seems to confirm. Find contemporary secondary or tertiary sources which use the term matter-of-factly and I'll buy it. Further, it reinforces what I've said a few times: this is primarily about historic German-Polish relations and the article title ought to reflect that.</dd>
<dd><b>Re-inserting dictionary point.</b> I did not remove your point about the Polish National Library I only re-inserted the earlier point.</dd>
<dd><b>Anti-polonism in France.</b> I was not suggesting that it doesn't exist only that the addition as it stood was POV. It's a series of straw men (He said x—of course he's wrong). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 10:18, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>" Find contemporary secondary or tertiary sources which use the term matter-of-factly and I'll buy it"The book was written recently.As to blaming Poland see Pawelka speech. "I only re-inserted the earlier point." Which isn't true as the dictionary of Polish National Library has it. " was not suggesting that it doesn't exist only that the addition as it stood was POV" In which way.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 10:37, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The use Black Legend in the intro takes a time-bound and context-specific idea and presents it as a matter-of-fact, taken for granted point. This is not appropriate to a lead a paragraph and the description of the book I found notes it as documentation much more than interpretation, i.e. essentially primary not secondary. <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/902/223books.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/902/223books.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Thus asserting a general Polish Black Legend in the lead qualifies as an inappropriate "analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claim" (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). Other sources on the book (surprise, surprise) were Wikipedia itself or mirrors. Searching "Polish Black Legend" (in quotes) gives a 110 results and you get one guess where most of them come from.</dd>
<dd>I will edit the para to the effect that it does not <i>generally</i> appear in dictionaries but the National Library is an exception.</dd>
<dd>France:
<ul>
<li>"Despite the fact that it brought more jobs to French people" is absolutely POV and beyond proof. "I don't think the French economy is at risk..." is not proof, but a rather tepid opinion.</li>
<li>"...a deeply religious nation..." Who in France is criticizing Poland's religious character (and plz don't do what's been done for Germany by pulling out an extreme commentator and presenting it as a nationwide opinion)?</li>
<li>Presenting points only to undercut them is the slipperiest kind of POV: "'...a good opportunity to remain silent,' ignoring the fact that Poland had traditionally been a loyal ally of France." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 11:20, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The deletion for POV of the paragraph denouncing France is in harmony with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Polonism_Archive_4_1752.html#Martin_Schulz.27s_remark" title="Talk:Anti-Polonism/Archive 4">Talk:Anti-Polonism/Archive_4#Martin_Schulz.27s_remark</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Polonism_Archive_4_1752.html#President_Chirac.27s_remark" title="Talk:Anti-Polonism/Archive 4">Talk:Anti-Polonism/Archive_4#President_Chirac.27s_remark</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Poles are also blamed for unemployment in France after EU expansion</i>" this is imprecise and is anti-polonistic only in your opinion</li>
<li>"<i>despite the fact that it brought more jobs to French people</i>" is a clear point of view that not everybody in France seems to have and which serves as propaganda</li>
<li>"<i>Antipolish sentiment has grown in that country</i>" this is only your point of view and sounds dishonest or arrogant (because you should know that you have no idea about anti-Polonism in France)</li>
<li>"<i>due to Poland's close relationship with United States</i>". Sounds extremely conceited and made up. Source?</li>
<li>"<i>The fact that Poland remains both an US ally as well as a deeply religious nation, has led to enforcing of negative and antipolish views in several layers of European politics.</i>" Source?</li>
<li>"<i>Josep Borrell the President of European Parliament has been reported to express antipolish remarks several times, accusing Poland of "taking orders from USA".</i>" Oh no! He seemed to criticise Poland's participation in the Iraq war! How anti-Polonistic to criticise a government!! Where are these reports saying it were anti-polish remarks by the way?</li>
<li>"<i>Another example of antipolonism sentiments are comments from Martin Schulz a member of European Parliament who demanded to silence polish representatives calling them "hooligans" (during the WWII the term "polnische Banditen" was commonly used by German propaganda) during European Parliament session on 27.10.2004</i>" *Cough-cough* Martin Schulz is German, not French, and he called a Britain, not a Pole, a hooligan. See <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Polonism_Archive_4_1752.html#Martin_Schulz.27s_remark" title="Talk:Anti-Polonism/Archive 4">Talk:Anti-Polonism/Archive_4#Martin_Schulz.27s_remark</a></li>
<li>"<i>Shortly after the Polish EU accession, when the Polish government expressed its solidarity with the American war on terror, French president Jacques Chirac remarked they had missed "a good opportunity to remain silent"</i> The "war on terror" or the Iraq war? Surely it's not a POV to mingle these events, is it? And calling Chirac's criticism as far as the Iraq war is concerned "anti-Polonistic" is not only completely biased; it is insane in my opinion.</li>
<li>"<i>ignoring the fact that Poland had traditionally been a loyal ally to France</i>", stated ignoring the fact that Wikipedia relies heavily on an NPOV.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So ... this was the entire French anti-Polonism paragraph. Now, your "Polish Black legend" and the doorstep-belief: first of all it <i>may</i> be from a book. Honestly, you cannot ask us to believe you blindly there or buy a book. 'God exists! You don't believe me? Buy my book!' Anyway, to say that Anti-Polonistic is often associated with it is at best your opinion. I associate it with "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Monopoly_5e28.html" title="Anti-Monopoly">Anti-Monopoly</a>", an attempt to equate Anti-Polonism to Anti-Semitism and cheap copycatting of the (existing) word "Anti-Americanism". Who can be able to state how something is associated by people except for God? Has someone looked into everybody's minds again? This is just biased nonsense in the lead paragraph.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 12:18, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Please direct your complaints to various authors using the term antipolonism?" What are you talking about? This has nothing to do with whether your addition about France was POV. Again, a single work (dealing, apparently, with Prussia 1772 - 1815, which is what I meant by "time-bound and "context specific") does not allow us to assert a "Polish Black Legend" that has no obvious basis. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:39, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Marskell! First of all it was Molobo who started the personal attacs. Secondly this article IS bullshit. I am a Pole living in Germany, whose parents were not forbidden to teach me polish, which brings me to the third reason, why these Lies shall be removed. The Article is full of POV's. Fourth of all: When you look at the editing history, you'll realize that brainsick-Molobo deleted the vote-for-deletion mark. To me this means that HE's afraid about that everybody may notice that HE is the one who's lying all the time on purpose. Micha.</p>

<dd>To be clear, I don't feel the VfD is necessary but I <i>absolutely object</i> to an involved editor removing the tag. I never suspected it would last longer than a day—I'm saying you shouldn't <i>take it upon yourself</i> to over-turn procedure. Of course it will be kept—I can't imagine an uninformed editor not voting keep. I'll keep it myself if you like and it won't be bad faith because I'll be opposing my own vote. But of course it needs massive re-vamping, which 9 out of 10 people voting keep will not be aware of. "Needing talk" is, as I said, a hope for even one or two editors to become dis-interestedly involved.</dd>

<dd>Were they not Germans? OF COURSE they were Germans. And Genghis Khan was a Central Asian like Lee Harvey Oswald was a white man. If we had "a white man shoots a white man" on Lee Harvey Oswald, it would of course be perfectly true and utterly stupid as a description. Similarly, if you want a collage of Germans shooting Poles make a user page for it (or at least a main page: Germans shooting Poles) and <i>on this page</i> attempt to prove what remains unproven: that this is nothing more than a regional, bi-lateral issue. Let's rephrase: Is this a WW II page? It looks like one. Why don't you have pics proving a contemporary fact rather than a historical phenomenon? Because you can't find them? Because this page, at the very least, should be re-named? Hmm. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:12, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Contemporary facts like accusing Poles of being thieves&#160;? Denying the right to speak in Polish, xenophobic attacks against Poles in France that led to discrimination of Polish firms&#160;? Blaming Poland for WW2&#160;? Claiming Poles worked with German Reich&#160;? Publishing books in Russia with lines like "everybody who reads this would shoot Poles out of contempt"&#160;? As to&#160;:"Were they not Germans? OF COURSE they were Germans. And Genghis Khan was a Central Asian like Lee Harvey Oswald was a white man. If we had "a white man shoots a white man" on Lee Harvey Oswald, it would of course be perfectly true and utterly stupid as a description." This silly politicall correctness.What I should call then German soldies murdering Poles in executions "A group of people murdering a group of another people" Instead of "German invasion of Poland" I should name it "one state invades another state"&#160;?.This would be absurd.As to your claim about Genghis Khan they are many articles that speak abour mass murder made by Mongol armies so I see no problem In saying the same about German armies if such things happened. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 10:04, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Four pics are redundant and yes it looks like a WW II scrapbook. Also you're inverting my point in your reply: I'm not advocating <i>less</i> specific descriptions but more specific descriptions. "Nazi soldiers" creates better specificity than "Germans" presented generically and really do we need two barely legible pics off the top showing exactly the same thing? How do I know they were members of NSDAP&#160;? IIRC officers were forbidden from NSDAP membership. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 20:03, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Germany section in general is a laundry list of dubious points and editorial asides without a single English source to allow the majority of the readers on this page to verify the info.</dd>
<dd>"In addition they [SIC] have been cases were Polish workers have been ordered by their employers to talk in German during their private time outside of work." No source, and I don't see how it can be proven anyhow.</dd>
<dd>"German constitution grants German citizenship to Polish-born persons if their ancestors were Germans citizens living on German territory as of 1937." Anyone desiring German citizenship faces ancestry requirements. I can't become a German.</dd>
<dd>"In addition radical German organisations expressing anti-Polish views(blaming Poles for WWII), are visited on regular basis by leading CDU and CSU politicians." Which organizations? Which politicians?</dd>
<dd>Further, it is never asserted that such policies (if in fact they are policies) differ substantially from the treatment given Turks, Arabs etc. Are the Poles singled out or this a general tendency toward homogenization (which, ultimately, the larger German society is free to pursue)? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 11:23, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Dear Marskell! I tried several times to tell Molobo, that e.g. Angela Merkel visited Erika Steinbach, the leader of the minority organization "Preußische Treuhand" (the organization of the people, who came from east Prussia or Silesia) just because she is a leader of a minority organization. Merkel ALSO visits the leaders of the turkisk, danish, sinthi- and roma or jewish minority, but that does not mean, that these minorities including the Preußische Treuhand play an importand role in Germany. Unfortunately I was -like all the other guys who did the same- not very successful. Believe me, there is no chance to fill fundamentalists like Molobo with intelligence. Micha.</p>
