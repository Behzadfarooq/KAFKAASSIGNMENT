<p><b>Interview Conducted by Masai Minters of UCLA Academic Advancement Program:<br /></b> Antonio, what was your experience as a student in FSP?</p>
<p>For me, FSP represented a rite of passage into university life. I had never had the opportunity to visit a university, so there were many disparities between my expectations of college and what actually happens at a prestigious university like UCLA. The FSP academic experience, with all its required reading and writing, gave me a head start into seeing what level of work and what study habits I would need to succeed and excel at UCLA.</p>
<p>How was it for you to work as an FSP Peer Counselor last summer?</p>
<p>I brought a number of valuable experiences to the position. These included, but are not limited to, coming from the inner city and having lots of experience in student counseling and in an array of business fields. As an FSP Peer Counselor, I was able to help students in the same way FSP Peer Counselors helped me when I was an incoming freshman. I wanted to work with students so they'd see college in an all-encompassing light and not be shocked by what they would encounter as entering freshmen in the fall.</p>
<p>Did you see a difference in how FSP impacted you in 1997 and how it impacted students in 2001?</p>
<p>The impact of FSP on students hasn't changed much between 1997 and 2001. The program was set up to help underrepresented students acclimate themselves to a foreign and, at times, hostile environment and it does just that. FSP gives students an all-inclusive, jump-start experience. Without the program, a lot of students would be in the dark during their first year at UCLA. From dormitory to classroom, FSP is a lifeline for students.</p>
<p>Why'd you decide to become an AAP academic year Peer Counselor?</p>
<p>I wanted to give something back. I'd been counseling for several years with a variety of programs all across the UCLA campus, and I really liked the structure of AAP counseling. It offered an opportunity to counsel a variety of students with a multitude of backgrounds, and it provided me easy access to all the tools necessary to counsel successfully. AAP focuses on the idea of social justice for the underrepresented, which I felt was particularly important in light of changing laws that seem to be closing doors and limiting access for underrepresented students.</p>
<p>I'm a Peer Counselor for PLUS, and our goal is to create a family environment for our students. The PLUS program was a really positive influence for me during my first year, and my goal is to continue to strengthen PLUS.</p>
<p>What have you gotten out of the job? How has it changed you?</p>
<p>This is the best job a student can have. Counseling in AAP has allowed me to learn to deal with people of different backgrounds on an intimate level. Many students I've counseled have shown me ways to open my eyes to life that I had never thought about previously. From counseling Latina females to Asian males, each student has brought me insights into their own approach to life that have allowed me to broaden my own horizon and outlook.</p>
<p>As a result of having such a wide range of counseling experiences at UCLA, I have grown outside the classroom just as much as I have inside the classroom.</p>
<p>What contributions do you think you make as an AAP Peer Counselor?</p>
<p>As part of the AAP Peer Counseling unit, I try to be a role model, not only to students, but to other AAP Peer Counselors. I've had the luxury of a range of counseling experiences, and I try to help newer Peer Counselors to be the best they can be for their students. And this strengthens what AAP does for all of its students.</p>
<p>Can you talk with us about your tutoring at Crenshaw High?</p>
<p>For the past two years, I've had the opportunity to be a CBOP fellow (UCLA's Community Based Outreach Program), teaching college preparatory skills at Crenshaw High School. I've really enjoyed this experience because I see so much potential in so many of the students. But potential without guidance is wasted. So I know that through my efforts I am helping students who don't always get the needed guidance at home or in school to be collegiate success stories and to write their own books and happy endings.</p>
<p>I help students to see that alternatives are possible if they try hard enough and have the right guidance. Many of our sessions are aimed at getting the students to not only see and appreciate their strengths, but also to recognize what they are doing wrong so they can help themselves. The experience has helped me to grow and never to forget where I come from.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about African American student enrollment at UCLA? And particularly about Black male enrollment?</p>
<p>Black enrollment is in many ways a reflection of society at large. UCLA's dwindling African American population is only a microcosm of greater societal issues faced by African Americans. The overwhelming majority of African Americans receive very poor education and are subjected to a continuing racism that keeps the cycle of low access to universities going. One solution is to increase the numbers of African Americans attending universities such as UCLA by strengthening university outreach programs. That, however, is only part of the answer. The problem is much deeper. Racism pervades our society; it affects the home and the schools, and it results in increasingly larger numbers of young African American males being sent to prison rather than being admitted into universities. Black males are not being presented the opportunities to change the negative conditions in their lives. Instead, they're injected with a negative virus that starts with an impoverished background and is reinforced by a system that does little to combat what is wrong in their lives.</p>
<p>As an African American male, I am hurt by the reality of what has happened to African American numbers at UCLA. African Americans make up less than 4% of the undergraduate student body; and African American males represent just over 1% of UCLA students. But what bothers me even more than these low numbers is that not many people notice or seem to care about this because it does not affect them directly. African American males are an endangered species in our society and on our campus.</p>
<p>As a role model to other African American male students, I try to keep a smile even in the face of this distressing situation. When students ask me why the number of African Americans at UCLA is diminishing, I run it down. But I also encourage them to keep in mind the realities of midterms and finals, that already create enough stress in their daily lives. I do make it a point every once in a while to take the smile off and give them the needed reminder that, "UCLA is only one battleground in an ongoing war being fought for the right to be educated. Alone, you are but one soldier, but together we are an army."</p>
<p>What advice would you give other AAP students?</p>
<p>My advice is to take UCLA as an environment not simply to learn from, but one to grow within. A range of resources are available to every student at UCLA. These start with AAP tutoring, counseling, and mentoring, but continue well beyond, and can even involve giving back to underrepresented communities through a range of programs from SHAPE to CBOP. The university experience is what you make of it, and the possibilities are unimaginable. So my advice to students is: continue to focus on the classroom, but also remember to reach for the stars while keeping a foot attached to the foundation that made it possible.</p>
