I don't believe Anti-Australianism to be a movement equivalent to anti-Americanism. Obviously, some people don't like Australia, but that does mean we need a article on it. Sentences in the article like 'In many countries, however, there are at least a few individuals who do not like Australians in general' show how ludicrous this article is. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeus_Ex_c1ba.html" title="User:Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a> 21:58, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Eh, I dunno. Australia's done some nasty things, but so has every government, ever. There is probably already an article detailing what white Australians did to the aborigines, and I don't recall ever hearing anyone internationally (exceptiong al Qaeda) hating Australia, so I guess I should go with <b>delete</b>, or merge into a proper article. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 01:48, Sep 12, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can't see anything wrong with it. All of these things, many of which I've heard of, would seem to be the sort that would produce anti-Australian sentiment. Keep. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Rhymeless</a> 03:29, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>After some thought, I vote for <b>delete</b>. The main problem is that I think this is quite neologistic. Some content could possibly be moved elsewhere, maybe to something like International Relations of Australia or something. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 03:56, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Three points: 1. "Anti-<i>Austria</i>lianism"!? Confusing Australia with Austria is anti-Australian *lol* 2. There is an "anti-American movement"? What is its phone number? 3. I think there <i>are</i> still some problems with the article, and personally I wouldn't have created it, but I think it is worth keeping. Just. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 04:07, Sep 12, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By the way, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Jakarta_embassy_bombing_6faf.html" title="2004 Jakarta embassy bombing">bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta</a> this week shows that the subject is not a "joke", non-existent or trivial. But I guess it's not surprising that North Americans and Europeans are not very aware of tensions between Australia and its neighbours. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 06:09, Sep 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>1. OK, I made a mistake, I was typing too quickly, thats irrevelant 2.By movement I didn't mean an organisation, I meant that large amounts of people in many counties hate the US, and there are sometimes large demonstrations against it. You cannot say the same about Australia. 3. If you want to keep this article,it opens the door to more anti-(country)ism articles. The fact is that there is no country with an equalivant amount of bad sentiment directed towards it than than the US. 4.The Jakarta bombing may be more to do with anti-Westernism that anti-Austrialism, the reason Austrialia was targeted could be because it is the closest Western country to Indonesia not because Australia is hated more than other big Western countries. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeus_Ex_c1ba.html" title="User:Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a> 09:27, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, DE, there *is* a significant amount of specifically anti-Australian sentiment in Indonesia - more so than is directed at, say, Britain or France. For instance, Australia's involvement in East Timorese independence was greatly resented by certain factions in Indonesia. But I agree with Lacrimosus that International Relations of Australia would be a better place to discuss such issues, since anti-Australianism is only one facet of those relations. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 06:50, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Neutral. My first thought when I saw this was "joke article". But whether or not at this title, there is a significant issue surrounding Australia's perceptions overseas, particularly in Asia and the pacific. There's been numerous studies of the topic, and I think a good article could be written. That said, this article is a mix of stereotypes, opinion and a handful of good points. If it's kept, it desperately needs cleanup. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:13, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep, I can't see why there couldn't even be Anti-Luxembourgian senitment, or Anti-Palauian sentiment at some point in time. Every country must have critics, and why not note their views, NPOV or course. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a></li>
<li>Borderline Keep. I became aware of anti-Australian sentiment while researching previous "New Pages" here in the Wikipedia. It does seem to be real. That said, doesn't <i>every</i> country have someone that doesn't like it for some reason? I don't think we need an article about each nation's detractors. This particular nation, though, seems to have enough negative sentiment built up that it is probably worthy of comment. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 04:03, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Keep'</i>, but rename. Unlike a number of "politically active" states, such as US of A, U of SSR, Israel, etc., sentiments w.r.t. Australia are mild, and do not deserve an attribute "anti-...". What could make sense is an article, kind of Perception of Australia, dealing with steretypes and recorded public opinions. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 02:50, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
