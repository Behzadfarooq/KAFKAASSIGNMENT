<p>Hi and thanks for the contribution of the info on the Soviet Z80 clone! No problem about the language fixing; we all learn from each other that way. I know I do. Wikipedia is a prime way of polishing one's writing in any language, including one's own.&#160;:) If you know anything more about the T34 chip and other Soviet/Russian chips, don't hesitate adding info to the 'pedia; it will be greatly appreciated, believe me. I linkified the T34 article in case anyone has any info to put there, now or later.</p>
<p>As for myself, I take great interest in the history of computing in general, and microcomputing in particular, and also have an interest in Soviet high tech in many areas---from weapons to computing, etc, etc. (I guess I have the geek/engineer's gene; any tech stuff is interesting; an being a reader of history as well, I love to learn about tech that hasn't been very well covered in the Western press before the iron curtain went away). In time I hope to learn some more about the Soviet supercomputers.</p>
<p>By the way, is the T34 CPU's name in any way connected to/inspired by the 'real' <a href="../../../t/-/3/T-34.html" title="T-34">T34</a>? (a quality product by any standard, I'd say!)&#160;:-) Just wondering. --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 00:01, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, but I was also amused by this coincidence when I first saw this chip. BTW, I live 0.5km from the place where these <a href="../../../t/-/3/T-34.html" title="T-34">T-34s</a> were produced during WWII&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's very interesting to hear. Are there some museum there now? And: weren't the T-34s manufactured more places than one? Also, I've heard/read somewhere that one reason that many T-34 crews were expert tank drivers/operators was the common practice of letting the factory builders who built each particular tank follow it into combat as its crew? --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 00:48, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's a museum, but the most interesting is that on June, 1st they allow everybody to walk in any part of the plant and make an exhibition of tractors (the most interesting probably is T-800, which was, and maybe still is the most powerful tractor in the world). In 2003, when they celebrated their 70th anniversary, they had their exhibition not in the plant but almost in the center of the city, on one of the squares. Much more tractors were exhibited, include old ones and their newest ones, and besides, some tanks.</dd>
<dd>As for the places of manufacturing. I investigated this and it turned out that in fact, T-34 was produced in many places: <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkov.html" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizhny_Tagil_7648.html" title="Nizhny Tagil">Nizhny Tagil</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorky.html" title="Gorky">Gorky</a>. Nowadays they don't produce any tanks here, but in <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizhny_Tagil_7648.html" title="Nizhny Tagil">Nizhny Tagil</a> instead.</dd>
<dd>As for the crew, I haven't heard of this. This could hardly be true, I think, as at least at our plant they experienced a great shortage of workers, as most men went to war, so they had to employ women and children. My granny worked there when she was 14 years old. However, she told me only that during the peace, when they tested their tanks near our city, she did have to be there in order to fix any problems (as she worked in quality control department). BTW, this (producing &amp; testing of tanks during the peace) was all kept in secret, she signed an <a href="../../../n/d/a/NDA_a834.html" title="NDA">NDA</a> and wasn't allowed to go abroad until 1987. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Ivanoff_528e.html" title="User:Anthony Ivanoff">Anthony Ivanoff</a> 14:35, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will try to search for T34 microprocessor on the internet, but I don't think I will find much. Instead, I consider adding some info to the wiki about home-made Z80-based computers, amazingly popular in Soviet Union in 80s. I have two such computers, if I find some info about T34, I will take a photo of T34-based computer which is buried somewhere in the corner of my room and upload it here. I also have a great many Radio magazines (<b>Radio</b>, published since 1924, is still the most popular magazine in Russia about electronics) - and it was there where schemes and instructions for assembling these computers were printed. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Ivanoff_528e.html" title="User:Anthony Ivanoff">Anthony Ivanoff</a> 05:40, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, actually, the Russian electronics hobbyist community of the 80s seems to have functioned a whole lot like the American one, namely by having magazines publish circuit layouts and articles about microcomputer kits? I don't think we had such sophisticated magazines in Scandinavia; don't know about central and western Europe, though. --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 00:48, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's right. It was this magazine who made all these Spectrums so popular, by publishing detailed descriptions on how to assemble them. IIRC, it all started from Radio80-RK computer ("Radio" for the name of the magazine, 80 for 1980, and RK for "Radio amateur's computer" - it was intended for calculations related to eletronics, thus helping these amateurs in their hobby). --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Ivanoff_528e.html" title="User:Anthony Ivanoff">Anthony Ivanoff</a> 14:35, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Update: So I didn't find any info about T34BM1, as I expected. The only thing I found is <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/offlinequestions/5548/" class="external text" title="http://www.computerra.ru/offlinequestions/5548/" rel="nofollow">this</a> page. It is a poll, asking 'What was your first computer', and here a person says he had a T34-based computer (search for "Z80" in the page).</dd>

<dd>The computer on the first photo wasn't on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZX_Spectrum_clones_6cfa.html" title="List of ZX Spectrum clones">list</a>, so I updated this list and wrote <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubna_48K_e725.html" title="Dubna 48K">an article</a> about it.</dd>

<p>Please don't give articles internal links to non-article pages. This creates a problem for mirror sites that copy only the article name space.

<p>You are entitled to vote as you wish of course. However, did you base your vote based not on the candidate's strength and weaknesses or based on an advertizement from a third party that you didn't like? In the latter case, I would encourage you to study the candidate's contributions, statements and opposition. You <i>are</i> allowed to change your vote (as well as to keep it unchanged obviously) if you realize that you simply got carried away.

<p>Hi Anthony, I've created this history/philosophy stub and I wondered if you'd be so kind as to take a look because I can't speak Russian. Researching this subject without any knowledge of Russian has proven to be a little too difficult. I'd like to find out as much info as possible, but I'm particularly interested to know when the group began and when it disbanded (if it has been disbanded?). I'd really appreciate your assistance!--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholas_Cimini_abef.html" title="User:Nicholas Cimini">Nicholas</a> 15:12, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, according to <a href="http://www.marecki.ru/text/interesting_text_4.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.marecki.ru/text/interesting_text_4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marecki.ru/text/interesting_text_4.htm</a> , it began in December 1917. In March 1918 there were already 18 people. They published a journal called "Free voices", free as in "freedom", of course. But there were only two issues, the last in June 1918. The name "Voskresenie" (resurrection), that is, resurrection of Russia, was adopted in late 1919. Bakhtin was the first to be arrested on December 8, and Meyer - on December 11, 1928, others a bit later - in December and January. So that was when it was disbanded.</li>
</ul>
<p>But note that Voskresenie, in fact, should be a disambiguation page. Voskresenie in Russian can also mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Sunday</li>
<li>Resurrection (either related to Jesus Christ, or used metaphorically)</li>
<li>A very old (1970s till now), famous and popular rock band in Russia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for your interest in Russia&#160;:)</p>
<p>PS Hmm... This page at marecki.ru may be a good source for turning the stub into a great article... Maybe I will translate info from there and put it in the article. Or maybe not =)</p>

<dd>Thanks for this Anthony. The most recent edit suggests that the <a href="../../../v/o/s/Voskresenie.html" title="Voskresenie">Voskresenie</a> were strictly opposed to the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolsheviks.html" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>. However, my understanding is that the group was sympathetic towards the revolution, although they wanted the freedom to express their spiritual beliefs. I'll do what I can to research this, but I'd really appreciate all the help I can get. Once again, many thanks <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiThanks.png_b5e9.html" class="image" title="Image:WikiThanks.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/15/WikiThanks.png" alt="Image:WikiThanks.png" width="43" height="39" longdesc="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiThanks.png_b5e9.html" /></a> --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholas_Cimini_abef.html" title="User:Nicholas Cimini">Nicholas</a> 18:17, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
