<dd>I think the main objection has been to the use of forced or coercive medication rather than to any particular treatment per se. Certainly <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Szasz</a> would aruge that people should have free access to antipsychotic drugs but would argue against their control or imposition against someone's will. - <a href="../../../v/a/u/User%7EVaughan_120e.html" title="User:Vaughan">Vaughan</a> 12:25, 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that this article is conspicuous by the absence of the initial point raised above. Antipsychotics were a primary target of the original 60s/70s antipsychiatry movement, often referred to as chemical straightjackets. Avoiding them (entirely or relatively) was a key part of developments like <a href="../../../s/o/t/Soteria.html" title="Soteria">soteria</a>. The modern antipsychiatry or consumer/survivor movement is also associated with a lot of criticism of their potentially anti-recovery long-term use, and of the basis for the huge pharmaceutical industry promotion of atypicals now that the typicals are out of patent. I'm sure it could be covered in the context of good balanced sections on effectiveness claims and adverse effects, they're a bit random-seeming in their coverage at the moment. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 02:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC) p.s. i've added a subheading that wasn't there before, to try to clarify the discussion, I hope this is OK</dd>

<p>It is my understanding that neuroleptic was initially a French term and that its specific literal meaning was related to the tendency to cause movement disorders. As I'm going on memory of an article I don't have in front of me&#160;; I'm not changing anything right now.71.214.6.129 06:33, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The alternate term major tranquillizer is more accurate as that is the mechanism by which the drug works. There is no drug on earth with "anti-psychotic" properties. The term is a complete misnomer. Francesca Allan of MindFreedomBC 03:35, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>She's right. There are no drugs that cure <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotic.html" title="Psychotic">psychotic</a> individuals of their ailments. Instead <b>Major Tranquilizers</b> are used to majorly tranquilize the <b>dangerous, the disruptive</b> and plain ol' nutjobs who might be a risk to themselves and to others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>She is in fact <i><b>quite wrong</b></i>, and you are even more incorrect. Perhaps you should research a bit more before you say things, especially if you plan to hide behind an anonymous identity. Antipsychotics are drugs to relieve the effects of psychosis, and your diagnosis to people with problems as 'plain ol' nutjobs' is rather hasty, not to mention rude. Major tranquilizers are used in the treatment of berserk and <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggressive.html" title="Aggressive">Aggressive</a>, violent people, AND psychosis. not all people who are experiencing symptoms typical to those of psychosis are violent, and major tranquilizers <i><b>certainly</b></i> not used to <i><b>cure</b></i> people of EITHER condition, they are typically used as a method of either subduing the patient or inducing sleep, as well as helping chemical inbalances in the brain. Perhaps you should think before you use such rude terminology, you make people experiencing psychosis sound like serial killers.--<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeur0X_e171.html" title="User:Neur0X"><font face="fixedsys" color="#330099">Neur</font><font face="fixedsys" color="#336600">0</font><font face="fixedsys" color="#330099">X</font></a> <sup>.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeur0X_4902.html" title="User talk:Neur0X"><font color="#003366">talk</font></a></sup> 01:23, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article on <a href="../../../d/o/p/Dopamine.html" title="Dopamine">dopamine</a> mentions that some anti-psychotics that affect dopamine activity can act as amotivators. Is anyone able to elaborate on this?</p>

<p>The part about off-label uses for antipsychotics is incorrect. Pimozide and Haloperidol are indeed used for Tourette's Syndrome, but those are FDA approved drugs for that condition. Off-label refers to treating a disorder with a drug that is not approved for such usage, such as using an anti-seizure medication to correct a mood disorder.</p>

One thing I notice isn’t mentioned clearly in the article is the disastrous effect some of these drugs can have on people. In 1997 I suffered a mental breakdown and had what was called a severe psychotic episode (basically due to extreme stress), I was sectioned and put in mental hospital and was put on Droperidol, paroxetine and a short course of high dose lorazepam. My symptoms from these 'anti-psychotics' became very severe. I became suicidal while in hospital and I never had been ever before. Worse, as the drugs ‘cured’ my bipolar 'depression' my reality began to slip and for a while after I was out of hospital I lost my core reality completely. I had gone from being psychotic and manic depressive to full blown schizophrenia. Eventually I began to regain reality, and have at least partly recovered but it has been a very difficult process and I don't even know if I would be alive now if it wasn’t for my families (especially my mothers) huge help.</p>
<p>I am probably the ultimate non-typical mental patient, until my breakdown I had been well rooted in reality for all my then 27 years. I was and am a computer scientist, I was specialising in AI and machine intelligence, I had a reasonably good knowledge of neurology and psychology, had been actively studying human consciousness for several years and was specialising in vision systems. What makes me even more untypical was that I had just made a breakthrough and was contemplating something not worth millions but many billions of dollars, and it was the stress of this this that I partly blame for the original breakdown.</p>
<p>The source of all my problems was that the doctors treated me like a sausage in a sausage factory, most of the people in that (uk) hospital got the same drugs as me and its obvious that its not so much the drugs fault so much as the way they were prescribed - the doctors and the system. Understandably I now have a deep fear and a certain hatred of psychiatrists because of this - just like seemingly most other mental patients. Another point not mentioned is the huge physical damage the drugs do to people, the line of emaciated half corpses that were most of the patients in that hospital reminded me unmistakably of Dachau.</p>
<p>I apologise for the length of this but its not easy to put things simply. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucien86_4e8e.html" title="User:Lucien86">Lucien86</a> 05:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As this is an encylopedic article, could we break this down into something more understanable to the common person? I mean, the article isn't in a science magazine, nor is it being presented at a science convention of some sort. It's for the common persons and the researchers. Is it possible to make this more understandable? I read through it and I'm not an expert, but that's exactly my point. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Marksman_9cb1.html" title="User:Colonel Marksman">Colonel Marksman</a> 06:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To be fair, this isn't the kind of topic generally looked up by anyone but a student or specialist, and as such, will find much more value in being indepth and technical the way it is, rather than simplified for your average user. More simplified explainations can be found in the various pages for specific antipsychotics, which is quite possibly where the information you're looking for or interested in is covered?&#160;;-)</p>

<p>There is a link under the subheading "Side Effects" (Tardive dyskinesia) that redirects to what appears to be a pseudoscience website www.yoism.org. Although there are indeed pictures there of what appear to be something like tardive dyskinesia, viewers must sift through alot of highly opinionated non-scientific garbage to get to anything of interest. Would it be ok to remove this link? Surely there must be other sources that would do better here? I will look for some.Neurophysik 05:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
