<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Newley_b5b9.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Anthony Newley was one of entertainment's genuine triple threats: an actor, singer, and composer with an international following, equally adept and prodigious in all three fields. Moreover, he enjoyed success as a performer in such seemingly mutually exclusive fields as rock &amp; roll and the legitimate stage. And even more improbably, he did it with a working-class Cockney persona that should never have found much currency outside of England. Indeed, for 30 years he was one of the most imposing talents to come out of England this side of the Beatles.</p>
<p>Born to a single mother in the London working-class neighborhood of Hackney, Newley was evacuated during the bombing of London and was thereby exposed to the performing arts when he was tutored during this time by George Pescud, a former music-hall entertainer. Though recognized as very bright by his teachers back in London, he was uninterested in school, and by the age of fourteen was working as an office boy when he read an ad for "boy actors." After an audition, he was offered a job including free tuition at the prestigious Italia Conti Stage School. He accepted and his career was launched. His first major film role was as Dick Bultitude in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Ustinov_b741.html" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>'s <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_Versa_52ef.html" title="Vice Versa">Vice Versa</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> followed by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Artful_Dodger_b978.html" title="The Artful Dodger">the Artful Dodger</a> in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lean_b22d.html" title="David Lean">David Lean</a>'s 1948 rendition of <i><a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Twist_2944.html" title="Oliver Twist">Oliver Twist</a></i>, the classic <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> tome. He made a successful transition from child star to contract player in British movies of the 1950s (broken up by a short and disastrous stint in the military), to a top-of-the-pops crooner in the 1960s. During this decade he also added his greatest accomplishments on the London and Broadway stage, in Hollywood films, and British and United States television. In the 1970s he remained active, particularly as a Las Vegas and Catskills resort performer, but his career had begun to flounder. He had taken risks that eventually led to his downfall in Hollywood. Throughout the 1980s and 90s he worked valiantly to achieve a comeback but always one obstacle or another hindered him. Finally it was his health, when cancer began to plague him in the 1980s and returned to claim his life at the age of 67, soon after his becoming a grandfather.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Newley_b5b9.html" title="Edit section: Music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>
<p>Newley had a successful pop music career as a vocalist, with two <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_record.html" title="Hit record">number one hits</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>: "Why?" and "Do You Mind?" As a songwriter, he won the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year_5dd7.html" title="Grammy Award for Song of the Year">Grammy Award for Song of the Year</a> for "What Kind of Fool Am I", but he was also well-known for "Gonna Build a Mountain" and comic novelty songs such as "That Noise" and his version of "Strawberry Fair". He wrote songs that others made hits including "<a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldfinger_%28song%29.html" title="Goldfinger (song)">Goldfinger</a>" (the title song of the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> film, <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldfinger_%28film%29.html" title="Goldfinger (film)">Goldfinger</a></i>), and "<a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeling_Good_b35c.html" title="Feeling Good">Feeling Good</a>", which became a hit for <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Simone_5158.html" title="Nina Simone">Nina Simone</a> and the rock band <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muse_%28band%29.html" title="Muse (band)">Muse (band)</a>. With <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Bricusse_ead0.html" title="Leslie Bricusse">Leslie Bricusse</a>, he wrote the musical <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_the_World_-_I_Want_to_Get_Off_5811.html" title="Stop the World - I Want to Get Off">Stop the World - I Want to Get Off</a></i> in which he also performed, earning a nomination for a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_for_Best_Leading_Actor_in_a_Musical_059a.html" title="Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical">Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical</a>. The play was released in a film version in 1971 (see<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/combined" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/combined" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), but Newley was unable to star in it due to a schedule conflict. The other musicals for which he co-wrote music and lyrics with Bricusse included <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Roar_of_the_Greasepaint%E2%80%94the_Smell_of_the_Crowd_1fec.html" title="The Roar of the Greasepaint—the Smell of the Crowd">The Roar of the Greasepaint—the Smell of the Crowd</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>) and <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_c564.html" title="Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory">Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</a></i> (1971), based on the children's book by <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roald_Dahl_780b.html" title="Roald Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>.</p>
<p>Newley's many albums combine his talent as a vocal stylist with his abilities as a songwriter. The consensus of critics and fans rates Pure Imagination, Ain't It Funny, Love Is a Now and Then Thing, and In My Solitude at the top of the list. Amongst the many compilations now available, the better ones are Anthony Newley: The Decca Years (1959-1964), Once in a Lifetime: The Anthony Newley Collection (1960-1971), and Anthony Newley's Greatest Hits (Deram). When he collaborated with Bricusse, they referred to themselves as the team of Brickman and Newburg, with Newburg concentrating mainly on the music and Brickman on the lyrics. Ian Frasier often did their arrrangements and it has been suggested that his contributions were more extensive than has been acknowledged. For the songs from Hieronymous Merkin, Newley collaborated with Herman Raucher.</p>
<p>In 1963 Newley even had a hit comedy album called Fool Britannia!, the result of improvisational satires of the British <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profumo_scandal.html" title="Profumo scandal">Profumo scandal</a> of the time by a team of Newley, his then-wife <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Collins_5d74.html" title="Joan Collins">Joan Collins</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Sellers_3f5b.html" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>. Newley's contributions to Christmas music are highlighted by his heartfelt rendition of "The Coventry Carol," which appears on many anthologies; he also wrote and sang a hilarious novelty Christmas song called "Santa Claus is Elvis." There is also a notorious album of spoken poetry which has Newley appearing in the nude on the sleeve with a similarly-attired young model.</p>
<p>In his later years as a mature singer Newley recorded songs from Fiddler on the Roof and Scrooge. He enjoyed his final popular success onstage when he starred in the latter musical in London and Birmingham in the 1990s. At the time of his death he had been working on a musical of Shakespeare's Richard III.</p>
<p>Newley's vocal style has been recognised as a major influence on that of the early <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>. In recognition of his creative skills and body of work, Newley was elected to the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame_5b19.html" title="Songwriters Hall of Fame">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a> in 1989 (see<a href="http://songwritershalloffame.org/inductee_ceremony_detail.asp?ceremonyId=1&amp;inducteeCeremonyId=43" class="external autonumber" title="http://songwritershalloffame.org/inductee_ceremony_detail.asp?ceremonyId=1&amp;inducteeCeremonyId=43" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Newley_b5b9.html" title="Edit section: Acting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Acting</span></h3>
<p>The shortlived <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_TeleVision_4ff6.html" title="Associated TeleVision">ATV</a> series <i>The Strange World of Gurney Slade</i> in which Newley starred, continues to have a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_following.html" title="Cult following">cult following</a> due to its postmodern premise that the Newley character is trapped inside a television programme. Apart from a repeat of one episode on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, it has not been seen in the UK in recent years. The show's theme tune by Max Harris (composer) may be better-known today than the series itself. The piano figure prominent in the recording was lifted (unacknowledged) from <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mose_Allison_bf29.html" title="Mose Allison">Mose Allison's</a> song "Parchman Farm".</p>
<p>Newley had memorable turns as Matthew Mugg in the original Doctor Dolittle and the repressed English businessman opposite Sandy Dennis in the original Sweet November. He also hosted Lucille Ball on a whirlwind tour of mod London in the Lucy TV special "Lucy in London." And none who have seen it will soon forget his performance in the autobiographical, Fellini-esque and X-rated Heironymous Merkin, which he also wrote and directed.</p>
<p>His last feature role in the cast of the long-running British TV drama <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i> was to have been a regular role, but Newley had to withdraw after a few months when his health began to fail.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Newley_b5b9.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>He was married to Ann Lynn from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, but the marriage ended in divorce. He then was married to the actress <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Collins_5d74.html" title="Joan Collins">Joan Collins</a> from 1963 to 1971. The couple had two children, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tara_Newley_af45.html" title="Tara Newley">Tara Newley</a> and Sacha Newley. His third wife was former air hostess Dareth Rich, and they also had two children, Christopher and Shelby.</p>
<p>Newley had been raised by his mother Grace and, from the age of eight onward, by his stepfather, whose name was Ronald Gardner. The latter wound up in Beverly Hills working as a Chauffeur for London Towne Livery Service LTD, owned and operated by actor Gerald Peters. Gardner soon ran off with a household employee of Newley's collaborator Leslie Bricusse, leaving Grace single again. Newley searched with the help of a detective and found his biological father George Kirby and effected a bittersweet reunion with the man who was a complete stranger to him, but who had secretly followed his son's career with fatherly pride all along. Newley bought his father a house in Beverly Hills, in the hopes that he would reunite with Grace--but it was not to be.</p>
<p>Newley died on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">14 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, in <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jensen_Beach%2C_Florida_5976.html" title="Jensen Beach, Florida">Jensen Beach, Florida</a> from <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renal_cancer.html" title="Renal cancer">renal cancer</a> at the age of 67. He was said to have expired in the arms of his companion, the designer Gina Fratini. He was survived by his four children, a grand-daughter Miel and also his mother Grace, then in her mid-90s.</p>
<p>Newley's life is the subject of a biography by Garth Bardsley called Stop the World (London: Oberon, 2003). Some of the biographical data has been called into question and is hard to corroborate; there are several scandalous revelations that may be false. The tone is at times rather hostile to its subject. Also tinged with bitterness, but relevant to the subject of Newley's life, are Joan Collins's interesting autobiographies Past Imperfect and Second Act.</p>
