<p>RickK: in our own article, <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingoism.html" title="Jingoism">Jingoism</a> is described as "chauvinistic patriotism, especially with regard to a warmongering political stance." These seems to me to be an accurate description of some of the discourse in the US w.r.t to the French over the past year (Freedom Fries and all). Why do you object to this term? -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 21:21, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take it out of the first sentence. The term is loaded, and implies that the only reason why there is anti-French sentiment is because of American bias. It does not allow for the possibility that there might be just some possibility that justifies the reactions. I'm not saying that the reactions ARE justified, only that the tone of including words like jingoism makes the first sentence POV. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:56, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</b>

<dd>Presumption of innocence, freedom of speech and freedom of opinion (including, but not limited to, religion) are constitutional rights (1789 <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_cb34.html" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">accusations section</span></h2>
<p>I think this section was a great idea, bringing the subject into the light, and placing the square light of objectivity on what are many of the common stereotypes. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 06:24, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree. The encyclopedic content is the history of Franco-US relations and its effects on perceptions of France within the US. That information, though incomplete, should form the heart of the article. The "accusations" section is nothing but a list of crude stereotypes so overstated that few could seriously hold most of them to that degree (e.g., the French may be vaguely considered weak, but Napoleon is well known), and then (almost as crude) rebuttals using POV language which seem designed to make Americans look ignorant rather than provide <i>balance</i>, which would be the only useful function of such counterclaims. The section should have a heavy rewrite rather than heavy prominence. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:06, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, an encyclopedia document facts, and it is a fact that those stereotypes and jokes are often said, including by some US politicians. The rebuttals are simply meant to explain how these jokes are factually wrong - in a similar way that Wikipedia guidelines state that when discussing fictional characters or events, one should always state that they are fictional in the introduction. If we have to explain that <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> is a fictional character and not a real person, I guess that we may explain why some jokes ignore facts. This has nothing to do with making Americans in general look "ignorant".</dd>
<dd>Now, my opinion is that any person making jokes like "how many Frenchmen does it take to defend Paris? nobody knows, it has never been tried" either is utterly ignorant of history, either shows enormous bad taste and insensitivity. I think that it is a significant fact in international relations that some prominent citizens of a country, especially politicians with a national career, can allow themselves to make such comments about foreign allies, and that it is very telling of some attitudes inside that country. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 06:12, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Okay, well, it's important to not be bring sensitivities into this. Jokes are just that, jokes, and the Paris joke can be found as funny even though it is obviously not true. By encyclopedic content, I mean professional quality, not lists of crude jokes. The article should be about anti-French sentiment. It would also be inappropriate in the article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> to include long lists of "nigger jokes". Rather, the phenomenon should be discussed from a dispassionate point of view as a sociological phenomenon. A few examples might help in this regard, but the "accusations" section both is not written very neutrally and has a choice of examples which are too extreme and rebutted too coarsely. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 09:09, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I may have expressed myself insufficiently well. To me, it is a significant fact that major US politicians can afford to make jokes such as the Paris joke over the tomb of the millions of French soldiers that died in WW1 to defend Paris, or the hundreds of thousands that died in WW2. To follow your example, no major US politician could nowadays make a "nigger joke" without being asked to step down. Still, interestingly, it is possible to mock France in such a way, and it is perfectly acceptable; your own dismissal of the matter as insignificant is actually very significant in that context.</dd>
<dd>To me, sociologically, it means that there's an ingrained acceptance in the American society of mocking the French in ways that would instantly gain condemnation on grounds of racism or xenophobia if jokes of similar insensitivity and arrogance were aimed at other communities.</dd>
<dd>In short, what I find interesting is not those particular examples of anti-French sentiment, but the fact that they may be regularly uttered in the press, political meetings etc... and that everybody finds that acceptable or merely dismisses them as harmless jokes.</dd>
<dd>I also note that if in a foreign country some major politicians made jokes about the United States on the same level, that foreign country would be branded "anti-American" by the American press.</dd>
<dd>The examples I gave may be extreme, but most were taken in the mainstream American media. Yes, it is probably a sad <i>fact</i> that the American political and mediatic establishment may go to such levels, and I find it enterely appropriate to reflect that fact, however unflattering it is for the said establishment. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 14:31, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I see France as a rival superpower, something which would send many of the merry pranksters who coined some of the "accusations" into hysterics, but they are a signifigant nuclear power and the #3 military spender generally <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph-T/mil_exp_dol_fig" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph-T/mil_exp_dol_fig" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

On the other hand, most americans do seem to be fat, arrogant, and stupid, at least in my crude estimation (the evidence, while anecdotal, is more striking here, being that I am american&#160;;) Anyhow I love information, and so long as its not innaccurate (and opinions rarely are) and is fairly presented (as I think this is) it has a place here.

<p>The portrayal of pre-WW2 American sentiment towards France as Francophilic is correct insofar as the facts it portrays, but a bit too rosy. Americans still had a bit of anti-French sentiment, though it was more light-hearted. The two main components of it were a feeling that French were snooty, overly-concerned with formality, and aristocratic (as compared to down-to-earth Americans), especially after the restoration of the monarchy, and a feeling that Parisians in particular had loose morals (especially as regards promiscuity). As <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Twain_2795.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> (a 19th-century American author) put it, "France has neither winter nor summer nor morals—apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country." So something about that should be added in. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 17:42, May 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>
