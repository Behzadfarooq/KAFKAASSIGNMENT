<dd>Clearly you are too arrogant and self-righteous that you have no interest in debating your point of view by your actions of quickly removing any critisms of your stand. You're right and all those ignorant Americans should stop using the English language all together. I fully expect this to be deleted in about 5 minutes. Broaden your horizons and get over it.<a href="../../../w/j/o/User%7EWjousts_c671.html" title="User:Wjousts">Wjousts</a> 12:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You arrogance is truly staggering. Let me put this in <i>simple terms</i> like you so condescendingly did on my talk page. Just because people use American spellings in articles doesn't make it wrong. Stop getting you knickers in a twist just because people have the cheek to not do things exactly the way you'd like them to. It's not better or worse, it's just different. Maybe you should try understanding other people's POV instead of declaring war on them. <a href="../../../w/j/o/User%7EWjousts_c671.html" title="User:Wjousts">Wjousts</a> 01:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>besides your comments were a personal attack and had nothing to do with editting any articles I have nothing to be ashamed of. The people who should be ashamed are those who believe you should just let terrorist run wild just because innocent people will be caught in the cross-fire if you act. I feel sorry for those trapped, but if they want to blame someone they should blame the Hezbollah terrorists. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 12:31, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To avoid needlessly replicating discussion across many talk pages, I'll post it here once.</p>
<p>The fact that the High Court is the highest in the Australian court hierarchy is useful and relevant information, which provides context to the articles on the judges. It's particularly important for those unfamiliar with the Australian court system. Further, the fact that article A includes something that article B does not is not a good reason to remove it from A, but rather a good reason to add it to B. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Antonio. I agree with you that quite a few administrators on here are quite pig headed and power mad. They all seem to be little people who must be really bullied in real life. I support you totally in that regard that some of these administrators have no decency or manners or civility when dealing with other people. They are all a case of little idiotic men having gone power mad. They are really stuffed up shitheads. They need to chill more and be more accomodating and be less serious sometimes. Maybe there should be a joke series on such little pighead administrators like the one on lawyers. Their big brother act sometimes get a little too far. Those retards should learn some good sense and diplomacy. You did a good job of exposing those stupid losers and their nonsense and frustrated rants. Cheers. This was just a message supporting you on that issue. No need to reply. 219.91.203.71 22:33, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You refer in an edit summary to a talk page discussion - I don't see one that matches the edit you made - you are making comments about the word compatriot but you are editing out statements made by a Ms Bailey (whoever she might be) - I don't see the connection.
