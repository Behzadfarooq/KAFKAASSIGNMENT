<p>See intervention on my talk page: article 'Rumold' + its talk page moved to 'Saint Rumbold' - see the latter article's talk page; <b>for the moment leaving 'Rumold' though I hereby suggest to delete the article</b> (not much content; links to it were all referring to the saint and were updated). Please verify and <b>remove auto-created comment [and related answer] from my talk page</b>, thank you. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> 2006-06-15 17:55 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like some help with renaming an article (unless it should not need to survive): 'Saint Rumold of Malines' in <b>two</b> distinct ways: 1. Malines is a French word that had been used in English during a limited period; now Mechelen (about 13 times more on advanced Google search in English language); 2. Here too it seems best to insert the "b" in the saint's name (for it is much more common in English and it is a fair common ground between Rombout and Rumold(us).</p>
<p>Please note: The initiator and only author (besides my edits) of the 'Rumold' article thanked me for its move to 'Saint Rumbold' on the latter's talk page. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> 2006-06-15 21:19 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for being unclear, I just spotted my above typo (now corrected in the 2006-06-15 17:55 UTC text) in the name of the article that I had originally intended to still remain as disambiguity page [thus except 'For ... see ...' wiping its content, invoking AntiVandalBot before I could even finish the whole setup], but then considered unneeded an therefore asked here above to delete. Please note that I also suggest <b>utter deletion of 'Saint Rumold of Malines'</b>, there is no other to distinguish him from and I can't find this as some standard phrase for Saint Rumbold either. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a>2006-06-18 01:54 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So do you want <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumold.html" title="Rumold">Rumold</a> to be a disambig page err? -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 07:19, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For a few saints, the main article is on "Firstname", for most on "Saint Firstname"; in the latter case most often the "Firstname" is a disambiguity page (not always: may be a redirect, or may not exist e.g. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neot.html" title="Neot">Neot</a> for <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Neot_09de.html" title="Saint Neot">Saint Neot</a>).</dd>
<dd>Then there are redirection pages on "St. Firstname" and for alternative names "Saint Firstname2", "St. Firstname2".</dd>
<dd>3 possibilities are open for 'Saint Rumbold':
<ol>
<li>Disambiguity for 'Rumold', 'Rumbold' and redirect for 'Rumoldus', 'Rombout' and 'Rombaut' to 'Saint Rumbold',</li>
<li>Redirect for 'Rumold', 'Rumbold', 'Rumoldus', 'Rombout' and 'Rombaut' to 'Saint Rumbold',</li>
<li>None of the above 5 firstname pages would exist. For the moment, only the one on 'Rumold' does.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Since the 2nd person now on 'Rumold', 'Rumold Mercator' is not known by the firstname only (even the famous father is known by the family name) and his article is a stub unlikely to be much expanded, there should <b>not</b> be any mentioning of him either on a disambiguity page or as 'For ... see ...'. So, just as there was no 'Rum<b>b</b>old' page so far, I assume <b><i>one might DELETE the 'Rumold' page</i></b>. These pages could at any time become created (there are several Rumbolds but not on Wikipedia) when the need arises.</dd>
<dd><b><i>The only other reasonable option</i></b> (and after checking nearly all saints known by a firstname without suffix, I assume this may be best) is the 2nd possibility, thus <i><b>'Rumold' becoming redirect to 'Saint Rumbold'</b></i> and create the 4 alternative names as redirect pages as well. I can do that, but <i><b>I leave it up to you to do this for 'Rumold'</b></i> (which still has a lengthy html source) for I do not want another AntiVandalBot intervention.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is also still an article 'Saint Rumold of Malines' but the saint was never known that way: There is only one 'Saint Rumold of Malines' on the web, with a link under 'Saint Rumold', the 'of Malines' is even in that single article not part of the name. Thus, please <b><i>DELETE the 'Saint Rumold of Malines' page</i></b>.</dd>

<p>Ah, they're usually pretty accurate, but I caught AWB making a small mistake, tonight -- an IP user removed some vandalism on the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> article, and AVB reverted back to the vandalized article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Egypt&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59405604" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Egypt&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59405604" rel="nofollow">This diff in particular</a> is important, but I imagine it would be useful to go both forward and back a few edits.

<p>Hi! Normally AVB is very helpful but I was just reverted for reverting clear vandalism, and I'm wondering if something in my edit summary triggered the bot. An anon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29&amp;diff=59999342&amp;oldid=59902744" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29&amp;diff=59999342&amp;oldid=59902744" rel="nofollow">vandalized</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29_7eef.html" title="Penny Arcade (comic)">Penny Arcade</a> by replacing its text with the text from <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> and an insulting remark that the makers of Penny Arcade should learn English. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29&amp;diff=60004614&amp;oldid=59999342" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29&amp;diff=60004614&amp;oldid=59999342" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> to the last good version, with edit summary <i>"rvv to last by CyberSkull. Not funny."</i> AVB immediately reverted me.</p>
<p>Was it my saying "not funny" which triggered the bot, or is content from <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> on some sort of protection-list, and it thought I was removing content?

<p>I removed the text from category:Breast cancer survivors, and was torpedoed by AVB just like <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">User:Tawkerbot2</a> did. Please alter the bot's programming to allow this, and please also fix any other of your bots with the same flaw.
