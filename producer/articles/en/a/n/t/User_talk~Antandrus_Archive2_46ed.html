<p>Hi Antandrus--</p>
<p>Nice Vogl article! Hoping it's true, I added in the Fidelio bit. Perhaps Schubert was buying up all the Vogl tickets he could afford...</p>
<p>I also enjoyed your comments about the 1911 edition, particularly the bits about chewing gum and Tovey scribbling frantically on the back of an envelope. So hopefully we feel mutually encouraged to edit this stuff liberally.</p>

<p>Hi Antandrus, and thanks for the note. I've had an enforced break from Wikipedia for a bit, but hope to return to regular editing in a few days. I expect I'll look at some music articles as part of that - must admit, when I stuck my head in here today I looked at a lot of arbitration stuff, which depressed me a bit; but then I stumbled across a few new music articles which cheered me up a bit&#160;:) Great to see you and Opus are still around - hope to join you soon. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<p>&lt;&lt;moved from User:Antandrus/temp&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Hello Antandrus. Wasn't sure whether this page is open to all comers to make changes or not, so thought I'd be discrete and just mention one spelling error (virtuoso, not virtuouso). I've always been fascinated by Alkan, and wonder if you can verify either way the story about the bookshelf and the Talmud. I recently heard/read somewhere that this is apocryphal.

<p>You're welcome! And thanks for the compliment on the photo (it's a pretty view from up there, after a stiff climb). I've been noticing your work for a while and I think it's superb--keep it up!

<li>I'm flattered, thank you! Do you mind if I ask which work you've noticed? I always like to know what the highest profile edits are, so I can put some emphasis on them. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkTroll_16e8.html" title="User:ClockworkTroll">ClockworkTroll</a> 06:12, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Certainly: what I really like is your interactions with other users, especially welcoming newcomers; your attention to VfD, which is a slum and avoided by many (including me sometimes... but I think it is a bit of a duty for us to labor in such unsavory locales from time to time); and also I just like your positive attitude. It's one of my favorite soapboxes too that people here don't spend enough time noticing the good work of others. Hope that answers your question! &#160;:-) Happy editing, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 06:22, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're very kind, thank you. Actually, I kind of enjoy slumming in VfD from time to time. It keeps my "head in the game" so to speak. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkTroll_16e8.html" title="User:ClockworkTroll">ClockworkTroll</a> 06:27, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for welcoming me to Wikipedia, my original user ID was 511. Unfortunately they've managed to break their user ID mechanism several times, so I have a couple of IDs. Anyway, thanks for the info, I didn't recall seeing it in the New Grove article when I looked at it a decade ago, and didn't make a copy... hey, Stanford has a copy of a thesis which contains a photocopy!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for your welcome greetings on <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.184.177.120.html" title="User talk:80.184.177.120">User talk:80.184.177.120</a>. I agree to your statement of the key signature of Mahler's 5th symphony. BTW, the Dover Score states it as "Symphony No. 5 in C-sharp Minor/D-Major", which makes sense to me, too. But keep in mind, that it wasn't me, who objected against the key, but Mahler himself: <i>"From the order of the movements (where the usual first movement now comes second) it is difficult to speak of a key for the 'whole Symphony', and to avoid misunderstandings the key should best be omitted."</i> <a href="http://www.gustav-mahler.org/english/gesamtausgabe/cr5-f.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gustav-mahler.org/english/gesamtausgabe/cr5-f.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Just a bit about my person: I haven't created an account on the English Wikipedia so far, because I am mainly contributing to the German edition. cf. <a href="../../../../de/w/o/l/Benutzer%7EWolfgang_Nuss_b246.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Wolfgang_Nuss">de:Benutzer:Wolfgang Nuss</a> - Greetings from Frankfurt, Germany --80.184.177.120 20:06, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd answer you in German on de: but I'm too embarrassed by the badness of my German. Thank you for the link: I didn't know about Mahler's own objection to key on #5. Best, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 20:39, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I am a 28 year old mother of five, and I am also a student that finds Wikipedia very helpful. For the general public to be able to edit and vandalize any page that they want,and you have to fix it must be a thankless job alot of the time. I had to revert your page on Thomas Jefferson because of Vandalism. I noticed that that version had an error also and I do not know how to fix them.

<p>5000 edits in eight months, very nice... I see you could be convinced to accept an admin nomination, according to your userpage. I don't really know what to say to convince you, except that it really can be useful in fighting vandalism and dealing with complicated page moves, and it may be easier than it appears to stay out of controversy.

<p>He/they used to formerly make a point of letting many hours elapse between their respective votes, but it appears as if he/they're not being as subtle any more.</p>
<p>Last time, he/they stopped doing it after a few public remarks had been made about their oddly coinciding user pages and voting patterns, so I'd encourage simply pointing it out in VfD discussions.</p>

<p>Ha! I've noted his absence -- I added him to the list of 20th c. composers in the first place, I believe -- and I have to admit that some of my motivation for getting a start up was your shock that he didn't have an article yet! I did see the site, yes -- actually, it's listed in the external links -- and got a few tidbits (with my terrible French and Babelfish). And I'm using the online version of Grove, which claims to be from the 29-volume second edition, and the best I have until I can get back into the university library (at which point I probably won't have time to do much writing, alas). Sorry to beat you to it (at least a little)!</p>

<dd>Incidentally, yes, I've played some Françaix -- the wind quintet -- but not nearly enough. My chamber groups keep going off and graduating on me, the wretches.&#160;:-) There is still an article by Arthur Hoérée (and Richard Langham Smith) in the Opera section article (yes, they're separated), but I found it almost utterly useless; if that's what you have in the 1980 I see why you're so glad it was replaced... <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 05:15, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again not nearly enough Poulenc -- I'm sure I've played one or two of his pieces, but I can't think of what. I started on violin myself (and still play, but there are so many <i>good</i> violinists around that it's hardly worth mentioning), but bassoon suited me better, it and I both being a bit odd. Yes, Stetson's wind program and theory department are good, for a southeastern liberal arts school, at least, though I ended up there largely by accident. I take it from your photo/caption that you're off in California, doing whatever it is one does with a doctorate in music.&#160;:-) So great minds think alike again, with duelling Madeleines. Actually, mine is the Madeleine, but yours is the remembrance of things past (she says, ducking the overripe tomatoes). And thank you!

<dd>Hm. I do know of <i>joyce</i> and <i>re-joyce</i> in <i>Metamagical Themas</i> -- had to go check to see if <i>GEB</i> ended with an incomplete sentence or not; I suppose the RICERCAR bit echoes the beginning chapter and could begin the book again, endless cycle-like, if that's what you're thinking of. I know Hofstadter's output fairly well and Joyce only by reputation and a few excerpts (sadly enough). Have you read <i>GEB</i>, then?

<p>Hi, thanks for your comment on my editorial changes; I won't presume to debate a musicology Ph.D.! I guess I assumed that the de i was a spacing mistake in the vertuosa name. As for me, I am just an amateur/armchair baroque fan. I checked the Library of Congress catalog for the Cavalieri title, and saw that both e and et were used in the title (I had expected e or ed, but those wily Italians and their non-standardized spelling!!!) Anyway, I hope you don't mind me looking at the baroque articles; I figure we can work together to bring the light and sound of the baroque to starving souls needing such nourishment.</p>
<p>9 Jan: Thank you for you kind note. Glad to be of service. I learn a lot about composers I've never heard of, but there is a lot of work to do; for instance, I set up a stub for Zelenka, because he wasn't there yet!... anyway, keep in touch.</p>

By the way, the composers you aren't even close to as well-known as say, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomaso_Albinoni_302c.html" title="Tomaso Albinoni">Tomaso Albinoni</a>. And many composers composed in more than one style throughout their lives. About Viraldini, I looked up that name and found several sources that imply he <i>did</i> exist. If he did exist, this would mean that he wasn't a well-known composer. But please tell me some reasons why you believe the composer never existed. Could the information and music of the composer have been artificially made. And could you please give me a source for putting down the suspicion that <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Purcell_9056.html" title="Henry Purcell">Henry Purcell</a> may have been born on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_10.html" title="September 10">September 10</a>.

<dd>Here's one source for Viraldini: <a href="http://viraldini.narod.ru/biog.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://viraldini.narod.ru/biog.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. But it's certainly possible that people make stuff up over the Internet, and it all gets relatively widespread, which I suspect is the case with information found over the web on the singer <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engelbert_Humperdinck_%28singer%29_12ba.html" title="Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)">Engelbert Humperdinck</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a> 18:30, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Antandrus,</p>
<p>Hmm, this editor does seem a bit loose-cannon-ish. I gave a try to Beethoven and Mozart and I see that you've got Schubert more or less under control (keeping in mind, of course, the long-term issues with that article that you mention).</p>
<p>In other news, do you think you could take on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notes_in%C3%A9gales.html" title="Notes inégales">Notes inégales</a>? I am encouraged in asking this by the happy result of my having earlier begged you for <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musica_ficta.html" title="Musica ficta">musica ficta</a>.</p>

<dd>Hah! Wonder just how painstaking the research for that would be, and how the cataloguing would go... Relatedly, just made the day of the music librarian here by pointing his entry out (who has, incidentally, read his autobiography, and hints that it is well worth adding to my ever-growing reading queue). <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 17:50, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I am Gérard and i read your to-do list. I am specialized in french baroque music - particularly for harpsichord and organ. I have written quite a lot of bios of french baroque composers for the french Wiki and my purpose is to translate them to english. Ot will be necessary to check them, because english is not my mother language, as you probably will notice. Could you help me&#160;? I have planned my contributions in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_baroque_harpsichordists.html" title="French baroque harpsichordists">French baroque harpsichordists</a> according to a corresponding page in the french Wiki.

<p>Hi, Antandrus&#160;; thank you for your kind answer. I didn't mention it, but I wrote in english, one year ago, about Louis Couperin, the Couperin family, Georg Muffat, Matthias Weckmann, Jean Titelouze, etc. I also adapted to english some drawings I made about harpsichord for french Wiki. Could you check them, specially for correct names&#160;? I think that my contribution can be useful&#160;: you are aware that french composers of the baroque are a bit neglected here, and I have gathered much information upon them. I wish we can do a good job by joining our efforts.

Although if I had thought about it, I could have made writing for Wikipedia into a credited independent study project and dropped a different class, but that's another of those brilliant ideas that come far too late.

<p>Hi Antandrus. Since we last spoke I've been working away at a few things here and there, many of them in the music area, but elsewhere too. I don't mean to trouble you (well, not unduly, anyway!), but I'd be grateful if you would have a look at how things are shaping up at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Talk%7EClassical_music_era_c097.html" title="Talk:Classical music era">Talk:Classical_music_era</a> and, most recently, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Talk%7ESonata_394f.html" title="Talk:Sonata">Talk:Sonata</a>. Any advice would be welcome.
