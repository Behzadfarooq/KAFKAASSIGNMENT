<p><b>Anthony Baez</b> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>) was a 29-year old security guard who died on December 22,1994. His death occurred early in the morning on Cameron Place in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Heights_3d0c.html" title="University Heights">University Heights</a> section of the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx.html" title="Bronx">Bronx</a>. The fatal encounter began when the man, Anthony Baez, and his brothers hit a police car several times with their football around 1:30 am. Officer Francis X. Livoti ordered them to go home. After some discussion among themselves, the Baez brothers decided to continue their game, playing in the opposite direction. The situation escalated when Baez's brother David openly defied the officer's orders to leave. Officer Francis X. Livoti arrested David Baez first for disorderly conduct and then attempted to arrest Anthony Baez, who had protested his brother's arrest by crossing his arms in front of his chest. A scuffle ensued, while four other officers arrived on scene. Anthony Baez, was 5'6", 270 pounds, and asthmatic. Officer Francis X. Livoti was 5'10' and 170 pounds. Anthony Baez was subsequently declared dead after being taken to the hospital by the police when a dispatched ambulance failed to arrive. The New York City Medical Examiner ruled that Anthony Baez' death was caused by asphyxiation "due to compression of his neck and chest" as well as acute asthma. Dr. Hirsch said that the classification of homicide indicated the death was caused "either entirely or partially" by "the actions of another person" but that it was not a ruling on blame. Phil Caruso, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said that Anthony Baez “resisted violently when they attempted to put handcuffs on him, that's when he had the asthmatic attack." Officer Francis X. Livoti was the subject of several civilian complaints for excessive force, none of the complaints were substantiated and all of which (until then) had been dismissed by the Civilian Complaint Review Board.<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60615F73B540C768CDDA80894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60615F73B540C768CDDA80894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In his defense, Officer Francis X. Livoti denied that he had used a choke hold, asserting that any choking was unintentional and that he had not caused Baez's injuries or death. Three officers at the scene testified that they did not see anyone put Baez in a choke hold, that Baez was resisting arrest when officer Francis X. Livoti handcuffed him, and that Baez was conscious after being handcuffed. Baez' father and brothers testified that Livoti did put Baez in a choke hold, and that Baez was limp when Livoti handcuffed him. Officer Francis X. Livoti also contends that the district court failed to consider that Baez at least contributed to the confrontation by resisting his (Livoti’s) efforts to handcuff him (Baez) behind his back. <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/2nd/981608.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://laws.findlaw.com/2nd/981608.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>The death of Anthony Baez during the Christmas season created sensational media attention. This was the third and most notable incident involving NYPD police brutality in 1994, and in some previous cases the officers were acquitted. In the Ernest Sayon case, the Medical Examiner's office found that he (Sayon) had died from the pressure applied to his chest and back by the police. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B15FF385D0C738DDDAC0894DC494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B15FF385D0C738DDDAC0894DC494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Racial tensions were also fueled, by the death of another police suspect in custody, Johnny Cromaterie, in Manhattan. Cromaterie, a black man, was 5'9" tall, weighed over 230 pounds and was an epileptic. Even though NYC's Chief Medical Examiner ruled his death a homicide, a grand jury declined in Feb 1994 to indict any of the five (5) officers involved, ruling that their use of force was justified. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B17F73D580C7A8DDDAA0894DC494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B17F73D580C7A8DDDAA0894DC494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>The Civilian Complaint Review Board in yet another case involving the 46th precinct, within a month of the Baez incident, ruled that detectives Patrick J. Brosnan and James Crowe had used excessive force in the deaths of suspects Anthony Rosario, and Hilton Vega. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60611F639590C7B8EDDAE0894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60611F639590C7B8EDDAE0894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Although the cases are unrelated, they have fueled suspicion in the Hispanic neighborhoods that some officers, particularly those who are white, treat residents with little respect and in some cases, abuse. In March 1995, a Bronx grand jury cleared the detectives of criminal misconduct. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60614F6385F0C738EDDA10894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60614F6385F0C738EDDA10894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>In March 1995, a Bronx grand jury indicted Officer Livoti on charges of manslaughter in the second degree. Homicide charges against officer Livoti were thrown out after an indictment with an incorrect charge was noted. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60612FA3A5E0C758CDDA00894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60612FA3A5E0C758CDDA00894DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>In December 1995, Officer Livoti was reindicted for <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminally_negligent_homicide.html" title="Criminally negligent homicide">criminally negligent homicide</a>. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B1FF8345D0C7A8CDDAB0994DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B1FF8345D0C7A8CDDAB0994DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Livoti's trial began in September, 1996. He had waived his right to a jury trial and instead opted to have the case heard solely by a judge.</p>
<p>In October 1996, Officer Livoti was acquitted by a State Supreme Court Justice. Fearing reprisals <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F14F93A5D0C7B8CDDA80894DF494D81&amp;showabstract=1and" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F14F93A5D0C7B8CDDA80894DF494D81&amp;showabstract=1and" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and heeding to the outcries of the public, Federal prosecutors reopened the case against Francis X. Livoti, in the death of Anthony Baez. The Federal prosecutors were not constrained by double jeopardy, that is, charging Officer Livoti twice with the same crime. Instead they turned to the same civil rights statute that was used to convict Los Angeles police officers Stacey C. Koon and Laurence Powell for the beating of Rodney King.<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10814F73B5D0C778DDDA80894D0494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10814F73B5D0C778DDDA80894D0494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p><br />
Officer Daisy Boria, who is a distant relative of the Baez's, was present at his arrest in 1994. She contradicted three of her fellow police officers, including her partner.<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C16FB3B5B0C768CDDA90994DE494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C16FB3B5B0C768CDDA90994DE494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>In 2002, Officer Alfredo Toro (who was also one of the officers on the scene the night Anthony Baez died), testified that a black man wearing a baseball cap helped Mr. Livoti hold the victim's feet down, according to a report in Newsday. Officer Toro was also more notably involved with the death of another officer in January 2006 <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061FFD3D5A0C708CDDAB0894DE404482&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061FFD3D5A0C708CDDAB0894DE404482&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>In 2003, Disciplinary charges were brought against two other officers Mario Erotokritou and Anthony Farnan involved in the death of Anthony Baez. Both officers were summarily dismissed. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EFDE1731F930A15756C0A9659C8B63" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EFDE1731F930A15756C0A9659C8B63" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<p>Gerard E. Lynch, a former top Federal prosecutor who teaches at Columbia law school, said that Federal prosecutors have increasingly been taking second looks at state cases involving organized crime cases, drugs and highly publicized civil rights cases. "One has to wonder whether a lot of cases get taken up because of media attention, as opposed to prosecutors asking whether the Federal Government has a legitimate interest in pursuing it," he said, according to the New York Times. Some believe that federal prosecutors are "disrespectful to the integrity of a verdict pronounced by a judge or jury," said the Times. On the other hand, federal prosecutions were used in the south to overcome the refusal of white juries to convict for racial murders. The federal crime that Livoti was convicted of carries a much higher sentence than the state homicide crime that he was acquitted of. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F16F83E5A0C738DDDA90994DE494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F16F83E5A0C738DDDA90994DE494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>In June 1998, Livoti was convicted in Federal court of violating Anthony Baez’s civil rights. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7071EF73C5B0C748EDDAF0894D0494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7071EF73C5B0C748EDDAF0894D0494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>Livoti was sentenced to seven and a half years in federal prison.<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B12F7385F0C7A8CDDA90994D0494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B12F7385F0C7A8CDDA90994D0494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>Livoti still denies using an illegal choke hold on Anthony Baez, and contends that Baez died because he struggled while resisting arrest after playing football in the cold, exacerbated by his asthma.<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10910FA345C0C758DDDA80894DF494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10910FA345C0C758DDDA80894DF494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>
<p>Livoti was released in April 2005, after serving six and a half years.<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0811FE3A5A0C768DDDAD0894DD404482&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0811FE3A5A0C768DDDAD0894DD404482&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
