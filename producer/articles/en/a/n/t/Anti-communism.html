<p><b>Anti-communism</b> refers to opposition to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>. Historically, the word "communism" has been used to refer to several types of communal social organization and their supporters, but, since the mid-19th century, the dominant school of communism in the world has been <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>. Marxist communism drew far more supporters and opponents than any other form of communism. As such, the term <i>anti-communism</i> is most often employed to refer to opposition to Marxist communism.</p>
<p>Marxism, and the form of communism associated with it, rose to prominence in the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Organized anti-communism developed in reaction to the growing popularity of the communist movement, and took on many forms as the 20th century unfolded. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservative</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchism.html" title="Monarchism">monarchists</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> fought against the first wave of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_revolution.html" title="Communist revolution">communist revolutions</a> from 1917 to 1922. <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> were based on a violent brand of anti-communism, they incited fear of a communist revolution in order to gain political power, and they aimed to destroy communism in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">Nationalists</a> fought against communists in numerous civil wars across the globe. <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">Liberalism</a> shaped much of the anti-communist foreign policy of the Western powers, and dominated anti-communist intellectual thought in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a> in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, Marxist communism became largely associated with the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in the public imagination (though there were many Marxists and communists who did not support the Soviet Union and its policies). As a result, anti-communism and opposition to the Soviet Union became almost indistinguishable, especially in terms of foreign policy. Anti-communism was an important element in the foreign policy of the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers.html" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a> during the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communism.html" title="Edit section: Conservative and traditionalist anti-communism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conservative and traditionalist anti-communism</span></h2>
<p>The communist movement is <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary.html" title="Revolutionary">revolutionary</a> and modernist - it aims to achieve a radical transformation of society, and it actively promotes the rapid modernization of traditional societies. For this reason, there is a great deal of conflict between communists on the one hand, and conservatives and traditionalists on the other. The majority of communist revolutions have occurred in relatively conservative countries, and most of the governments overthrown by communists had been conservative governments.</p>
<p>Since communists advocate social equality, they are theoretically opposed to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a>, and other forms of hereditary privilege. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the young communist movement was at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> continent. At the time, monarchists were the most prominent anti-communists, and many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">German Empire</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Monarchists viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from the natural order of things, and they believed that kings and emperors had the right to take any steps necessary to prevent the spread of ideas that threatened this natural order.</p>
<p>However, World War I shattered the balance of power in Europe, and delivered a fatal blow to traditional monarchy. Kings and emperors drew their legitimacy from their image as wise protectors of the people and stewards of the country. It was assumed that the king always knew best, and that the king's judgement was, if not infallible, at least better than the judgement of the common people. But the world war, which had been started by the kings of Europe, brought death and misery on a scale never seen before. The image of the king as a wise ruler was replaced by the image of the king as a detached fool who knew nothing of the suffering of his people. The old European monarchies were overthrown in a series of revolutions and military engagements. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist-run Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917-1922. Many of these, such as the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Revolution_636a.html" title="German Revolution">German Revolution</a>, were defeated by conservative monarchist military units.</p>
<p>The 1920s and 30s saw the fading of traditional conservatism. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> movements on the one hand, and by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a>-inspired <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_conservatism.html" title="Liberal conservatism">liberal conservatives</a> on the other. Communism remained largely a European phenomenon, so anti-communism was also concentrated in Europe. When communist groups and political parties began appearing elsewhere in the world, such as in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> in the late 1920s, their opponents were usually <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonial authorities</a> and/or local nationalist movements.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">reactionary</a> anti-communist <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorships</a> that were established in Europe in the late 1930s, such as the government of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, are considered to fall somewhere on the border between traditional conservatism and fascism.</p>

</div>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, communism became a global phenomenon, and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and its <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on the preservation of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, the interests of large <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation.html" title="Corporation">corporations</a>, and the defense of traditional customs, social norms and ways of life. These conservatives saw communism as dangerous due to its intention to abolish private property and its desire to do away with cultural norms, such as traditional <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_role.html" title="Gender role">gender roles</a>.</p>
<p>The United States never experienced traditional conservatism in the 20th century. As a result, the ideology known as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_conservatism.html" title="American conservatism">American conservatism</a> does not share the monarchist history of its European counterpart. Instead, it is based on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualism.html" title="Individualism">individualism</a> and a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalist.html" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> view of economic competition as beneficial for society, which is, quite unusually, coupled with strong religious sentiment and defense of the traditional family. American conservatism was always opposed to communism, but this opposition only became a cornerstone of American conservative thought in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">50s</a>. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy, and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term "<a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>".</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, conservative governments in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> turned to the United States for political and economic support. Many of these were <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> regimes, which used the fear of communism as a means of legitimizing repression, the suspension of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, and the abolition of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. Examples include <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> under <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syngman_Rhee_4153.html" title="Syngman Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a> <i>(see <a href="../../../j/e/j/Jeju_massacre.html" title="Jeju massacre">Jeju massacre</a>)</i>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Taiwan</a> under <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiang_Kai-shek_4931.html" title="Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> <i>(see <a href="../../../2/2/8/228_Incident_7ec7.html" title="228 Incident">228 Incident</a>)</i>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Vietnam_334f.html" title="South Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> under <a href="../../../n/g/o/Ngo_Dinh_Diem_7b2e.html" title="Ngo Dinh Diem">Ngo Dinh Diem</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> under General <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zaire.html" title="Zaire">Zaire</a> under <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobutu_Sese_Seko_f45d.html" title="Mobutu Sese Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraguay.html" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> under <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfredo_Stroessner_ebdc.html" title="Alfredo Stroessner">Alfredo Stroessner</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> under <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusto_Pinochet_2e33.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, the conservative governments of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> in the United States and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in Britain followed an aggressive anti-Soviet foreign policy that is credited by their supporters as a major factor in the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Cold War, communism is no longer seen as a major force in world politics, and therefore most conservatives are far less concerned with anti-communism. Nevertheless, conservative anti-communism resurfaces anywhere that communist political groups make significant advances, such as in <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> in recent years.</p>

<p>At the end of World War I and the Russian revolution, there were attempted socialist uprisings or threats of socialist uprisings throughout Europe.

Throughout Europe, numerous <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocrats</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> intellectuals as well as capitalists and industrialists lent their support to fascist movements in their countries that arose in emulation of Italian fascism. Meanwhile in Germany, numerous right wing nationalist groups arose, particularly out of the post-war <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freikorps.html" title="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>, which were used to crush both the Spartacist uprising and the Munich Soviet.</p>
<p>However, certain anti-communist authors have disputed the view of fascism as a reaction against socialist revolutionary movements and instead stressed what they believed to be essential similarities between Communism and fascism in both theory and practice. The noted <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_School_824a.html" title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a> <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economist.html" title="Economist">economist</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Hayek_7651.html" title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>, author of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Road_to_Serfdom_ef0e.html" title="The Road to Serfdom">The Road to Serfdom</a></i>, argued that various modern <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> movements, including fascism and Communism, have common philosophical roots both springing from the opposition to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> of the 19th century. Anti-communists arguing from these positions see it as far more than a coincidence that <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benito_Mussolini_f411.html" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> himself was an enthusiastic <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> socialist and a prominent member of the Italian Socialist Party before the World War I, while many philosophical founders of fascism, such as <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergio_Panunzio_bca6.html" title="Sergio Panunzio">Sergio Panunzio</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Gentile_95df.html" title="Giovanni Gentile">Giovanni Gentile</a>, came from a Marxist or <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndicalist.html" title="Syndicalist">syndicalist</a> background. Despite the similarities between communist and fascist ideologies, however, they are divided on the issue of what the foundation for the ideal society should be (communists focus on class solidarity, while fascists focus on national or racial solidarity).</p>
<p>With the worldwide <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s, it seemed that liberalism and the liberal form of capitalism was doomed; communist and fascist movements swelled. These movements were bitterly opposed to each other and fought each other frequently. The most notable example of this conflict was the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, which became in part a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proxy_war.html" title="Proxy war">proxy war</a> between the fascist countries and their international supporters who backed <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> and the worldwide Communist movement (allied uneasily with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyists.html" title="Trotskyists">Trotskyists</a>) which backed the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republican</a> government and were aided chiefly by the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> supported the idea of a coalition with the western powers against <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> as well as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_front.html" title="Popular front">popular fronts</a> in various countries against domestic fascism. This policy was largely unsuccessful due to the distrust shown by the western powers (especially Britain) towards the Soviet Union. The <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Agreement_c71b.html" title="Munich Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> between Germany, France and Britain heightened Soviet fears that the western powers were endeavoring to force them to bear the brunt of a war against Nazism. The Soviets changed their policy and negotiated a non-aggression pact with Germany, known as the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact_d4d5.html" title="Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</a> in 1939. The Soviets later argued that this was necessary to buy them time to prepare for an expected war with Germany. However, some critics question this claim, pointing out that along with a non-aggression clause, the pact also laid out extensive economic cooperation between the Soviets and Germans, in the form of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German-Soviet_Commercial_Agreement_8b7a.html" title="German-Soviet Commercial Agreement">German-Soviet Commercial Agreement</a>, providing Nazi Germany some of the materials it needed to build its war machine. This detail is used by the aforementioned critics to argue that Stalin expected the war to be waged solely between Germany and the Western Allies, with the Soviet Union keeping its neutrality while its two greatest enemies fought each other.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it is clear that Stalin did not expect the Germans to attack until 1942, so he was taken by surprise when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, with <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>. Fascism and Communism reverted to their relationship as lethal enemies - with the war, in the eyes of both sides, becoming one between their respective ideologies.</p>

<dd><i>This section deals with anarchist criticisms of Communist states. Many anarchists (including <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_communism.html" title="Anarchist communism">anarchist communists</a>) describe themselves as communists - spelt with a lower case c - referring to their belief in a society without exploitation or property.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The anarchist critique of state Communism comes from a different angle. Anarchists traditionally agree with Communists that capitalism is a tool for oppression, that it is unjust and that it should be destroyed, one way or another. Anarchists, however, go on to say that <i>all</i> centralized or coercive power (as opposed to just wealth) is ultimately injurious to the individual. Therefore, the concepts of <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.html" title="Dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, state ownership of the means of production, and other similar tendencies within Marxist thought are anathema to an anarchist, regardless of whether the state in question is democratic. There are, also, strong anti-anarchist tendencies among Marxists, who have been denounced variously as unscientific, romantic, or bourgeois.</p>
<p>The debates in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_International_5bd2.html" title="First International">First International</a> between <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and Karl Marx are well-known.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> While Bakunin's own philosophy owed much to Marx's critique of capitalism, their views diverged sharply over questions of how a post-capitalistic society should be organized. Bakunin saw the Marxist State as simply another form of oppression: "The question arises, if the proletariat is ruling, over whom will it rule? This means there will remain another proletariat which will be subordinated to this new domination, this new state." He loathed the idea of a vanguard party ruling the masses from above, quipping that "when the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called 'the People's Stick.'"</p>

<p>Anarchists initially rejoiced over the 1917 revolution as an example of workers taking power for themselves, and indeed played a part in the revolution (see <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_anarchism.html" title="Russian anarchism">Russian anarchism</a>. It quickly became evident, however, that the Communists and the anarchists had very different ideas regarding the kind of society they wanted to build there. Anarchist <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Goldman_57e3.html" title="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, who got deported from the USA to Russia in 1919, was enthusiastic about the revolution, but left sorely disappointed, and began to write her book <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Disillusionment_in_Russia_89ba.html" title="My Disillusionment in Russia">My Disillusionment in Russia</a></i>. Anarchist <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Serge_8b0c.html" title="Victor Serge">Victor Serge</a>, in response to the pro-Leninist sentiment in the global left, said, "All right, I can see the broken eggs. Now where's this omelette of yours?"</p>
<p>Anarchists often cite the crushing of the <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt_Rebellion_a7d3.html" title="Kronstadt Rebellion">Kronstadt Rebellion</a>, in which the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> defeated an embryonic anarchist commune, as a specific example of the tyranny they perceived in the Bolshevik government. The <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhus.html" title="Typhus">typhus</a> epidemic, and subsequent crushing of <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestor_Makhno_b249.html" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor Makhno</a>'s weakened "Black Army" in the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> was also a specifically controversial action of the early Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, a pro-Soviet Communist Party gained considerable influence due to the necessity of aid from the Soviet Union. Communists and liberals on the Republican side fought mainly against the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falange.html" title="Falange">Falange</a> fascists, but also put some effort against the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist.html" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Revolution_f22f.html" title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>, ostensibly to bolster the anti-Fascist front (the anarchist response was, "The revolution and the war are inseparable"). The most dramatic action against the anarchists was in May 1937, when Communist-led police forces attempted to take over a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo_b9fe.html" title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">CNT</a>-run telephone building in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. The telephone workers fought back, setting up barricades and surrounding the Communist "Lenin Barracks." Five days of street fighting in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_May_Days_9ae4.html" title="Barcelona May Days">Barcelona May Days</a> ensued. The enmity between anarchists at communists reached a new high, and remained there.</p>
<p>Bitter feelings between anarchists and Communists are apparent even today in revolutionary circles. Much conflict and arguing occurs as it did in the 19th century between Marx and Bakunin. However, in recent times, anarchists and Communists often join in protest (at least for pragmatic purposes) on certain issues, such as the recent <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The first major manifestation of anti-communism in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> occurred 1919–1920 in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Red_Scare_b159.html" title="First Red Scare">First Red Scare</a> led by Attorney General <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Mitchell_Palmer_ef23.html" title="Alexander Mitchell Palmer">Alexander Mitchell Palmer</a>.</p>
<p>Following World War II and the rise of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, many of the objections to Communism took on an added urgency because of the stated Communist view that their ideology was universal. The fear of many anti-Communists within the United States was that Communism would triumph throughout the entire world and eventually be a direct threat to the government of the United States. This view led to the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domino_theory.html" title="Domino theory">domino theory</a> in which a communist takeover in any nation could not be tolerated because it would lead to a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_reaction.html" title="Chain reaction">chain reaction</a> which would result in a triumph of world communism. There were fears that powerful nations like the Soviet Union and the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> were using their power to forcibly assimilate other countries into communist rule, in a new form of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">Imperialism</a>. The Soviet Union's expansion into <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Europe_1cd5.html" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a> after World War II was seen as evidence of this. These actions prompted many politicians to adopt a kind of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pragmatism.html" title="Pragmatism">pragmatic</a> anti-Communism, opposing the ideology as a way of limiting the expansion of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Empire_c5a6.html" title="Soviet Empire">Soviet Empire</a>. The US policy of halting further communist expansion came to be known as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Containment.html" title="Containment">containment</a>.</p>
<p>The United States government usually argued its anti-communism by citing the human rights record of Communist states, most notably the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maoism.html" title="Maoism">Maoist</a> China, the short-lived <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> government in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> led by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol_Pot_2322.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>, because those states ended up killing of millions of their own people and continued to suppress civil liberties of the surviving population.</p>
<p>Anti-communism became significantly muted after the fall of the Soviet Union and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_bloc.html" title="Eastern bloc">Eastern bloc</a> communist regimes in Eastern and Central Europe between 1989 and 1991, and the fear of a worldwide Communist takeover is no longer a serious concern. Remnants of anti-communism remain, however, in United States foreign policy toward <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">mainland China</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>. In the case of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the United States continues to maintain <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba_99df.html" title="United States embargo against Cuba">economic sanctions</a> against the island in a policy which is sharply criticized outside of the United States, but which has substantial support in the US, particularly from the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban-American_2a01.html" title="Cuban-American">Cuban-American</a> constituency, including many of the Cuban exiles living in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> who oppose any such normalization with the Cuban government. Much of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> wing of American politics also opposes trade normalization with Cuba while the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Cuba_a22f.html" title="Communist Party of Cuba">Communist Party of Cuba</a> retains its influence.</p>
<p>Due to expanding American trade interests with the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, much of the United States foreign policy establishment does not regard "Communist China" as communist in any meaningful sense. Nevertheless, there is some hostility toward the People's Republic of China, particularly among conservative Congressional Republicans which can be regarded as remnants of anti-communism. For example, national security issues were raised during Chinese state-owned CNOOC Ltd.'s takeover bid for <a href="../../../u/n/o/Unocal.html" title="Unocal">Unocal</a>, an American energy firm.

Communists and communist sympathizers often emphasize the persecution of their political movement by "reactionary" forces, which they feel is being downplayed by capitalist governments. Anti-communists respond to this by pointing out that communist governments have often used similar methods to deal with their political enemies, including fellow communists. Regarding this issue, the opinions of communists are divided: some of them support the actions of those communist governments on the grounds that they were necessary in order to deal with dangerous terrorists and criminals, while other communists agree that such actions cannot be justified and put in question the self-proclaimed communist nature of the governments willing to carry them out.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communism.html" title="Edit section: Criticisms of anti-communism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms of anti-communism</span></h2>
<p>Proponents of communism in capitalist countries tend to challenge the accuracy of anti-communist claims. A common rebuttal of anti-communism is that communist countries had created a new, non-proletarian ruling class and thus were not in fact communist. This is a view first put forward by <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_communism.html" title="Left communism">left communists</a> in the twenties and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyists.html" title="Trotskyists">Trotskyists</a> in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Anti-communists respond to these claims by saying that they believe communist states are totalitarian by nature, and that in Marxist theory too much power is given to the state. They point out that several communist governments have existed, but none have been considered democracies. Anti-communists also question if a classless communist society can truly be achieved.</p>
<p>Some anti-communists, particularly those with <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">Libertarian</a> leanings, extend their criticisms well beyond Soviet-style communism, associating it with any state-run activity beyond the most minimal. People who support a <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_economy.html" title="Mixed economy">mixed economy</a> where some services are supplied by government-run institutions, such as what takes place in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social-democrat</a> countries, resent the association with communism.</p>
<p>Some writers and historians object to anti-communists' comparisons of communism to fascism (under the blanket term "<a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>", which they believe to be incorrect). They cite historical evidence, such as the fact that the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> fought against <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> during World War II and say that fascism was the enemy of communism (a view that was shared by Hitler himself, who was one of the most virulent anti-communists of the time), while many anti-communists in occupied Europe took the side of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. Others, however, placed anti-fascism or national independence above their dislike of communism.</p>
<p>Yet another objection to anti-communism, which became more widely advanced in the 1970s, was that in pursuit of anti-communism, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> was conducting a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_policy.html" title="Foreign policy">foreign policy</a> in which it supported people and governments that sometimes egregiously violated <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, which it saw as lesser evils than communism. In order to justify these actions, U.S. Ambassador to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeane_Kirkpatrick_b4fe.html" title="Jeane Kirkpatrick">Jeane Kirkpatrick</a> stated the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkpatrick_doctrine.html" title="Kirkpatrick doctrine">Kirkpatrick doctrine</a>, which argued there was a difference between <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> regimes and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> regimes.</p>
<p>Many staunchly anti-communist regimes have been dictatorial and guilty of egregious human rights abuses, oppression, and sometimes <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>. These may include <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, secular Middle Eastern dictatorships in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, right-wing military juntas in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> such as those in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama.html" title="Panama">Panama</a>, the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> regime in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, the anti-communist regime in <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zaire.html" title="Zaire">Zaire</a> under <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobutu_Sese_Seko_f45d.html" title="Mobutu Sese Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>, and anti-communist regimes in the Far East as <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a>'s <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiang_Kai-Shek_4a54.html" title="Chiang Kai-Shek">Chiang Kai-Shek</a>'s <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a>. Citing governments like these as evidence, communists claim that much Cold War policy was driven by simple anti-communism and a disregard for problems in nations ruled by anti-communist but undemocratic governments.</p>
<p>Various Western countries, the United States first and foremost, are also often accused of racism, oppression and violence, denial of political or labour rights, support for governments which presided over mass killings, torture and detention of political opponents, or engagement with regimes (usually on the basis of their shared anti-communism) which practised genocide or racial segregation. In <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, the use of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategy_of_tension.html" title="Strategy of tension">Strategy of tension</a> in the 1970s has been widely criticized.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, anti-communists generally believe such claims to be of an "<a href="../../../a/n/d/Slogan%7EAnd_you_are_lynching_negroes_5a8b.html" title="Slogan:And you are lynching negroes">and you are lynching negroes</a>" variety. They argue that while capitalist governments may have some faults, Communist ones are worse. Many also state that they disapprove of some actions undertaken by anti-Communist leaders, though the defeat of communism and Soviet influence during the Cold War was a top priority. Some also believe that it is easier for countries previously ruled by an authoritarian, anti-Communist government to transition into a democracy, while it is more difficult for a totalitarian Communist nation to do so.</p>
<p>The communists take the other side in claiming which government is more flawed, stating that while communist governments may have had some faults, capitalist ones are worse. Communists cite democratic and popular support for a variety of Marxist-oriented governments (or at least anti-anti-Communist governments) that existed during the Cold War era, such as <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allende.html" title="Allende">Allende</a>'s <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>. Communists condemn support for oppressive regimes for the sole purpose of eliminating communist influence, and claim that this sort of action is worse than any differences that communist nations may have had with capitalist countries. In addition, communists assert that a transition from an authoritarian, anti-communist state to a democratic one could only occur with military intervention, civil war, or the death of a leader, as evidenced by the nations in the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis</a> during World War II, or the death of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>Communists also claim that in some former Communist countries, conditions were better before its collapse. An example used in this argument is Russia, which has faced a brutal transition to capitalism and has a 25% poverty rate, whereas <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, under the central, socialist-style planning of <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukashenko.html" title="Lukashenko">Lukashenko</a>, was the only former <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSR_1c16.html" title="SSR">SSR</a> that suffered very little economic damage.</p>
<p>Ironically, many anti-communists were more focused on the perceived challenges of communism than on the internal problems in certain communist states, and few anti-communists were able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union even as late as the mid-1980s.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communism.html" title="Edit section: Objections to communist theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Objections to communist theory</span></h3>
<p>The central part of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s communist theory is <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>, a methodology for studying history using dialectical reasoning which concludes that human society has grown or evolved through several historical stages due to the contradictions inherent in each stage, with each transition to the next stage involving the overthrow of the existing socioeconomic order. This idea was first theorized by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel_6ad4.html" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>, but Marx used it to formulate his beliefs. Using this method, Marxists conclude that capitalism will be followed by socialism, just as <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a> was followed by capitalism. Marxists then conclude that socialism would be followed by communism, which Marx claimed would not be able to be improved upon as it has no contradictions of its own.</p>
<p>Most anti-communists reject the entire concept of historical materialism, or at least do not believe that socialism and communism must follow after capitalism. Some anti-communists question the validity of Marx's claim that the state will just wither away into a true communist society.</p>
<p>Many critics also see a key error in communist economic theory, which predicts that in capitalist societies, the bourgeoisie will accumulate ever-increasing capital and wealth, while the lower classes become more dependent on the ruling class for survival, selling their <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_power.html" title="Labor power">labor power</a> for the most minimal of salaries. Anti-communists, claiming that this argument is equivalent to the statement that "the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer", point to the overall rise in the average standard of living in the industrialized West as proof that contrary to Marx's prediction as, they assert, both the rich and poor have steadily gotten richer. There is still, however, communist attack of this objection. This is rooted in Lenin's 'Imperialism - the Highest Stage of Capitalism', argued to be the conclusive chapter of the founding series of communist works set out by Marx. His predictions correlated with Marx's in that the poorer would get poorer and the richer would get richer as capitalism would live on, however he predicted, in accordance with the early 20th century rise of imperialism, that the class struggle would move to an international basis. Many members of the modern Left assert that trends like this have indeed been seen in recent years, for example as Western economies develop and those of third world countries continue to decline as their citizens are continually exploited.</p>
<p>Another reply to this criticism is that the nations who most endorse capitalism today, such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, had a long history of bountiful natural resources, strategic geography, military victory, and technology long before many capitalist intricacies, giving them these benefits today. Similarly, they claim nations such as <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> had long histories of military defeats, brutal environments, strict dictatorships, and underdeveloped economies throughout their histories, making living conditions harsher even after socialist revolutions. Anti-capitalists, on the other hand, often argue that capitalism is now a global economical system, therefore affecting the whole world. Thus, it is necessary to see economical trends without national boundaries. They state for example that much of the commodities sold in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> are produced or enhanced in one way or another, in a poorer country. And on an international scale, the division between the rich and poor has generally increased.</p>
<p>Communists also argue that the industrialized West profits immensely from the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploitation.html" title="Exploitation">exploitation</a> of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> through <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a>, that the gap between rich and poor capitalist countries (sometimes called the <i>North-South Gap</i>) has widened greatly over the past hundred years, and that poor capitalist countries vastly outnumber the rich ones. The standard anti-communist reply to the latter argument is to point out the examples of former Third World countries that have successfully escaped out of poverty in the recent decades under the capitalist system, most notably the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Tigers_3f78.html" title="Asian Tigers">Asian Tigers</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and even nominally Communist <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">China</a> itself. Anti-communists also cite numerous examples of Third World Communist regimes that failed to achieve development and economic growth and in many cases led their peoples into an even worse misery, for example the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mengistu.html" title="Mengistu">Mengistu</a> regime in <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> or the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korean_897a.html" title="North Korean">North Korean</a> <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> government. Supporters of Mengistu or Kim typically attribute the shortcomings in their societies to "imperialist" Western meddling. Other communists, such as the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyism.html" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyists</a>, while agreeing that imperialism harmed these countries, also say that Ethiopia and North Korea were never communist--they were <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinist.html" title="Stalinist">Stalinist</a>, meaning that they were ruled by a clique of bureaucrats who claimed to be acting in the popular interest but actually betrayed it, being more oppressive to its working class.</p>
<p>Many refer to both communism and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> as totalitarianism, seeing similarity between the actions of communist and fascist governments. It should also be noted that many modern left-attributed communists, particularly <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-communism.html" title="Anarcho-communism">anarcho-communists</a>, use these similarities, and actual sayings from Marx himself, to argue that those self-proclaimed communist regimes were not actually following any sort of communism at all. One such quote by Marx to support this simply says, "<i>Democracy is the road to socialism.</i>"</p>
<p>Anti-communists also object to the actual practices of communist governments in contrast to the stated promises of communism, questioning whether or not they are truly able to be called "communist". For example, the view of "human nature" usually expounded by anti-communist <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivists</a> is that while an egalitarian society could be looked at as ideal, it is virtually impossible to achieve. They state that it is human nature to be motivated by personal incentive, and point out that while several communist leaders have claimed to be working for the common good, many or all of them have been corrupt and totalitarian. Communists retaliate that "human nature" essentially doesn't exist, since human beings are extremely adaptable with inbred logic and have shown themselves to be able to live in a wide variety of social organizations, some similar to communism, throughout history.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communism.html" title="Edit section: Anticommunist historians">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anticommunist historians</span></h3>
<p>One of the most influential anti-communist historians was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Conquest_360c.html" title="Robert Conquest">Robert Conquest</a> who argued in his works that Communism was responsible for tens of millions of deaths during the 20th century.</p>
<p>Communist parties (sometimes combined with left socialist parties as workers' parties) which have come to power have likewise tended to be rigidly intolerant of political opposition. Most communist countries have shown no signs of advancing from Marx's "socialist" stage of economy to an ideal "communist" stage. Rather, communist governments have been accused of creating a new ruling class (called by Russians the <i><a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomenklatura.html" title="Nomenklatura">Nomenklatura</a></i>), with powers and privileges far greater than those previously enjoyed by the upper classes in the pre-revolutionary regimes.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that many communists do not support or justify such repressive actions. In particular, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyists.html" title="Trotskyists">Trotskyists</a> have been virulent critics of the policies carried out by Stalin's Soviet Union and other nations who followed the same model. They refer to these nations as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> rather than communist, and sometimes call them <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deformed_workers_state.html" title="Deformed workers state">deformed workers states</a>. The anti-communists reply that the repression in the early years of the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> regime, while not as extreme as that during Stalin's reign, was still severe by any reasonable standards, citing the examples such as <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Dzerzhinsky_624c.html" title="Felix Dzerzhinsky">Felix Dzerzhinsky</a>'s secret police, which eliminated numerous political opponents by extrajudicial executions, and the brutal crushing of the <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt_rebellion.html" title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tambov_rebellion.html" title="Tambov rebellion">Tambov rebellion</a>. According to them, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a> could hardly claim any moral high ground, having been one of the top-ranking Bolshevik leaders during these events. Trotsky was later to claim (unconvincingly) that the Kronstadt rebels were early harbingers of the bureaucratisation which he associated with Stalinism.</p>
<p>Anti-communists will likewise argue that the contemporary communist/Marxist claim that any communist regime that perpetuated human rights abuses was not a "true" communist state is merely a convenient excuse that can be evoked to avoid taking responsibility (and thus a version of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_true_Scotsman_3eed.html" title="No true Scotsman">No true Scotsman</a> logical fallacy).</p>
