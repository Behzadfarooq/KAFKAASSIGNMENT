<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zordrac</span></h2>
<p>I think he, like many people on here, probably with myself included, is his own worst enemy. He gets too passionate about what he believes and when you lose focus, the first thing to go is often the ability to make compromises and resolve disputes. I personally believe there's nothing anybody can do at this point to undo the arbcom sockpuppet block, particularly since even though he was a outspoken critic of Kelly Martin, Kelly very fairly(I was surprised) reduced the block to what it was before for Internodeuser, the alleged sock of Zordrac.</p>
<p>So, at this point, the best thing seems to be to leave it be. I know that's easier said than done, in the real world today, I laughed my ass off when I saw that the sign of a real estate agency I quit last month had fallen down, and I was tempted to rub it in, but we all gotta take it one day at a time I guess.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I can help out with anything in the future. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4"><i><b>Karm</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00"><i><b>a</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636"><i><b>fist</b></i></font></a> 18:02, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the advice. Believe it or not, I actually <i>had</i> been letting it lie (no pun intended) because even though he was telling malicious lies about me he was at least telling them in the form of "Oh, woe is me, pity me, for I am soooo piteous, being harassed* by my two Wikistalkers* (* Note: please see User:Zordrac/FAQ for my own private redefinitions of these terms)". But when he went back to naming me by name and repeating the same lies about me, I broke the silence I had been trying to maintain for the sake of peace. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:35, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was deleting revisions that supposedly included in their edit summaries the real name of a contributor (I didn't want to take any chances).

<p>To be more specific, there were some claims made against you in a comment on the user talk page, trying to give out your real name. I don't think it would have flown with you. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 01:44, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, I see. That clarifies things; Zordrac spent some time allied with a user who thought he knew my real name and kept trying to post it everywhere he could to harass me. If that's the case, it shouldn't be necessary to restore the version, if you can just confirm to anyone questioning that none of the edits which were removed were by me. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a></p>

<p>To begin with, I'm not the admin you're looking for.&#160;:) I VFD'd the article, but didn't end up redirecting it or formally closing it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I reverted to the redirect and replaced the text in the list of characters. He didn't so much improve the article drastically, so much as polish what was in the long list already, thusly I merged his changes into the list.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On "Engram"</span></h2>
<p>I saw that you recently moved <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engram.html" title="Engram">Engram</a> to <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engram_%28neuropsychology%29.html" title="Engram (neuropsychology)">Engram (neuropsychology)</a> and made a disambiguation page. That's a really good idea; I've looked at the old page many times, trying to figure out what would be the best way to convey the various very different meanings of "engram" without hitting on that solution. I realize you might be quite busy, but would you consider taking the time to write at least a brief stub for <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engram_%28Scientology%29_cd45.html" title="Engram (Scientology)">Engram (Scientology)</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engram_%28Dianetics%29_fae6.html" title="Engram (Dianetics)">Engram (Dianetics)</a>, whichever is more appropriate? I felt bad when I happened to see a note from you on someone's talk page, saying that you sometimes felt dissuaded from making edits that might be perceived as too 'pro-Scientology'; I just want you to know that I have great respect for you, and think we need more editors like you, who can fairly and clearly present the Scientology point of view, without presenting it as the only point of view, or the only rational point of view. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Antaeus: Thank you for your kind message; I am greatly honoured that you think so highly of me, although I cannot possibly think I could deserve such praise - I am far from a model editor, and indeed have much to learn. As for the issue of not wishing to make edits that may be perceived as being pro-Scientology - I am acutely aware that, since I have openly stated my Scientology background on Wikipedia, it is most difficult to attempt to temper what is often a rather strong critical POV on articles relating to Scientology without being accused of Scientology POV pushing, simply because the view presented in the article tends to be more the mainstream one; it is more I do not wish altercations to occur over the subject, and I am somewhat self-conscious about running the risk of appearing that way albeit unintentionally. However, that can't be helped really. As for the Engram article, if you take a look at <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engram_%28Dianetics%29_fae6.html" title="Engram (Dianetics)">Engram (Dianetics)</a> I have fleshed together a preliminary stub; I will add more info. on engram running etc. tomorrow, polish it off a bit, and add critical aspects with a reference or two to critical sources for NPOV purposes. I do hope this helps. Thank you, and best regards, --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 01:42, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow -- it looks like a great job so far! That's impressive, especially for something only started tonight. As for having a lot to learn -- well, we all do, really; we just need to keep ourselves aware of it so that we <i>do</i> continue to learn. You may think you're far from a model editor, but I'm being honest when I say that a new editor could do a lot, <i>lot</i> worse than to take you as a model.

<p>Hi Antaeus,</p>
<p>I know it can be a bit frustrating dealing with <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> etc, but could I ask you to take the time to explain deletions/reversions? If you don't do that, there's not much for the other editors to work with in terms of working out and responding to whatever your objection is. I certainly don't disagree with (most of) your deletions/reversions but it would help if you could make the reasons clear. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 11:25, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I try to do that when I can, but we're dealing with editors who pretend they never heard us the last fifteen times we raised the same objections. Tell them fifteen times why they can't just put the results of "scientific tests" that never appeared anywhere except Scientology books into the article as confirmed fact and they'll just put it in a sixteenth time. Show them documented proof and Terryeo will still "cut unverifiable blah-de-bloo to talk page because I don't want to believe it la la la la I'm not listening lol ~~~~". After a certain point you realize that these are people who aren't talking on the talk page to actually <i>communicate</i>, to actually <i>resolve</i> anything, these are people who just want their own way, and will use whatever serves their purpose at the moment to try and get their way. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:04, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly it makes sense, if it isn't published it isn't presentable in Wikipedia. A good lesson to keep in mind for those who support citing unpublished, confidential documents&#160;:). However, since Science of Survival underwent 15 or 20 reprintings, is listed by ISBN in the Library of Congress, can be purchased new or used today, to quote a study within that book is not unreasonable. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:06, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for mediation re Dianetics</span></h2>
<p>I think we need to expose the editing dispute over <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> to a wider audience. Terryeo clearly has no intention of following basic editing standards, whether it's because he doesn't agree with them or just doesn't understand them. We should, however, give him the chance to get the views of people who haven't been involved in this dispute and whom he might see as less partial sources of advice than us. I propose to submit a <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">Request for Mediation</a> concerning the Dianetics article. If that fails, an Request for Comment on Terryeo's conduct may be necessary, though I'd prefer that to be only a last resort.

<dd>Gladly. I don't know if he'll have any interest in following basic editing standards once he realizes that they won't allow him to put pro-Dianetics and pro-Scientology spin everywhere that he wants to see it, but if there's a chance that he can be made to comprehend that he is not standing up for free speech against censorship, but rather practicing POV-pushing in violation of Wikipedia's principles, I'd like to take that chance. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in Re: to the article <a href="../../../m/e/s/MEST_%28Scientology%29_a201.html" title="MEST (Scientology)">MEST (Scientology)</a> I see you have insisted certain lines be included in the article. Please understand, this attempt to communicate with you is not about what you believe to be true or false. This attempt to communicate is about the information the article presents. You have reverted the information which I removed to the discussion page. Then you didn't discuss. But instead reverted the information into the article again. I invite your discussion. The lines I am talking about are these:"... eventually attain "cause over MEST' - the ability to influence the physical universe by thought alone.[1]"</p>
<ul>
<li>which points to a verification which does not say anything like, "by thought alone." That is the portion which I umm, well, know to be false and which there is no verification of and which I have pasted to the discussion page, saying similar to what I have just stated. I do understand of course that some secondary sources give their interpretation as being "by thought alone" and the article is perfectly free to cite them. But the verification that [1] points to does not use those words.</li>
</ul>
<p>and secondly this line:</p>
<ul>
<li>"In Hubbard's teachings, our Thetans have become contaminated or debased by the influences of MEST, which must be transcended." A secondary source of information (such as clambake or xenu or something) might use those words. Scientology sources will never use those words like that. If that sentence is to be included, doesn't it make sense to use it as a quote and cite a source of information?</li>
</ul>
<p>Scientology literature does say something like: "we, as thetans, have allowed ourselves to become injured and reduced our abilities because of impacts with MEST and these difficulties can be overcome".

<p>at ChrisO's talk page you stated: "may wish to look at a user-conduct RfC against Terryeo instead. His poor behavior is clearly affecting far more than just the Dianetics article". I want to tell you Feldspar. I am very easy. There is only one thing I want. I want the subject material which comprises Dianeticts to be introduced in the Dianetics article. Likewise with every article on Wikipedia. I am not talking about running on for many paragraphs, I am talking about one or two, 4 paragraphs at most which are dedicated to presenting the information which comprises the subject. I am very easy. The rest of the mumbo jumbo can be anything, fairy tale, pseudoscience, anything you all want. I don't care as long as the subject is first presented. On that basis a rational person can then make their own judgements. Without the information of what a subject is, a rational person can not make judgements. I am very easy. There is one other thing I insist on. I will insist that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> be followed. This means that legally contested docments, unpublished to the public, shall not appear on Wikipedia if I can prevent it. It means some things further but I intend to follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If this attitude I hold bothers you, too bad. I expect you to hold the same attitude in your areas of expertise. I won't give you an example because last time I did (about vitimin B3) you hypered off about how Vitimin B3 information from Dianetics is invalid. So, I won't give you another example. However. I am making a statement here. I am very easy. You all do whatever you feel is right, I will do what is right about introducing subjects. You're being silly to view my actions as hostile.

But I do want, somewhere kind of early on, the meanings of the articles. "Dianetics Studies" communicates something, it makes it easier for the reader to know there are things studied, some things to know about that.

Let us remove the "spookiness" and communicate. In the edit you just reverted for that reason, I changed "major" to "minor" based on my own knowledge and the following information which I invite you to read: The U.S. Navy's information to its troops. <a href="http://www.chaplaincare.navy.mil/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chaplaincare.navy.mil/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> click "About various faiths" click "Scientology". At that site the beliefs of Scientology are discussed. There is no mention of "Space Opera" being a "major" belief. And then further, a number of Doctors of Divinity and esteemed scholars, including people who testify before governments as experts about religion state their opinions <a href="http://www.humanrights-germany.org/experts/" class="external text" title="http://www.humanrights-germany.org/experts/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Those men are Catholics and other faiths. None of them state that "space opera" is a "major" part of Scientology beliefs. Therefore I changed "major" to "minor".

Once they have "happened" in his head, they become the facts of his world until something happens that makes them inconvenient to him, at which point they change again.</dd>
<dd>This is how he a) first left a message on my talk page gloating about how he'd written to Daniel Brandt and told him I was "using weasel words in an underhanded way to discredit him"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31878088&amp;oldid=31876306" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31878088&amp;oldid=31876306" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, b) later asserted that I had <i>requested</i> him to write to Daniel Brandt as my intermediary<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Izehar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32102332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Izehar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32102332" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and c) still later asserted that "before we had communicated, he threatened me on the Daniel Brandt talk page, and made wild accusations about me, claiming to have been "watching me"." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Obviously, since "requesting" him to represent me to Brandt would be "communication", what he is claiming all in all is that I threatened him on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">Talk:Daniel Brandt</a>, made wild accusations against him and claimed to have been "watching" him -- and then I turned around and said "Hey, Zordrac? I want someone to speak in my name to Daniel Brandt. Will you do it for me? I want to make sure Brandt gets the impression that I'm up to no good, trying to discredit him through underhanded tactics" and Zordrac, who had purportedly been the victim of my "threats" and "wild accusations" by that point, agreed to do so.</dd>
<dd>The reason I think he may be actually <i>unable</i> to keep a grip on reality, rather than just being willing to lie when it suits him, is that he seems to have no awareness at all of how easy it is for people to see through his falsehoods. Prime example is what he wrote about me at User:Zordrac/Poetlister: "08:16, 23 December 2005 <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a>, wrote to Zordrac supporting Lulu and implying that they both would stalk Zordrac until either he stopped trying to get Poetlister's ban reversed, or else was banned from Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>". A simple check of the diff included by Zordrac shows that it has <i>nothing</i> to do with Lulu, with Poetlister, with Poetlister's ban, with Zordrac's efforts to get Poetlister's ban reversed, or <i>any</i> part of Zordrac's description of it. So -- that's Zordrac for you. He may or may not actually be delusional, but from the outside the difference seems mighty moot. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
