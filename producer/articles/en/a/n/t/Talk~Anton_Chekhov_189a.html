<p>The second paragraph seems to restate a number of things said in the first paragraph. I'm not qualified to make any changes, but anyone who feels like they are should clean that part up. 2.12.06</p>
<p>Didn't he write a short story called the Exclamation Mark? It's not mentioned here, I would add it but I don't know the date of publication. Anyone heard of it?--Mattyw 01:22, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Deleting the Dutch spelling of the name. Why do we care? This is the English Wikipedia. Only the English and Russian spellings need to be here. If you want to include the Dutch spelling, please do it on the Dutch Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Lir, is this a backdoor attempt leading up to a revival of your previous campaign to rename <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 04:44, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't think of a reason why one would want to include the Dutch spelling (aside from the fact that it is noteworthy), Im simply trying to revert back to some links that Wik removed without any reason that I can see. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q.

<p>Should I add a cleanup sign to the article. Looks like this article has good use for cleanup and research. Chekhov is important. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 07:21, Dec 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added an attention headline to this article. I'm not an expert on Chekov, but know enough to know that the current article needs to be redone. The "Influences" section is substandard. The fact that Kevin Spacey has acted in Chekov plays is not releveant. A good biography of the man, his relation to the Moscow Art Theatre and a brief overview of his plays would be far more apropos. I mean, c'mon- it's Chekov! 24.126.118.203 09:11, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)Japhy</p>
<p>I added the part on Carver, I was very suprised to find that he wasn't mentioned at all in the article.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me join the chorus, this article is AWFUL. It should be completely removed. I know (next to nothing) about chekhov, but there must be someone on wikipedia that wrote a thesis on the guy. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtohiro_8ed7.html" title="User:Protohiro">protohiro</a> 05:13, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried to help after seeing the notes above. My edits were done in stages so they can be easily traced. If you feel anything that I edited out is worth restoring, please do it. In addition to a lot of duplicate info, I found a lot of unsubstantiated, unattributed or tendentious text or useless trivia (like the last words "I die"), IMHO not fit for a serious encyclopedia. I also think the following long and hopelessly partial list doesn't belong in the article, so I took the liberty to shorten it down.</p>

<dd>I have restored the tag - clearly the article is far from finished - plus I would urge User Humus sapiens not to make some edits and changes of writing style to streamline the article in the way he or she deems fit, without consulting or considering previous editors' inputs. Yes, <i>when the article is chaotic or incoherent</i>, feel free to change - but <i>not</i> when the original is clear enough. For example, he or she constantly changes dashes to commas, garbling the punctuation, or reword a previous edit with no clear gain in clarity but merely flatten the meaning prosaically. It is exasperating to write a paragraph and then have it reworded for no reason, <i>and</i> with the emphasis changed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, some of his or her edits are obviously POV. Chekhov's stories are never considered "brilliant" (dictionary meaning of brilliant: "extremely clever technically"). It is a poor choice of description for what Chekhov writes. He or she then adds, oddly, that Chekhov merely "considered his writing a <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobby.html" title="Hobby">hobby</a>". This is simply misleading - Chekhov's writing is a rich source of income for his family and he takes it seriously enough for them to call it his "mistress" - he is not a mere dilettantish.</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many other edits are baffling. Why put the Russian term for physician in brackets, for instance? This, after all, is not a cultural-specific term, and is completely superfluous.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short, please refrain from making corrections to other editors' hard work without a clear idea of what you're doing.

<p>I have been rereading some Chekhov these few days. There are some odd maintenance about his plays in this article though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>His plays commonly feature the struggle of a sensitive individual to maintain his integrity against the temptations of worldly success.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unless I am reading a different playwright, I fail to see how this is the case. Neither of his four major plays show this. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 20:12, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays, but he compensates for any lack of outward excitement by his original techniques for developing internal drama. His main themes are work and love, but his characters find lasting satisfaction in neither activity. His younger characters are usually portrayed as victims of illusion, the older ones as victims of disillusionment. The passage of time is a constant preoccupation, as are the trivialities of life and the desultory and unsuccessful search for its meaning.

<p>I'm going to see my first Chekov play this weekend, and I really enjoyed this Wikipedia article. I found it very helpful, well-organized, and NPOV. Maybe it's time to take the "edit this article" sticker off? It's certainly much better than the discussion contributors make it out to have been two years ago.</p>

<p>I am not an expert on Chekhov, but I am an admirer of his work. And: This Chekhov article has passages lifted directly out of "Encyclopedia Britannica." Here's one that's a direct lift:</p>
<p>"Though already celebrated by the Russian literary public at the time of his death, Chekhov did not become internationally famous until the years after World War I, by which time the translations of Constance Garnett (into English) and of others had helped to publicize his work. Yet his elusive, superficially guileless style of writing—in which what is left unsaid often seems so much more important than what is said—has defied effective analysis by literary critics, as well as effective imitation by creative writers."</p>
<p>Wikipedia has just begun to garner legitimacy from the Scientific community--the magazine Nature has published an article this month adjuding Wikipedia as a repository of "accurate" and reliable information--and such lapses as in the Chekhov article are cause for concern. Granted, the magazine has assessed only Wiki scientific content, but surely the Humanities deserve to be up to par?</p>
<p>Is there not a Chekhov expert out there who could revamp and rewrite this article, for God's sake in her/his own words or paraphrases, instead of unacknowledged, plagiarized sentences and passages? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Pchalla (<a href="../../../p/c/h/User_talk%7EPchalla_494c.html" title="User talk:Pchalla">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pchalla_7af1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pchalla">contribs</a>) 01:26, December 19, 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I have removed The Butterfly from the short story section because The Butterfly and The Grasshopper are one in the same story.

<p>It is erroneous to attribute the disastrous audience response to The Seagull's opening performance to "the audience was expecting a comedy". After all the name of the play is 'The Seagull: a Comedy in Four Acts'. Too often Chekov is interpreted as monotone gloom. More accurately, the role of Irina was played by a famous farceuse, and so the audience expected a farce. They were shocked by the realism of the play.</p>

<dd>It's not an opinion piece but a review of Chekhov's early stories by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Steiner_94cc.html" title="George Steiner">George Steiner</a>, a heavyweight literary critic, from the Observer, which has a serious literary section (you may be put off by the title, which is unSteinerlike and was probably written by a headings writer). The lead of the present article is bound to contain superlatives because Chekhov is held in ridiculously high esteem, both as a playwright and as a short-story writer, by writers, actors, and literary critics. I can easily replace this with similar statements, if you want me to do so, referenced to other leading writers, but I do not see how one can provide a lead critical of Chekhov or containing criticisms of Chekhov referenced to leading authorities, unless I pick out a critical comment by, say, Nabokov (who, even then, generally eulogises Chekhov). I chose the Steiner reference ahead of others because I felt it was intrinsically pithy and because it could be verified online. The lead is obliged to point to the subject's significance; see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_010f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)</a>.</dd>

<dd>I do however intend to lengthen the lead at some point, so that it is a summary of the article.

<dd>Hiya. Just read the article, sorry, only skim-read it last time. Anyway, the lead is obliged to point out the subjects significance, yes, but there's a difference between what we have in the lead and pointing out his significance.

<dd>E.g. in Asimov. "Asimov is widely considered a master of the science-fiction genre and, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C.

I'm not saying suggesting scrap the statment of importance - I know very well how important Chekov is! - just it needs to be toned down a bit. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 19:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The trouble with the "generally considered" formula is that it's more cumbersome to reference; you'd need about ten sources to back the claim up and the claim would have to be put in dreary neutral language or the individual references wouldn't back the specific wording. "Generally considered" also implies that "a minority do not consider". It's surprisingly difficult to find authoritative sources for the contrary view, however. What criticisms I have found of Chekhov have been specific criticisms within a framework of general praise. There are novel criticsms of Chekhov as a person in Rayfield, but not of his work. I'm aware of a vague notion that Chekhov's plays are boring and that nothing happens in them, but I can't find any authority actually saying that.</dd>

<dd>I've now put up a rewritten version of the opening paragraph, and, despite the syntactical obstacles of the Russian names and old and new style dating, I don't think it's too stodgy. There still may seem too much praise for Chekhov, but I'm hoping to slip in a couple of downers in the next paragraph or two, including Tolstoy's lovely comment "You know, I cannot abide Shakespeare, but your plays are even worse". <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 04:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've finished a rewrite of the whole lead, which is now of a good size. Although the praise for Chekhov is still heavy, I've largely submerged the superlatives in the notes. As well as referencing modern critics, I've tried to seek out the views of heavyweight writers, including Tolstoy, Gorky, Woolf, Joyce, and Carver, so that we don't have "a crow in peacock's feathers", to use an expression of Chekhov's. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 03:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm working on cleaning up ISBNs tagged as being in error, and came across this from this article:</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;But is it the end, we ask? We have rather the feeling that we have overrun our signals; or it is as if a tune had stopped short without the expected chords to close it. These stories are inconclusive, we say, and proceed to frame a criticism based upon the assumption that stories ought to conclude in a way that we recognise. In so doing we raise the question of our own fitness as readers. Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic—lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed—as it is in most Victorian fiction, we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia, ''The Common Reader: No.I'', The Hogarth Press, 1925, ISBN 07012026371925 {{Please check ISBN|07012026371925 (too long)}}, p 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>Looking at WorldCat, it is unclear to me whether this reference is referring to <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1261226?tab=details" class="external text" title="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1261226?tab=details" rel="nofollow">this</a>. or <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60809575?tab=details" class="external text" title="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60809575?tab=details" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>
<p>Being semi-bold, I am going to pick the latter, and re-cite the above block quote with the OCLC rather than the invalid ISBN. Kind Regards, <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 18:11, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many thanks. It's actually quite an easy quote for readers to check, because the book has often been republished and quoted. Checking on Amazon Search Inside Books, this quote comes up on page 172 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 015602778X</a>.</dd>

<dd>Ah ... If that is the case, maybe we should switch to an ISBN citation since I believe ISBNs are generally better known than OCLCs. I was thinking that there was something special about the 1925 Hogarth edition.</dd>

<dd>By the way, if you are an ISBN expert, maybe you can tell me what happens now that the ISBN system is changing to a 13-figure format? Should we add numbers to all the ISBNs or leave them as they are? <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 18:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really an expert. There's some talk of this at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Articles_with_invalid_ISBNs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Articles_with_invalid_ISBNs" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. My sense is that it is going to take a good long time for the cataloging world to catch up with 13 digit ISBNs, and that just because the 13s exist, the 10s aren't immediately invalid. Also, it is a great job for a computer or a Bot to go through all the WP articles and convert the 10s to 13s. In fact, I believe this has already happened at least once. So, I'd say if you want to list only 1 ISBN, list the 10 unless only the 13 is available. You could also list both the 10 and 13. Just my 2 cents ... I'm relatively new here.

<dd>Oh, I see. I don't think it matters what edition that quote is referenced to. As far as I recall, the Hogarth Press was a hand-printed affair in which Virginia and Leonard Woolf used to wind off the copies by hand in a shed; and so there's probably not much point quoting the first edition, which will be so valuable that no-one can actually get their hands on it to check. Anyway, thanks for your help (and on the Luther article, which I've also had to do with in the past). <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 18:50, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnton_Chekhov_189a.html" title="Edit section: Removal of The Seagull and Stanislavsky/Art Theatre section to The Seagull article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Removal of <i>The Seagull</i> and Stanislavsky/Art Theatre section to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seagull_dc16.html" title="The Seagull">The Seagull</a></i> article</span></h2>
<p>I disagree with that very strongly. This article is not too long, and the information was crucial to an understanding of why Chekhov became the playwright he did. What happened was that the fiasco of the performance made him give up playwriting; but then the Art Theatre, under Nemirovich-Danchenko and Stanislavsky, took up the play and entirely revived Chekhov's interest in the stage and its possibilities. Without these events <i>The Three Sisters</i> and <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> would never have been written.</p>
<p>Donald Rayfield, in his biography of Chekhov, has a whole chapter titled <i>The Flight of the Seagull</i>, the only work to which he devotes a chapter. It wasn't just a crucial play for Chekhov but for the history of theatre, since it launched Stanislavsky and stimulated his innovations.</p>
<p>The most important thing about Chekhov is his works, which is why references to them are interwoven with biographical facts in this article. But the events surrounding <i>The Seagull</i> are particularly biographical. Without them, the article at that point begins to give more weight to where he lived etc. than to what he wrote, in my opinion, something I wanted to avoid. I intend to restore this integral material in a week or two's time unless reasonable objections to it are provided here, which anyway should be the done thing.</p>
<p>I'd add that in time I intend to rewrite <i>The Seagull</i> article — more than enough material exists to ensure a long and detailed article on that seminal play and the dramatic events surrounding its first performances, without need of depleting this article. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 07:24, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, I've just looked at <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seagull_dc16.html" title="The Seagull">The Seagull</a></i> article. It's not enough to transfer the notes without the references. What, for example, does "Allen, p 11" mean on its own? The books need to be fully listed. They took hours and hours to read and research (and the Benedetti cost money to buy), so lets not waste them. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 07:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
