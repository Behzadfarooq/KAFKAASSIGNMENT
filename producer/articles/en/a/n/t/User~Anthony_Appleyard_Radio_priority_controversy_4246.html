<p>There has been controversy about <b>who invented radio</b>.</p>
<p>There was a long dispute, including a court action, between <a href="../../../g/u/g/Guglielmo_Marconi_0dad.html" title="Guglielmo Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Tesla_c53c.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> as to who "invented radio" and therefore had the rights to the founding patents of radio transmission of messages. Their work and discoveries are described at length in Tesla's role in the history of radio and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marconi%27s_role_in_the_history_of_radio.html" title="Marconi's role in the history of radio">Marconi's role in the history of radio</a>.</p>
<p>The other main claimant is <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Stepanovich_Popov_8cf2.html" title="Alexander Stepanovich Popov">Alexander Stepanovich Popov</a>: see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_radio.html#Alexander_Popov" title="History of radio">History of radio#Alexander Popov</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla's work started in or before March <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>. In March 1981 he patented a "<i>Method of Operating Arc-Lamps</i>", which from available description seems to have reliably emitted radio waves, but seems not to have been intended to do that.</p>
<p>Around July 1891 Tesla established his laboratory in New York. See Tesla's role in the history of radio#Tesla's work in New York for more information.</p>

<p>Marconi started <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marconi%27s_role_in_the_history_of_radio.html#Marconi.27s_early_work" title="Marconi's role in the history of radio">his work</a> in or before January 1896. (Some say that in 1894 he read about Hertz's work.) Marconi developed and commercialized his work into a practical communications system, which Tesla did not. He got his patent <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=586193" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=586193" rel="nofollow">U.S. Patent 586193</a><span class="PDFlink"><a href="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=586193" class="external text" title="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=586193" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a></span> in 13 July <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>.

<p>By 1895, Marconi introduced to the public a device in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, asserting it was his invention. Despite Marconi's statements to the contrary, though, the apparatus resembles Tesla's descriptions in the widely translated articles. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Marconi's later practical four tuned system was pre-dated by N. Tesla, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_radio.html#Oliver_Lodge" title="History of radio">Oliver Lodge</a>, and J. S. Stone. Tesla was the first, though, to expound the principles of the four tuned system. The earlier two tuned systems were not practical for commercial activity (as found in the United States court case). In addition, other prior work was conducted by others (such as by Hertz and Bruan, but not excluding others) from which many of Marconi's devices and methods were derived. Marconi's <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=676332" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=676332" rel="nofollow">U.S. Patent 676332</a><span class="PDFlink"><a href="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=676332" class="external text" title="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=676332" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a></span> <i>Apparatus for wireless telegraphy</i> [1901], in which a more developed system was disclosed than in his earlier patents, was well after contributions made by other investigators.</p>
<p>Marconi’s late-1895 transmission of signals was for around a mile. This was small when put against Tesla's early-1895 transmissions of up to 50 miles.</p>

<p>In 1901, Marconi in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> claimed to have received daytime transatlantic radio short wave (HF) frequency signals at a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_frequency.html" title="Medium frequency">wavelength of 366 metres</a> (820 kHz) transmitted at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poldhu.html" title="Poldhu">Poldhu</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, but some say that he merely detected natural static that resembled the signal.

<p>Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, the US Patent Office reversed its decision on the priority of radio and awarded Marconi the patent for radio. Tesla fought to re-acquire his radio patent, but failed.</p>

<p>In 1943 a lawsuit regarding Marconi's numerous other radio patents was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, who overturned most of these. At the time, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> was involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with Marconi's company regarding radio, leading various observers to posit that the government nullified Marconi's other patents in order to moot any claims for compensation (as, it is <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speculative_reason.html" title="Speculative reason">speculated</a>, the government's initial reversal to grant Marconi the patent right in order to nullify any claims Tesla had for compensation).</p>
<p>The court decision was based on the proven prior work conducted by others, such as by Tesla, <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Lodge_f0eb.html" title="Oliver Lodge">Oliver Lodge</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stone_Stone_618b.html" title="John Stone Stone">John Stone Stone</a>, from which some of Marconi patents (such as <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=763772" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=763772" rel="nofollow">U.S. Patent 763772</a><span class="PDFlink"><a href="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=763772" class="external text" title="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=763772" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a></span>) stemmed. The U. S. Supreme Court stated that,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The Tesla patent No. 645,576, applied for September 2, 1897 and allowed March 20, 1900, disclosed a four-circuit system, having two circuits each at transmitter and receiver, and recommended that all four circuits be tuned to the same frequency.</i> [... He] <i>recognized that his apparatus could, without change, be used for wireless communication, which is dependent upon the transmission of electrical energy.</i>" <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In making their decision, the court noted,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Marconi's reputation as the man who first achieved successful radio transmission rests on his original patent, which became reissue No. 11,913, and which is not here [320 U.S. 1, 38] in question. That reputation, however well-deserved, does not entitle him to a patent for every later improvement which he claims in the radio field. Patent cases, like others, must be decided not by weighing the reputations of the litigations, but by careful study of the merits of their respective contentions and proofs</i>." <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The court also stated that,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>It is well established that as between two inventors priority of invention will be awarded to the one who by satisfying proof can show that he first conceived of the invention</i>." <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
