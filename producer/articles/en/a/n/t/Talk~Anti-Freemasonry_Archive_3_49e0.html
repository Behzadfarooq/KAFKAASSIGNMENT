<h2><span class="mw-headline">A seperation of church from the social sphere is not Religious Tolerance</span></h2>
<p>The change from "Religious Tolerance" to "a seperation of church from the social sphere" is extremely POV. Although masonry is accused of seperating church from the social sphere, it most definitely does deny this accusation. Furthermore, "a seperation of church from the social sphere" is almost the same thing as anti-clericalism. "Religious Tolerance" means that masonry recognizes and respects the beliefs or practices of all religions, which is very much different than "a seperation of church from the social sphere." Since a church is a specifically Christian body, this would imply that masonry does not deny that it is attempting to remove Christianity from the "social sphere" or society. This is most definitely denied by masons! Furthermore, in <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a>'s edit summary for this change siad to "see talk page," there is nothing on this page about the change from "Religious Tolerance" to "a seperation of church from the social sphere." I am reverting this statement until further discussion on the talk page has appeared. <a href="../../../c/h/t/User%7EChtirrell_7421.html" title="User:Chtirrell">Chtirrell</a> 01:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine about the reversion, although religious tolerance is also very POV. We need to discuss what should be there. I've added a tag to represent this.

<dd>Can we please have some sort of suggestion rather than "Religious Tolerance". There was certainly a side of "Religious Tolerance" that did involve a radical seperation of church from the social sphere (that is not just the "state" but things such as education, marriage, funerals, etc.). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 21:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have readded <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_tolerance.html" title="Religious tolerance">religious tolerance</a> because Freemasonry has been accused of this. There is a cited reference to Hitler accusing Fremasonry and Judism of religous tolerance and not to the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Seperation_of_church_and_state.html" title="Seperation of church and state">seperation of church and state</a>, although Freemasonry has been accused of this as well. This is not a question of if Freemasonry is religiously tolerant, which can lead us into POV waters, it is a question of if it has been accused of this historically, which it clearly has.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Squaring the Circle</span></h2>
<p>These are my opinions on where the content fork issue has got to.</p>
<p>There is still a strong opinion from the non-Masonic editors that this article is a POV fork. I still concur with this. Althought the article has improved and the respect shown to non-Masonic editors has increased markedly, the fundamental flaw in the article is still present.</p>
<p>What is the fundamental flaw? Well it's quite simply that the article is really about external reactions to Freemasonry rather than any coherant anti-Freemasonry movement. This further leads to placing together a number of entirely unrelated views.</p>
<p>For example as someone who would be seen as adhering to "anti-Freemasonry" - that is I am a Catholic who agrees with the Catholic hierachy in seeing Freemasonry as incompatible with Catholicism. At the same time I'm lumped together with Nazis, Stalinists, Protestant fundamentalists, Hamas and anti-corruption activists! I would say that I have little in common with most of these groups other than that I disapprove of some aspect of Freemasonry.</p>
<p>This taring with the same brush is always in danger of breaching NPOV guidelines.</p>
<p>So is this article without merit? Well I don't think so. I do believe that there is a distinct "Anti-Masonry" movement, but that it does not include the pot-pouri of movements laid out above.</p>
<p>This movement is one that sees the oath bound secrecy of free-masonry as being a corrupting influence on civil society. That is democracy is harmed by deals done behind closed doors, fiscal corruption is invited by secret lodge meetings, allegations that guilty men are set free, etc, etc. This is a secular "Anti-Masonry" argument and it is present almost throughout the history of speculative Masonry. It is for example a reason why it was banned in Holland (about four years before the Papacy), it continued through the Anti-Masonic Party, it surfaced in the Poulson scandal and it is around today in critiques such as Steven Knight's "The Brotherhood" and New-Labour's calls for judges and policemen to list Masonic affiliations.</p>
<p>Unlike the present "Anti-Freemasonry" article it is a coherant critique that has a continuity down the centuries. It may or may not have any credibility (I'm sure that editors here will have their views on that) but it avoids the wooly thinking that is the basis of the present article.</p>
<p>On the name <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Anti-Freemasonry%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Anti-Freemasonry%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Anti-Freemasonry</a> attracts 667 pages on google and [Anti-Masonry <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Anti-Masonry%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Anti-Masonry%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Anti-Masonry%22&amp;btnG=Search</a>] attracts 37,200. Perhaps time for a change?</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<dd>Some history is in order here, I think. The reason this article exists was because people felt the topic wasn't being trated fairly in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>. Every time it was summarized as an attempt to slim down the article, it caused a huge problem. It actually was supposed to be sent to Anti-Masonry, but Lightbringer decided to redirect it here so he could write whatever he wanted (his actual words). So, we've basically had to work with it as it is, because otherwise it would get reverted. No one (that being Lightbringer or clones)was ever interested in pointing out anything like the Anti-Masonic party, because the now obvious agenda was Freemasonry = Satanism.</dd>
<dd>If we're going to have the list of claims endlessly re-added in, we need to refute them if we're going to be an NPOV factual source. Now, if we're going to do something else entirely, that's fine, as long as we get a consensus on it. The article is the way it is because there was no other way to anything with it under the circumstances. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:08, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I see it, Anti-Masonry actually takes three forms ... 1) Secular/Societal Anti-Masonry, which would include all the criticims outlined by JASpencer: The fear that "democracy is harmed by deals done behind closed doors, fiscal corruption is invited by secret lodge meetings, allegations that guilty men are set free, etc, etc" (to use his words). 2) Secular/State Anti-Masorny, which would include the fear that Masons could use their meetings to plot against the govenrment (especially true in totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany or Communits Russia). and 3) Religious Anti-Masorny, in which Masonry is seen as being incompatable with a given religion (The exact nature of the incompatablility will vary from religion to religion, but the objection is the same.) These three forms are very different in WHY they they are Anti-Masonic, but they all do have the common link of <i>being</i> Anti-Masonic. Again, I see it as being similar to many of the other Anti-whatever articles here on Wikipedia. I still think that there is a valid Article in all of this. Anti-masonry is a legitimate phemomenon that deserves its own Article. The key is to keep the Article from becoming NPOV either for or against Masonry. Thus, I think we need to keep plugging away at this article and not simply merge it into <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> in order to make that article less POV. If <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> needs improvement, then we need to improve it on its own merits and faults, independant of any other article. The same holds true here. If we stop thinking in terms of: "That is where we say good things about Masonry, and this is where we say bad things about Masonry" (even though that may have been how this article got started) and if we start treating the two Articles as seperate entities, valid in their own right, then we should be able to create TWO excellent and NPOV articles about related subjects. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does anyone know what the Wikipedia policy is on "anti-whatever" articles? People are being commendably honest that this is what the article is.</dd>
<dd>In the current structure I just can't see how you can get away <b>without</b> labelling all critics of Freemasonry as Nazis, which frankly was the state of the article when this current bout of hyper-editing started, and which I think it will degenerate to again. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 20:53, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly agree with <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> that the Catholic responce to Freemasonry should in no way be grouped together with the National Socialist responce to Freemasonry, so on and so forth. However, I disagree that the secular disagreement with masonry is the only distinct "Anti-Masonry" movement. Several different social movements can be grouped under one major movement even though they have radically different bases with different arguments, but contain a defining common thread. For example, the wikipedia article on socialism contains over 20 branches of socialism which are vastly divergent and incombatable with each other. Another example would be the anti-catholicism article where, this movement is divided into secular and religious groups and then further sub-divided. My opinion is that we attempt to mimic this catagorization and to show conclusively that the only common thread between these groups are a "prejudice against, hostility towards or criticism of the beliefs of Freemasons." I believe before we continue we should make a considerable effort to define the divisions within anti-masonry and structure the article along these divisions, thereby completely seperating one group's arguements and beliefs (aka expression of anti-masonry) from another. <a href="../../../c/h/t/User%7EChtirrell_7421.html" title="User:Chtirrell">Chtirrell</a> 23:16, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This list is in no way complete, but I figured it is a start with what we have in the article already. I just wanted to put this out so everyone can start putting in their ideas or changing this structure. I also believe that prior to this structure, prehaps in the introduction there is a short discussion on Anti-masonry as a social movement that encompasses what we've put forward here. That is A)Anti-masonry is not a coherent and homogeneous movement B)The only defining factor is based in the definition at the top, that the group has a "prejudice against, hostility towards or criticism of the beliefs of Freemasons" and that C)Anti-masonry is quite dynamic and has dramatically changed over the course of it's history.

<dd>The term 'Anti-Freemasonry' is non-existant, the correct term is Anti-Masonry.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Masons refer to their critics as Anti-Masons and to the criticism of themselves as Anti-Masonry, never Anti-Freemasons or Anti-Freemasonry. In point of fact Masons never or very seldom refer to themselves as Freemasons, but as Masons. Generally Masons dislike the term Freemasons, it is a term generally used by non-masons to refer to the 'fraternity'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact the only place I have ever seen the term 'Anti-Freemasonry' or 'Anti-Freemason' is here. I believe this term is used here because the Masonic Editors wanted to 'kill' the old 'Criticisms of Freemasonry or Masonry' page but the Masonry term was already used so they picked this one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think many Masons would object to the name of the page or the title of the section, if it is merged with Freemasonry, being changed to the correct term 'Anti-Masonry'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Generally the critics of Masonry do not refer to themselves as Anti-Masons or their critism as Anti-Masonry as I believe the current Masonic use of these terms is to paint criticism of Masonry with Anti-Semitism and Anti-Semites.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My preference would be for the topic simply to be 'Criticism of Freemasonry(Masonry)', as it is a neutral descriptive term that is not pejoritive to criticism of Masonry or it's critics.<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumanun_Genus_f0e4.html" title="User:Humanun Genus">Humanun Genus</a> 11:12, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it's here because of an edit war you or one of your compatriots was part of, and this article started because somebody didn't like "Anti-Masonry" not being a page of rants and cut and pastes from FreemasonryWatch. So, they made this and put said material here. Also, if you were at all grounded in history, the word "Anti-Masonic" goes back to the 1820s. It wasn't called the "Critics of Freemasonry Party", you know, and it wasn't the Masons that coined the term. Furthermore, until your non-sock nature is proven, nobody at all is going to care what you say, so you'd probably do yourself a favor by keeping quiet and letting everyone else get on with the article. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 14:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes a complete rewrite is necessary - by a non-masonic editor. The problems on this article and the Freemasonry article are completely due to the incredible bias of Masonic Editors. Masonic Editors have shown themselves completely and utterly incapable of editing this topic to anything even remotely resembling NPOV. This conclusion is apparent to everyone.<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumanun_Genus_f0e4.html" title="User:Humanun Genus">Humanun Genus</a> 11:16, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly no one owns the page either Masonic or otherwise. It has been a criticism - and a fair one - that a few Masonic editors treat this page and a couple of others as "theirs". I don't think that trying to simply formalise and reverse this bias is a good idea - even if it were it would go against a whole range of Wikipedia policies. I'm afraid that this is going to be a case of patient editing, debate and concensus building. Certain Masonic editors do seem to be recognising POV problems with some of these articles, although it is a slow process. For example we are getting far fewer claims that there are no "legitimate criticisms" of Masonry or that all critics of Freemasonry simply unread or evangelical Christians.<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 13:04, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Cautious Support</b> as long as we <i>do</i> move the historical information back eventually (or perhaps rewrite it). Anti-Masonry does have a historical aspect that needs to be addressed. It has existed almost as long as Freemasonry. For example: the historical opposition of the Catholic Church, the American Anti-Masonic Party, the persecution under the Nazis and in Communist Russia all need to be mentioned. But if removing the section now will help us build a better article in the future, I will not block doing so. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:18, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK... lets get totaly authorative and go with what how the word is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED)... "Antimasonry: Avowed opposition to Freemasorny" (1979 ed., p. 369). I would say that covers all the disperate groups and motivations in the article fairly well. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:06, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Are Criticisms "Avowed Opposition"?</span></h2>
<p>Does "Social Anti-Masonry" really fit into an article about "avowed opposition towards Freemasonry"?</p>
<p>As I see it allegations of cronyism and moral faults of known masons probably need to be better tied into the Political anti-masonry, if possible?</p>

<dd>It can fit, depending on who is criticizing Masonry for cronyism, etc. I would certainly put Steven Knight's opposition to Masonry into this category... It becomes political when people try to actually do something about their social opposition. I would certainly agree that <i>most</i> "avowed opposition" is either religious or political in nature, but not all. That said, I never liked the title "Social Anti-masonry" (it sounds like a bunch of people at a tea party, complaining about what is going on down at the lodge). I can't come up with a better term, but we should think about it and try. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:30, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe the different forms of political anti-masonry should be listed by country not by political party or at least by both. I wouldn't mind it being listed as "Baathist Iraq Anti-masonry," this would lead to less confussion about where it occured, for those who are not knowledgable of Middle Eastern politics. I also believe that every totalitarian regime should be briefly listed under political anti-masonry with the bulk of the discussion occuring in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry_under_Totalitarian_Regimes_7724.html" title="Freemasonry under Totalitarian Regimes">Freemasonry under Totalitarian Regimes</a> and a link appearing connecting the two.

<dd>I agree - as the section is currently written. I think the original intent was have a section to discuss the fact that some critics find fault with the actions/behavior of individual Masons, and then tar the entire Fraternity with the same brush (although we would have to find a more NPOV manner of saying that). I could could probably find some examples if needed, but to be honest - I just don't have the time or interest right now to do so. Cut the section if you want to.

<dd>You are misusing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. It's not the source as a whole that needs to be credible, it needs to be a source that can verify what you have in the article. For example according to how you interperate WP:RS the bible cannot be used as a source since it doesn't stand up to any academic review. The only thing that needs to be adressed is does source X verify the wording in statement Y. If we are presenting people's opinions or claims all that needs to be verified is that the people make those claims, the fact that they are nut-cases doesn't mean they didn't actually make the claims. My skitzophrenic aunt talks to the umbrella outside, if I say in an article that she claims the umbrella is talking to her that is 100% ok to add in, even though it is obvious the umbrella is not actually talking to her since it has no mouth. From WP:RS "An opinion is a view that someone holds, the content of which may or may not be verifiable. However, that a certain person or group holds a certain opinion is a fact, and it may be included in Wikipedia if it can be verified; that is, if you can cite a good source showing that the person or group holds the opinion." The majority of WP:RS deals with facts, you are protesting opinion. That a group said something is a verifiable fact, the contents of what they claim is not. The contents of their claim cannot be held up to WP:RS because it is presented as opinion. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 18:24, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Under the Patriotism Section</dd>
<dd>[7] - In the context of this article the Catholic Encyclopedia is a biased source. That is not in itself a reason to bar citations from it. But in this case, it is also being used as a secondary source, quoting something that someone else said. I have no way of knowing if they are quoting correctly. Also, you can use it to talk about what Catholics think and do, but not what Freemasons think and do. If you want to include it you would have to say: "According to the Catholic Encyclopedia" or something.</dd>
<dd>[8] - not acutally a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> issue... but the citation needs to say what the source is.</dd>
<dd>[10] - kinda the same as #7.</dd>
<dd>[11] - also kinda the same as #7.</dd>
<dd>Under the Cronyism section:</dd>
<dd>[17] - GYPSY??? come on! That is not a source.</dd>
<dd>[19] - Duncan is definitely a biased source with an agenda. The citation also misconstrues what Duncan is saying and draws an unfounded conclusion from it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As I said before... I am sure that we can improve these citations. Make it clearer who is saying what, etc. I do realize that in an article about Anti-Masonry, we will have anti-masonic citations.

<p>I agree that the catholic encyclopedia shouldn't be used for the patriotism section. Number 17 and 19 are valid, the Duncan's quote does infact come from duncans and is being used in the correct way.

<dl>
<dd>I would disagree about using Duncan. He is not a reliable source for quoting ritual. Besides... he says nothing about Freemasons helping "other Freemasons when it would be immoral to do so" as the Article states. OK... I know what you are going to say... that statement is attributed to the Catholic Encyclopedia and not Duncan. Sure. But then you go and cite Duncan to "prove" the previous statement, and it does nothing of the kind. The "be he right or wrong" line does not imply helping someone if it would be immoral to do so. It means you do not turn away from his need for help. For example, if a Companion were to call you and say he had just had a car accident, paniced, and ran from the scene of the accident... the aid you give him could be to counsel him to go to the police and turn himself in. Freemasons are not unique in this... Roman Catholic priests do this all the time. The only difference is that we do not have the benefit of confession if it comes to court. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 01:03, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The quote is saying that if you see another freemason in a difficult situation you are to support him (espouse) to the point that he is freed from the difficulty (extricate) if it is right or wrong to do so. If it didn't have the extricate part that would be fine, however the extricate word makes it pretty clear that it's not just limited to acting as a mentor. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 01:27, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hold on a second ... (deap breath) we are talking interpetation here. You have your interpretation and I have mine. Both of which are admitedly POV. Given that I am an insider and have a little bit more insite as to what "correct" interpretation is, I don't think you should be trying to tell me what Masonic ritual means. That said... no matter <i>who's</i> interpretation is correct, it <i>is</i> nothing more than interpretation... thus, it should not be included in the Article, unless cited by a reliable source. If you want to say that the Catholic Encyclopedia interprets Duncan as saying that Masons are obligated to help a fellow Mason, even if that help is immoral... fine (assuming that is indeed what the CE actually says). But my original objection stands. That section has POV and RS problems. It needs to be re-worked. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 02:49, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Patriotism section</span></h2>
<p>I think this needs to go, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The claim is that Masonry prevents full committal to country, based on this statement: "Another characteristic of Masonic law is that "treason" and "rebellion" against civil authority are declared only political crimes, which affect the good standing of a Brother no more than heresy, and furnish no ground for a Masonic trial." Masonry (Freemasonry) from the Catholic Encyclopedia, quoting Mackey, "Jurisprudence", 509. It says, therefore, that actions of a political nature are no grounds to convene a Masonic trial for purposes of expulsion from Masonry. It says nothing about patriotism at all. In fact, the Masonic claim is that many of the early American patriots were Freemasons. If Freemasonry prevented full committal to one's country, there would be no such thing as military lodges, which have existed since before America was even a country.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The point is in comparison to the earlier operative constitutions which were far clearer on the subject.<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 20:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, but we're talking pre-1700s vs post-1700s in England, then, not modern-day universally, but "modern-day universally" is the impression I get from reading the paragraph. It needs to be fleshed out a lot more (otherwise the evidence doesn't fit), and it also needs to be stated that the links between Operative and Speculative aren't set in stone (pun intended), nor are the connections at all clear from the paragraph. In short, the claim is based on some really circumstancial evidence, and I don't believe any real proof of this situation has ever come to light, whereas there are plenty of counterexamples. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 23:39, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Note 9 also does not support the statement it is used to cite, as the note claims that a Mason is a peaceable subject, which doesn't seem ambiguous at all. If you want use Note 10, fine, but as was mentioned, cite that it is the Catholic Encyclopedia. I don't think what it says is applicable to <i>all</i> critics. I have to agree that the Catholic Encyclopedia really should be limited to use only in instances relating to Catholicism in particular. It's too easy to see or claim an agenda when religion-based statements are applied to a non-religious context. You have to ask yourself what the Church saw in society at the time of writing, especially since the country as a whole was trying to stay out of a war at the time. There were, however, many military leaders who were Masons both prior to and after WWI. So the claim really doesn't hold water, and I don't believe it was ever really a legitimate statement outside of this one source. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 02:54, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm just not comfortable with using only a Catholic commentary on issues that are much larger than Catholicism. I think other religions wouldn't criticize Freemasonry for a lack of patriotism, as its outside the purvirew of religion. The nature of the critique has a lot to do with how the Catholic Church sees itself in society - i.e., the criticims of church and state has a lot to do with the Church's own aspirations, and these are not views shared by other religious groups. In short, I think you're taking a particularly Catholic view and saying it's a universal view, which I feel is too POV given that patriotism crosses over religious boundaries. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 23:39, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah yes... Google searchs.. I checked out these searches. Several of the "treason+masonry" searchs deal with treasonable acts that involve masonry... as in stones and bricks that make up WALLS! Try doing the same searchs with Freemasonry and you get very different results... "Satan+Freemasonry" gets you 240,000 hits. Yes, you do get lots of hits on "Freemasonry+treason"... but, many of these are duplicate hits (ie more than one hit on the same site), AND after doing a quick flyby on some of them, they are actually anti-masonic sites that talk about how Freemasons have horable punishments for <i>treason</i> against the fraternity (ah yes... those "blood penalties"... gotta love em!). In otherwords they are not talking about treason against the state at all.</dd>
<dd>Now... all that said... I do agree that the accusation has been made, and so can be included in the article if you feel it is needed. But the statement must be made with care for proper citations and can be refuted with ease.

<dd>I don't think it is a very common accusation at all. It tends to be a one or two liner used on the religious anti sites as "further" evidence of Masonic damnation. I would actually say that the alligations of cronyism and favor are significantly more common. Perhaps my perception is skewed by being from the US, where freemasonry is often viewed as another "service" group such as Kiwannis, Lions, Rotary, etc. etc. which are seen as being ultra patriotic (and usually conservative in politics). Perhaps it is different in the UK. Personally, both as an editor and as a Mason, I wouldn't mind doing away with the section. The Masonic reasoning is admittedly POV... the editorial reasoning is that the evidence contradicts itself. Thus, it should probably be omitted. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:15, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just as it is important to have a "criticisms" section in the Freemasonry article, it is important to include a "criticisms" section here. The difference being that the critisms here would be directed against the Anti-masonic side. I am not talking about having a counter-argument for every statement... I am talking about adding a section that outlined the Masonic view of the more common Anti-masonic arguments and criticizing typical Anti-masonic practices (For example... misquoting Masonic authors or taking Masonic statements out of context).

<p>The Patriotism Section should stay, it is an important, and extremely effective, criticism of Masonry. MSJapan, a Freemason well familiar with Freemasonry's weaknesses, recognizes this and thus seeks to remove it. A very well cut incision on the body of Freemasonry JASpencer.

<dd>"I don't think it is a very common accusation at all." In America, perhaps. Most secular conservative criticism seems to center round this aspect, especially on the continent. <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Francaise_cb41.html" title="Action Francaise">Action Francaise</a> would be an example of this. I'm sure a lot of the Totalitarian criticism of Freemasonry centers on their supposed "rootless cosmopolitan" nature. It would be surprising if a group centered around international brotherhood <i>did not</i> get some of this criticism. The fact that the more predestrian (and I mean that in a good way) American and English Grand Lodges are not getting as much criticism is more a sign that their members are more social on average. That Blueboar or MSJapan see it that way is no surprise. It's rather telling that the defence is that they are good propositional Americans rather than blood and soil patriots.</dd>
<dd>As a member of an organisation that has got its fair share of abuse for being international (especially in England), I'm not that sympathetic with the critique and don't think it that important.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Conspiracy section needed</span></h2>
<p>Given what JASpencer has stated about the patiotism section (in essence, that we need to keep the section because the claims do indeed exist) I feel it is time to reinsert a section on the various conspiracy accusations that are made.

It is primarily copied from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemason_conspiracy_theories.html" title="Freemason conspiracy theories">Freemason conspiracy theories</a> article. I removed references to those theories already better discussed in other sections of this article. There is a lot that needs to be done to bring this section into line with the rest of the article... The citations and links need to be brought into line with our current format. I also think some of the theories should be expanded upon to say exactly who makes the claim and in what context, or to explain them better. Will search for more theories as we go. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 16:15, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also spendt some time looking throught the sites referneced (to make sure the references actually support the claims), and I have some trouble stopping laughting... there is one which (on a page linked from a page used as a reference) <a href="http://www.mt.net/~watcher/telescopecropcircle.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mt.net/~watcher/telescopecropcircle.html" rel="nofollow">claims</a> that Masons are behind cropcirlces... and part of the logic is that some fractal cropcircles look like snowflakes, and <a href="http://www.mt.net/~watcher/jamescameronconspiracy.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mt.net/~watcher/jamescameronconspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">under 33 degrees water turn into snow (bottom of page)</a>.

<dd>Use Google to find better links. There are a ton of pages on each subject of conspiracy, just choose the ones that are the best written, most informative, or use the most historical references and data. There are plenty of other theories that can be added, elaborated, expanded on, and described in detail. Spending time going through external web pages will give a good continuity of theories, while giving you enough opportunities to ignore the most poorly written pages.

The admirable work <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> is doing here is really being wasted since there is likely to be very little traffic and thus eyeballs on this side page. If <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a>'s work is to be fully valued it must be included on the main page.

<dd>There are currently two "concencius" - one Masonic uncritical, the other Masonic critical. The Masonic uncritical "concencius" consists of deleting all criticism of Freemasonry, channeling all critiques they are unable to get deleted into a side page "ghetto" with little readership, and painting the critics of Freemasonry as criminals. The critical "concencius" generally seeks to have the main Freemasonry page completely rewritten and have the material presently contained on the Anti-Masonry page, and other critical side pages, merged into the primary Freemasonry article, the article with the greater readership. Generally Masonic Critical Editors prefer to use sources such as the Catholic Encyclopedia while Masonic Uncritical Editors prefer to use sources such as 'Freemasonry for Dummies'.<a href="../../../4/0/_/User%7E40_Days_of_Lent_80ba.html" title="User:40 Days of Lent">40 Days of Lent</a> 10:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was certainly intended as NPOV - perhaps you have a better non-homogenous 'anti-movement' to compare anti-masonry with? I think part of the problem is that a lot of people assume anti-masonry is more unified than it is in reality. Besides, I never meant to say that anti-masonry == anti-semitism, but rather to point out that like the later, the former is not a unified movement. <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWegianWarrior_abbf.html" title="User:WegianWarrior">WegianWarrior</a> 13:02, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of the material has been discussed previously and deleted by Masonic editors(in the case of Signs, Oaths, and Secrets of Masonry). The material I removed to this talk page is either on the wrong page (in the case of the conspiracy theory and conspiracy web site material) or very poorly referenced (in the case of the Saddam Hussein Conspiracy Theory referenced to the Moonie owned Washington Times).

<dd>I've never seen a connection made between Freemasonry and the Holocaust before. The sources sited all seem to go to Masonic websites that themselves contain little or no references. I am familiar with Holocaust literature and never seen any citations for Freemasons being arrested in such numbers, none-the-less murdered. It seems pulled out of thin air IMHO, other than a few Masonic websites, that themselves have a lot of other questionable claims or largely unsupported claims on them.<a href="../../../j/k/w/User%7EJKWithers_2359.html" title="User:JKWithers">JKWithers</a> 13:51, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the reply, JKW. Just so I can better understand where you are coming from, are your concerns based on a belief that Freemasons were <b>not</b> sent to concentration camps and executed by the Nazis during the Holocaust? Is it the numbers claimed that you have a problem with, or is it the claim itself. Or is it that you do not feel the source is reliable (ie that the claims comes from Masonic websites and not some other source)? Please expand on your comments and explain exactly what you do not like about each claim and citation.</dd>
<dd>Keep in mind that at Wikipedia, the criteria for inclusion is the verifiablility of a claim, not the truth or untruth of the claim itself. Perhaps the language in this section needs to be changed to make it clearer who is making the claims presented, but the fact that <i>someone</i> makes them is verifiable and cited. If you have any citations that contradict the claims made here, they can be included to balance the POV, but we should not simply cut the section because you have never heard these claims before. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I said I have never seen or heard the claim before that Freemasons were arrested and murdered by the Nazi's - anywhere. I checked the citations given and found there were really no references of primary sources at all. The articles cited either had no author listed or an author with nor credentials. The claims in the section are to my mind not credible at the moment, they are certainly not supported at present at any rate. The Wikipedia criteria of verifiability has not been met.<a href="../../../j/k/w/User%7EJKWithers_2359.html" title="User:JKWithers">JKWithers</a> 14:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, JKW, here's a book citation with which you should be familiar, then - <i>Nazi Hunter</i> by Simon Wiesenthal. The statement that Freemasons were among the groups persecuted by the Germans is on the first page of the book. Also, I'm not sure about "no citations" Bernheim in particular has a lot of citations, and I don't know what you consider "primary sources" for the Holocaust. That is also a good question as to why this is c/ped in here, but the history shows that Fossick the LB sock did it. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 15:10, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your first wikipedia contribution is on the same day that he was banned. Thus, the accusation that you yourself are yet another Lightbringer sock. I have requested a check user on your IP so that we can be sure whether you are, or are not this vandal. If I have accused you falsely then you have my appologies, If the accusation turns out to be true... then you will be banned again. In any case, I hope you will understand my reluctance to have these same edits stand. This is not meant as a personal attack, but to protect the page from said vandal. 14:35, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citations and Footnotes</span></h2>
<p>An issue has come up on a related page (<a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECatholicism_and_Freemasonry_8764.html" title="Talk:Catholicism and Freemasonry">talk:Catholicism and Freemasonry</a>) regarding the need to add quotations to all the footnotes and citations. I want to take this to a different level, divorced from any specific citation or footnote or even any specific page. We need to create a consensus policy for the various Freemasonry related articles regarding citations and footnotes. JASpencer seems to feel that every citation and footnote should contain a quotation. I disagree. I feel it is enough to cite a link to where the statement that we make in this article can be found (or where clear support for the statement can be found if we are not actually quoting something). I find all the quotations in the footnotes to be clunky, overly burdensome, and potentially misleading (the potential is there for someone to take a snippet from what is said in a source, quote the snippet here (out of context) to support a statement, when in fact the original in the source does not support what is being said here at all). So, I want to toss this debate out to all the editors. Do you think we need all these quotations in the citations?... please explain your view so we can come to some consensus. Please respond on this at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECatholicism_and_Freemasonry_8764.html" title="Talk:Catholicism and Freemasonry">talk:Catholicism and Freemasonry</a> so we can consolidate our replies in one location. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:14, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>No</b>. A footnote is to direct a reader to a source, not to give them the source text. I don't think that any citation needs a quotation.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">quote requests in Conspiracy section</span></h2>
<p>At some point, someone (it may have been a lightbringer sock) added quote requests to everyone of the claims in the Other Conspiracy Theories section. I have removed them all. I feel that asking for quotes from these sites is nothing but rediculous. Each claim is cited and linked to at least one conspiracy website where the conspiracy claim is clearly made. I suspect that whoever requested these quotes did so without bothering to look at the linked websites. If someone has a specific problem with a specific claim and the link to a specific conspiracy site, I will be happy to discuss them one by one. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:47, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can understand why you might think adding all these nut case conpiracy sites is a case of "Poisoning the well"... You obviously take the religious (and particularly the Catholic) objections to Freemasonry quite seriously, and I can see how you might feel that lumping your objections in with those raised by the conspiracy nutters deminishes what you consider to be the legitimacy of your issues. However their inclusion is not meant that way. This Article is about Anti-Masonry in general... not just those parts of it that you consider "legitimate". Remember, the truth of a claim is not the basis for inclusion. There are people out there who actually believe this stuff, and it would be POV not to include the material. We have sub-articles to discuss the specifics of the "legitimate" religious objections. There is also a seperate sub-article to discuss the conspiracy material in more depth (actually, that page needs work... but that is another issue).<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:52, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>

<dd>HAVE YOU EVEN LOOKED AT THE SITE? OK... I need to add a second link to <a href="http://www.freedomdomain.com/neworder.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freedomdomain.com/neworder.htm" rel="nofollow">this sub page at freedomdomain.com</a> for the New World Order stuff which is why I originally linked to the main page. But it is all there. Since you insist...Let's play the quote game:</dd>
<dd>On New World Order: "<i>So, the idea, essentially, is to be able to consolidate power as efficiently as possible. If there is a "plan", like the <b>masons</b> want to put in one of "their men", a candidate for office, and there is opposition, then they could easily mibolize against that candidate through control over media, intelligence agencies, and local and state authorities. If say, <b>the masons</b> want to get rid of the guns, to get their "agenda" passed, they can have members in the most "stealth" departments in the military, bring in someone who is a "sleeper", like McVeigh, who is also "active" in militia, patriot, and sovereignty circles, and help him to carry out a plan, like blowing up a federal building. At the same time, they would be able to coordinate all local and state agencies to "varying degrees" and have them respond accordingly, in order to keep everything "covered-up". In the same manner, they could use another Military connection to stage a shootout at a High School, and carry it out professionally, so as to leave little trace of doubt as to any conspiracy.</i> "</dd>
<dd>On Illuminati: First, near the top it says: "<i>The Compass represents geometry and building. It is a Mason's tool. It measures by "Degrees". When you graduate college, you recieve a 'Degree'.You are also called an "Alumni" for "Illuminated" or "Illuminati". Well, who do you think set up that University. The Freemasons and Illuminati, of course</i>." Then a little later: "<i>The Torch that is carried in the Olympics is Masonic. It is called the "Torch of Enlightenment". The French Grand Orient Temple Masons gave the U.S. the "Statue of Liberty". She is holding the Masonic "Torch of Enlightenment". Also referred to back in the 1700's by the Illuminati Masons as the "Flaming Torch of Reason". The Torch represents the "Sun" in the sky.</i>" (they are quoting Weishaupt here, but note that their quotes do NOT go around the words <i>Illuminati Masons</i>)... then a little further down the page: "<i>Most of the Founding Fathersof America were Freemasons. Some were members of the Illuminati</i>."</dd>

<dd>The key here is that these claims exist and can be verified. I do not think they need to be beafed up or "proven". It is simply a list of wacko conspiracy theories. If I were to provide exact quotes for each claim, it would make this section seem much more important to the article than it is. What is important is to include them... not "prove" or overly support them.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well provide quotes in the footnotes. Yes they shouldn't be in the main text. Conspiracist sites tend to be far too long for just a simple point and look. As I've said on another talk page this flight from the truth is going to be convenient for you at the moment but it won't always remain that way.</dd>
<dd>It would be far easier to put the quotes in. Taking out quotes and quote requests is akin to taking out citation requests. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 17:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Factual Accuracy tag on Other Conspiracies section</span></h2>
<p>First, let me just point out the redundancy of adding a Factual Accuracy tag to a section of an article that already has such a tag for the entire article... but, leaving that aside... please let me know where there is a factual inaccuracy.

<dd>On the contrary... your edits skew the article to an Anti-masonic bias. To maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, both sides need to be represented.

<dd>That would be called a POV fork and it is not allowed at Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. While this page <i>is</i> about Anti-masonry in general, and the claims that Anti-masons make in specific, to not allow the POV of Masonry and Masonry's responce to these claims is a clear violation of WP:NPOV. Both sides of these issues MUST be presented. I also note that your argument here is the opposite of what you say in your edit summaries (where you keep saying that "the article is about Freemasonry"). You can not have it both ways.</dd>
<dd>Again, if you wish to discuss specific issues please do so. If you simply don't like including both sides of an issue, then you should not be posting to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:18, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you are not a sock of lightbringer, then you have nothing to worry about, and a notice to that effect will be posted... if you are, then others need to know about the accusation.</dd>
<dd>I am not sure you understand what a POV fork is... a POV fork is where you take material with one POV and break it off into a seperate article. This is what you were suggesting. That is not allowed on Wikipedia. You MUST present all sides of any issue. That means that both the Anti-masonic claims, and the pro-masonic counter claims MUST be included. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 16:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
