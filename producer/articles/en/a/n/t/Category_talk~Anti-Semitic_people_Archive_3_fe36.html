<p>Some of the editors confuse opposition to Israeli subjugation of the Palestinians to anti-semitism or new-anti-semitism. If you would read his speeches Hasan Nasrallah said he would not get in the way of a peace deal with the Palestinians. Neither would M. Ahmed Nejadi if push came to shove. The Saudi Beirut peace initiative has been on the table gathering dust how many years now? Anyway I visited this blocked site to add General <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Patton_c84b.html" title="George Patton">George Patton</a>. He said some vicious and ignorant things.

<p>A question to those removing it: Why is there "a problem" with a disclaimer being included in this category? Does it not seem very probable that irregardless of the current state of the category now, some editor with an axe to grind with a less than fully well known figure may in the future add such a figure to this category on false pretenses? A disclaimer makes perfect sense. In fact I'd go so far as to say that any category that is portraying any particular individual in a negative light should have such a disclaimer as a policy. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 01:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm adding back in my reply to Netscott, which was blanked. Whoever is doing this, stop screwing with this page! To reiterate:</p>
<dl>
<dd>What you're describing, Netscott, is vandalism. If a person is added to the category in the article inappropriately, the place to address that is in the article. Such a person can be removed instantaneously. This tag is therefore redundant and unnecessary. Also the one proferred on this talk page is worse than the one that is in the article itself (which, I see, is inappropriately placed at the top when it is supposed to be at the bottom). Both types of tags are unnecessary. If placed in this category, it should be placed in <i>all</i> negative categories uniformly. All or none, to be fair and uniform. Otherwise this category will be singled out.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 16:53, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is that WP guidelines state that membership in categories should be 'self evident'. If users need to read a disclaimer on the category page to figure out it's idiosyncratic rules then that isn't the case. Also, the disclaimer provides no guidelines to distinguish between people who criticize a Jewish person or particular aspects of Israel or the Jewish religion (who may include reform-minded Jews). If the category isn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Category#Some_general_guidelines" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Category#Some_general_guidelines" rel="nofollow">self-evident</a>, which is the case with <a href="../../../c/u/l/Category%7ECults_04bf.html" title="Category:Cults">Category:Cults</a>, for example, then subcategories can be added that focus on specific concrete criteria. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 03:48, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term Anti-Semitism is flawed in that respect. I think it would be more accurate if the page 'Anti-Semitic people' be changed to 'Anti-Jewish people' since many. many people that don't like Jews have nothing against Arabs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there is religious anti-Semitism too that is directed at Judaism (or rather against observant Jews). Anyway, the term is flawed, but we can't change how words are used. For instance a homophobe is seldom a person who has a phobia against gays, but rather a person who hates gays. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<p>Literally "anti-Semitic" is anti anyone who is semitic like, Jews, Arabs, Assyrians, Maltese, etc. If one looks at the history of the term "Anti-Semitism", it was coin by a German named Wilhelm Marr, who formed the Anti-Semitic League in the late 1800's as a result of Jewish people converting to Christianity and intermarrying with German Christians of non-Jewish decent. So the term anti-Semitism is only directed at the hatred towards Jews. So for people who like to claim that the "Jewish lobby" are trying to persuade people that anti-Semitism is only for Jews and is deliberately excluding Arabs (people like Malaysian Foreign Minister <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Hamid_Albar_40b1.html" title="Syed Hamid Albar">Syed Hamid Albar</a>), well here's the proof 203.213.98.185 03:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is that from some policy I am unaware of? The dispute arises from what criteria are to be used for inclusion. Are you saying these criteria should be allowed to vary from article to article? I feel the criteria should be uniform. That being the case, we need to discuss the criteria <i>here</i>. What better way for disputants to discuss perceived flaws in those criteria than by raising the example of various allegedly miscategorized persons?</p>
<p>Wikipedia needs a consistent standard of inclusion for this extremely subjective category. Note that at a previous <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_May_17_c086.html#Category:Anti-Semitic_people" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 May 17">CfD discussion</a> I noted that I would only support the continued existence of this category if fair and consistent standards of inclusion were adopted. This is <i>not optional</i>. This is <i>demanded</i> by <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> (and in the case of dead alleged anti-semites, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> at the very least). Since that CfD debate I have seen no real substantive debate here which would lead to the adoption of objective standards for inclusion. The section you have removed is one of the only discussions of this issue which we've had.</p>
<p>I repeat: <i>this</i> is the place to have a discussion on what the overarching standard of inclusion for this category will be. Having that discussion on a few dozen other talk pages will only lead to inconsistency and unfairness in treatment of various subjects. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 17:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I usually find little common ground with Kasreyn, I do agree with his main point, i.e., this is the place to raise systemic concerns regarding the category.

<dd>This category has been subjected to repeated efforts to kill it, as Doright just pointed out. Its very existence is a bone of contention, even as equally judgmental categories remain unmolested. To my mind the tag in question is yet another effort to water down this category, one of a series of such efforts and increasingly tiresome. The standard is quite simple -- do the editors in the underlying article feel that this person is <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitic_cf3f.html" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a>. Note the definition.<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anti-Semite" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anti-Semite" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It's quite clear.

<ol>
<li><i>Discrimination or hatred against Jews</i></li>
<li><i>Discrimination or hatred against semitic peoples, not all of whom are Jewish (Literal interpretation; very rarely used.)</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>And so it is as plain as mud, because while "discrimination" may be fairly easy to nail down because it is an <i>act</i>, hatred is an <i>emotion</i>, and that is where the subjectivity enters into the debate. Where do we draw the line on which statements demonstrate clear anti-semitism, which statements merely demonstrate insensitivity or lack of empathy, and which statements are harmless or intended satirically? I'll tell you how we draw that line: <i>subjectively</i>. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 06:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't feel it's any simpler. Sure, it makes it clearer <i>what</i> is being hated, but the principle factor in recognizing anti-semitism is still the ability to recognize hatred, and hatred is a subjective concept which different people have differing concepts of. So my above comment still holds true, that some borderline remarks may be anti-semitic in the opinion of some, but not anti-semitic in the opinions of others, and this is the weakness which led me to vote for the deletion of the category. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 19:29, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that's not what I'm doing. I'm saying we should have both a disclaimer (to dodge possible legal problems when living persons are labelled as anti-Semites) and clear inclusion criteria. Is it enough that an editor thinks a person is an anti-Semite? Should we require a source? Should we require a reliable source? Should we require several sources? // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a>

<dd>Liftarn makes a very good point. Please refer to <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>; also note that the estates of some deceased figures may also be a source of concern.

<dd>That's been asked and answered many times before, in the numerous efforts to get rid of this category. If the editors in the underlying pages agree the person belongs in the category, then he belongs in the category. One is placed in this category, as you know, by inclusion in the individual article.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 13:41, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So therefore, if the editors of article x on a real anti-semite take a critical and careful view of circumstances, and logically and correctly apply the anti-semitic category, and the editors of article y on a non-anti-semite choose to push their POV that its subject is an anti-semite (gasp, shriek! Trust me, POV pushes do happen here, and sometimes they get away with it for some time), then articles x and y wind up in the same category, which essentially says to the reader, <i>these two persons are equivalent</i>. This is why allowing differing standards on differing articles, when those articles will then be linked by a single unified category, is a terrible idea. It can only work if we can trust all editors on ALL bio articles to be equally well educated and critical on the subject of anti-semitism. I think that's a somewhat unreasonable expectation.</dd>
<dd>I'd say it's much more reasonable to have a core of editors at the category page, with a good notion of what the requirements for the category are, and have those editors monitor the category and ensure it is only applied accurately. If a discussion must be had on the separate article's page, an editor from this category can go there and explain the criteria for inclusion. Then the editors of that page can determine their consensus as to whether the subject meets those criteria. And if they don't like the criteria, <i>they can come to this talk page and try to change the consensus</i>.

<p>Hello all, I've just seen this list and as much as I do hate anti-semitic people I have to say I've never in my life seen such a thing as this list in an encyclopaedia!! It is absolutely ridiculous. Are you basically informing people of the world that you think these people are anti-semitic? who exactly has the right to apply this label to people in AN ENCYCLOPEDIA!?! Is there also a Racist people list here? If not then why not? How about a Sexist people list?? Please do note I'm not saying that these people aren’t or are anti-semitic but an encyclopaedia is no place for this sort of labelling...and if you think it is then you MUST have other similar lists too there are far worst people in this world than Anti-semitics! --<a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYas121_a069.html" title="User:Yas121">Yas</a> 03:12:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC) PS. how do I vote to have this removed? it's articles like this that give Wikipedia a bad name!</p>

<dd>PPS. Could someone kindly also provide the definition of Anti-Semitic this article uses? As I see some of the people in the list only ever criticised the Jews and/or Israel, they are/were certainly not Anti-Semitic by normal definition (sorry but Jews are not above criticism) and don't deserve to put in a list with the Nazis and Hitler! --<a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYas121_a069.html" title="User:Yas121">Yas</a></dd>

<p>Im pretty fed up with this too. I recognise the need to make note of particular people who have been influential in promoting anti-Semitism, but I distinguish this from reference to the occasional person who feels somehow persecuted by the nominal fact of ethnic collusions and biases. (I am a resident of Murkah after all, so there is a limit to how much I can criticise.) As such I am going to categorically remove this category tag from any and all living persons first, with notable exceptions considered, and then move on reworking its application to certain dead people. As its a subjective subject, I may decide to change these to more appropriate subcategory tags, such as Category:Alleged anti-Semitic people, Category:Potentially anti-Semitic people, Category:Anti-Arab people, Category:Anti-Islamic people etc. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 15:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This "Category" is not even called Alleged-Anti-Semitic! It just goes a head and accuses people. On a different note, how on earth does Wikipedia ever hope to maintain this list and stick to it's fundamental principle of "open to everyone to contribut/edit"? You'll just have people labelling everone they don't like...and who's going to decide who stays in the list and who does not?? It'll be chaos that's why Encyclopedias are no place for this sort of nonsense! --<a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYas121_a069.html" title="User:Yas121">Yas</a></dd>

<dd>Just my two cents. MY understanding of "lists" and "categories" is that NOBODY should be deciding anything or creating definitions. Wiki policy seems to say that only people who have been reported as being "xxx" in multiple, reliable sources should be included in said list or category. Some lists are easy, ie "US baseball players who have hit over 500 HRs" other lists like this are harder. Again, only people who have been labeled/called/defined/ect in OTHER, VERIFIABLE, RELIABLE sources should be included. This is not a list that people should add to based on their opinion or original research ect. I am sure this will just add more confusion than good&#160;:) Please correct me at will&#160;:) Cheers!--<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 18:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gibson also apologised and called his language "despicable." Everybody knows that anti-Semites dont apologise for being anti-Semitic. Ive even heard some people claim that Jews who dont support Israel are "anti-Semitic", are we going to list them as well? Biblical Jews who made tribal war against other Jews?

<dd>There are plenty of ways to rationalise both bigotry and its opposing bigotry. When you start populating the Category:Anti-Islamic people and Category:Anti-Arab people categories, we the people can consider this way of categorizing people as reasonable and fair. According to your view, is this article supposed to have this tag on it forever, with no chance for Gibson's <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption.html" title="Redemption">redemption</a>? This category represents an acceptance for a certain POV bias, and is at best only a "blunt instrument," as Slim put it. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 20:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
