<p>I'm baffled by this article. Shouldn't an encyclopedia be a repository of knowledge and not a place for point/counterpoint discussion of extremely narrow and specific issues? Could anybody please explain in clear words why they think this is encyclopedic? <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 23:22, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Especially considering there are almost no concrete examples of anti-semitism, and ESPECIALLY systemic anti-semitism within the movement. 209.148.141.155 14:28, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly don't think this article is encyclopedic, as it will never consist of anything but political accusations. Maybe if it were renamed "Anti-globalization and anti-zionism" we could write a real article, but as it stands there's no substance to write an article about. I'm not saying that anti-semitism doesn't exist within the anti-globalization movement, but it's certainly not prevalent enough to write an encyclopedia article about, any more than we would write an article about African-Americans and anti-Semitism or Boy Scout leaders and child molestation. Anything in this article would be better dealt with in either the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> article or the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> article. We don't need POV forks devoted to every overlap of political ideology. This article needs to be merged back or deleted outright, IMO. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:40, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It shouldn't be re-titled, since it's not about anti-globalization and anti-Zionism, it's about anti-globalization and anti-Semitism, though opponents of the article have consistently tried to misrepresent it as being about the former. The merge idea won't work, since the people watchdogging the Anti-globalization page refused to allow this material to be in it, which is how this article came to be created in the first place. It's not a POV fork, of course, since the POV isn't represented anywhere else. And finally the VfD failed, so attempts to subvert that vote by deleting the article anyway are inappropriate. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:06, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is encyclopedic because the controvery has spawned much debate and many articles. This page could provide an opportunity to explore the three main strands of the debate. 1) the anti-globalization movement is antisemitic. 2) The anti-globalization movement is not antisemitic, and the charge is used to silence critics of Israel. 3) The anti-globalization movement is not institutionally antisemitic, and the charge is used to silence critics of Israel, but antisemitic rhetoric and images are far too common, and need to be challenged (which is actually the Naomi Klein position).--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 13:39, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You misunderstand the nature of "facts"; partisans on various sides of this issue (and thousands of others) all believe that they are presenting the "facts", it's just that they all disagree on which "facts" are "true". You're assuming that we can determine the "facts", when <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is clear that "a single, unbiased, objective point of view" is generally not possible. Moreover, you misunderstand the nature of Wikipedia articles; the policies regarding them were specifically designed for this kind of topic, and are all about debates. WP:NPOV assumes articles will be full of debates, and merely insists that "Articles without bias describe debates fairly rather than advocating any side of the debate." Quoting again from the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>"Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, which means it is a representation of human knowledge at some level of generality. But human beings disagree about specific cases; for any topic on which there are competing views, each view represents a different idea of what the truth is, and insofar as that view contradicts other views, its adherents believe that the other views are false and therefore not knowledge. Where there is disagreement about what is true, there's disagreement about what constitutes knowledge... A solution is that we accept, for the purposes of working on Wikipedia, that "human knowledge" includes all different significant theories on all different topics... We could sum up human knowledge (in this sense) in a biased way: we'd state a series of theories about topic T, and then claim that the truth about T is such-and-such. But again, consider that Wikipedia is an international, collaborative project. Nearly every view on every subject will be found among our authors and readers. To avoid endless edit wars, we can agree to present each of the significant views fairly, and not assert any one of them as correct. That is what makes an article "unbiased" or "neutral" in the sense we are presenting here. To write from a neutral point of view, one presents controversial views without asserting them; to do that, it generally suffices to present competing views in a way that is more or less acceptable to their adherents, and also to attribute the views to their adherents. Disputes are characterized in Wikipedia. They are not re-enacted."</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, rather than being an abberation that should be deleted, Wikipedia policies were specifically designed to produce this kind of article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:33, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What about putting the image in, with the appropiate remarck that the star is not a star of David&#160;?

<p>There is no reason to keep the image out other than as a cover up to censor the truth.

<dd>There are several reasons. The image is certainly at best insensitive, but images of the Star of David morphing into a Swastika are a far clearer example of the issue. There are images of demonstrators with signs that contain better examples of antisemitic rhetoric.

<dd>"Improvement of Wikipedia" is a little vague. If you really want to know the relevance of the image, the answer is that it is a blurry version of a better photo that we have. The sole reason for using this one is that the word <small>SHERIFF</small> is not very visible in it, and so the photo can be used to say, explicitly or implicitly, that the protestors were anti-Semites wearing stars of David. — <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelpful_Dave_4207.html" title="User:Helpful Dave"><i>Helpful Dave</i></a> 21:59, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, I have written articles about how there is too much tolerance of antisemitism in the anti-globalization movement, and I think this is not an appropriate photo to illustrate the point. Insensitive, stupid...yes, but especially since the word "sheriff" is blurred out, this photo is mostly being used as a propaganda ploy by the political right to bash the left, and by people who are uncritical of Israeli policy to unfairly bash critics. Antisemitism is an important issue.

<p>Yes, i understand all too well what certain POV advocates think, but the golden calf and yellow 6 pointed stars are an excellent example of "Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism". Write "sherriff" or whatever you like, those yellow stars wern't ment to be meerly "insensitive", I don't care how stupid those protesters were, the effect is the same. Even if it was unintentional as you seem to prefer we assume, the effect is for the reader to judge, not you or I. <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 06:07, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am a little bit disturbed by "the effect is for the reader to judge, not you or I"; this opens the way to virtually any image manipulation, in the "we report, you decide" style.

<dd>Removing this image is not censorship. The image simply has nothing to do with the topic of the article. The claim that the image demonstrates anti-semitism has been widely discredited, both here and elsewhere. It has already been shown that Rumsfeld's star is not a Star of David, as many had claimed, and no one is convinced that showing someone dressed as Ariel Sharon or having Donald Rumsfeld carry a golden calf demostrates anti-semitism. If you can explain how that demostrates anti-semitism, I'm all ears. Otherwise, I will remove the image and file a complaint against you if you continue to use this article as a platform for pushing discredited right-wing propaganda. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 15:57, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh Sam. Did you actually <i>read</i> the image description page, as well as that of the B/W version? Might be time to re-iterate:
<ol>
<li>The badge was clearly intended as a sheriff's badge. Because some lousy versions of this image had been published, it was misinterpreted as the "Jew" star used in Nazi Germany. Obviously it's easy to get that idea, but the evidence indicates that this was never the intention of these protesters.</li>
<li>Since when do calves have horns?&#160;:-) The use of a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_calf.html" title="Golden calf">Golden calf</a> as a methaphor is hardly anti-semitic, it's more anti-(whoever is said to worship it). This particular cow doesn't even look like a calf. I perceive a mixed metaphor, kind of a cross between a Golden calf and a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_cow.html" title="Sacred cow">Sacred cow</a>.</li>
<li>Nobody was singled out, it just appears that way because of the selection of view the photographer made. See the description of <a href="../../../d/a/v/Image%7EDavos_WEF_Golden_Calf.png_7a1c.html" title="Image:Davos WEF Golden Calf.png">Image:Davos WEF Golden Calf.png</a>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I also thought this issue had been resolved long ago (must be in the archive, I guess). <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. The yellow star issue was settled long ago. Even SlimVirgin, who was the most ardent supporter of the idea that the star was anti-Semitic, backed off on the issue once the high-res version of the photo was discovered. Some people tried to claim that the star was still a Star of David since it had 6 points instead of 5, but as you can see <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=sheriff%20star&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?q=sheriff%20star&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" rel="nofollow">here</a>, sherriff stars commonly have 5, 6, or 7 points. Besides, the Nazis typically made Jews wear arm bands. And why would someone wishing to express anti-Semitism dress up like Donald Rumsfeld? Portraying the star as anti-Semitic is rather transparent propaganda.<br /></dd>
<dd>2. I'm not sure what the Golden calf has to do with anti-Semitism. You'll have to explain this one to me. The Golden calf is a symbol of the worship of money and thus an entirely appropriate symbol for an anti-globalization protest. If it's supposed to be anti-Semitic, why would Donald Rumsfeld be carrying it?<br /></dd>
<dd>3. I fail to see how someone dressing up as Ariel Sharon amongst other protesters dressed as other (non-Jewish) world leaders could be perceived as anti-Semitic. If it had been someone dressed as Joseph Liberman instead of Donald Rumsfeld, you would have a point, but otherwise, I don't see how you could make such a connection.<br /></dd>
<dd><b>Question:</b> Do you think that Donald Rumsfeld is Jewish? If so, I could understand where you get the idea that the photo is anti-Semitic, but otherwise, I'm frankly at a loss to understand your contention.<br /></dd>

<p>Hi Sam, thank you for your answer above. I personally don't currently have a strong opinion on this image one way or the other, but would like to understand your perspective.

<dd>Well firstly this is conjecture, I don't have a citation regarding what they claim to have ment by it, but that would be handy. <i>My</i> interpretation (which I'm not placing in the article of course) is that rumsfeld is acting as the servant of sharon, carrying the golden calf (of <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammon.html" title="Mammon">mammon</a> I assume, what with the $ coming out of his ears). Sharon carries a club, apparently as slave master, while rumsfeld wears the yellow "sheriffs badge" to indicate America's position of aiding Israel militarilly in the mid-east. <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 01:49, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a very plausible conjecture, certainly not a left-field assessment. It's consistent with, for example, <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/26/Columns/Anti_Semitism_s_globa.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/26/Columns/Anti_Semitism_s_globa.shtml" rel="nofollow">this editorial</a> which talks about the anti-semitic element displayed at anti-globalization rallies indicating Jews are "the hidden hand controlling the global economy." My feeling though is that we really should find confirmation first that this is the message intended behind this particular image. Otherwise just by putting it in the article we've drawn conclusions for the reader that this is indeed an example of anti-globalization and anti-semitism, which probably constitutes original research. I think if we can find outside confirmation though, it's a good image that should be in there. I'll look around and see what I can find. Another thought, I've come across mention of anti-semitic display by some anti-globalist protestors carrying signs reading, ""Nazis, Yankees and Jews: No More Chosen Peoples!" An image of that, if it could be found might be a good example to put in the article also. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:57, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's plausible, but it is just conjecture. I have said repeatedly that antisemitism in the antiglobalization movement is a real issue and needs to be discussed, but that there must be better images available. The claim that I am somehow trying to censor the issue is outlandish. I have an article in the New Internationalist issue on Judeophobia; and a number of articles on the same theme on a website.

<p>'Lets just stick it up and let the reader deside' sounds nice and NPOV, but its not because if the photo is put in the article with no explanatory text the reader will assume that it is a clear example of anti-Semitism, which it certainly isn't. As people have said there are examples that are far less ambiguous (though in my opinion most of those memtions so far are not anti-Semitic). That said no one has uploaded any let.<br />
Just to address Sams 3rd point,that <i>Prominent Jews singled out for representation in this manner</i> he seems to have forgotten/missed the point that there were lots of other world figgers represented too including <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">bin Laden</a> <a href="http://www.remote.ch/search/search.dbc?WHAT=wef" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.remote.ch/search/search.dbc?WHAT=wef" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<dd>Thank you Sam for saying that. The ideal we all fall short of sometimes is to be respectful toward each other even when there is disagreement. Btw, I did find a <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791&amp;page=3" class="external text" title="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">link relating to the image</a> (search for "Davos"), I don't know if anyone mentioned it earlier. It at least gives evidence that others perceived this image as antisemitism. Whether antisemitism was actually the intention of the protestors is still unknown, though. Even with "sheriff" written on the star, the other elements in the image still could suggest the "Jews run the global economy" message, but again the true intentions of the demonstrators aren't known. It could be cited though as the perception of Mark Strauss, in <i>Foreign Policy</i>. I'm equivocal on whether it should be in the article though without knowing this was indeed the intent of the demonstrators. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 19:12, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even if Sam's interpretation is 100% accurate, how does that demonstrate anti-Semitism??? Israel and the US were both major participants in the WEF conference. If someone is protesting the WEF conference (and particularly the US's economic exploitation of the Middle East), portraying Arial Sharon and Donald Rumsfeld as worshippers of mannon would certainly make sense. Is it impossible to criticize Arial Sharon or the Israeli government without being anti-Semitic? No one claims that the WEF protest was anti-Christian or anti-Muslim or anti-Caucasian, but the logic would be the same. Yes, I'm sure people who are anti-Semitic say that Jews run the world economy, but using that argument to say that this is an example of anti-Semitism is a Cum hoc ergo propter hoc logical fallacy. Correlation does not equal causation. Anyone familiar with the context of the WEF protest understands that there was no anti-Semitic intention to this particular demostration, as has been well discussed and documented on the image talk page. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 14:46, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The WEF is mainly attended by representatives of large corporations, however, a handful of countries also send government representatives to give talks or participate in seminars, etc. As the Middle East is one of the more volatile economic markets, Israel almost always sends high-level government representatives to participate in the WEF. In the last several years, Vice-Prime Minister Shimon Peres has attended regularly and frequently made speeches at the conference regarding the political/economic situation in the Middle East. The governor of the Bank of Israel is also a regular participant in the conference. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 21:38, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the published accounts of this specific demonstration, there were people wearing masks of at least the following: George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Arial Sharon, and Osama bin Laden, all wearing monkey suits and carrying clubs. I think the basic intention of the demonstration was to make a statement that our "leaders" don't really have our interests in mind, but rather are concerned mainly with money and power. The only people who have claimed that this demostration had an anti-Semitic theme are people who have seen this particular blurry photo out of context, mostly on right-wing blog sites like LGF. Using Wikipedia to perpetuate this out-of-context misinterpretation is POV-pushing in my view (and I think the view of most other editors debating this article).<br /></dd>
<dd>BTW, I wasn't claiming that this particular demonstration was to protest Israel's participation in the WEF. I was making a point that <i>even if</i> Sam's interpretation of the photo was correct (which I don't believe it is), the protestors could be justified in making such a statement in the context of a WEF protest, without anti-Semitism having anything to do with it. Singling out Israel (or Arial Sharon) for criticism would certainly warrant scrutiny, but would not ipso facto demostrate anti-Semitism. Regardless, Israel was not singled out for criticism in this case, so the point is fairly irrelevant. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 23:03, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Let's just continue the discussion. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs identifies the protestors in the picture as members of ATTAC <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-32.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-32.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>:
<dl>
<dd><i>ATTAC, a worldwide group with many members and promoters in Germany, was monitored very thoroughly by Jewish organizations, mainly in France and Britain, as it went beyond criticism of economic policies to address political issues. In a January 2003 demonstration against the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, some of its activists, including Germans, staged a "masquerade." One person, disguised as President Bush, carried with another person a "golden calf." Both "Bush" and the calf were marked with large yellow stars. Subsequently ATTAC came under heavy criticism and tried to deflect it with a "Discussion Site of ATTAC-Germany on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict."<sup><small>21</small></sup> Although attempts were made there to deny anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, between the lines the message was clear: Israel is solely responsible for the escalation since September 2000, and European Jewish groups isolate themselves when they decline to attend "anti-racism" rallies together with ATTAC and other leftist groups.</i>"</dd>

<dd>Also, I would like to point out that Jerusalem Center's account of the protest isn't even accurate. First, they've confused Donald Rumsfeld with Bush (as the two people carrying the cow were Rumsfeld and a person dressed as a pig), and Rumsfeld was the only person seen wearing a sherriff's badge (not Bush). Also, there was no sherriff's badge (or yellow star) on the cow. There are <a href="http://www.remote.ch/picts/thumb/007100/7187_2.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.remote.ch/picts/thumb/007100/7187_2.JPG" rel="nofollow">pictures</a> of the cow from both sides on the internet and you can see that there is no star. Obviously if there had been Star of David on the Golden Calf there would be pictures of it all over the internet and we wouldn't be debating this ambiguous photo of Sharon and Rumsfeld, that's for sure. If they can't even get the obvious facts right, I'm certainly going to be skeptical of whatever else they have to say about it. Regardless, I will withhold judgement until I read more about the controversy with ATTAC. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 18:14, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't assume the JCPA account isn't accurate. They weren't commenting on this particular photo captured at one moment in time, but on the protest as a whole, which I assume lasted at least all day if not over the period of several days. In fact an account by Jay Nordlinger, a participant in the WEF who gave a lecture, observed a person dressed as George W. Bush carrying the calf, so it's plausible and likely that the calf (and perhaps even the yellow stars) were traded off among various characters throughout the protest. Nordlinger reported: <i>Some of the protesters are dressed as monkeys — no, really — and others carry a golden calf. This calf is borne by persons wearing a George W. Bush mask and a Donald Rumsfeld mask. "Rumsfeld" is wearing a yellow star — nice. Real nice. Also, the protesters are raining all over the place xeroxed dollar bills that show President Bush in place of George Washington and have the president saying, "We f*** the world." On the back it says "In War We Trust."</i> <a href="http://nationalreview.com/impromptus/impromptus020503.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://nationalreview.com/impromptus/impromptus020503.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

On the other hand, the photo has been cropped to accentuate the problematic aspects, and many of the complaints seem to come from folks with a history of bashing the left and conflating antisemitism with criticism of Israeli policies.

<dd>I tend to agree this image probably is wrong for this article based on the facts as we know them so far. The image certainly evoked many negative responses, but the bottom line is, there is still ambiguity linking this photo to outright antisemitism, though yes it is insensitive as many have already mentioned. There are more blatant examples I've seen cited, but without accompanying photos. Perhaps the focus should be on locating a more representative photo to use instead of this one. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 19:43, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I actually changed the article to titledisputed template which I think covers my concerns slightly more accurately though I still believe the info in this article should be merged back to the anti-globalization or anti-semitism article (title should not conclude that this phenomenon factually exists more than errant charges of anti-semitism is used to discredit the movement). Why isn't this article's info simply included in an "examples or allegations of anti-semitism" sub section of the anti-semitism article? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:37, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, and regarding your last question, for one thing the article is relevant to both Anti-globalization and anti-Semitism.

<p>Please correct me if I am wrong (very useful, as I am researching the Wikipedia for my MA dissertation) but this article does not seem to represent an example of Wikipedia's NPOV. It seems to represent a theory which has little hard evidence attributed to it bar opinion editorial pieces from newspapers, some of which (Naomi Klein) actually seem a little out of context here. I say 'lack of hard evidence' due to the muddying of items such as the EU report and the often-thorny distinction between (legitimate or otherwise) criticism of Israel and anti-semitism.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that, if this article must exist, it will only serve the needs of the Wikipedia if members of anti-globalisation (itself a politically loaded term) organisations are invited to contribute. It would therefore serve as a useful resource, both for proponents of the current POV of the article, and for members of these organisations interested in these allegations (as they should be). As the article stands, it detracts from the credibility of the project in circles which are suspicious of the origin of much of the material that links anti-semitism to the globalisation movement.</p>
<p>The debate about the picture also seems bizarre more than anything else, I have passed it around a varied assortment of people (as part of my research into debates here) and didn't manage to find anybody who thought it was anti-semitic - each person identified the golden calf as a symbol of mammon. If the picture is sufficiently vague to produce such an interpretation, it hardly seems to fit into the tradition of anti-semitic propaganda, and rightly or wwrongly, should probably be considered POV.

'Traditional academics' tend to frown on Cultural studies as a discipline, and occupy a position of disinterested observation (NPOV, even) which I believe is false anyway, as your own research methods are always shaped by politics.</dd>

<dd>That's the spirit. Jump in and edit. There is nothing wrong with being a scholarly participant observer here at Wiki, as long as someplace you post a note that you are doing an academic study. On your main User page is a good place to post a note. However to start out a discussion comment by invoking your scholarly status as a researcher; and then make a POV comment about text, is in my view outside the bounds of appropriate Wiki behaviour. Here editors range from folks with post-doctorates to folks without formal education. What matters is good editing and following the rules for citation and support for text being added. As you can probably figure out, just adding a comment on a discussion page that you think an article needs work is generally considered a waste of everyone's time. The point is to edit text. Or as others here often say--"we are writing an encyclopedia, not talking about how to write an encyclopedia." If the latter interests you, there are discussions policy and writing rules elsewhere on Wiki and on discussion lists. Happy editing. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 13:39, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I posted a note about the fact that I'm researching right after registering as a user (after two years of anonymous edits), and the only reason I make it clear in the occasional comment is because I like people to contact me with their opinions, as you have done. As for my POV on the article, I'm of the opinion that the more controversial a topic is (and I dont think it's going too far to call this topic and its talk page controversial) the less likely it is to fit the term NPOV, which I don't see as being easily obtainable anyway. This is off-topic though, so I will restrict such discussion to my user page and other relevant talk pages.</dd>

<p>Zen master, you seem to be finding all sorts of disputes that I don't see anywhere on this talk page (see above). Now the title is disputed? Where will I find that debate? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:30, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It has been disputed ever since VfD. See my previous post for details. To summarize, I still believe the content should be merged to other articles but slightly more importantly a title should not conclude that this phenomenon factually exists when there is at least as much evidence that errant charges of anti-semitism are used to discredit the movement (to a greater degree than any real anti-semitism within the movement). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:41, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that is one of the tactics often used, and obviously being used here. The other tactic I've seen is to rename the article, and then claim that the contents don't match the article title, and therefore the article should be merged (i.e. deleted).

<p>I wasn't even the one that initially suggested the merging so it isn't just me. What you label as original research is actual fact.

Bald assertions that "this is actual fact" betray a strong POV and a fundamental misunderstanding of Wikipedia policy. And I suppose it's inevitable, the people who want to delete the article, first put it up for VfD, then when that fails try to "delete by merge", and then when that fails, put it up for VfD again. Why not accept consensus instead? Is there any specific statement in the article you disagree with?

I agree that sometimes the charge is just a way to bash the left. But sometimes it is not.

<p>The principle of democracy is that the losers accept the decision of the majority. Are you having anti-democratic tendencies, zen? Your last argument, BTW, is just another distraction tactic, since it is completely absurd to expect complete NPOV language just one month after such a dispute. Having contributed to several controversial topics myself, it is my experience that having sections where proponents and critics can express their POV views are good at caliming down people and certainly better than having no article at all. Also, though each section may be POV, the whole article becomes balanced and relatively NPOV (as it expresses all the views). Thus, your argument is baseless. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 18:41, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How is that title comparable to this article's title? That book or whatever it is may indeed be POV but the title of this article is basically stating that group X (anti-globalism) is Y (anti-semetic), <b>that</b> is what is POV (much more POV that merely mentioning the existence of something that might itself be POV, see the difference?). The title of this article is still very much disputed. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:07, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, the title just makes a connection between both terms. It doesn't make a judgement on this connection. As the content of the article shows, this connection is supported by some, and rejected by some. "and" is not equal to "is". When you say "apples and oranges" you are not saying "apples are oranges". That's basic English grammar, I think. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 21:18, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is there a precedent for title contents such as 'POV' or 'allegations of..' on Wikipedia? I haven't seen one, but that doesn't mean anything. If not, I don't think the work is needed on the title but on its introduction, to put the title in better context.

<dd>There is no particular precedent for including "allegations" in article titles, which, in fact, is a way of introducing POV.

<p>My point is why isn't the article Luis mentions above instead titled Protocols of the Elders of Zion and anti-Semitism? That article's actual title <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_1249.html" title="Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> presents a very POV subject neutrally but this article's title does not, why is that? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:40, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because the article isn't about anti-Semitism, it's about a document called "Protocols of the Elders of Zion".

<dd>Does that article mention anti-Semitism? That book is much more anti-Semitic than the anti-globalization movement by orders of magnitude. How did an article about a book, which factually concludes it is fraudulent and anti-Semitic, get a neutral title while allegations of some anti-Semitism within the anti-globalization movement get a very POV conclusive title? The other article reaches all the factual and justifiable conclusions of anti-Semitism within the contents of the article, but this article concludes things in the title. This discprepancy needs rectifying one way or another. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:58, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the article doesn't discuss allegations that it is Anti-Semitic, as opposed to this article, which does discuss allegations of anti-Semitism.

<dd>Huh? If it's so simple then please explain it to me. That article does indeed discuss allegations and facts that the book is anti-Semitic. To quote from that article "The Encyclopædia Britannica describes the Protocols as a 'fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century'" and "...[a group] had been criticized for using [the book] in their anti-Semitic publications". An article with a fact based conclusion that a book is anti-Semitic is neutrally titled, yet an article about allegations of some possible anti-Semitism within the anti-globalization movement is presented POV conclusively, that does not make sense. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 01:17, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could the following link be added to the 'reactions' section of the page? As suggested by Cberlet following my badly-phrased comment above, I have been trying to find sources to add to this debate. However, most of the stuff that I've been able to find originates from partisan blogs on either side of the spectrum. However, the following piece is from the Guardian newspaper.</p>

</ul>
<p>To contrast, the following link also contains a case which may suggest some evidence to suggest that the conflation of various interest groups to campaign against the Iraq war may have resulted in anti-semitism being ignored.</p>

<p>Could somebody please offer me some guidance on researching a topic where the discussion is so highly polarised. How much can sources from blogs be used? I am trying to find stuff to include in the article, but I'm still learning how to find good sources. Also, apologies if these links have also appeared before - this page changes pretty quickly.

It contains a series of Avi speeches by <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Finkelstein_13d4.html" title="Norman Finkelstein">Norman Finkelstein</a> on anti-semitism and criticism of Israel. I am aware that Finkelstein's opinions are considered controversial, but I think that his ongoing feud with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Dershowitz_e083.html" title="Alan Dershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a> is relevant to this topic.</dd>

<p>This article has rightly been subject to criticism in regards to relevance and a generally non-encylcopedic style. If it can't be merged I would suggest a) eliminating 3/4 of it and leaving it a step above a stub as that's all it basically warrants (it's a <i>sub article of a sub-article</i> and yet it's 70% the size of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">Globalization</a>--it's granparent article if you like). Or b) making a larger article called the Left and Anti-semetism or some such thing which would actually be relevant and including most of this stuff there. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:33, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is a relatively reasonable summary of an often bitter and contentious debate. Wiki cannot eliminate such articles, since that implies that the proponents of the central argument have nothing of merit in their claims. It is entirely appropriate for an encyclopedia to have entires on matters that are the subject of debate. People who oppose the idea that there may be some in the anti-Globalization movement who are at best insensitive to antisemitism tend to suggest this page has no merit. Not a big surprise.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 20:27, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since there are no space restrictions on wikipedia, I don't see why a sub-sub-sub-sub article should be deleted. On the contrary, the aim of wikipedia is to make central articles only summaries, and to put more details into subarticles. This frees up space for the central article, and at the same time allows even minor issues to be treated in great detail. It is a characteristic we should cherish in wikipedia, not condemn. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 20:35, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with this article is not its existence, as it would certainly prove useful to members of the anti-globalisation movement who might then think twice about seeking common cause with certain organisations. Also, the fact that the allegations exist requires both their assertion and refutation in an article of this kind. The problem lies in the presentation of the article and its use of sources. The Mark Strauss article is actually a lot more nuanced than the quotations presented would suggest, examining a variety of possible reasons for the infiltration by anti-semites and also supplying stories of Jewish activists. The first paragraph, quoted in the wiki entry, is provocative but is IMO not supported well by the arguments made in the piece. It also generated a lot of negative feedback (one example at <a href="http://www.ratical.org/corporations/RGonAJP2003.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ratical.org/corporations/RGonAJP2003.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I think the opening paragrpah needs to do more to put the debate in context, perhaps covering some of the material from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-zionism.html" title="Anti-zionism">anti-zionism</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 21:02, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If nobody objects to inclusion of a little material from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-zionism.html" title="Anti-zionism">anti-zionism</a>, I'll put that in the intro and add some nuance to the bit on Strauss. However, I think the discussion of the EU report requires work that I don't feel qualified to do - the non-endorsement of the report probably needs to be commented on by a user with a knowledge of the byzantine complexity of EU departmental politics.

<dd>Sorry Marskell, but I think the creation of a whole 'left and anti-semitism' article is outside the scope of my abilities. I'm a better minor editor than researcher, although I'm working on it. I intend to improve the introduction of this one and slim it down a bit, hopefully with less reliance on a series of articles/op eds which (as in the case of Strauss and Klein) actually comment on each other anyway. As for 'left and antisemitism' do you not think creating that article might result in more debate than anything else? I personally don't like the term 'anti-globalization' but it is in common currency and easy to locate within debate. Defining the various spectrum of views that might correspond to 'left' in this particular case strikes me as being very difficult.</dd>

<dd>As a point of basic logic, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Globalization_84d1.html" title="Anti-Globalization">Anti-Globalization</a> is a sub-article of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">Globalization</a>. Length does not determine primacy--the Wiki article on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_skunks.html" title="Pet skunks">Pet skunks</a> is three or four times larger than the article <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skunks.html" title="Skunks">Skunks</a> (presumably bc somebody who owns a skunk had some time to kill) but if you had to choose one over the other as worthy of inclusion here you'd have to pick Skunks. Similarly, if <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> has received more attention than <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">Globalization</a>, it's due to the slant of contributors; the average browser is going to search Globalization first and hit the Anti- page as a sublink and subsequent to that hit this page as final reading. BTW, I think Anti-Globalization is poorly done, totally POV, and very overlong--I added a comment there just after this one.</dd>

Yes, it would create more talk page yip-yap but so what. Will points out that "'Anti-globalization'...is in common currency" but is "'Anti-Globalization and Anti-Semitism'" in common currency?" Leftist anti-semitism probably gets more Google searches than Anti-Globalization-anti-semitism; The latter is an adjunct of the former I'd say. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "allegations" section began with a quote contained in the ludicrously far-right FrontPageMag.com. By all standards this is not a legitimate source, and we cannot prevent controversial claims from it without saying something about the nature of the publication - better yet to just not include it at all. I mean, just look around the site: today they accuse UNICEF and Oprah Winfrey of funding Palestinian terrorist groups, beneath an article demonizing black people and next to a racist advertisement for gun t-shirts. I mean I'm not trying to apply a double-standard - I wouldn't include something from an anarchist zine on the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> article while presenting it as widely held opinion. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 01:17, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why I rewrote the lead. It is not possible to state that every member of a movement accepts or rejects anything. Some people within the anti-Globalization movement and people who support the anti-Globalization movement have warned about anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is not accurately called a form of racism unless you want to get into a long discussion about false claims of shared genetic heritage and neonazi ideology. There are clearly people who publicly claim to be part of the anti-Globalization movement who promote xenophobia and anti-Semitism--which is exactly what Naomi Klein was warning about.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 13:26, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great. Good news. Now let me switch hats, and suggest we need more discussion in the body of the text of how the claim of "antisemitism in the anti-globalization movement" is sometimes used by some on the zealous right to bash progressive critics of unregulated capitalism and U.S. foreign policy. The Frontpage article was a good example of that. And I switch hats again and suggest we need a short discussion of the problematic alliance between the Nader people and Pat Buchanan, who regularly flirts with antisemitism. &#160;:-) --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 14:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I rewrote the allegation section because it seemed mostly to consist of large quotes from articles which can be seen as opinion pieces. The problem is that the Strauss article contains some liinks and facts, but also some unsubstantiated claims. I also delated the Stern quote, as he doesn't even make any direct accusations, although I kept a summary in.</p>
<p>I know that I said I would try and make the article shorter, but I think an important step to that is making it read better first. I propose slimming down the 'reaction' section, but I don't know what to do about the ideological concerns part - it seems far too long. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 19:06, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is this nonsense? Is this a case study in self-delusion? Does Wikipedia now have to have a page devoted to every crank and the ravings of every lunatic under the sun? Because this is what this so called anti-globalisation and anti-semitism page is about. For a start, the anti-globalisation movement doesn't even LIKE the term (it prefers anti-capitalist, grassroots globalisation, global justice movement). If you're talking about the anti-immigrant movements, the populist anti-globalisation movements who favour BORDERS (unlike the anti-capitalists, etc) or the fascist movements, then why not RENAME THIS PAGE huh? Secondly, this movement IS NOT the anti-war movement (with its associated discourse and analysis which includes critiques of Israel), though there are important overlaps and similarities in some areas. Thirdly, as someone who has been involved in the UK movement for 6 years, I have NEVER heard anyone involved even utter anything even close to anti-semitic. Not a joke, not a sentence. In fact, many of those involved are active jews who are even more against the policies of Israel than many on the left who are not jewish.</p>
<p>So, is there a space on wikipedia for the bloke next door who says the goldfish is talking to him, or are people going to start to get with reality? Thank you.</p>

<dd>Now that you have vented...what constructive ideas or edits do you have to offer to make the page a better addition to Wikipedia. Simply because you disagree with a page does not mean that the issue does not exist. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 12:40, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think his point isn't that the issue doesn't exist, it's that the issue is a political strawman. Anti-semitism is not a significant phenomenon in the anti-globalization movement. The 2 real issues are:</dd>
<dd>1. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a> within the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-war_movement.html" title="Anti-war movement">anti-war movement</a>.</dd>
<dd>2. anti-Semitism within right-wing nationalist movements (such as Front National in France). Nationalists often share views on certain issues with anti-globalists, and are sometimes wrongly labeled anti-globalists, but their politics are entirely different even if they do show up at the same protests. The anti-globalization movement is overwhelmingly left-wing (i.e. social justice, civil rights, anti-racist). They oppose globalization because they see multinational corporations exploiting 3rd world countries with impunity. Nationalists are typically right wing and oppose globalization because they support economic protectionism.</dd>
<dd>Critics of the anti-globalization movement have tried to use these 2 legitimate issues to paint the anti-globalization movement as anti-Semitic, but few people even take these accusations seriously as they are so ludicrous. It speaks volumes that Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> doesn't discuss anti-semitism at all (where it is obviously a real problem), but there's a lengthy article discussing anti-semitism and anti-globalization. It's obvious that this article exists because of efforts to push a particular point of view. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:57, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that it is always a straw issue. Sometimes it is, sometimes not. That's why I added the section on ideological issues. There are leftwing anti-globalization activists who have applauded coalitions with rightwing nationalist movements and dismissed the criticism that these movements often come with the baggage of xenophobia and antisemitism. Ralph Nader's team of anti-globalization activists--with their open coalition with Pat Buchanan--are the best known examples of this in the U.S.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 17:05, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you believe that there needs to be an entire encyclopedia article about anti-semitism and anti-globalization because some unnamed anti-globalization activists have formed coalitions with right-wing nationalist groups that are probably anti-semitic. Do you realize that the articles on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">Nationalism</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">Right-wing politics</a> don't even mention anti-semitism? If it's not even notable enough to mention in those articles why the hell is there an entire treastise about it here (where the connection is tenuous at best)? The only reason this article survived VfD is because certain people are interested in propping up a negative POV of the anti-globalization movement (or they are interested in conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism). Either way this article is unencyclopedic and inherently POV. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 17:21, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>This stuff doesn't make much sense:<br />
<i>Strauss makes a number of accusations in his article, including that:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Marchers at an anti-globalisation march in Porto Allegre, Brazil displayed Swastikas</i></li>
<li><i>Jewish peace activists were assaulted at the same march</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Well I'd like to see proof but I can see how these would link anti-glob to anti-sem (or at least iny elements of anti-cap) but...</p>
<ul>
<li><i>European newspapers have resurrected the image of the ‘Christ-killing Jew’</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Since when do Anti-globalisationists own european newspapers?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Palestinians are lining up to buy copies of Mein Kampf</i></li>
</ul>
<p>If true this shows anti-sem amoung Palestinatines rather then anti-glob's.<br />
Further:<br />
<i>Strauss draws many of his sources from anti-Semitic newspapers in the Arab world, and does not provide direct links to the sources of several of the accusations mentioned above. However, he does present evidence that groups such as the right-wing National Alliance have sought to recruit anti-gobalization protestors through websites which avoid explicit declarations of far-right politics.</i><br />
This proves what? That The far right is trying to recruit anti-glob's by pretending that they're not far-right which one would imagine involves pretending their not anti-semitic, which suggests that anti-globs would be put off by anti-semitism, which suggests anti-glob's don't tend to be anti-semities!!!<br />

<dl>
<dd>I see your point. I personally don't consider that Strauss article to be a valid source - he is willing to make very provocative claims (European Newspapers and the Christ Killing Jew) without being willing to back them up. If material like that is going to be on Wikipedia, then it probably belongs in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">New anti-Semitism</a> article - which is currently a repository for similar conspiracy-type theories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I think this point about teh <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Alliance_b1f0.html" title="National Alliance">National Alliance</a> recruiting deserves to stand - there is a danger that far-right groups are pursuing a tactic of finding 'common ground' with people attracted to the anti-globalisation movement, and Strauss does provide evidence of this claim. I also don't necessarilt agree that far-right and anti-semitic can necessarily be conflated - there are people on the far-left who are anti-semitic, just as there are people on the far-right (Israeli right and christian right) who aren't. I think the point of this article is that mass movements can sometimes make strange bedfellows, so the bit about the National Alliance should stay, although perhaps with a rewrite. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 14:54, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although this article has improved 10-fold since it's grossly biased beginnings, there are still a few things taken out of context. For example, this sentence is misleading: "[Naomi Klein] wrote in a 2002 article of her great concern in finding antisemitic rhetoric on some activist websites that she had visted." This makes it sound like she was shocked to find anti-globalization activists posting anti-semitic rants on their websites. In actuality, the posts were not made by anti-globalization activists, nor was she "greatly concerned" about finding them there. If you read the article you find that she was "thinking about" the fact that she is commonly confronted with anti-semitic propoganda, even on indymedia sites (which are essentially open discussion boards with plenty of right-wing trolls, racists, and conspiracy theorists of all stripes). The way it is phrased in the article is misleading, IMO. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:02, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"A lot of ink has been spilled chronicling the pro-Israel leanings of American neocons and fact that a the disproportionate percentage of them are Jewish.

But the point is not that Jews (who make up less than 2 percent of the American population) have a monolithic perspective. <b>Indeed, American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat and many of them disagree strongly with Ariel Sharon’s policies and Bush’s aggression in Iraq</b>. The point is simply that the neocons seem to have a special affinity for Israel that influences their political thinking and consequently American foreign policy in the Middle East."</dd>

<p>Lasn's strategy (of listing which neocons are Jewish) is both ridiculous and ill-advised, but that doesn't make him an anti-semite, as Katerg's first edit stated. Thanks<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 19:47, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>you're right, he isn't antisemitic, but he certainly feeds antisemitic sentiment. i personally just think he's insane. thanks for making it more neutral --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKaterg_8e87.html" title="User:Katerg">Katerg</a> 20:28, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, Lasn is insane. The point that he is trying to make is interesting, but the way he has gone about it is idiotic beyond belief (sadly, a pretty accurate description of most of his recent activities), and he contradicts his own arguments. Hopefully the amount of 'Jewish conspiracy runs the world' lunatics that article attracted to his site will make him think twice before publishing anything without reading it through first.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 21:31, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kalle Lasn's points were taken completely out of line. There cannot be any - ANY - denying that a great many neoconservative intellectuals, whether it be Leo Strauss, Irving Kristol, Allan Bloom, Wolfowitz or a great many others, are of Jewish background.</p>
<p>and what exactly is the point of saying that? what are we being called to do about it? what does pointing it out accomplish beyond being an excuse for hatred? you can't deny they're all guys too. what does that mean? --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKaterg_8e87.html" title="User:Katerg">Katerg</a> 20:21, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Moreover, there cannot be any denying the close relationship between some members of the Bush administration and the Likud party.</p>
<p>I fail to see how criticizing America's foreign policy when it comes to Israel is parallel to anti-semitism. SubbEvil</p>

<dd>That's not the argument. Only a few right-wingers make that argument. The primary issue with Kalle Lasn is the outlandish and clueless insensitivity to the historic use of lists of Jews and claims of a Jewish conspiracy. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 21:21, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to be, errr, so anti-semitic (actually, I'm not, according to the following websites, if everyone where Jewish, the world would be a much better place&#160;: <a href="http://www.jinfo.org/Mathematics_Comp.html" class="external free" title="http://www.jinfo.org/Mathematics_Comp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jinfo.org/Mathematics_Comp.html</a> AND <a href="http://www.jinfo.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.jinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jinfo.org/</a>).</p>
<p>Though that above selection may be *SLIGHTLY* unrepresentative of the truth. Anyhow, this got me round to thinking that, as Globalisation is driven by the most intelligent people, and the following referenced website on wikipedia corroborates this&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence</a>, then that means that the overwhelming majority of European individuals who benefit most from Globalisation are either Jewish or have at least one parent who is Jewish. This, I believe, is a statistical fact once one takes a Normal z-distribution table and supposes that there is even a 0.5 Standard Deviation difference in the intelligences between European and (diminishing due to inter-marriage) Jewish populations.</p>
<p>Just a thought (with scientific and statistical validity).</p>
