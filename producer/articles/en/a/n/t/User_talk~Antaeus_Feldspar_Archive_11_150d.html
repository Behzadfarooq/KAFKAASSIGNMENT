<p>I really hate to bring this up, but you have been one of the protectors of the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Swift_f059.html" title="Tom Swift">Tom Swift</a> entry against its persistent vandal. Due to someone making a category edit, some of the vandal's "pet changes" have not been reverted, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Swift&amp;diff=41321835&amp;oldid=40517655" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Swift&amp;diff=41321835&amp;oldid=40517655" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Swift&amp;diff=41321835&amp;oldid=40517655</a>.</p>

<p>Where are you cutting and pasting from for the Dianetics and Scientology articles? I see a good deal of what you revert is presented on certain websites, presented as good information of those subjects. Are you copying and pasting certain informations into Wikipedia? In particular in the Dianetics article, you and I went back and forth for some while about a full list of Dianetics books or a very sketchy list of Dianeitcs publications. I later found what you reverted to, to be present even today at a certain dictionary site. This prompts me to ask where you get the information which you feel should present the subjects of Dianetics and Scientology. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 21:15, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, isn't that interesting? First you present your accusatory theory ("<b>Where</b> are you cutting and pasting from?") and then you present your ... not your "evidence", but your claim that there <i>is</i> evidence, which you cannot describe coherently (hello, what I "reverted to" was most likely by the nature of reverts to be <i>what was there before</i>?) for which you somehow think the most likely explanation is my "cutting and pasting". If you actually thought I copying and pasting from outside sources, you would have followed the correct Wikipedia procedures for alleged copyright violations -- of course, <i>then</i> you would have had to submit your "evidence", which (if it existed) might turn out to have a much more logical explanation (such as that -- Reverting 101: Reverting is the act of restoring a page or part of a page to the state it was in <i>before</i>.) Why am I <i>not</i> surprised that you chose instead to phrase your "question" in fine Joe McCarthy "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?" form on my user talk page? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its a pretty honest question, I presented it in a manner which seemed polite and not accusatory to me. A "yes" or "no" would suffice. What I would like to do is arrive at good aticles.

<dd>Because a simple question was not asked, Jimmy; an uncivil question which <i>assumed</i> the truth of an untrue accusation for which not one shred of evidence has <i>still</i> not been offered was asked. I can answer simple questions, however, that does not mean I am <i>obligated</i> to answer simple questions, especially when they are being asked for the purposes of harassment, an excellent example being your absolutely unfounded speculation of "Are you on drugs?" It's too bad that Spirit of Man can't see this (or more accurately, that he can't make sense of what he's seeing since he's blinded by his prejudices): after watching you allege totally out of the blue that I may be "on drugs", based on absolutely nothing I've ever said, then perhaps he'd finally comprehend that legal clause of "malicious disregard for the truth" which he has such trouble with. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:54, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thetan article</span></h2>
<p>You came into the Thetan article and <b>REFUSED</b> to do any discussion on the discussion page whatsoever. I suppose you are in your "non-discussion" mode and in 2 or 3 days you will be screaming, "I discuss on talk pages all the time". But in this single, solitary and individual situation you refused to discuss and had not been editing the Thetan article and came to the Thetan article which I have been working on and you used this edit summary: "17:25, 4 March 2006 Antaeus Feldspar (rv Terryeo's attempt to remove true and verifiable information which the CoS finds inconvenient. Notice he makes no attempt to remove "redundant" information about Operating Thetan.)" Which is at least critical (obviously) and which could, conceiveably be helpful <b>IF</b> you were involved in discussion on the article's discussion page (but of course that is beneath you are something). It is kind of irritating, you know what I mean? I'm trying to produce good, understandable - to - the - reader articles. I'm dealing with another editor in that article who at first insisted that "spirit" was an idea cooked up by Hubbard and presented in the guise, "thetan" and that "spirit" doesn't exist and shouldn't be believed to exist by anybody, ever. Your edits combined with your inflammatory edit summary aren't helpful. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 08:50, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are a liar Terryeo. I never insisted that "spirit" was concocted by Hubbard. In fact, you know that I know that the idea of a spirit that persists after death is one that has existed for thousands of years. The whole point is that this article <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thetan.html" title="Thetan">thetan</a> isn't about a "spirit". If "thetan" and "spirit" held the same meaning then LRH wouldn't have taken the time to invent a new word that holds quite a different meaning than what most people think of when they hear the word "spirit". <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 09:07, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Terryeo, I have <i>no doubt at all</i> that you would like it if, every time you made a clearly incorrect edit in flagrant violation of policy (even one you have made twelve times before), any editor wishing to restore the article to the state it was in before you damaged it had to write an essay of at least 500 words on the talk page, giving a detailed explanation of just why your edits violate policy. However, that is not the case. The fact that you were completely aware of articles corresponding to both the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_Thetan_ca0f.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_thetan.html" title="Body thetan">Body thetan</a> subsections of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thetan.html" title="Thetan">Thetan</a> article and yet you tried to remove only <i>one</i> section as "redundant" shows that you are not a well-intentioned editor who actually <i>tries</i> to abide by Wikipedia policy and might correct some form of mistake if his mistake was explained on the talk page but a blatant POV warrior with no intention to edit correctly. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:08, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey, good for you, nice to not have any doubts, huh? Heh. I would like to talk with you though Feldspar because it seems to me we might better understand each other's position if we did. I do understand you have strong and nearly violent reaction to the way I edit. I think we understand basic Wikipedia policies differently and would like to work out a common understanding. Of course we have different beliefs, but I don't think that has anything to do with the different approaches we take to editing.

<dd>"work out our differences"? I highly doubt it. I could do that with an <i>honest</i> editor, but you are not an honest editor, something you proved when you threw allegations at other editors that they violated a policy which <b>you already knew</b> that your <i>interpretation</i> of (the only thing they violated) was and always had been completely mistaken. It isn't a case of "we understand basic Wikipedia policies differently"; it's that I see them as rules we work by to shape our efforts to create a resource of NPOV information and you view them as obstacles to be twisted aside or openly violated so that you can push your POV. It's insulting to me that you think I haven't recognized that by now. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:39, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well Feldspar, where does it start? Don't you think it more productive to spend your time doing something besides reverting my edits without creating anything? It starts by talking. I offer that perhaps we understand Wikipedia policies differently. It is insulting to me that you don't understand that I do understand them. We have similar, if opposite understandings of the same thing and therefore, I would hope, a base to talk to each other from. Agreeing on points of policy might be step we could take toward more productive editing <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 19:05, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Terryeo, it is far too late to pretend that you are an honest editor who has, at worst a "different" "understanding" of what policies mean. That lie was threadbare even <i>before</i> you decided to blatantly violate exactly the same policies which you declared, with a maximum of furor and a minimum of grounds, that <i>others</i> had violated. I realize that you are, for purposes of show, trying to make it look like you are an honest, sincere editor just trying to edit the best you can and that I am the pig-headed stubborn jerk who refuses to re-evaluate my beliefs in the light of new evidence. However, the flaw in this is that there <i>is</i> no new evidence -- none that supports your pretenses. The evidence that you're an insincere POV warrior keeps mounting and mounting. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:56, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, but was it not you who, upon my adding the Catholic Church to the list, went over to the Sahaja Yoga site and added a link to the critical section? If that isn't revenge editing...</p>
<p>I agree with you on that point though, and will research other sources before I re-incluse the Roman Catholic Church to the list.</p>

<dd><i>If that isn't revenge editing...</i> No, it isn't. What happened is that when I saw the surprising addition of Roman Catholicism, with the even more surprising source of the University of Virginia Religious Movements homepage, I checked the source to see if it was accurate. Going through the whole article, I found that it wasn't. I wondered whether there were other entries in the list which also used that source when that source did not actually meet the qualification, so I checked the two entries in question that used that source. In both cases, the source <i>did</i> refer to them as a cult. In the case of the Sahaja Yoga entry, I found the U of V article to not just meet the qualifications for the list, but to be an informative article in its own right, the kind of article we try to link to. Since it was not already an external link from the Sahaja Yoga article, I entered it. That's not "revenge", that's "seeing a way to improve an article, and improving it." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:47, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry to bother you with such a matter, but in the <a href="../../../i/-/9/I-95_exit_list.html" title="I-95 exit list">I-95 exit list</a> page, there was talk about what to do with such a page. After discussion on AFD and in Talk, which can all be accessed on that page, the consensus was <b>no consensus</b>. Myself and many others work on the page to make it presentable and up to Wikistandards, when suddenly <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">User:SPUI</a> comes out of the woodwork after not contributing to talk or any discussion, and decides to make major changes which go against consensus and talk. This is not the problem. In his latest reversion, he claims that this site is a Fork, which I and others disagree with, since the article is not to represent a different POV, but provide a central hub of information (a person may go to the individual <a href="../../../i/-/9/I-95.html" title="I-95">I-95</a> state page for in-depth information about the route, including information, but for multi-state travel, a single page of exit lists provides easy-to-access information that people, such as myself, like to know. It seems that he is just using anything he can to get his way, which he seems to do quite often, including ignoring consensi. So I was just asking if, since you seem to be more knowledgeable about forks, you could review the article and decide if it was a fork or not. I'd appreciate your input and thank you very much. --<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605">MPD01605</a> 23:31, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Vandalism"</span></h2>
<p>I thought your remark on my talk page was uncalled-for. As I explained to ESkog, I described in full my reason for making that change on the <a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_short_selling.html" title="Naked short selling">naked short selling</a> talk page. I agree that using the word "vandalism" was a mistake, but I can't go back and change that so what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>This page has been the subject of an editing war going back weeks, in which a succession of meatpuppets coming in from the outside making a concerted effort to turn that page into a flyer for an "anti-short-selling crusade." Just prior to my arrival, a POV fork, aimed at evading consensue concerning the page, was deleted by administrators. Additionally, the discussion on the Talk page has been invariably ad hominem, and I have been subjected to personal attacks and gotten little support in defending myself.</p>
<p>The change that I reverted was an effort by a new anonymous editor to add original research on a tangential issue with unsourced, one-sided commentary. In the past, such edits have been described by other editors as "near vandalism."</p>
<p>I'm not defending my use of the word "vandalism," which was wrong, but I think the substance of the destructive changes being made to that page is more important than your piling on concerning my incorrect description of a perfectly proper edit. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomstoner_584f.html" title="User:Tomstoner">Tomstoner</a> 14:35, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When did I ever say that? I admitted that the "vandalism" comment was incorrect.
