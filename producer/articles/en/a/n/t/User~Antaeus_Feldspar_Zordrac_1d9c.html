Just so you know. Its actually one hell of a lot worse than implying he is gay."</p>
<p>Zordrac will later pretend that I <i>requested</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Izehar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32102332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Izehar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32102332" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for him to e-mail Daniel Brandt and ask Daniel to do something -- since of course it never happened, the details of what I purportedly requested are vague, existing only within Zordrac's imagination. However, to explore this theory, let us ask, "<i>Assuming</i> that I desired Daniel Brandt to do anything, <i>why</i> would I choose Zordrac as my intermediary?</p>
<p>As we'll see, Zordrac will later claim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> that "before we had communicated", I had made public threats and "wild accusations" against him and claimed to be "watching [him]". If this had been true (rather than a figment of Zordrac's imagination) <i>why</i> on Earth would I select Zordrac to "explain" me (incorrectly) to Daniel Brandt? and <i>why</i> on Earth would he have accepted??</p>
<p>The truth is much simpler: Zordrac wanted to curry the favor of Daniel Brandt and to cause trouble for me; to meet these goals he told Brandt that I was "trying to imply that he was a hypocrite, by using weasel words in an underhanded way to discredit him", and to cause trouble for me, "advised" Brandt that "my" intentions was "defamatory of nature". He then left the above edit on my user talk page to gloat about the trouble he'd caused for me. Only when he realized that his attempt to stir up <i>more</i> trouble between Brandt and Wikipedia editors could backfire on him did he invent the ludicrous story that I had <i>asked him</i> to represent me to Brandt.</p>

I am not the only one who has to explain this to Zordrac; Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters is the victim of the same smears from Zordrac as I am, and puts it succinctly: "going from talk page to talk page for the sole purpose of spreading grossly untrue and insulting accusations against me is really not good behavior." Zordrac continually erases these messages from his talk page, this time with the edit summary "rv yet more vandalism by confessed stalker. sheesh. just asking for a ban".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_Zordrac_1d9c.html" title="Edit section: Zordrac lies about me again">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Zordrac lies about me again</span></h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> 20:36, 24 December 2005 (UTC) Zordrac's claim: "I had never met [Antaeus Feldspar] prior to Daniel Brandt, and indeed, before we had communicated, he threatened me on the Daniel Brandt talk page, and made wild accusations about me, claiming to have been "watching me". He then engaged in an obstructive edit war to try to engage me in it, and when I backed out of it he engaged others in it and repeatedly accused me of things in edits."</p>
<p>Of course, I have never made any threats to Zordrac at all, besides threats to take him through the established procedures (RFC, RfAr) that Wikipedia has for users who commit severe breaches of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> against others, as Zordrac has committed by his lies against me.</p>
<p>However, this particular lie is incredibly easy to demolish. "Before we had communicated" must mean before Zordrac had initiated communication with me by leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31739851&amp;oldid=31670032" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31739851&amp;oldid=31670032" rel="nofollow">this message</a> on my user talk page; that was at 16:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC). At that point, I had edited <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">Talk:Daniel Brandt</a> exactly once, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Daniel_Brandt&amp;diff=31732583&amp;oldid=31718778" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Daniel_Brandt&amp;diff=31732583&amp;oldid=31718778" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> at 14:31, 17 December 2005 (UTC).</p>
<p>Any reasonable person reading this edit can verify that Zordrac's description of it is wholly false: there are no threats; there are no "wild accusations" (unless saying someone "is apparently under some misguided impressions regarding the 'See also' section" or that their "reasoning ... commits at least one major misunderstanding and one major fallacy" now counts as a "wild accusation".) And most notably, there is a complete absence of any claim that I was "watching" him.</p>
<p>As we have just seen, Zordrac is willing to make false claims even when he must realize that anyone can check the history and realize that those claims are wholly false. When Zordrac claims "he then engaged in an obstructive edit war to try and engage me in it", it must be taken in this context: even when it comes to <i>objective</i> and <i>verifiable</i> facts, Zordrac cannot be trusted to tell even the truth as he knows it. Can his word be taken at any higher value about who caused an "edit war"? Clearly not.</p>
<p>As for "repeatedly accused me of things in edits", examination of the facts shows that Zordrac <i>did</i> in fact knowingly <i>do</i> those things. He cannot now complain that the consequence of what he himself chose to do is some sort of unthinkable offense against him; he chose to lie about other editors, and now he faces the consequences of those lies.</p>

<p>Zordrac repeats his previous false accusations against me, and denies that he ever made false accusations against me at User:Zordrac/Poetlister: "there are ZERO lies in there, and the article is NOT about you." However, here is what Zordrac claims about me at that page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>08:16, 23 December 2005 <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a>, wrote to Zordrac supporting Lulu and implying that they both would stalk Zordrac until either he stopped trying to get Poetlister's ban reversed, or else was banned from Wikipedia. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is the actual contents of that diff (reprinted here for convenience):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Correction, Zordrac: you did not "help me out", you deliberately tried to incite trouble for me, and then you lied like a cheap rug about it, actually claiming that I <i>asked</i> you to put words into my mouth. I really, <i>really</i> hope you're enough of an idiot to file that RfAr because when you do I will bury you with all the evidence of your lying. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:46, 22 December 2005 (UTC)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>As anyone can see, Zordrac's very specific and detailed accusations against me are completely at odds with the actual evidence he presents: there is not one word about Lulu, not one word about Poetlister, not one word about anyone's ban. There is just, again, a clear and firm announcement that Zordrac is continuing to tell lies damaging to my reputation and that if he forces this to a head <i>he</i> will be the one who regrets it, since all the evidence shows how knowingly false and malicious those lies are.</p>
