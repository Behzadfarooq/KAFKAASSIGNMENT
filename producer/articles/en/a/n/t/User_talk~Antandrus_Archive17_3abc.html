<dd>Hum. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Renaissance_composers_a03a.html" title="List of Renaissance composers">List of Renaissance composers</a> seems to be arranged by "first" name, without regard to quality of name. I guess since I'm not willing to re-order the entire freaking list right now, I should just follow that somewhat random ordering? <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 01:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <i>hate</i> that ordering. Somebody just went and did it and I let it go with a sigh and a "whatever." I think it should be by date, like it used to be, or at least by century and surname (though as you get back beyond the 16th century, you have to decide if a "surname" is significant or not). It could also be by century and geographic region (Italy, Portugal, Spain, Low Countries, Burgundy ... but even <i>that</i> gets <i>really</i> complicated in the 15th and 16th centuries) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 01:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should do it by social-security number! ...maybe not. I think birth year might be best. I think with countries/areas we might get some annoying POV pushing and fighting. Maybe not, but whenever you put country in the mix you can get some surprising results. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 01:33, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Antandrus,</p>
<p>You recently showed some interest with the user message and template harmonistion program. We will be starting the actual changes, we hope within the next week. But prior to that, what we would like from yourself is instead of an evening of vandal fighting or patrolling recent changes, you monitor the RC page for those actually doing the reverts and leaving user page messages. This may involve red wine as you see fit, I'll be quaffing a glass or two for certain this evening. We would like to make as many people aware of the fact that the templates they use are going to change. If you could seek out the RCP's and Cut n Paste the following message to their talk page that would be appreciated, or reworded as you see fit. Cheers. <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b>Khukri</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khukri_f113.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 09:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<i>==Upcoming template changes==</i></p>
<p><i>Hi, I've just noticed that you recently left a templated userpage message. I'm just bringing to your attention that the format and context of these templates will be shortly changing. It is recommended that you visit [[WP:UW|WikiProject user warnings]] and harmonisation discussion [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_user_warnings/templates|pages]] to find out how these changes could affect the templates you use. We also would appreciate any insights or thoughts you may have on the subject. Thanks for your understanding. Best regards ~~~~</i></p>

<p>Ok, my grandmother just sent me <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songs_from_the_Labyrinth_5585.html" title="Songs from the Labyrinth">Songs from the Labyrinth</a>. It's really...weird. It's almost not terrible. I mean, I think it might not be terrible. Then again, it might be. The lutenist has his moments, but I'm really opposed to the multi-tracking of Sting's voice in stuff like "Fine knacks for ladies", it's really just creepy sounding. I don't really understand that. Do people really think they are so good that they need to sing every part? Why? I also don't understand the spoken bits. Paul Hillier does that on some of his recordings as well. I guess they're supposed to give a feeling of mileu... but once again it just sounds to me like someone likes to hear themself too much. Sting's vowels are really strange, I can't quite put my finger on it. I guess part of it is that he lengthens all the diphthongs and uses reflexive rrrrs. Basically, I really do think Dowland's music was meant for singers whose voices were singer-ly, although it's hard to know what that really meant at the time, but Sting definitely sounds like he's been smoking a few packs of cigarettes. I'm also not particularly excited by his text interpretation, although I can imagine a lot worse. Really, it's just weird. Weird that he did it, weird that my grandmother sent it to me, and weird that I'm listening to it. I'm not hating it as much as I expected though, although I did hope for a little more original text interpretation or something.</p>

<dd>Very very interesting. I think what's admirable is just that people take risks like that; most of the time the results will be crappy, but it's good to see the creativity at work; once in a while a "crossover" artist does something worth hearing. Do you remember a recording the Hilliard Ensemble did a few years ago -- lovely Renaissance polyphony, and then after a minute or so a soprano saxophone starts improvising? The first time I heard it I thought someone had turned my TV on in the background. Oh, and didn't Linda Ronstadt record opera arias once? (iirc, it was ghastly) And then there's <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_Foster_Jenkins_473d.html" title="Florence Foster Jenkins">Florence Foster Jenkins</a> ... but she wasn't a pop sensation I suppose. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 23:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose it's good to take risks. I'm not sure about Florence Foster Jenkins, though... I think maybe she was just delusional. Oh dear, I just listened to one track where it sounds like he's beating his archlute (looks more like a theorbo, but whatever) with a large heavy stick. Also, he committed what I think is sacrilege to "Flow my tears" by having the lute come in about three measures late. I don't think I've heard the Hilliard ensemble/sax album. Which one was it? It's nice that a wider audience might hear Dowland, I just wish that they could hear it done a bit better. Better doesn't have to mean more traditionally, but frankly I expected him to add a bit of excitement and energy to songs which have a tendency to become rather languid and sleepy in the wrong hands, but he only managed to make them sleepier, and then cruelly abuse his instrument (it's not being beaten in a nice way-I can hear it crying)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, so I sort of doubled back on myself, calling his treatment of "Flow my tears" sacrilege while wanting him to do something more exciting. I don't know what to say about that, except that "Flow my tears" is one of the more perfect songs ever created, and it's silly to mess its basic structure unless you're going to do something really awesome, which he didn't. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 23:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Poor lute.

I just noticed that Wikipedia has an article on the Philip K. Dick <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flow_My_Tears%2C_The_Policeman_Said_08f0.html" title="Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said">novel</a> based on it, but not on the song itself. What???

<dd>Don't know if I'd even be here, if it weren't for Alfred Deller; he was one of the first "early music" singers I'd ever heard, and one of the most impressive. We've come a long way, in interpretation of old music, since then, but still some of those early recordings are amazing. (Don't bother with his <a href="../../../p/%C3%A9/r/P%C3%A9rotin.html" title="Pérotin">Pérotin</a> though.) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 12:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah yes, I do have a certain place in my heart for Deller, as well as Purcell, of course&#160;:) So, on the subject of the redlink, I think I'm going to write an article, and I can't decide whether to have it at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flow_my_tears.html" title="Flow my tears">Flow my tears</a> or at <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lachrimae.html" title="Lachrimae">Lachrimae</a> and have it be a bit broader in focus. <small>when I was looking it up in Grove, I made a typo and wrote "Flow my teats"&#160;:P</small>. Also, I'm trying to decide whether the recording from my recital is good enough to post. People have done it worse, but people (including myself) have done it far better. Maybe I can upload it here secretly, and you guys can tell me whether you think it's worth it. (i.e. whether this particular not-so-great version is better than none) <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:20, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say "Flow my tears" and have "Lachrimae" as a redirect (specially as Sting seems to have listed it as "Flow my tears", which is now what most people will expect). If you want to use me as a preview for the recording, that fine by me. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 17:24, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I believe the name of the song is properly "Flow, my tears, fall from your springs", but "Lachrimae" is a book he published later, as well as a number of instrumental pieces based on "Flow, my tears". I'll put up a link if I can convert the recording and upload it. I'll do it here rather than on commons so I can delete it if necessary&#160;:P <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:33, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh! It doesn't have any categories at the moment. Argh. And of course all of the categories are based on pop music, rather than art music, and the WikiProject song people are probably going to give me grief anyway, and want to put an infobox on it. Ok, I'm really whiny today. If a good category occurs to you, stick it in there.

<dd>It's a good question. You know, we don't have all that many articles on individual compositions from the Renaissance (and earlier) -- and I think we should. For example I'm considering redlinking <i>every</i> piece in Josquin's works list and writing articles on them (feeling a little like Kafka's <a href="../../../a/_/h/A_Hunger_Artist_c1e9.html" title="A Hunger Artist">Hunger Artist</a>, but oh well). Start with a cat lute songs, then compositions by John Dowland, maybe. Anyway I'm glad we have the article now. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 01:33, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! I made a comment on the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippine</a> talk page, but I've thought of re-posting it here...anyway, I would just like to ask why "Goldilocks" was removed in the section about Filipino culture. There is a real <a href="http://www.goldilocks.com" class="external text" title="http://www.goldilocks.com" rel="nofollow">Goldilocks</a> fastfood/bakeshop chain here in the Philippines (just like <a href="../../../j/o/l/Jollibee.html" title="Jollibee">Jollibee</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Pizza_4142.html" title="Greenwich Pizza">Greenwich</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chowking.html" title="Chowking">Chowking</a>), and it's found in most major cities in the Philippines.

And most children's party here in the Philippines usually have cakes that were ordered from Goldilocks. If an article (even if only a stub) needs to be created for this, I'll be happy to start researching about Goldilocks. --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 21:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Admin Coaching, now being coordinated by <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">HighwayCello</a>, is a program for people who want help learning some of the more subtle aspects of Wikipedia policy and culture. People are matched with experienced users who are willing to offer coaching. The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.</p>

<p>A number of socks appeared during the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brad_Hines_2414.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brad Hines">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brad Hines</a> affair. I tagged them and made an <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Utzchips_5ec2.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Utzchips">evidence page</a>. To me, they were obvious, however, the reviewing admin archived the evidence page with the note "This should be taken to WP:RFCU."</p>
<p>I am a little reluctant to take the case to RFCU because the top of the page asks "<b>Does your request belong here?</b> and gives guidelines for the answer:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obvious, disruptive sock puppet Block. No checkuser is necessary.</dd>
<dd>Disruptive "throwaway" account used only for a few edits Block. No checkuser is necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I may have given too much evidence on the evidence page, or the admin may have been confused by my inclusion of a meatpuppet on the evidence page (unnecessarily because the account was blocked anyway) , or it may be that there are special reasons for RFCU that I don't understand in this case. I left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKilo-Lima&amp;diff=85844342&amp;oldid=85835166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKilo-Lima&amp;diff=85844342&amp;oldid=85835166" rel="nofollow">this note</a> with the reviewing admin, but have not heard back, and he/she seems to be off line. My question is, how I should proceed. Should I file RFCU? If I do take it to RFCU, which code shoud I use? Should I instead refile an evidence page with the "obviousness" highlighted and the one meatpuppet removed from the list? Could you just review the evidence and block? (For the executive summary of the case, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKilo-Lima&amp;diff=85844342&amp;oldid=85835166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKilo-Lima&amp;diff=85844342&amp;oldid=85835166" rel="nofollow">this note</a>).

<p>from Kartcrazy in reply to your message on my talk page</p>
<p><br />
Hi, the information was passed to me by my friend who is a semi-retired historian. He would have made the entry for wikipedia himself but he isnt really the computer type of person. I added a basic version of everything he had found out about Heinz Oberlinger to wikipedia. Hopefully I can find the time to add some more detailed information soon.</p>
<p>My friend and other historians have found the information by piecing together old pieces of scripture he found on a dig near the battle site. His main find was a box, in which were letters to and from Heinz Oberlinger, well preserved considering how long ago it was, certainly able to be read from. On translation is gave a rough describtion of him, tall, strong etc. The letters mention several times his agreement with Arminius, although unfortunatly, from the letter he couldnt establish the exact time when the agreement was formed. It detailed his plans for the battle and a few tactics he might employ. Whether he carried those particular tactics out or not, will hopefully become apparent soon as more evidence is still being dicovered, however these things if researched properly do take time. His name, which admittedly I haven't seen written down yet, was also included in the letters. I made an anglicised version of his name spelt phonetically. That was probably an error on my part, maybe im not cut out to be a historian.</p>
<p>I would assume you are writing this as you cannot find any references to it in any historical books. My friend is currently writing his own book on the entire subject but heinz oberlinger was his most major find, as I believe no one has ever discovered any mention of him before! Certainly he is never mentioned in any of the books i've read. It's got us quite excited I can tell you, we won't stop talkoing about anything else lol! Of course if you find any refences to him can you please let me know asap as both of us are quite keen on finding out what really happened and whatever refences, no matter how small, may well fill in a gap in the puzzle.</p>
<p>I put the information on wikipedia as I felt that, as the book isnt really progressing that fast, I should make a heavily abriged version to let people know the basic facts now rather than waiting for the whole book to be published. And also, to be honest, I think more people would read it if it was on wikipedia I was thinking that I could slowly add more information to the page as we got it, maybe a section about the evidence we've found and a section on what we think might have happened and perhaps a section on what we know for certain.</p>
<p>Out of interest is it within the rules to put a link to how to buy the book when it is eventually published on the heinz oberlinger page?</p>
<p>Sorry i've seemed to have gone on for ages, glad to see you're interested in my friends findings. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kartcrazy (<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKartcrazy_92ef.html" title="User talk:Kartcrazy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kartcrazy_dd3f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kartcrazy">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

Look, the research is currently being carried out, he is currently documenting the evidence. I wrote the jist of what I understood from my friends phone message. I now understand that is not in the rules as it is original research and isn't in writing yet. I origianally wrote it as an unlinked page as the information was still due to be verified and I could add to it at my own pace but I was asked to put a link in which i did. By doing this it released the information too early, obviously a mistake. However I do not appriciate being called a hoax! I do not just make things up to delibratly mislead people! I also do not appriciate being laughed at before you even know half of what you need to pass judgement! I know my friend has put a lot of work into this and to judge it before you even know the facts is unforgivable. I merely gave the information he has gathered so far. There are many explanations for the evidence being found, some are crazy and some more sensible, if what you are saying is true then perhaps our early theory is wrong or perhaps i mis-understood (more likely.) Possibly there was another battle near there and the two men were drawing paralels between the two battles. I dont't know, Im not a historian, my friend is! When he knows for sure I'll tell you. Translating old languages is very hard indeed! He's sending it to a proper expert soon.</p>
<p>I will definitely inform you when my friends book is going to be published! Kartcrazy <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKartcrazy_92ef.html" title="User talk:Kartcrazy">(talk)</a></p>

<dd>Fair enough, I won't laugh at you. I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> that you have a "friend" who told you he dug something up at the site of the Battle of Teutoberg Forest. However listen to me: the earliest datable inscriptions in the German language are from several hundred years after that battle, and they are runes inscribed on metal: helmets, scabbards, brooches, fragmentary, and usually just single words. At the time of the battle, there is no reliable evidence that the Germans had written language at all, and they certainly weren't writing letters that they were burying in boxes. So your friend is pulling your leg. All right?

<dd>Hi, thanks for your thoughts. Regarding one-off accounts, I think the usual practice is just to block them. In this case, I think they just fell through the cracks. Regarding using RFCU to "out" the user, the only pay-off I see is this. Rather than having a bunch of "suspected sockpuppets of so-and-so" we would have a bunch of "confirmed sockpuppets of so-and-so". As mentioned before, these accounts are usually blocked anyway, and the puppet master has the right to remove the tag from his/her userpage after ten days. So it would seem that RFCU would really have value only if the puppetmaster causes trouble again, and denies that he/she caused trouble before. RFCU seems to be intended be used sparingly and as a last resort, and I'm not convinced the folks there would approve of RFCU "in case" the puppetmaster is abusive again. So, I don't intend to start a discussion on the RFCU page. (That, and I already have a number of discussions on my plate as it is). You of course are welcome to start such a discussion. I thank you again for your advice, and for the time you spent looking over the case. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 03:02, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Funny, I was just about to tell you I had created a highly POV stub on this, and that you should promptly dive in and take all the POV out. I too find it intensely moving...in fact I have created in my own failing brain a list of pieces that pack that kind of punch in seven minutes or less. This is the one that got me thinking along those lines; I also include the only piece by Arnold that I really like, A Survivor from Warsaw. There sure aren't many others.

<p>The article <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_Tech_Inc._48a0.html" title="Sleep Tech Inc.">Sleep Tech Inc.</a> was nominated for deletion by <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">User:Kinu</a> on Nov 11 but I dont think he followed the correct procudure for nomination so it doesnt seam to have its AFD discussion page (I cant find it anyway:). An anon subsequently deleted the template and when I was on RC patrol I reverted the deletion. The user who created the article <a href="../../../m/g/a/User%7EMgarnes2_ae2e.html" title="User:Mgarnes2">User:Mgarnes2</a> contacted me and said he wants to keep it but I'm not exatcly sure what to do cos I cant find the AFD nomination.

<dd>Well, perhaps this is just my POV sticking its nose in, but I don't like drive-by nationality changes, declaring that someone is nationality A and anyone who says otherwise is an idiot. I don't find a single-wrod description of nationality for international composers to be all that edifying anyway, so I'd personally prefer to keep it just with the longer description. Whichever. I think I'm just going to leave it alone, although it does bug me that the anon seems to have gotten their way by edit warring, and has not left a single message on the talk page, despite being asked several times. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 23:42, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oy, that Esperanza thing. Yet another of those periodic giant train-wrecks. It's deviated far from its original intent and become more of a social club than anything else, but I'm inclined to just leave it alone, since voting delete does more harm than good (in terms of making hard feelings) and the active members have already gotten the hint it needed reform. I signed up myself when it first appeared, but never really thought of a way to use the organization in any helpful way. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 02:50, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict! again!) Yes, that's always my concern when things like this crop up. It's hard to balance things which are of no use to the 'pedia, but make people who are ostensibly contributing to it feel happier, against things which are simply a distraction from the 'pedia, since they can look like the same thing. I think people should feel good about working on the encyclopedia, and should be allowed and encouraged to work on side projects and tangential things, but I don't think that people who are simply here to myspace in a wiki-format should use another site. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 03:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes... I use the same philosophy I use at work, managing a lot of people: it's fine with me to see people chatting, even playing solitaire, goofing off, surfing the internet, playing youtube videos, --as long as they are also, and mostly, good productive members of my division. When goofing off is all they do, it's time for them to go. Here, if all a user does is yak in the "coffee lounge" or fill user pages with boxen, or invent yet more frilliferous signatures, but contributes nothing to article space, that person needs to be shown the door politely. After multiple suggestions. I think that Esperanza is just a place people go to goof off now, and if we delete it there will just be another thing like it appearing: people are people everywhere and need a "social space", but within the project itself. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 03:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The problem really comes, as I see it, when Esperanza becomes one of many possible cabals, with active members supporting each other for adminship, in deletion debates, etc. Esperanza is unlikely to become "Teh Cabal", but I can easily see it becoming a small cabal-ish entity. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 03:29, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm, interesting point. On a related note, it always tweaks my suspicion-meter when I see too many successive&#160;!voters with excessively frilly signatures, wherever it is, especially if I haven't heard of most of them before. I don't really know where we should draw the boundary between goof-off-clubs/mini-cabals, and respecting the normal human need for a place to gather and chat. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 03:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, I noticed that you said lots of things link to it, yet nothign links there when i clicked the link you provided, and from there the 'what links here' link. You should probably update the link on the admin board to reflect the accurate name of the missing file, so a follow-up can be done? <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 18:41, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm, if only you can find a review somewhere that says that ... every once in a while when I'm feeling cantankerous I open up Slonimsky's <i>Lexicon of Musical Invective</i> and add a few choice bits like that. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel like attempting to record something. Got any suggestions/requests? I've only got me, at the moment, so it has to be solo. I should see if I can find a review of that Sting thing, I think there have been some, but they mostly say "Whoah! Who knew!? Dowland! First Singer-Songwriter!" (clearly Sting needs to bone up on his music history, but whatever) <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 05:11, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you every try multi-tracking? It would be great to have usable recordings of, say, Le Jeune chansons for high voices ...&#160;:) (now you're sorry you asked ...

<dd>Hm. As cool as I think mindspillage sounds on her multi-tracked bassoon, I tend to find multi-tracked voices creepy. See the above Sting thread. I might experiment with it, though, just to check out if I can do it. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 05:45, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh! I like multi-tracked voices. I do think it loses something to have all one voice rather than several different colors, but you should still definitely try it. (Says she who enjoys singing with herself, badly.) The <a href="http://cpdl.org" class="external text" title="http://cpdl.org" rel="nofollow">Choral Public Domain Library</a> has some interesting things to try singing through, if you're stuck for ideas. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 07:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
