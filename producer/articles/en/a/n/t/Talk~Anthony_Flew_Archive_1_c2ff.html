<h2><span class="mw-headline">Older talk</span></h2>
<p>I find this article about Flew very very very light in substance pertaining to the man himself and more about his recent position. Can we have some input on why should we should give more weight to Flew's position than that of Pamela Anderson...</p>
<hr />
<p>I find it amusing that there is such a strong desire/need among certain people to constantly support the fact that Anthony Flew now believes in God with it not being the God of Christianity. His belief or disbelief in the God of Christianity is entirely irrelevant. It is either stated to not let this occurrence inflate the heads of Christians or to not let it cause panic in the minds of atheists. Since I believe that most God believing Christians will believe in their God regardless of how Flew feels on the matter (considering the fact they maintained that belief while he was a committed atheist); I therefore feel that the latter is the ulterior reason this occurs. Regardless of how one feels on this, it would be bordering on inane to assume that Flew's recent change would be a step further away from the Christian's notion of God. If one is willing to admit that there exists such a hightened degree of complexity in something so seemingly simple that there must be a God to account for this vast amount of information; why would it be the case that that God who was concerned enough to 'create' such complexity is not concerned enough to care about the creation as a whole? timL</p>

<p>In regards to these Christian websites that were posting on-line about Flew converting to Christianity can we have some proof of this or some links to these pages? I've heard this sentiment stated time and time again, but I still have yet to find one of those articles myself; an article (by Christians) stating that Flew has converted to Christianity. Are you trying to build up a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many people online refer to "rumors that he had converted to christianity" a few years back. I can't find any, either, even in newsgroups. but several people refer to them. Maybe they are just rumors of rumors... The article I pointed to says that they occurred in 2001 and 2003. - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 16:14, Dec 31, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I wrote to the author of that article, and he says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The rumors appeared (to my knowledge) in email lists and email grapevines. That was so long ago I can't recall exactly where, but everyone started calling and emailing me about it, so apparently someone was saying this, and a heck of a lot of people all over the country and beyond were hearing it. How it could have spread so widely as to result in so much diverse inquiry escapes me--I suppose it may have been all over bulletin boards of the time, but who knows. You might try some Google-like searches of a wayback site (there are a few like that where old web pages are archived) to see where it was discussed in bulletin boards, but most of that data will be lost (even BBS's themselves rarely keep archives beyond a year). At the very least you should be able to find discussions of the Flew article from 2001.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, as far as I know, there was no official publication, online or print, making the assertion in either of those two years. I just kept being asked about it by all manner of people from all over the world (India, New Zealand, England, and the U.S. are the only nationalities I recall inquiring). How they all came across it, I don't know. I just went straight to the source--it didn't really matter to me at the time where it originated, nor did I think I could find out with my limited resources."</dd>

</dl>
<p>I am somewhat concerned about that being stated as well. I have performed some google searches that might direct me to sites where Christian (or Muslim) organizations are saying that Flew converted to their conception of God; however, those searches have not been successful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>He also said (I don't know if he realizes he can add his comments directly to this page by pressing the edit button.):</dd>

<dd>"'I have performed some google searches that might direct me to sites where Christian (or Muslim) organizations are saying that Flew converted to their conception of God; however, those searches have not been successful.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is true--no one has gone on record claiming that Flew has become a Christian, for example--at least not to my knowledge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But Flew's conversion to deism is still being touted by theists as proving their case now on national television (Faith Under Fire on PAX, the episode with Moreland and Tabash, aired a month or two ago), in peer reviewed print publications (the Habermas-Flew interview in Philosophia Christi, already available online) and national press releases (various ones have appeared in print, including the Seattle Times, and these are also available online)."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>--Yes, but Omegatron, part of the theists claim is involved in the deists understanding of God. If the deist wants to state that God does exist, and that God's interaction with creation is only that God created it (to whatever extent that maybe), then that notion is enveloped in part of the theist's understanding of God. The theist elborates on that by saying that God is concerned with its creation. So Flew moving from atheism to deism is very significant for a theist, because it involves part of the theist's understanding of God as well. It might not prove their case, but I certainly feel it provides support to one of their main tenants in their conception of a creator. I'm confused as to why one would be shocked that theist's are making comments about this turn of events, as well as their perceived implications of it.TimL</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His version of deism explicitly denies the involvement of god in creation, so theism is not an "elaboration" on it. Apparently... His claims about conversion to deism or theism seem rather shaky. I see quotes that sound like both. The article linked too says he basically isn't sure yet, as of December 2004. Regardless, he clearly states that his idea of a god or prime mover is not related at all to the God of the Christians or Muslims. I added direct quotes and toned it down a little. Is that neutral enough? - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 01:09, Jan 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>---Thanks for the clarification on that. I was interpreting deism as the notion of a God creating the universe and then abandoning it; not being concerned with the creation and not revealing its nature to its creation either. Taking the 1st part of that (God creating the universe) and then viewing theism as having that as one of its main foundational beliefs. I can understand how he might be concerned if some people with their own special interests are extrapolating this to a more theistically centered idea of God. However, I still feel the jump from atheism to deism would hold some significance for a theist.TimL---</p>
<p>If one person in particular is trying to bend the reality of Flew's "conversion" to adhere to their notion of God, that's one thing; but that "one thing" is not very interesting. Numerous people do that with various other topics not related to theistic or atheist mindsets. But I don't think it is appropriate for stigma to befall the Muslim or the Christian faith practices as a whole because of an individual's brash comments. And to reiterate, Antony Flew's recent change (whether deism or nominal theism) is certainly a large step away from atheism and a step closer towards the ideas of a personal, concern God.TimL</p>
<hr />
<p>I apologize if I've misunderstood any of this discussion or misattribute anything. The formatting here is somewhat difficult to follow.</p>
<p>I believe that the sentence</p>
<p><i>Flew now believes that God does exist, with the aid of recent finding in <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> research</i></p>
<p>is perhaps too strong. But it doesn't much matter. Flew certainly has rejected atheism at least in part because he believes there can be no natrualistic explanation of the origin from DNA of a reproducing organism.</p>
<p>I think it's interesting that the media seems to report at least annually for the past few years that Flew has rejected atheism. But he has, there's not much about that. What's unclear is what it is he believes now. Unfortunately, he hasn't provided much help in figuring that out.</p>
<p>I have not seen anyone suggest that Flew has converted to Christianity, but there are people like <a href="http://wittingshire.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://wittingshire.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">this guy</a> who has blogged quite a bit about Flew's "conversion," the suggestion being that deism is the first step towards accepting Christ as one's personal savior.</p>
<p>It's not. And there are many forms of deism - Spinoza's, for example - which are utterly incompatible with any form of theism. There's no reason to say that Flew's conversion to deism should give any comfort to theists. Or there wouldn't be if Flew himself hadn't been so confused about what it is he believes. [[---What's more incompatible with any form of theism? His notion of deism (deism defined as an entity that created the universe..something which theists also believe) or his previous atheism (negating the existence of God). Flew, stating that there is a God to make sense of the abundance of information at a microscopic level (indicating that purely naturalistic means can't account for this information) seems to be pretty much in-line (at least in respects to this one issue) with how theists feel. So please explain again why his conversion to deism should give no comfort to theists.---]] The discussion with Habermas is just sad. Flew in one breath denies the possibility of immanence and in the next says that he is open to divine revelation.</p>
<p>I haven't yet found anything by Flew in which he discusses what you'd naturally think he'd discuss, like the usual (his own!) objections to the teleological and cosmological arguments.</p>
<p>Really, all we know of what Flew now believes is that he is no longer an atheist but is not a Christian.</p>

<p>Sorry for the top-posting, but we are suffering from vandalism. User 66.91.226.222 is a con man named Jason Gastrich, a self-described internet evangelist, and he's the one changing everything from NPOV on Flew to GPOV (Gastrich Point of View.)</p>

<dd>A few points. It is confusing that you haven't timestamped this - please use the four tildes method to get an automatic timed signature. Please do not call POV edits 'vandalism': we have policy against POV, which is perfectly adequate. Please note that most Wikipedians respect anonymity of those who post here. And finally, having added a POV dispute tag, please could you get specific about what you object to in the <i>current</i> page. Tagging should not be used in a generalised, threatening way, but to flag changes needed that cannot be brought to consensus through extended talk page discussion. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 15:51, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took out the NPOV warning. This is an upcoming revert war though, and will need to be dealt with. I don't object to the current page. I object to the twice modified page I, and someone else, reverted from. You're right, NPOV isn't the correct term to use, but a revert war is coming between everyone else and 66.91.226.222. As for the anonymity, this is part of a personal crusade on the part of 66.91.226.222, who even included a link to his webpage about Flew (Left Atheism, Now Theist! God Exists!)

<dd>Page protection is an extreme measure. As a page participant I am anyway barred from doing that. I don't like the 'supporter of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a>' phrase; I preferred it when neither atheism nor theism were mentioned in the lead, because I am still not clear what legitimately can be said on Flew and theism. Some of what is in the Current section may check out, as may what has been added about the forthcoming 'Prometheus' book.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it comes down to this: WP can't clarify Flew's position more than he himself clarifies it. I added 35+ book titles, which gives some perspective. The atheism debates go back to the mid-1980s, it seems.</dd>
