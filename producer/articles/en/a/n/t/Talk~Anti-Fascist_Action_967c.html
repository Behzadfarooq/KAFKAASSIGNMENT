<p>This article looks to contain some "straw man" efforts by far-right editors to discredit the anti-fascist movement - most notably in the supposed "AFA logo" at the top of the article and the caption for it. Looking on Google, I find this logo only features in the article in the external links section and there is no evidence it is official. I am removing it. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 17:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That logo was not invented by far right conspirators. That logo has appeared in ant-racist publications as an official logo of AFA (at least the British AFA). Just one quick example is The "Fuck Fascism" EP by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oppressed_48bc.html" title="The Oppressed">The Oppressed</a>, which is an official SHARP/AFA release.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 17:42, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Writing as a former member of AFA in the UK, I agree with Spylab: that logo was certainly used by AFA in the 1990s. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 17:08, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is also definately the case that AFA members were heavily involved in IWCA, whether or not latter is "soft on racism". By the way, great editing work Spylab! My only objection would be removal of links to Rolan Adams, Anti-Racist Alliance, Youth Against Racism in Europe, Workers Against Racism and Cable Street Beat. Even if those don't yet have wiki pages, they should! <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 17:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>"This article looks to contain some "straw man" efforts by far-right editors to discredit the anti-fascist movement"</i> Noone needs to discredit the antifascist movement. They are discredited by themselves. I once saw an antifa poster saying that "Greek means murderer". I didn't removed that poster. I left there so that people can see how disgusting antifa's beliefs are. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsos_26c7.html" title="User:Mitsos">Mitsos</a> 19:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, they're not "different groups". AFA UK and AFA Sweden are different groups, but they are both named "Anti-Fascist Action" in English. But if a disambiguation is not the solution, perhaps a merging? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 18:17, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A disamb page can't disambiguate to non-existant pages can it? But I understand why Jobjörn did this. There is something odd about the current page, as it is not clear whether we are looking at one international organisation (or closely related family of organisations) or at several different organisations. Were the non-UK AFAs copies of or branches of UK AFA? I don't think they were, which makes me wonder if they should all be on the same page. There isn't, say, a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_6b46.html" title="Socialist Party">Socialist Party</a> page which looks at all the parties with this name. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 16:22, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 'Antifa' is not one single international organisation, it's just a general term describing political groups that dedicate their time and efforts to fighting fascism and neo-nazis. The means and methods are as diverse as the groups involved, so it's hard to lay down characteristics of an 'Antifa' group. As for the non-UK Antifa groups being copies.. no. In Germany, the term Antifa goes back to the 1920's ("Antifaschistische Aktion"), to the era of frequent fights between communist and nazi streetgangs. In the 1980's, with a resurgence of Neonazism in Germany (and especially after the Reunification), Antifa groups reappeared again. This was in no way connected to the UK, and I would dare say the same about Swedens Antifa, for instance. I know of ties between german, dutch, and scandinavian antifa groups - british antifa groups don't play a role in these networks though. Ok sorry, random ramblings really..

<p><b>Oppose</b> - I don't see why we have to even discuss this. They are two different organisations (one in the UK and one in Sweden). // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>

In fact, I'm not sure the title of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifascistisk_Aktion_db8e.html" title="Antifascistisk Aktion">Antifascistisk Aktion</a> should be in Swedish: <a href="../../../s/v/e/Sveriges_Arbetares_Centralorganisation_38c4.html" title="Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation">Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation</a> was renamed, why shouldn't AFA?

<p>Anti-Facist Action in the UK was a distinct organisation which only had very loose contacts with some groups in the rest of Europe. It seems to me that the only real connection with other organisations listed in these articles is that at the lowest common denominator they are all anti-fascist. AFA (UK) should have it's own page.

<blockquote>
<p>Various elements of AFA from the anarchist movement and non politically affiliated members did not agree with Red Action's policy of renouncing street violence as a tactic against nazis. Many also felt the IWCA could not operate as a democratic body, due to their experience of Red Action's notoriously autocratic leadership style in AFA. After either leaving AFA or being expelled due to Red Actions political machinations, various ex-members continued to operate well into the nineties under the name No Platform.</p>
