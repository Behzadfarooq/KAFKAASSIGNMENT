<p>Hi, what did you expect would happen following your blanking of the disendorsements page? Did you think that everyone would immediately have nothing negative to say about anyone anymore?! --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 13:30, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not expect anything really special to happen. I mostly wanted to see what would be done, in particular if editors would proceed in the way of criticizing editors in such a disastrous way. In short, I did something that anyone could do, or could reverse, which was done.</p>
<p>However, I think that maintaining a list to only put criticism on people is just such a poor move it should just not exist. I think it is forgetting that most editors on Wikipedia are people giving hours of personal time in a common goal and in good faith.</p>
<p>In a community, there are enough reasons to be in disagreement, and enough reasons to get mad at each other, that setting a public list only to say "this person is just plain bad and plain wrong" is an extremely destructive idea in the long run. I absolutely do not support the idea.</p>
<p>Incidently, I find quite interesting that so unwikilove comments are left in this page, while my own comments were censored. I would suggest that the editor who censored me either restores part of my comments or that he apologizes to me.</p>
<p>In all cases, I never involve myself in english wikipedia policies. However, since I was asked to approve the current procedure for election of AC, I consider it is part of board activities to be involved in this case. And the procedure did not involve such a page.</p>
<p>It would be very seriously wrong to claim I prevent people to say negative comments about others. I made comments on the talk page on that topic. I have voiced myself enough criticism of some editors in 3 years not to claim voicing criticism is bad and should not be done&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Consequently, I have a constructive suggestion to make&#160;:-) Since on one hand some people want this page dedicated to criticism, and on the other hand, this page is not part of the procedure, what about keeping that page, but not as a subpage of the AC election&#160;?</p>

<p>Think yourself lucky only to be called a vandal. He accused me of election fraud. However I don't think Xed is a troll in the usual sense of the word. I honestly dont think he knows what he is doing. He is the brightest of people and simple assumes that if anyone does anything that he disagrees with then it's perfectly acceptable for him to say the first thing that comes into his head. He never backs down, even when clearly in the wrong, so there is no point in trying to reason with him I'm afraid. Fortunately for the most part, eveyone just ignores him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(The snott rake)</a> 09:55, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hummm&#160;?</p>
<p>This place is really populated by strange people&#160;;-)<br />
Okay... I will only put him on the ignore list then.<br />
What is a bit problematic in such cases, is that if old participants know of these types of personalities, they can avoid or ignore those. But I believe a newbie could be pretty much discouraged in participating to Wikipedia by such a person.</p>
<p>You know what I find real tough Theresa&#160;? Since I basically do not have any more time to participate to the english wikipedia, there are many many people I just do not know now. When I read the anti-endorsment page, I can guess that most participants to it are not amongst our best elements, but I am just not sure. Because in most cases, I do not know these people. Or if I do, it is only by earsay, not primary experience.</p>
<p>This is essentially the experience of a newbie. And the experience is tough, because when you navigate in policy discussion pages, you can find many of those often unpleasant personalities. And most of them are specifically involved in those pages. If you are a newbie, or just dropping by from time to time, you have no idea of the weight and quality of each person and general respect for it, and it makes it a rather uncomfortable experience.</p>
<p>I realise two things. First how much a web of trust might help, even though a web of trust might have bad consequences in excluding personalities which are important elements but often difficult to deal with. Second, that in dealing with Foundation issues, how lucky we are that basically all those involved are really good people. Even though we may not agree all the time, all involved do their best and they want to do the best.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for your comment&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Hi Anthere, how have you been. It's been a while since we have communicated. Here is the blurb I am posting on all AMA members pages. Hope you can participate:</p>
<p>As AMA Coordinator I am requesting that suggestions be placed on <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Membership_Meeting_plans_a5f3.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Membership Meeting plans">Wikipedia:AMA Membership Meeting plans</a> for our first membership meeting, to be held in the near future, (hopefully before any election occurs.) Since we have never had any kind of "official" meeting we need to discuss how this will occur (i.e. Wiki pages or IRC channel), how it will be structured (i.e. meeting agenda) and if there will be any "chair" to supervise the meeting and meeting "secretary" to write up minutes or keep some kind of official record of what transpires. Thanks in advance for your input and your continued work as an advocate. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— ©</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex756_8b95.html" title="User talk:Alex756">Alex756</a> 19:35, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anthere, I think that is a good suggestion regarding using the Signpost to discuss rules that may need to be changed. I will bring it up at the next meeting. It would be nice if you could come to a meeting, I don't know if the time is bad for you, Michael Snow can't make that time, but we haven't set another time yet for our third meeting so if you have any suggestions it would be great for you to attend (but if you can't I know you are busy with a lot of activities on Wikipedia). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— ©</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex756_8b95.html" title="User talk:Alex756">Alex756</a> 23:35, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Anthere. I'm Quadell, and I deleted <a href="../../../c/o/s/Image%7ECosmos_tubulaire.jpg_7d43.html" title="Image:Cosmos tubulaire.jpg">Image:Cosmos tubulaire.jpg</a> (which Alan Barrett graciously restored) because it had no licensing or source information and it was listed on <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a> for over a week with no objections. I should have contacted you first, however, and I apologize. I'm glad that the image has been restored, and that no permanent harm was done. I'll be more careful to contact the uploader in the future.</p>

<p>The only way to ensure that more of your lovely photographs are not deleted is to place image tags on them. If <i>I</i> run into any more of your photographs, I'll certainly tag them for you, but other people might not. As you can see, there have been several different people who have listed your untagged images as possible copyright violations or as images for deletion.</p>

<dd>In fairness, Anthere, you were advised on by Paddu at 10:43, 26 Jan 2005 that the images had no image tags. It is not exactly as if no-one had brought the matter to your attention. Even if you were not warned of their deletion, the more general problem was brought to your attention a month before the deletion took place. I'm upset that you identify the problem as being with the Untagged Images project, rather than more generally with the <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> process.

<dl>
<dd>I was asked the status, and I answered the status. When I am asked, I assume that when I answer, it is taken into account. Otherwise, why asking&#160;??? I have no clear idea whether the problem is with the tagging process or the deletion process, it seems it is the deletion process. But tagging is also done on other projects and I do not think my images were deleted for having no tags, since I mentionned all were gfdl. Wikipedia is horribly slow, and I am very sorry, but I really am overworked and can not assume anymore being an editor on the english wikipedia. I can't assume checking votes for deletion on all projects I have been participating to in the past 3 years. I think this is the last time I upload images on the english wikipedia. If I have no time to watch for deletion of my contributions, it is best I do not contribute at all. I think (I have the weakness to think) that I give enough of my time everyday to wikipedia, that by default my work would be trusted to obey the project rules. More than 2 years ago, while trying to attract people on Wikipedia, I spent a lot of time on forum trying to convince people to join. There was this old lady who loved gardening, she had many pictures in her garden. I made several articles about these plants on fr:wiki, not really on en: but I uploaded her pictures with her blessing nevertheless. I thought it was good idea to thanks her with her little name on the image upload page. I hoped she would come, and unfortunately she never did. This is because I thanked her on the upload page that her pictures get deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">SweetLittleFluffyThing</a> 04:50, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>You'd said all images are GFDL unless mentioned otherwise. So some of these images had the info. "Courtesy of Ginette". Not knowing what Ginette is (googling gave a french site that I couldn't understand), I skipped marking them as GFDL. To the best of my knowledge I tagged the rest of your untagged images (as of the time when I last posted here) as GFDL. I should probably have tagged these Ginette images also as GFDL. That would have avoided the deletion. Sorry! -- <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddu_be1f.html" title="User:Paddu">Paddu</a> 20:23, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anthere, in the past two weeks I have deleted over a thousand images. I have been long concerned about the number of untagged and unused images on Wikipedia, taking up space on the server, and often violating copyright law as well (there's no way to tell for sure if there's no source information). I tagged many thousands of images myself, and I started the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_tagging_fab5.html" title="Wikipedia:Image tagging">image tagging project</a> to encourage other users to tag tens of thousands more. I started the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_sleuthing_a075.html" title="Wikipedia:Image sleuthing">image sleuthing</a> project to determine the copyright statuses of images that are difficult to determine – but it's slow work, since we can only work on about fifteen images at a time, and there's a backlog of tens of thousands. I started the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_recreation_requests_aaaf.html" title="Wikipedia:Image recreation requests">Image recreation</a> project, and nearly a hundred useful but copyrighted images have been recreated in GFDL form so far. I've worked hard on <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, clearing out months of backlog that no one else wanted to do. I've worked perhaps thirty hours a week, unpaid of course, working on images. I've only deleted images according to policy: those that were listed on <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a> for over a week, or <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images</a> for over thirty days. I have never received a word of thanks from you or anyone else on the Wikimedia board for my efforts.</p>
<p>And yet, when I deleted two images that you had uploaded, I was chastised. Even though the images were not used on any articles in Wikipedia. Even though the only reason they existed on Wikipedia, apparently, was that you like them. Even though you had been asked multiple times by several different users to tag your images, but have so far declined, expecting someone else to "run a bot" and do your work for you. Even though the images themselves clearly indicated that you did not take the photos and presumably did not own the copyright, and there was no indication that the copyright holder approved of their use on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If you want your images kept, please tag them. If you're unwilling to tag them, then don't expect others to care for your images more than you do. I am available for mediation if you think it appropriate.</p>
<p>But it is this focus on the negative – this tendency to chastise rather than thank – that gets good, hard-working people to leave Wikipedia.</p>

<p>You said: <i>"I do not deny your work. I just regret that you deny other people work."</i> But I don't deny that other people work. Perhaps I don't understand your accusation.</p>
<p><br />
You said: <i>"A couple of these insect images, I hesitated selling them. Ie, making money with them. I did not. I stupidely gave them to Wikipedia. Because I liked them and believed in the project."</i> That's wonderful that you care for the project. I do too, and I don't think it's stupid. By the way, you can still sell your images if you like; the GFDL does not prevent this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. Once they were on the net, they used it&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You said: <i>"Actually, have you any idea of the time I spend daily doing work, sometimes very boring work, for *you*, so that to try that this project work&#160;?"</i> Yes I do. We both do this. We should be allies in this. Your hostility toward me is confusing.</p>
<p>You said: <i>"I feel not ashamed to please ask that someone run a bot on them for me."</i> You shouldn't feel ashamed for that. But it's one thing to take responsibility for your images, and ask people until someone says yes; it's another thing to simply put out a blanket request and assume that that's good enough, and that you're not responsible for your images anymore.</p>
<dl>
<dd>true. Though, in a sense, I am no more responsible of my images since they are now owned by Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You said: <i>"Only the little bunch of images where I had the weakness to thank the original author were not mine. All the other images are mine, and you have no reason to doubt this."</i> It isn't a weakness to thank the original author; it's a requirement. It's also required to get their permission to release the images under the terms of the GFDL. I believe you had taken the picture of the insects having sex, but I had no way of knowing this when I listed it as an "untagged orphan". If the image description page had said "I took this picture", I would have tagged it as GFDL. But there was no information. Images that are untagged, that have no source information, and that aren't used in articles are routinely listed on <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">IFD</a>. It's absolutely nothing personal, Anthere.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe there is absolutely no requirement to put on an image description "I took this picture" to be assumed to be the author. By default, we generally assume that we are the author. If that changed, we should update the uploading text to have uploaders mention they are the author. Right now, it is not the case. Secondly, when I uploaded all these images, I also agreed to do so under the gfdl. Not under no licence. So, by default,my images are in effect under gfdl. Similarly, if this was not the case, the uploading text asking us to engage we were uploading under gfdl should not have been there. No information in reality did not mean no author and no license. At that time at least, it meant we trusted people, the pictures were under gfdl and the uploaders were authors unless mentionned.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You said: <i>"Where I a totally unknown editor, I might understand your unwillingness to trust an editor by default, by in my case, I think it is ludicrous to consider that by default I cheated."</i> I didn't assume by default that you cheated. I didn't assume anything. Several people, including me, politely asked you tag your images. You declined. I see now, on the top of your talk page, is a helpful notice that all your images are released under the GFDL. That's great, but that notice wasn't there when I listed your images on ifd on February 3, over a month ago. I would never accuse you of cheating, Anthere. Also, I believe that the same rules should apply for all users. When I would run into images with no image tag, no information of where it came from or who the creator was, and not used in articles, I would list them on IfD. And I treated images the same, whether they came from an anonymous user or a Wikimedia board member. I don't think we should treat certain users special, or that different rules should apply to certain people. I think you would agree.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I added the tag to my talk page in december. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAnthere&amp;diff=8541701&amp;oldid=8503559" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAnthere&amp;diff=8541701&amp;oldid=8503559" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Only afterwards, someone told me it would be more visible on my user page. But by february the 3rd, there was already a note saying the pictures were all under gfdl if needed. If it was not to be used, it was no use asking me.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You said: <i>"No. I will not tag my images. At this point, it is a matter of principle."</i> Come on, Anthere. You're bigger than that. Violating Wikipedia policy as a matter of principle is something people like Cheesedreams do, not you. At this point, it's moot anyway. I now know, and all involved know, that all your images are released under the GFDL. Any that I encounter, I will tag GFDL.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Violating&#160;? Look, I hope you will be logical on this. On one hand, you consider my images have no author and no tag. Right&#160;? So, are likely to be copyright violations and should be deleted. *You* take the right to delete them for copyright violation. On the other hand, I try to claim I am the author and they are under gfdl, but they get deleted anyway. So EITHER they are with no author and no tag, and I am authorized to delete them just as much as you, OR they are under gfdl, and any of us deleting them would do a violation. But I see not why I would be in violation in deleting them, while you would have this right. Okay&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You said: <i>"There are people who are so busy paining editors by destroying their work and not apologizing, that it gets good, hard-working people to leave Wikimedia."</i> All your images were restored, and I'm grateful. I already apologized to you<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Anthere&amp;oldid=10705581#Your_images_are_being_deleted" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Anthere&amp;oldid=10705581#Your_images_are_being_deleted" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, but I found your request for a more public apology to be condescending and distasteful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry then. You may not strictly understand the motivation of those who add pictures to Wikipedia. Whenever I go somewhere, I think of Wikipedia. I take my camera, and spent half of my day outside, trying to take the best pictures. Say I take a 100 in an afternoon. 90 I will put in trash. 10 I will uppload here, and possibly 1 will be used in the end, sometimes making the featured image here or on the german wikipedia for example. Contrary to text where our contributions are mixed with others, we stay the author of an image, and it is extremely difficult to see that a gift was just dump when it was giving in good faith. That afternoon, when I took the copulative insect, I also took some damsel which I am terribly proud of (they made the featured image on de). I cannot give up authorship of these images, and never will. I see their deletion as a direct attack to me, which I regret, but it is just simply a fact.</dd>
<dd>The problem I have with what you do is not with all the work you do with the tagging of course, it is mostly with the fact you do not check with people. But I should recognise that the only issue is that you do not realise how people may be happy with their image. When you doubt of their author, when you doubt the gift made by the author, when you criticize the fact they are not used in an article, these are each time a sort of a blow. Most of the work we do on wikipedia will not let any sign in the future. Who knows which articles we contributed to&#160;? Who know which rules we helped to set&#160;? No one but a couple of people will remember. These is why images are a bit different, they are not collaborative. They are sensible material. And it pains me to see gift just trashed, for no reason than a doubt which could be clarified in 10 seconds. This is what is causing me problem. And I see absolutely no sign that you understand that in the future, and no sign you will now try to tell people beforehand. I thought that after the Algeria and Ginette pictures, all was fixed. I did not realise a couple of insects were missing tags. I thought all these were done. And now I wonder which is the next image I will find missing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Athere, will you please accept mediation with me? I can't believe we're destined to be antagonists here. We're both hard-working contributors, we've both uploaded our images here because we believe in the project, and we both work in good faith to improve the place. And you've given hints (forgive me if I'm wrong) that you have considered leaving Wikipedia over this. I've entertained such thoughts as well. And that's insane, for two good contributors to drive each other away over what might be a misunderstanding. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_sleuthing_a075.html" title="Wikipedia:Image sleuthing">sleuth</a>)</sup> 19:49, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certainly do not leave wikipedia over this. That would be stupid. As for me, I am not leaving, I am taking a break. I just needed so badly you can not just begin to understand. Your image deletion is just a drop on top of an already overful glass. I tried already to explain my point of view, and my asking that you tell users before deleting (which you never did for the insect picture right&#160;?), and I was clearly not successful. I do not think mediation will help you understand my point of view any better. As for your point of view, I understand it very well. You are perfectly correct I should have myself taggued all my images a long time ago. This is my mistake I did not, and I will try to assume in silence the future image deletion that are likely to occur for the ones left aside. At least, that might teach me collaborative work on images&#160;:-) Other than that, what to say but the fact I do not like so much the new english wikipedia where rules and automatisms have become more important than human editors, because as far as I can tell, human editors are still those giving content to the project.

<p>Hello Anthere, I saw your message on my talk page. Now I'll be the 1st to confess I was overreacting on the Clitoris article (as a matter of fact I used to LOVE looking at playboy when I was in 'Nam, and still do once and while to this day) However, I personally think as a strong Christian that there's certain age when you should be exposed to those sort of things. As a matter of fact I discovered wikipedia because of my younger daughter Jen shown this site to me (she's under 18, and <b>I</b> don't want her to see picture like the one on Autofellatio). Now I understand you're French (I seen you're Bio page), you have very different cultural values than we Americans, however, in this country it's <b>Illegal</b> to show pornographic pictures to minors. Now I'm not making a legal threat (I’m no lawyer either but I was reading about it). However, if a parent sees that Autofellatio picture (or even the drawing possibly), your website my have some problems with the US Department of Justice. I'd love the idea of children's wikipedia, so long as it doesn't touch controversial topics such as Autofellatio. (Now I might be blocked for breaking the three-revert rule, for attempting the link the drawing).
