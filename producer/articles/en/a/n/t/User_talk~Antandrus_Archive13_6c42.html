<p>I know it's not much for someone who has been <b>bold</b> so many times and created so many articles in music, but I'd appreciate your taking a look at the page <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_history.html" title="Music history">music history</a>, which you've contributed to the discussions for.

<p>Hi Antandrus. I just rewrote the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Requiem_%28Faur%C3%A9%29_a9d6.html" title="Requiem (Fauré)">Fauré Requiem</a> article, and I found this [<a href="http://patachonf.free.fr/musique/faure/requiem.htm#bas" class="external autonumber" title="http://patachonf.free.fr/musique/faure/requiem.htm#bas" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] webpage, which has a copy of a page of the manuscript. I can't tell if it's okay to use this. It's only one page from a huge work, and it was written well before the 1923 cutoff, although Fauré didn't die until 1924. Do you know if it's okay to use and if so, how it should be tagged?

<dd>Never having done that before, I tried an experiment on my own <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_temp_c7bb.html" title="User:Antandrus/temp">User:Antandrus/temp</a> page, and I seem to have lost 62 revisions.

<dd>BTW, just trolling, what you have to do is delete the page, then go back and restore it by clicking the little boxes next to <i>every single reversion</i> except the ones you <i>don't</i> want. It's a huge pain, and if a page has a very long history (I've never seen a definition of how long) it's better to bug a developer to do it (they have extra magical powers). I'm guessing the Global warming page is huge, though, so it's probably best to find a dev. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 02:14, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually that is what I did on my temp page experiment... but the deleted revisions didn't magically reappear until I re-checked the revision history the next morning. There was some kind of database lag issue the other night.

<dd>I was leaning more towards Codex as well, but Grove had Manuscript. It seems that Codex is more specifically for medieval manuscripts, so I'm thinking that might actually be better. Also, Las Huelgas Codex just sounds better to me, for no reason. Any thoughts on capitalization? It seems like a proper noun to me, thus all cap, but you could say that either Codex or Manuscript is just an adjective describing the proper noun. Or something. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 02:20, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If I may interject my 2 cents: I've always seen it referred to as the Codex Las Huelgas, not the Las Huelgas Codex. A quick Google search seems to confirm that as the most common name of the manuscript, so that would be my recommendation (with appropriate redirect pages for "Las Huelgas codex" and "Las Huelgas manuscript"). As for "codex" vs. "manuscript," the original distinction was between "codex" and "scroll," with codices (manuscript books made up of pieces of parchment) commonly used for Christian Scriptures instead of the more cumbersome scrolls. "Codex" thus gained the connotation of a book of ancient, classical, or sacred writings. --<a href="../../../p/e/i/User%7EPeirigill_aec5.html" title="User:Peirigill">Peirigill</a> 17:46, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am MichaelIsGreat. I added two articles (same one on each page but with a different title), one to the Bösendorfer page at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6sendorfer" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6sendorfer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6sendorfer</a> and one to the Player pianos at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_piano" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_piano" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_piano</a></p>
<p>The information that I gave on these two pages is very recent, very useful and also very relevant to these two articles.</p>
<p>You accused me of writing an advertisement! I think this accusation is false and of very bad faith!! I accuse you of having an agenda in rejecting my two postings!!! My postings were simply enthusiastic about a new computer piano that is nothing less than exceptional. Now, such an exceptional, unique, one-of-a-kind product, should I belittle it to please or fit the mood of Mr. Antandrus?!! What a joke this Wikipedia is!!! Yes, I read the neutrality thing but is it neutral to belittle a product that is nothing less than exceptional and unique? Should I tell the truth and call this computer piano exceptional, a milestone or should I call it another reproducing piano when this CEUS computer piano has this recording and playback feature that is unique and that allows it to be the first and the only piano to be able to playback faithfully any piano performance in its full expressiveness?</p>
<p>What I wrote is very accurate and I have no interest at all, financially or else, with Bösendorfer. I am only very enthusiastic about their new computer piano that is really EXCEPTIONAL in many ways (I clearly explained WHY this computer piano is indeed exceptional!!). To understand how exceptional it is, you must have a strong background on computer pianos.</p>
<p>Therefore, to say that my two postings were an advertisement is completely untrue.</p>
<p>Again, when a product is unique, one-of-a-kind, should I call it ordinary and belittle it? For your information, Bösendorfer pianos are considered to be the Rolls Royce of pianos!!! It is not me who qualifies them this way, it is those with a thorough experience of many piano makers who qualify them this way! To qualify their products as ordinary would be an insult to the truth.</p>
<p>ANYWAY, REWRITE MY ARTICLE TO YOUR LIKING AND GIVE ME A COPY FOR APPROVAL. I WILL SEE THE WAY YOU WANT TO SEE IT WRITTEN.</p>
<p>I am a new user of Wikipedia. It will be my first and last experience at Wikipedia!! Wikipedia is a joke when someone like you can censor, in bad faith I believe, so easily people like me who wrote in good faith and only to add valuable information that is not widespread at all anywhere. You should be ashamed of yourself! WHEN PEOPLE LIKE YOU CENSOR AN ARTICLE THAT IS NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT BUT THAT IS SIMPLY AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF A UNIQUE PRODUCT, THEN YOU ACT WRONGLY.</p>
<p>I have no time to read the help files to figure out how to use Wikipedia. I assume I could get your version through the mytalk link that I have at the top of my page when I check the two pages where I posted. Then I will come here to give you my feedback if I agree on your version.</p>
<p>You really should be ashamed of your behaviour because my postings are not advertisements at all. I called an outstanding, unique product the way it should be called. I explain also why I call it a milestone in the history of reproducing pianos. The recognition of a unique product should be stated without having to bear your INAPPROPRIATE intervention.</p>
<p>YOU WILL HAVE TO POST ON THIS CEUS COMPUTER PIANOS ON THE TWO PAGES I POSTED. I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU OR ANYONE TO CENSOR MENTIONING THIS NEW CEUS COMPUTER PIANO ON THESE TWO PAGES. IS IT CLEAR? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelIsGreat_6c5b.html" title="User:MichaelIsGreat">MichaelIsGreat</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelIsGreat_8da5.html" title="User talk:MichaelIsGreat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MichaelIsGreat_beb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/MichaelIsGreat">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Re your "...I've been intending to add a bit to the pre-1600 section if I ever get back to writing..." That would be very helpful, I'm sure. When I first started this Wiki stuff a few months ago, I wasn't too sure about collaborative writing; however, it seems to have produced a pretty good result so far among the three or four main contributors. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmatt_a810.html" title="User:Jeffmatt">Jeffmatt</a> 07:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was just curious about your opinion on references. I've noticed lately on a couple of the older articles on composers that they are being called unreferenced because they don't have inline citations, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Ives_c73a.html" title="Charles Ives">Charles Ives</a> (I added the inlines) and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Glass_45ef.html" title="Philip Glass">Philip Glass</a> come to mind. What do you think of that? I think it's a bit silly to say that not having inlines = not having references, but it makes me think that I need to add inline citations for a number of things where if it were up to me I wouldn't, because I think inline citations are only for disputable facts, or quotes that need to be specifically attributed. Oh, and that lovely person, MichaelIsGreat has been blocked for disruption and personal attacks, after having accused you, myself, RobertG and a newbie of bad faith and being pawns of jealous piano companies, I guess. &lt;sigh&gt;. I hope you're doing well. I need a research project, so if you think of one you don't feel like doing, feel free to shoot it at me.

<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkBuckles_4300.html" title="User:MarkBuckles">MarkBuckles</a> suggested I expand the article on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reciting_tone.html" title="Reciting tone">Reciting tone</a>, which I did, with mixed results. After discussing it with him, I think the only way to clarify the structure of psalm tones is to essentially reproduce the nine psalm tone formulae in staff notation from Hoppin. This raises two questions. First, how? If I were to reproduce the formulae in Finale, say, and save it as a .pdf file, is there a simple way to insert in it an article? Second, is it kosher to lift a whole page of material directly from source material, even with attribution, or am I violating copyright? Any suggestions would be much appreciated! <a href="../../../p/e/i/User%7EPeirigill_aec5.html" title="User:Peirigill">Peirigill</a> 18:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice one! I like it. How likely is it someone would lie about studying with Palestrina at that time, I wonder?

<dd>Well, he got the <i>big</i> post at St. John Lateran the year after dedicating that book to Palestrina; it was probably with Palestrina's blessing, and the book may have been, um, a bit of mild flattery (oh-oh, original research... ) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:48, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Some of these are still ongoing and warrant more input (such as the idea to scrap the members list altogether). However, some decisions have been made and the charter has hence been amended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" rel="nofollow">See what happened</a>. Basically, the whole leadership has had a reshuffle, so please review the new, improved charter.</p>

I've left {{subst:test}}, {{subst:test2}} and now {{subst:test3}} on his talk page. His M.O. is to "zap" a couple of pages, wait a few minutes until he thinks no one is looking, and then "zap" a couple of more. Would you mind dropping him a note on his talk page? Thank you. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> 04:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I haven't touched the singers: there could be hundreds of articles to write. (Oh, you might mention that "professional singers" were considered to be a lower social class; a naive reader might not realize this; Gesualdo was at pains to be an "amateur" composer for the same reason, not to damage the perception of his nobility -- if I understand their social structure correctly.)

<p>My name is Roygene. Perhaps you remember me? My brother vandalized all of those articles a few months ago? Anyway, he managed to get ahold of a manuscript I am writing and incorporate it into Star Wars. I have already tagged two such articles, Xeaus and Amelico, for deletion, but those are the only two I found and there may be more. I don't know how to check Caliente001's history or what articles he's edited, but knowing him, he probably did do some more damage. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoygene_b030.html" title="User:Roygene">Roygene</a> 19:57, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Antandrus. It was nice to sign on and find a nice message instead of a rant&#160;:-) I'm pretty happy with the articles I've done today, although they could probably do with a quick copy-edit and some smoothing (<a href="../../../m/%C3%A9/d/M%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_%28Charpentier_opera%29_cb2f.html" title="Médée (Charpentier opera)">Médée (Charpentier opera)</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_Bendidio_5838.html" title="Isabella Bendidio">Isabella Bendidio</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonora_Sanvitale_0761.html" title="Leonora Sanvitale">Leonora Sanvitale</a> if you're feeling bored.) I looked in on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>'s FAC thingie, and it was a bit disheartening. I would help out, but when I read it I think it flows pretty well, so I feel a bit helpless. Now I'm checking inter-wiki links between Spanish and French, which is funny because I don't know any Spanish, I just know enough Latin and other Romance languages to figure it out pretty easily. It's kinda fun. Oh! And some family pull managed to get me the Newcomb through interlibrary loan already! Score! Prepare for some serious Madrigal in Ferrara action.

<p>Hello Antandrus: First, thank you very much for your kind welcome note the other day. I have skimmed your user page and am very interested to learn more about your career-changing, an area I struggle with constantly.

<p>Unless you are able to provide a non-commercial link of the score &amp; music of Ellens dritter Gesang, is it not rather unhelpful to Wikipedia visitors that you removed the one I found and provided (after trawling the internet for ages)?

<dd>Haven't quite made it to bed yet - but I did apply a range block. I just wondered which ranges you have seen the bot active in so far. I have reverted in 207.200.116 and 112 - have you seen vandalism outside of these ranges? If there is only a small number of 3rd level ranges, then maybe longer /24 blocks could be applied to them (e.g. 207.200.116.0/24). Any thoughts?

<p>That's a really lovely article. Great job. I made a couple edits you should probably check. It's interesting how the circumstances of performance sound pretty much the same as in the <i>musica secreta</i> of Alfonso II d'Este, except he might have invited important nobility more often. I feel like there ought to be a better article to link to on the so-called effects of the ancient modes, as well as on Greek poetic metre. Perhaps I'll have to write them myself.

<p>To <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_ae0f.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey O. Gustafson">Jeffrey O. Gustafson</a> who initiated this block request I ask why? We have had no interaction until now so how do you come to this requested action at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>? Did you come across my account during your own research or are you acting as a proxy for another admin/user with whom I've caused to be angry with me? In reviewing your contributions I see no such "letter of the law" before now and so I feel singled out by you and I have no clue as to why - that to me is most disturbing. If you've come to this action on your own then should I be always wary of another admin challenging the legitimacy of my account?<br /></p>
<p>For <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> who advised me not to worry and <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick</a> who made me laugh I give special thanks, you've helped me to not take this so personally. And to <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_ae0f.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey O. Gustafson">Jeff</a>, thanks for being courteous in informing me of your action and for letting me feel that your heart wasn't for blocking me.<br />
Except for my one explanation above, I haven't edited for a few days now so as to allow y'all to comment about this based on my history of contribution rather than my reaction to it.<br /></p>
<p>I wanted to say all of this before it all goes to archive heaven. I still have a lingering concern that this may arise again and don't want to go through WP life looking over my shoulder or worrying that I might piss-off some admin and cause another inquiry about the legitimacy of my account. If any of you who have been so gracious as to take the time to support me here have any suggestions to prevent such an action, please drop your thoughts on my talk or by email.<br /></p>
<p>Finally, on a personal note to all, I never ever expected so much supportive response from all of you. I know that I've been moody at times and have spoken in ways that I have regretted the next day. I hoped otherwise but it seemed that those unfortunate responses might end up being my legacy as they were the foremost in my mind. And so far as this being a "role account", I think that I'll let the descriptions of <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember">NoSeptember</a> (both above) stand as the most intuitive descriptions of this account. My (and our) warmest regards to all of you for your understanding and outward support for the continuation of <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo's</a> user account and future contributions. Again, my delighted and humble thanks&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 02:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>addendum:</b> Jeff, I was confused at the outset in that I wasn't aware of the "role account" policy and then after becoming aware I was frustrated that I had made so many edits which could mislead someone to the conclusion that my account was a role account. I'm sorry that in my zeal to understand your actions that I posed the possibility that you were acting at someone else's behest. I have no evidence of that and it was improper of me to even mention that such a bizarre conspiracy was possible. I find myself guilty of "blaming the messenger" and posting an inappropriate comment about your motivation.<br /></p>
<p>As for my account, I want to state that it is not a role account and I apologize for leaving the impression that it is one. "<b>hydnjo</b>" is the signature that I commonly use for much of my correspondence and thought it to be appropriate when I first started my WP account. The portmanteau is an acknowledgment of our shared existence and not an indication that Heidi and I share in editing at WP.<br /></p>
<p>I thank you for your courtesy in informing me at the outset of the discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and for your compliments about my contributions. The comments in my response were made in the shadow of my own frustration with my having left a trail of edits that could easily be construed as having come from either Heidi or myself. I sincerely apologize to you for making any suggestion as to your motivation in bringing up a legitimate policy question. You have a genuine concern for the orderly behavior of our editors and I thank you for initiating this discussion and providing me the opportunity to explain the nature of my account. --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 18:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Antandrus. I am writing to inform you that I have placed a merge tag on two articles: <a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodovico_Zacconi_65e8.html" title="Lodovico Zacconi">Lodovico Zacconi</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucovico_Zacconi_c979.html" title="Lucovico Zacconi">Lucovico Zacconi</a> of which the former was greatly expanded by you over the last two years. As I hold no PhD in music composition, I was wandering if you could take a look at both. As far as I can tell, the articles are about the same person. If so, they should indeed be merged.

<p>I do not believe Ive made your aquatance before since I've not editing Wikipdia for some months. I tried to leave a message for "Happy Camper" this morning at 11:00 (Eastern Standard Time) and it said that you had blocked my AOL ISP. The name of the offending ISP was not mine which is "Merlinus" I would appreciate it if you could rectify this and unblock me as soon as possible. Peace...

<dd>Hi Josiah: thanks for the message. Yes, that's our "friend", the kid in North Carolina, who has literally been vandalising every day (with maybe a handful of exceptions, for example when all his ranges have been blocked) for more than a year. Regarding blocks of individual puppets: I usually block them, because he uses aged accounts for page-move vandalism--it's next door to impossible to get them all though, since he has made thousands. Let's hope Mackensen's range-block (with the delicious summary "hive of sum and villainy") sticks. Happy editing! <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:08, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Oh--and regarding tagging the accounts, I have mixed feelings about that. He's clearly motivated by a desire to be notorious, and having a huge category devoted to his sockpuppets is like having a huge trophy cabinet, and I think encourages him: I have used the "indefblockeduser" tag for several hundred of his socks for that reason. Yet I can understand the desire to put the "NCV" tag on so that new editors, admins, and RC patrollers can get an idea of what his typical behavior is. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:14, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've blocked all the accounts that were listed at RCU, and the ones that were used on <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp_90eb.html" title="Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp">Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp</a>. I ended up tagging some of the accounts with {{NCV}} and some with {{indefblockeduser}}; more with NCV, just because it was fewer keystrokes. (I figured it was good to have some of this batch in the "trophy cabinet" to show patterns in naming, like the "lentil" business. I think it's handy for less experienced admins like me to be able to see more of the history.) Thanks for the info, though, and I hope that Mackensen's range block takes care of the kid, for a while at least. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 22:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right, in general: in the history of humanity there have been those who build, and those who deface and destroy: the former outnumber the latter, both in the history of civilization and in the microcosm of that which we have on Wikipedia. These things are universal and will never change. Yet each person has the ability to choose whether to be a builder or one who tears down. Why do you make your choice the way you do?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Genghis Khan tore cities down and killed their inhabitants because the settled way of life was a threat to his idea of what was the right way to live: always moving. Why would one want to tear down an encyclopedia? Is the accumulation of knowledge in one place a problem? I realize these are unusual questions to ask of a vandal, but think about them: do you really know why you do what you do? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks a lot for the message. It's good to know sometimes that people appreciate what I do - also nice to find another early music/Baroque enthusiast. The topic is slowly getting better on Wikipedia, but it's still a long way off (though Gregorian Chant is a very nice article to look at, and should get FA). Opera in general is still erratically covered, but the Opera Project is very active and we're getting there (mind you, I only did a bit with Henze - 1 fairly lengthy paragraph for the biography - and a whole load of one-sentence stubs for the operas; I <i>think</i> that <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry Flower</a> was the one who really expanded the bio).</p>
<p>Anyway, about some real editing; I did a couple of stubs the other day, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Indian_Queen_a81b.html" title="The Indian Queen">The Indian Queen</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwartung.html" title="Erwartung">Erwartung</a>, and I don't know if you're looking for something to do, but if you have a recording or have seen one or both of these the two of them could certainly stand some expansion. This last is a very long-term project, but I'm working on a "History of Opera" article that's currently gestating in my workspace (the link near the bottom of my userpage). It's currently only at the "vague outlines" stage but what I thought I might do was to get a more definite shape to the article and then ask specialists in various periods and genres to contribute (i.e Meladina for Russian opera; Ssilvers for operatic/musical crossbreeds, etc). Perhaps there's a particular section that you might enjoy creating? Anyway, the whole thing's very long-term and there's no real urgency, but it might be something to bear in mind. Thanks again for the encouragement. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 20:02, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not know that poem, it's interesting. I actually know about what we called "broken consorts", a number of my friends had one as their chamber music group one semester, it was pretty funny. One of my friends was playing a school <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandora.html" title="Bandora">bandora</a> which had fixed frets in an approximation of quarter comma <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meantone_temperament.html" title="Meantone temperament">mean tone</a>. It really pissed him off&#160;:-) I've just done <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola_bastarda.html" title="Viola bastarda">Viola bastarda</a>, because mindspillage likes the name, and it made sense as a companion article to division viol. In regards to literature critics never knowing about music, I agree, I wish altogether there were more and better interdisciplinary cooperation. It's something I would think the wiki would be really perfect for; however, I mostly see interdisciplinary cruft instead.
