	    <p>This new page, a work in progress, is devoted to one of the most active and successful international literary societies, the high regard in which it is held being evidenced by the distinguished panel of scholars and authors who participate in its conferences and the institutions (<a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balliol_College_8eea.html" title="Balliol College">Balliol College</a>, Cambridge, and the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_Collection_fb82.html" title="Wallace Collection">Wallace Collection</a>) which host its conferences.</p>
<p>Powell was regarded by such writers as <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Waugh_d3c0.html" title="Evelyn Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsley_Amis_530a.html" title="Kingsley Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> as amongst the greatest British novelists of the 20th century, a view supported by present day critics like <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._N._Wilson_3c07.html" title="A. N. Wilson">A. N. Wilson</a>. Powell's work remains in print continuously, has been the subject of TV dramatisation, and continues to be set text.</p>
<p>There is a significant body of material relating to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Powell_68f3.html" title="Anthony Powell">Anthony Powell</a> and his works already in Wikipedia, which appears to have generated considerable and growing interest. The new entry on the Anthony Powell Society provides information likely to be valuable to students, academics and general readers on how that may be developed.</p>
<p>Numerous other literary societies, smaller, less successful and less international have been allowed to retain entries. The intention is to refine this entry and it is respectfully suggested that time be allowed so to do. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalliol_0e19.html" title="User:Balliol">Balliol</a> 23:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, this page looks like a useful addition to Wikipedia and appears to be in compliance with guidelines, although no doubt it can be improved. Powell could hardly be described as other than one of the giants of 20th century English literature so I fail to see the justification for proposing deletion. These hair-trigger attempts to delete new entries are causing unnecessary annoyance across the Wikipedia community and should be firmly resisted. I note that this is not the first such episode involving this editor and would politely suggest a more measured approach.</dd>

<p>There are several other articles on Wikipedia about literary societies, for example: or associations</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_Irregulars" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_Irregulars" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_Irregulars</a></p>

<p>Literary societies or associations are an important part of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_society.html" title="Civil society">civil society</a> and are worthy of coverage in an encyclopedia, along the same line as the various other clubs, leagues, fan groups (for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie</a>) that are covered on Wikipedia. A literary association is an institution that is part of this fabric of civil groupings. If the literary association can show it has an established membership, a professional and multitiered website, and a comprehensive series of activities, it is as worthy of coverage as the other niche groupings covered on Wikipedia that the Wikipedian community has collectively accepted, does have some more general relevance either in showing a constituency for their object of scrutiny or in providing evidence of cultural associations that are neither <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>-sponsored nor acts of individual enthusiasm. The Anthony Powell Society entry should be considered as part of this registering of literary associations as an aspect of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_society.html" title="Civil society">civil society</a>.</p>

<p>May I strongly endorse the views expressed above. The Anthony Powell Society contributes a lot to the study of the Powell novels and to the Knowledge and pleasure of his many serious readers. It also welcomes and encourages new readers. Many of us value Wikipedia not only for the wide range of its coverage but also for the important contribution it can make to cultural life by dealing with slightly esoteric subjects with a degree of depth that helps make them more widely available and understood. Several of the present Powell-related entries, contributed by members of the Society, play their part in this process. Vandalism is to be deprecated, not least when it is attributable to one of the editors.</p>

<p>I would add that The Anthony Powell Society page is not a vehicle of self-promotion, which may be the concern of some whose knowledge of Powell or literary societies may be nominal. The term "society" after an organization's name in the US is often linked with a charity or fundraising: e.g. The Humane Society or the ASPCA. Perhaps the idea of censorship is merely a matter of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The Anthony Powell Society (or the Evelyn Waugh Society) is a society dedicated to the preservation of the work and memory of one of the Twentieth Century's foremost and highly-regarded men of letters. Toward that end, the society mounts conferences, coordinates exhibitions, produces newsletters and journals that, while Powell-related, draw on a number of different sources across not only literature, but also history, music, et al. It is also a form of outreach.</p>
<p>Those who are drawn to the Powell discussion page on Yahoo groups (another FREE source maintained by the Powell Society) are often opened up intellectually to a greater depth and appreciation of not only Powell, but also learn of other writers (past and present) who have been/are influenced by his canon of work. The list has members from around the globe. There are additional in-depth discussions about the times in which Powell lived, aspects of his writing, potential character models based on historical figures who people his works.</p>
<p>It would be unfortunate indeed for someone acting in ignorance of a subject, its relevance and contribution to the greater society that is the world to simply determine that it shall not exist: i.e. "If I have not heard of it, it must not exist."</p>
<p>Especially as Wikipedia has two entries just on the subject of Literary Societies alone:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_society" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_society" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_society</a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category%3ALiterary_societies" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category%3ALiterary_societies" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category%3ALiterary_societies</a></p>
<p>As this is a forum based upon the idea of give and take for the greater common good, I think it would be a crime of sorts for an organization that has -- and continues to -- show itself worthy because of what it is willing to give to others to be relegated to the irrelevant simply because of editorial myopia.</p>
<p>After all, Anthony Powell's seminal work of fiction, the twelve-volume _A Dance to the Music of Time_ remains in print (as do his journals), lives and breathes for such diverse writers as <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Rankin_1081.html" title="Ian Rankin">Ian Rankin</a>, A N Wilson and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Hitchens_80b0.html" title="Christopher Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> -- and for myriad others. Surely there is room in Wikipedia for the Society that helps make that possible.</p>

<p>Runingonbrains originally flagged this article for speed deletion on the grounds that "The given reason is: it is an article about a club that does not assert the importance or significance of the subject." A paragraph explaining the importance and significance of Powell was added accordingly. Runningonbrains has now deleted it. This is, we would respectfully suggest, neither consistent nor constructive. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalliol_0e19.html" title="User:Balliol">Balliol</a> 22:34, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article about the society should assert the importance of the society. Powell is obviously notable, as he has his own entry. I still do not believe this society is completely encyclopaedic, however, that is one man's opinion, and a good case could be made for it to stay. I appologize to those that I seem to have offended by suggesting that this article didn't belong. In the future, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">don't assume bad faith</a> when commenting about additions, notices, etc added by me and other editors. When dealing with thousands of pages of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">vandalism</a> each day, occasionally people mistake a legit page for one made in a not-so-noble effort. Again, I appologize, and happy editing all. -<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunningonbrains_2b29.html" title="User:Runningonbrains">Runningonbrains</a> 07:46, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your response. I don't think there was any suggestion, certainly not on my part, of anyone acting in other than good faith. Debate is what makes Wikipedia interesting. In fact what I understood to be your suggestion of an introductory para on Powell seems helpful, and as non-Brits may not know of him a brief explanation seems of value. Accordingly I am reinstating a slimmed down version. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalliol_0e19.html" title="User:Balliol">Balliol</a> 09:57, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The recent edit by <a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.67.115.253.html" title="User talk:129.67.115.253">129.67.115.253</a> prompts me to wonder whether <i>all</i> the categories associated with this article should be removed, since they all allude to the man, not the Society. I didn't want to delete them all without discussion, however. We could replace them with a category such as <a href="../../../l/e/a/Category%7ELearned_societies_bac8.html" title="Category:Learned societies">Category:Learned societies</a> or one of its subcategories like <a href="../../../l/e/a/Category%7ELearned_societies_of_the_United_Kingdom_8bb8.html" title="Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom">Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom</a> or, perhaps better, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Category%7ELiterary_societies_46c8.html" title="Category:Literary societies">Category:Literary societies</a>.
