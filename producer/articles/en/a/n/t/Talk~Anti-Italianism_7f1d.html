<p>AnonMoos, are you saying that French, Swedesh, Irish, Canadian folks etc - and other notAmerican citizens - were also interned like the Japanese, Italians and ItalianAmericans?

Therefore the use of the words "Italian-Americans" in the section is rather misleading. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 15:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section strains hard, but fails, to draw a general point (that there is widespread, or substantial, or at least notable anti-Italian sentiment in the Democratic Party, and apparently only in the Democratic Party among political parties) by relying on scattered anecdotes that simply do not add up to a pattern of anti-Italianism by Democrats. These few anecdotes--some of them even of questionable anti-Italian intent--are not justification for trying to stick an "anti-Italian" label on the Democratic Party. (Nor, I believe, could one justifiably put a section like this in the article on the Republican Party) Gathering "evidence," like that presented here, is only part of the process; you also have to assess its importance and significance. To use these spindly reeds to suggest something general in the attitude of the Democratic Party toward Italian-Americans is a leap too far. I propose the section be deleted. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickDC_c7c4.html" title="User:RickDC">RickDC</a> 21:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. All of those quotes, even if taken wildly out of context, would not demonstrate any serious anti-Italianism. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorrisGregorian_aedd.html" title="User:MorrisGregorian">MorrisGregorian</a> 02:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The topic heading should not be anti-Italianism in the Democratic party. However, instead of deletion, the section should be reworked to leave these examples (and add others) to show that public displays of anti-Italianism are seen even in the highest levels of government. This racial stereotyping and innuendo of Italian Americans would never be tolerated, or ignored by the media, if it was directed against most other ethnic groups. The point of the section is misdirected at Democrats but there is value in retaining the core information.--Ana Nim 14:17, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree, paesan. I find it amazing how people can get away with directing disparaging innuendos and stereotypes towards Italians, when any stereotyping against any other ethnic group would never be tolerated. However, perhaps the title should be changed. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallmarcus_9143.html" title="User:Callmarcus">Callmarcus</a> 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if the section were retitled and the focus reworked, so that the Democratic Party was no longer the focal point, the scattered anecdotes seem thin proof or even evidence of anything notable beyond the fact that people occasionally say things that can be interpreted as (and sometimes are) "anti-[fill in the blank]" This point could apply to almost any group in society, and to make it here, so weakly, does a disservice to the preceding sections of the article, in which good points are made well. I still recommend that the section be deleted entirely; I don't see a ready way to improve it to the point where it would add value to the article. In any event, certainly the focus ought not to be on one political party. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickDC_c7c4.html" title="User:RickDC">RickDC</a> 23:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>PS. As a side note, a Mayor in a suburban New York town (the name of the exact town escapes me) recently responded to questions from an Italian American school board official by stating "Because I don't like guineas." I find it amazing how little attention was given to the incident.</p>
<p>I've retitled the section, to remove the focus on solely the Democratic Party. I've reworded the text. I've also deleted the paragraph on New Jersey, which has no substance to it--just that two Italian-Americans in NJ didn't like Menendez's vote against Alito. I still strongly believe the section should be deleted entirely. It's a weak and insubstantial segment for an encyclopedia article. I've only tried to eliminate its anti-Democratic focus. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickDC_c7c4.html" title="User:RickDC">RickDC</a> 00:48, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There might be claims in this that are invalid, but anti-Italianism certainly existed in US history and the history of a few other nations. See <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22anti-italianism%22+-chomsky&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22anti-italianism%22+-chomsky&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">Google books on Anti-Italianism</a>. (I took off Chomsky's because they seem to be irrelevant) I think it'd be better to ask "do we need this article as it is now" or "this article is done badly and needs better sourcing." You can add the appropriate tags to indicate it needs improvement. Some statements I made like a year ago, when I didn't understand Wikipedia as well, are there unaltered and probably need sourced.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>As an Italian American who has been discriminated against and has had family members discriminated against, I find your statement extremely offensive. Sources can be found for almost everything on this page. You seem to have an agenda. - 16 December 2006 UTC</li>

<dd>Offensiveness is a purely subjective matter. As an Italian I rather find offensive someone who says Italian culture &lt;&lt;significantly differs from that of the mainstream identity of white people and Western European cultures&gt;&gt;, which means absolutely nothing and it's probably written by someone who haven't the faintest idea about European and Italian cultures and how each other are related. This is an article about old 19th Century North American stereotypes about Italians, and it fall exactly in those stereotypes. Nothing to be astonished at. So, as long as this is an encyclopedia and nobody produced verifiable sources for that, I'm going to delete it. --<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFertuno_ec03.html" title="User:Fertuno">Fertuno</a> 12:42, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How is the truth offensive? Censoring and erasing this page will not bring an end to anti-Italianism, if that's what you think. If you erase this, next it will be the anti-Semitism page, the Racism page, and so on. Just because you have some bizarre shame of the past does not mean we should erase it. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallmarcus_9143.html" title="User:Callmarcus">Callmarcus</a> 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
