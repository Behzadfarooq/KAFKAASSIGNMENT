<p>Respected Madam,</p>
<p>This is with reference to the current <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikipedia-logo.png_6a5c.html" title="Image:Wikipedia-logo.png">Wikipedia Logo</a>. The leftmost jigsaw piece along the equator of the globe in the image has text written in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>. However the way it appears in the logo, it seems that it was created on a software that did not have Indic Language Support. Hence, what should be <a href="../../../c/o/r/Image%7ECorrect_hindi_vi.JPG_c618.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c1/Correct_hindi_vi.JPG/20px-Correct_hindi_vi.JPG" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../c/o/r/Image%7ECorrect_hindi_vi.JPG_c618.html" /></a> appears as <a href="../../../i/n/c/Image%7EIncorrect_hindi_vi.JPG_edcb.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/d/da/Incorrect_hindi_vi.JPG/20px-Incorrect_hindi_vi.JPG" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/n/c/Image%7EIncorrect_hindi_vi.JPG_edcb.html" /></a>. It is our request to change it as soon as possible to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Image%7ECorrect_hindi_vi.JPG_c618.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c1/Correct_hindi_vi.JPG/20px-Correct_hindi_vi.JPG" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../c/o/r/Image%7ECorrect_hindi_vi.JPG_c618.html" /></a> so that is consistant with the Hindi language and thus free of defects.

<p>I registered the former name of the channel, #en.wikipedia.vandalism, initialy for my bot to run on. You might recall the shifting from en.wikipedia format to #wikipedia-en and my channel was among the renamed. Fennec registered #wikipedia-en-vandalism for potential abuse by vandals during the shift. he later handed the channel to Essjay. I was well aware of this but did not interfered as I trusted Essjay. The channel ran fine with Essjay in command (even though I had identical level of access) for months. Essjay gradualy reduced my access and recently has banned me and my bot from #wikipedia-en-vandalsim w/o a reason. Soon after he converted the channel into a redirect to #wikipedia-en and started his own (which I am banned from).</p>
<p>Freenode policy points that all actions regarding channels with "wikipedia" or "wikimedia" in them to be taken by group contacts. Group contacts include: Essjay, Angela, Anthere, Fennec.</p>
<p>I need to be able to use #wikipedia-en-vandalism for my vandalism-detection-bot, computer, to operate. The bot uses the channel name to interprete what wiki it is processing, for instance bot would talk in french at #wikipedia-fr-vandalism and keep a log of vandalism and other actions independently of en.</p>

<p>Hi, Anthere! It has been a long time since I've been in contact with you and I appreciate all you helped me with when we were still working together on Wikipedia (that french translation particularly&#160;;). Since I've moved on to other things, I'd really like to know how you've been. There is too much that has happened to me since we last spoke so I'd like you to look at the lengthy message I left on Angela's talk page if you want to see what I've been up to. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Angela#Hello_from_Alex" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Angela#Hello_from_Alex" rel="nofollow">link</a> to that). Anyway, I'd love to have a chat with you to catch up on what has happened since our early Wikipedia days.

<dd>I should have looked at the article history earlier, but I see that you created the <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soils_retrogression_and_degradation.html" title="Soils retrogression and degradation">Soils retrogression and degradation</a> article in 2002 on the French WP, and then on the English WP. I have proposed that it be merged with <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_degradation.html" title="Land degradation">land degradation</a>, but my enthusiasm for this is lukewarm at best. The concept that man-induced soils degradation is the opposite of natural <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedogenesis.html" title="Pedogenesis">pedogenesis</a> is exciting, and resonates with the theory of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biorhexistasy.html" title="Biorhexistasy">biorhexistasy</a> and with the work of David Pimental - it deserves its own article. Regrettably, the article has the appearance of original content. If I do redirect the article to land degradation, my understanding is that the history will remain so that when verifiable sources are identified the article can be restored. You may want to copy a previous version to a subpage of your user space to develop further in anticipation of this. If you do, please note it on the article talk page.</dd>

<p>With all due respect, three of these four board members all had financial links back to Jimbo Wales. I frequently read you mention how you are an unpaid volunteer; meanwhile, Wales is not so subtly using the Wikimedia Foundation to promote a similar commercial project that is receiving millions in capital. And you have stated that some Foundation employment decisions have been made with little input from yourself. You are very wise in your perceptions about the future of Wikipedia and the dangers of its status quo direction, but if you do not stand up a bit more aggressively and appeal to the Wikipedia community directly, the window of time to have any input into its future may pass.

<dl>
<dd>correct. I think it embarassed Angela more than once to have financial link to Jimbo. Note that the link is more teneous now since Jimbo is no more then CEO of Wikia.</dd>

<p>I frequently read you mention how you are an unpaid volunteer; meanwhile, Wales is not so subtly using the Wikimedia Foundation to promote a similar commercial project that is receiving millions in capital.</p>
<dl>
<dd>correct</dd>
</dl>
<p>And you have stated that some Foundation employment decisions have been made with little input from yourself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmmm. Well, that's a bit more complicated.</dd>
<dd>The decision to employ Danny was made by Jimbo alone. The argument being that Danny was going to be his assistant, so that the choice should be primarily Jimbo's. Fair enough. However, for Angela and I, Danny was meant to be the Foundation assistant so we should have approved as well perhaps. Still, this argument did not fully stand, since it could be argued that employment was the decision of the president, and that the president was Jimbo. So in the end, the board only involvement was to actually agree to hire an assistant, but not to agree on the name nor on the price. A year later, I think that the choice of person really belonged to Jimbo, but that amount of money to involve belonged to the board through the approval of the budget.</dd>
<dd>The decision to employ Tim was more collective, since we agreed on the concept of hiring someone, as well as on the name. However, the price was not left to the board approval and imho, this is not correct. One of the way a board may act is precisely through the budget decision. In this case, process was entirely messed up.</dd>
<dd>Brad hiring was entirely subject to board approval (name, price, job). Which is good. However, we made a faux-pas in not discussing that enough before hand among all board members. Hence a decision which did not meet 100% approval.</dd>
<dd>little by little, things are improving in terms of decisions being made by the board. But it is tough. In the future, employment decisions will be made by the Executive Director. The board will only decide on budget (and the amount of money allocated will lead in good part the decision to hire someone or someone else, or no one).</dd>

<dd>hmmm. I feel that I have stand already very aggressively. Publicly and privately. And yes, I feel the time passing, very quickly, with no effect. My time on the board is limited. A good way to limit risk for an unlimited board member is just to let things pend forever. And there is little that can be done against that. Ant</dd>

<p>Hello there! Long time Wikipedia user, not-so-long editor here. I have come to you hoping to seek some advice in settling a dispute on a Wikipedia article, GraalOnline in which I have entered in at an all-too-hot time. The problem is that a user persists on removing/editing a large amount of content which a number of other users find to be relevant in regards to an article about criticisms as to how the online game in question is being run. I have argued that the criticism section is an integral part of an on-going problem, and I have talked on the discussion page about quite possibly negotiating and editing the more extreme views into that of a lesser tone, but it seems I am somehow already blocked from editing in the talk page. The user also insists that I have reverted the article without talking about it, even though it seems I have been talking about it? What is there to be done?--<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuribo_430b.html" title="User:Kuribo">Kuribo</a> 10:44, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It was the first wikipedian we lost on the &gt; french project. At that point, he was the editor with the largest number &gt; of edits. And it was not only typos. He left us a last word just before &gt; he had an operation and did not survive it. &gt; &gt; We sent flowers to his burial. We told his family how important he was &gt; for us and they were proud of what he did for Wikipedia. &gt; A text was written about him.

It was the &gt; picture he had on his user page. A bad image, but the only one we had &gt; for him. Certainly an image which will never be reused by anyone. But an &gt; image of Treanna. &gt; &gt; &gt; The crime&#160;: it was uploaded as a non-derivative license. So, it is &gt; proposed for deletion. &gt; &gt; &gt; And frankly, I can not ask Treanna any more if he would be nice enough &gt; to change that license to make it free by wikipedia definition.</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm beeing an insensitive prick here, but why not simply ask his family to change the license? With the author dead the family is the new legal copyright holder (unless he left a will stating otherwise), and we obviosly know how to get in contact with them. I mean by all means give them some time to grieve before confronting them with the GFDL release forms or whatever, but if we are planning to keep the image around permanently it seems like the only real solution. It is what we would have demanded of anyone else (people have literaly been banned for insisting on using NC or ND images of themselves on theyr own userpage), and I for one do not apreciate having double standards. Either we allow every unfree image with a sufficiently compelling "sob storry" to stay, or we stay true to our stated goals of free content even if it means that an image of someone dear to us can not be used. Personaly I favour the later.</p>
<hr />
<p>He told me in a dream he changed the copyright license to "anyone can copy for any reason". I called the family and they agreed. So change the license because the copyright holder (legally - the family) said it was ok. Really. And stop trying to change rules to allow breaking rules. It's as bad as telling white lies. 4.250.168.134 16:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there, my name is Nick, my username is Potters house and I have encountered a problem with trying to provide any information about Johnny Lee Clary. I have posted this post off to other staff members also. I am not sure if this is the best route to resolve this, but can think of no other way.</p>
<p>The article Johnny Lee Clary has been deleted. I have known Johnny through telephone conversations and email for a short time now (about 3-4 months). He recently came and shared his life story in for our church group for the first time just two weeks ago. Before I met Johnny I became interested in his story i.e. his conversion from the head of the KKK in the US, to being a Christian Minister who now teaches against race hate groups. I found the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> as it still is today, deleted, except for some small talk. If you read the talk you see what I have said at the time (notice I have gotten no reply, probable my fault as I donât know heaps about WIKI policy). From my understanding Johnny Lee Clary was posting as The KingOfDixie and looks like he tried to change a few things on Wiki concerning the KKK. While this is a controversial subject, Johnny being the former leader of the KKK would probably know a thing or two and be able to contibute, but thatâs another story. He eventually made an article about himself i.e. Johnny Lee Clary. Johnny being quite new to Wiki and ignorant of rules of conduct found himself at odds with some admins and had his site deleted.</p>
<p>Whilst observing Johnny over the last 3-4 months I have noticed that he is very outspoken against race hate groups such as the Neo Nazis, Skinheads, KKK etc. This, more often than not, lands Johnny in the hot seat. He has experienced persecution from racist groups for his departure from the KKK and voiced opinions against these racist organizations on his webpage, www.xkkk.org. Johnny has also received multiple death threats.</p>
<p>Because of his bold stance against these racist groups Johnny has become accustomed to hatred directed at him by those same groups. Johnny concluded that perhaps the guy who deleted the page <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> was a white supremist. I am hoping to clear this up. Before he told me this, I started to create J L Clary, after hearing nothing from posting in user talk on Johnny Lee Clary's article. I wasn't 10 minutes into the J L Clary article when it was issued a deletion notice, and then before I had time to reply (about 5 minutes) it was deleted! I was amazed. I told this to Johnny and he said the main reason he was told that he couldn't have an article was because he was not prominent enough.</p>
<p>Johnny has a very famous testimony and has been on multiple TV shows like Oprah, Donahue, Jerry Springer, etc, and even recently when he preached in our town he made front page news, a double spread on his life, and the local ABC interviewed him live, which is not bad for our town (LISMORE NSW Australia) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> .</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> came to our town hardly anyone knew or cared, yet <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> is allowed an article (and rightfully so), but more people know of Johnny. As to whether he is famous or not, just Google search him and see all the TV interviews and radio interviews he does. He hangs with some of the most prominent Christian leaders in Australia. Besides this, just being the former KKK leader should be enough for an article (he doesn't even get a mention in the KKK one, and would be deleted). He was also a Pro Wrestler. So he is prominent in Christian circles, he is prominent amongst race hate groups, and he is also prominent in the WWE wrestling.</p>
<p>Johnny asked me to test the waters for him to see if he was being persecuted by someone from a race hate group. So I created some sites, John Clary <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Watts_9977.html" title="Wade Watts">Wade Watts</a> and Operation Colorblind - the name of Johnny's Ministry. These have been fine until yesterday. I cannot understand why these sites are just issued a deletion notice? Just because they mention JLC? I was hoping to discuss these things but they are just deleted. The one on Wade Watts is about a black gospel preacher who was one of the leaders in the civil rights movement in the US and was good friends with Martin Luther King. He took Johnny Clary under his wing and even ordained Johnny as a minister (to this day Johnny is the only white man ordained in the All Black Baptist Church). But his article is up for deletion because I mentioned Clary and had a link.</p>
<p>That is why I am writing to you to see if you can help. It seems to me that the person(s) deleting all articles which even mention Johnny Lee Clary has an agenda. I thought that wikipedia admins had to keep a neutral stance on every article. It seems like this guy has a vendetta against JLC. Why delete the Wade Watts article. That is guilt by association and could be proof that all deletions are because of racial discrimination! I hope this is not the case and would think that it is politically motivated, as Johnny is a strong supporter of George Bush and Antaeus Feldspar of Kerry.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> This shows how Antaeus Feldspar supports Kerry, which is fine, but Johnny is a strong supporter of Bush.</p>
<p>My hope is that Johnny will be able to have an article like any other famous person, minister, former KKK leader, or pro wrestler, and that Johnny and anyone connected with him and his ministry will in future have certain rules set in place that do not allow the wholesale deletion of the articles associated with him, but that they will be at least discussed.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading this long winded post. I have only been using WIKI for about a year myself so I need your help, I don't really know what else to do. I hope you can help. I personally think that Johnny's story is one that is beneficial to the cause of reconciliation between races and to the3 unity of society as a whole. It would be a shame if WIKI became known for having covert racists. Of course I hope that this is a misunderstanding and that all will be cleared up soon.</p>

<p>Also note his contributions: Featured articles: Â· African American literature -- My first featured article. Thanks to everyone who gave feedback. While I didn't start the article, I obsessed on it for an entire month and wrote most of the copy. Â· Ku Klux Klan -- I began work on this article after it became a featured article. Since then I've mediated several editorial disputes on the article (including one of which kept the article from being delisted as a FA) and made a large number of edits. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 00:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC) Nick.</p>
