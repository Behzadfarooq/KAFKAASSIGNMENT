<p>Anti-spam techniques can be broken into two broad categories: those that require actions by individuals, and those that can be automated.</p>

Since all anti-spam techniques can cause legitimate e-mail to be incorrectly identified as spam, many anti-spam systems are either not enabled by default or are configured to be very conservative about what will be identified as spam. Automated anti-spam systems are discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p>Address harvesting are methods that spammers use to obtain e-mail addresses of real people, and if the spammers can't learn of the address, the address is less likely to be sent spam.</p>
<p>Most people want new people to be able to contact them via e-mail and many people cannot hide their e-mail addresses. While preventing spammers from obtaining email addresses does not solve the spam problem any more than avoiding the high crime areas of a city solves crime, individuals need to weigh the risks.</p>
<p>One way that spammers obtain email addresses to target is to trawl the Web and Usenet for strings which look like addresses, using a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spambot.html" title="Spambot">spambot</a>. Contact forms and <a href="../../../a/d/d/Address_munging.html" title="Address munging">address munging</a> are good ways to prevent email addresses from appearing on these forums.</p>
<p>There are other ways that spammers can get addresses, such as <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_attack.html" title="Dictionary attack">dictionary attacks</a> in which the spammer generates a number of likely-to-exist addresses out of names and common words. For instance, if there is someone with the address <tt>adam@example.com</tt>, where 'example.com' is a popular ISP or mail provider, it is likely that he frequently receives spam.</p>

<p>Posting anonymously, or with a fake name and address, is one way to avoid "address harvesting," but users should ensure that the fake address is not valid. Users who want to receive legitimate email regarding their posts or Web sites can alter their addresses so humans can figure out but spammers cannot. For instance, <tt>joe@example.net</tt> might post as <tt>joeNOS@PAM.example.net.invalid</tt>, or display his email address as an image instead of text. Address munging, however, can cause legitimate replies to be lost. And if it's not the user's valid address, it has to be truly invalid, otherwise someone or some server will still get the spam for it.

<p>Contact forms allow users to send email by filling out forms in a web browser. The web server takes the form data, forwarding it to an email address. The user never sees the email address. Contact forms have the drawback that they require a website that supports server side scripts. They are also inconvenient to the message sender as they are not able to use their preferred e-mail client. Finally if the software used to run the contact forms is badly designed they can become spam tools in their own right.</p>

<p>Many email users sometimes need to give an address to a site without complete assurance that the site will not send out spam. One way to mitigate the risk is to provide a <i>disposable</i> email address—a temporary address which forwards email to a real account, which the user can disable or abandon. A number of services provide disposable address forwarding. Addresses can be manually disabled, can expire after a given time interval, or can expire after a certain number of messages have been forwarded.</p>

<p>Many modern mail programs incorporate <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_browser.html" title="Web browser">Web browser</a> functionality, such as the display of <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a>, URLs, and images. This can easily expose the user to pornographic or otherwise offensive images in spam. In addition, spam written in HTML can contain <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_bug.html" title="Web bug">web bugs</a> which allows spammers to see that the e-mail address is valid and has not been caught in spam filters. <a href="../../../j/a/v/JavaScript_6861.html" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> programs can be used to direct the user's Web browser to an advertised page, or to make the spam message difficult to close or delete.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-spam_techniques_%28e-mail%29.html" title="Edit section: Avoiding responding to spam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Avoiding responding to spam</span></h3>
<p>Spammers may regard responses to their messages—even responses of "Don't spam me"—as confirmation that an email address is valid. Likewise, many spam messages contain Web links or addresses which the user is directed to follow to be removed from the spammer's mailing list. In several cases, spam-fighters have tested these links, confirming they do not lead to the recipient address's removal—if anything, they lead to more spam.</p>
<p>It must be noted that sender addresses are often forged in spam messages, so that responding to spam may result in failed deliveries or may reach innocent e-mail users whose addresses have been abused. In many countries providing a false identity in that way is a criminal offense. <i>Criminal</i> spammers sometimes send their messages from purposely compromised computers in order to hide their real identity. <i>Benign</i> spammers reveal their identity, allowing recipients to respond.</p>
<p>In late 2003, the USA <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Trade_Commission_eba7.html" title="Federal Trade Commission">FTC</a> launched a public relations campaign to encourage email users to simply <i>never respond to a spam email—ever</i>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> This campaign stemmed from the tendency of casual email users to reply to spam, in order to complain and request the spammer to cease sending spam.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>, it is widely considered even more important to avoid responding to spam. Many ISPs have software that seek and destroy duplicate messages. Someone may see a spam and respond to it before it is cancelled by their server, which can have the effect of reposting the spam for them; since it is not a duplicate, the reposted copy will last longer.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-spam_techniques_%28e-mail%29.html" title="Edit section: Responding to spam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Responding to spam</span></h3>
<p>Some people advocate responding aggressively to spam—in other words, "spamming the spammer". The basic idea is to make spamming less attractive to the spammer, by increasing the spammer's overhead. Spamming is attractive because of its low cost (actually, the cost is shifted to the user). There are several ways to reach a spammer, but besides the caveats <a href="#Responding_to_spam" title="">above</a>, it may lead to retaliations by the spammer.</p>
<p><b>1. Replying directly to the spammer's email address.</b> <a href="http://pcworld.about.com/news/Apr162004id115702.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://pcworld.about.com/news/Apr162004id115702.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Just clicking "reply" will not work in most cases, since the great majority of the sender addresses are spoofed. In some cases, however, spammers do provide valid addresses, as in the case of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_fee_fraud.html" title="Advance fee fraud">Nigerian scams</a>. <a href="http://www.419eater.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.419eater.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p><b>2. Targeting the computers used to send out spam.</b> In 2005, IBM announced a service to bounce spam directly to the computers that send out spam. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/22/technology/ibm_spam/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/22/technology/ibm_spam/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Because the IP addresses are identified in the headers of every message, it would be possible to target those computers directly, sidestepping the problem of forged email addresses. In most cases, however, those computers do not belong to the real spammer, but to unsuspected users with unsecured or outdated systems, hijacked through <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malware.html" title="Malware">malware</a> and <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombie_computer.html" title="Zombie computer">controlled</a> at distance by the spammer.</p>
<p><b>3. Leaving messages on the spamvertised site.</b> People selling their wares need a tangible point of contact so that customers can reach them. Sometimes it is a telephone number, but most often is a web site containing <a href="../../../f/o/r/Form_%28web%29.html" title="Form (web)">web forms</a> through which customers can fill out orders or inquiries, or even "unsubscribe" requests. Since positive response to spam is probably much less than 1/10,000, if just a tiny percentage of users visit spam sites just to leave negative messages, the negative messages could easily outnumber positive ones, incurring costs for spammers to sort them out, not mentioning the cost in bandwidth. This was the approach used by the now-defunct <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Security_1b7b.html" title="Blue Security">Blue Security</a>'s <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Frog_a4a7.html" title="Blue Frog">Blue Frog</a> service: it looked for web forms on those sites and filled one form on behalf of the subscriber for each spam received, thus overwhelming spammer sites (Blue Frog service had up to a half million users). Ironically, it was Blue Frog's effectiveness that brought it down, by attracting a massive, retaliatory <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial-of-service.html" title="Denial-of-service">denial-of-service</a> attack from a spammer who refused to fold. After the demise of Blue Frog, other services have been trying to replicate its ideas, while avoiding its shortcomings.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-spam_techniques_%28e-mail%29.html" title="Edit section: Reporting spam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reporting spam</span></h3>
<p>Tracking down a spammer's ISP and reporting the offense often leads to the spammer's service being terminated. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to track down the spammer—and while there are some online tools to assist, they are not always accurate. Occasionally, spammers employ their own netblocks. In this case, the abuse contact for the netblock can be the spammer itself and can confirm your address.</p>

They provide automated or semi-automated means to report spam to ISPs. Some spam-fighters regard them as inaccurate compared to what an expert in the email system can do; however, most email users are not experts.</p>

<p>There are a number of services and software systems that mail sites and users can use to reduce the load of spam on their systems and mailboxes. Some of these depend upon rejecting email from Internet sites known or likely to send spam. Others rely on automatically analyzing the content of email messages and weeding out those which resemble spam. These two approaches are sometimes termed <i>blocking</i> and <i>filtering.</i></p>
<p>Blocking and filtering both reduce the amount of spam delivered to mailboxes, but blocking does more to alleviate the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandwidth.html" title="Bandwidth">bandwidth</a> cost of spam, since spam can be rejected before the message is sent. Filtering tends to be more thorough, since it examines the details of a message.</p>

<p>For example, spam can be greatly reduced by a number of simple checks that, unfortunately, few MTA vendors bother to implement.</p>
<p>In many situations, simply requiring a valid <a href="../../../f/q/d/FQDN_d36e.html" title="FQDN">FQDN</a> in the SMTP EHLO statement is enough to block 25% of incoming spam.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refusing connections from hosts that begin transmission prior to presentation of the receiving host's HELO banner</li>
<li>Refusing connections from hosts that give an invalid HELO - for example, a HELO that is not an <a href="../../../f/q/d/FQDN_d36e.html" title="FQDN">FQDN</a> or is an IP address not surrounded by square brackets</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<i><b>Invalid</b></i> HELO localhost
<i><b>Invalid</b></i> HELO 127.0.0.1
<i><b>Invalid</b></i> HELO domain.tld
<b>Valid</b> HELO [127.0.0.1]  
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Refusing connections from hosts that give an obviously fraudulent HELO - for example, issuing a HELO using the FQDN or an IP address that doesn't match the IP address of the connecting host</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<i><b>Fraudulent</b></i> HELO friend
<i><b>Fraudulent</b></i> HELO -232975332
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Refusing to accept email claiming to be from a hosted domain when the sending host has not authenticated</li>
<li>Refusing to accept email whose HELO/EHLO argument does not resolve in DNS. Unfortunately, some email system administrators ignore section 3.6 of RFC2821 and administer the MTA to use a nonresolvable argument to the HELO/EHLO command.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the examples above are fairly simple checks, all conform to existing standards and RFCs, and all are missing from most commercial <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_Transfer_Agent_71ee.html" title="Mail Transfer Agent">MTA</a> implementations available today.</p>

<p>Until recently, content filtering techniques relied on mail administrators specifying lists of words or <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_expression.html" title="Regular expression">regular expressions</a> disallowed in mail messages. Thus, if a site receives spam advertising "herbal Viagra", the administrator might place these words in the filter configuration. The mail server would thence reject any message containing the phrase.</p>
<p>Content based filtering can also filter based on content other than the words and phrases that make up the body of the message. Primarily, this means looking at the header of the email, the part of the message that contains information about the message, and not the body text of the message. Spammers will often <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoofing_attack.html" title="Spoofing attack">spoof</a> fields in the header in order to hide their identities, or to try to make the email look more legitimate than it is; many of these spoofing methods can be detected. Also, spam sending software often produces a header that violates the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822">RFC 2822</a> standard on how the email header is supposed to be formed.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of this static filtering are threefold: First, it is time-consuming to maintain. Second, it is prone to false positives. Third, these false positives are not equally distributed: manual content filtering is prone to reject legitimate messages on topics related to products advertised in spam. A system administrator who attempts to reject spam messages which advertise mortgage refinancing may easily inadvertently block legitimate mail on the same subject.</p>
<p>Finally, spammers can change the phrases and spellings they use, or employ methods to try to trip up phrase detectors. This means more work for the administrator. However, it also has some advantages for the spam fighter. If the spammer starts spelling "Viagra" as "V1agra" (see <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">leet</a>) or "Via_gra", it makes it harder for the spammer's intended audience to read their messages. If they try to trip up the phrase detector, by, for example, inserting an invisible-to-the-user HTML <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comment_%28computing%29.html" title="Comment (computing)">comment</a> in the middle of a word ("Via&lt;!----&gt;gra"), this sleight of hand is itself easily detectable, and is a good indication that the message is spam. And if they send spam that consists entirely of images, so that anti-spam software can't analyze the words and phrases in the message, the fact that there <i>is</i> no readable text in the body can be detected.</p>
<p>However, content filtering can also be implemented by examining the <a href="../../../u/r/l/URL_e6b3.html" title="URL">URLs</a> present (i.e. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamvertising.html" title="Spamvertising">spamvertising</a>) in an email message. This form of content filtering is much harder to disguise as the URLs must resolve to a valid domain name. Extracting a list of such links and comparing them to published sources of spamvertised domains is a simple and reliable way to eliminate a large percentage of spam via content analysis.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-spam_techniques_%28e-mail%29.html" title="Edit section: Statistical filtering">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Statistical filtering</span></h3>
<p><i>Statistical filtering</i> was first proposed in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> by Mehran Sahami <i>et al.</i>, at the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization. A statistical filter is a kind of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Document_classification.html" title="Document classification">document classification</a> system, and a number of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_learning.html" title="Machine learning">machine learning</a> researchers have turned their attention to the problem. Statistical filtering was popularized by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Graham_1672.html" title="Paul Graham">Paul Graham</a>'s influential <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> article <i><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/antispam.html" class="external text" title="http://www.paulgraham.com/antispam.html" rel="nofollow">A Plan for Spam</a></i>, which proposed the use of <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naive_Bayes_classifier_acb3.html" title="Naive Bayes classifier">naive Bayes classifiers</a> to predict whether messages are spam or not – based on collections of spam and nonspam ("ham") email submitted by users. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~horvitz/junkfilter.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://research.microsoft.com/~horvitz/junkfilter.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Statistical filtering, once set up, requires no maintenance per se: instead, users mark messages as spam or nonspam and the filtering software learns from these judgements. Thus, a statistical filter does not reflect the software author's or administrator's biases as to content, but it <i>does</i> reflect the <i>user's</i> biases as to content; a biochemist who is researching Viagra won't have messages containing the word "Viagra" flagged as spam, because "Viagra" will show up often in his or her legitimate messages. Spam emails containing the word "Viagra", however, do get filtered because of their unique content compared to legitimate messages. A statistical filter can also respond quickly to changes in spam content, without administrative intervention. Statistical filters should also look at message headers <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, thereby considering not just the content but also peculiarities of the transport mechanism of the email.</p>
<p>Spammers have attempted to fight statistical filtering by inserting many random but valid "noise" words or sentences into their messages while attempting to hide them from view, making it more likely that the filter will classify the message as neutral. (See <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_salad_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Word salad (computer science)">Word salad (computer science)</a>.) Attempts to hide the noise words include setting them in tiny <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typeface.html" title="Typeface">font</a> or the same colour as the background. However, these noise countermeasures seem to have been largely ineffective.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><i>Checksum-based filter</i> takes advantage of the fact that often, for any individual spammer, all of the messages he or she sends out will be mostly identical, the only differences being <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_bug.html" title="Web bug">web bugs</a>, and when the text of the message contains the recipient's name or email address.

<p>The advantage of this type of filtering is that it lets ordinary users help identify spam, and not just administrators, thus vastly increasing the pool of spam fighters. The disadvantage is that spammers can insert unique invisible gibberish—known as <i><a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashbusters.html" title="Hashbusters">hashbusters</a></i>—into the middle of each of their messages, thus making each message unique and having a different checksum.

<p>A number of systems have been proposed to allow acceptance of email from servers which have authenticated in some fashion as senders of only legitimate email. Many of these systems use the DNS, as do DNSBLs; but rather than being used to list nonconformant sites, the DNS is used to list sites authorized to send email, and (sometimes) to determine the reputation of those sites. Other methods of identifying ham and spam are still used. The A&amp;R allows much ham to be more reliably identified, which allows spam detectors to be made more sensitive without causing more false positive results. The increased sensitivity allows more spam to be identified as such. Also, A&amp;R methods tend to be less resource-intensive than other filtering methods, which can be skipped for messages identified by A&amp;R as ham.</p>

<p>Since a large percentage of spam has forged and invalid sender ("from") addresses, some spam can be detected by checking that this "from" address is valid. A mail server can try to verify the sender address by making an SMTP connection back to the mail exchanger for the address, as if it was creating a bounce, but stopping just before any e-mail is sent.</p>
<p>Callback verification is compliant with SMTP RFCs, but it has various drawbacks, mainly that it relies on external mail servers whose responses are not reliable, as well as the fact that it's using other people's resources to combat spam. At the same time, there will be numerous false negatives (spammers abusing real addresses) and some false positives (legitimate e-mail with undeliverable sender address).</p>

<p>There are a small number of organizations which offer IP whitelisting and/or licensed tags that can be placed in email (for a fee) to assure recipients' systems that the messages thus tagged are not spam. This system relies on legal enforcement of the tag. The intent is for email administrators to whitelist messages bearing the licensed tag.</p>
<ul>
<li>Habeas Safelist</li>
<li>Bonded Sender.</li>
</ul>
<p>A potential difficulty with such systems is that the licensing organization makes its money by licensing more senders to use the tag—not by strictly enforcing the rules upon licensees. A concern exists that senders whose messages are more likely to be considered spam who would accrue a greater benefit by using such a tag. The concern is that these factors form a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perverse_incentive.html" title="Perverse incentive">perverse incentive</a> for licensing organizations to be lenient with licensees who have offended. However, the value of a license would drop if it was not strictly enforced, and financial gains due to enforcement of a license itself can provide an additional incentive for strict enforcement. The Habeas mail classing system attempts to further address this issue by classing email according to origin, purpose, and permission. The purpose is to describe why the email is not likely spam, but permission based email.</p>

<p>Another approach for countering spam is to use a "ham password". Systems that use ham passwords ask unrecognised senders to include in their email a password that demonstrates that the email message is a "ham" (not spam) message. Typically the email address and ham password would be described on a web page, and the ham password would be included in the "subject" line of an email address. Ham passwords are often combined with filtering systems, to counter the risk that a filtering system will accidentally identify a ham message as a spam message.</p>

<p>As a refinement to stamp systems was the idea of requiring that the micropayment only be retained if the recipient considered the email to be abusive. This addressed the principal objection to stamp systems: popular free legitimate mailing list hosts would be unable to continue to provide their services if they had to pay postage for every message they sent out.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> has announced that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> is working on a “ magic solution” to the spam problem that requires that so-called “unknown senders”, i.e. senders not on the Accepted List of the recipient, post “the electronic equivalent of a” stamp whose value would be lost to the sender only if the recipient disapproves of the email <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Gates said that Microsoft favors other solutions in the short-term, but would rely on the contingent payment solution to solve the spam problem over the longer run. Microsoft, <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a> as well as <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> have recently introduced systems that allow commercial senders to avoid filters if they obtain a certificate or certification, which is lost to the sender if recipients complain.</p>
<p>The intent of such "sender-at-risk" solutions, which impose a significant cost to the sender only if the recipient rejects the message subsequent to receiving the email, is to deter spam by making it economically prohibitive to send unwanted email messages, while allowing legitimate emailers to send messages at little or no expense.</p>

<p>A <i>tarpit</i> is any server software which intentionally responds pathologically slowly to client commands. By running a tarpit which treats acceptable mail normally and known spam slowly or which appears to be an open mail relay, a site can slow down the rate at which spammers can inject messages into the mail facility. Many systems will simply disconnect if the server doesn't respond quickly, which will eliminate the spam. However, a few legitimate e-mail systems will also not deal correctly with these delays.</p>

<p>A greeting delay is a deliberate pause introduced by an SMTP server before it sends the SMTP greeting banner to the client. The client is supposed to wait until it has received this banner before it sends any data to the server. (per <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2821.html#s3.1" class="external text" title="http://rfc.net/rfc2821.html#s3.1" rel="nofollow">RFC2821 3.1</a>). Many spam-sending applications do not wait to receive this banner, and instead start sending data once the TCP connection is complete. The server can detect this, and drop the connection.</p>
<p>There are some legitimate sites that play "fast and loose" with the SMTP specifications, and may be caught by this mechanism. It also has a tendency to interact badly with sites that perform Callback Verification, as common callback verification systems have timeouts that are much shorter than those mandated by <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2821.html#s4.5.3.2" class="external text" title="http://rfc.net/rfc2821.html#s4.5.3.2" rel="nofollow">RFC2821 4.5.3.2</a>.</p>

<p>Another approach is simply an imitation MTA which gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server which gives the appearance of being an open proxy. Spammers who probe systems for open relays/proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and potentially revealing information about themselves and the source of spam to the unexpected alert entity (in comparison to the anticipated careless or unskilled operator typically in charge of open relay MTA systems) that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to <a href="../../../d/n/s/DNSBL_6327.html" title="DNSBL">DNSBLs</a>, or store them for analysis.</p>

<p>One difficulty occurs in implementing opt-in mailing lists: many means of gathering user e-mail addresses remain susceptible to forgery. For instance, if a company puts up a Web form to allow users to subscribe to a mailing list about its products, a malicious person can enter other people's e-mail addresses — to harass them, or to make the company appear to be spamming. (To most anti-spammers, if the company sends e-mail to these forgery victims, it <i>is</i> spamming, albeit inadvertently.)</p>
<p>To prevent this abuse, MAPS and other anti-spam organizations encourage that all mailing lists use <b>confirmed opt-in</b> (also known as <i>verified opt-in</i> and (by spammers themselves) as <i>double opt-in</i>). That is, whenever an address is presented for subscription to the list, the list software should send a confirmation message to that address. The confirmation message contains no advertising content, so it is not construed to be spam itself — and the address is not added to the list unless the recipient responds to the confirmation message.
