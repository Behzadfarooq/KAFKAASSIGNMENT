<p>There's a large body of recent research suggesting anti-depressants either have a very small or non-existent effect, and that anywhere from 75-90% of their efficacy is accounted for by variations on the placebo effect (50-75% from the classic placebo effect itself, and another 15-25% from the unblinding effects that take place in studies that use sugar pills instead of active placebos—which is many of them). Some research even indicates that some of the physiological changes in brain function are mimicked by placebos as well. This is obviously controversial, but I think needs to be at least mentioned. Is anyone familiar with this able to write something up? If not, I'll try to put something in eventually. For reference, some papers on the subject include:</p>

<p>Well, that is all well and good but I think all the antidepressant articles here on wikipedia seem to focus on the negative with little to know discussion of the benefits. And there are many, many, many studies showing the effectiveness of these medications. Most pschiatrists, many of them intelligent competant people have found these meds very effective in treating depression. There needs to be more coverage of this.</p>

<p>I do worry that the controversy surrounding antidepressants is in danger of overshadowing what is surely its raison d'etre, which is the wellbeing of depression sufferers. Just a thought. <a href="../../../c/b/h/User%7ECbh_2fae.html" title="User:Cbh">Chris</a> 10:59, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, that's precisely the controversy---whether antidepressants contribute to the wellbeing of depression sufferers, or fail to do so. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 21:55, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Precisely. The "controversy" originated with case histories of depressed patients whose condition either did not improve or seriously worsened when they were treated with ADs, and with patients who discontinued ADs and found themselves substantially worse than before they began treatment. Even people like Glenmullen and Healy aren't denying that drug therapy has its uses, they're questioning the absolute faith in drug therapy on the part of psychiatry, precisely BECAUSE of their concern for the well-being of people with depression. The reason most WP articles on this subject contain large amounts of information about the controversy is because the controversy is very real and taken very seriously by anyone who has studied the possible negative effects of antidepressants (or indeed, experienced them). It would be POV to play this down, not to mention it 82.37.58.152 22:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>This discussion topic was apparently created by 130.126.49.10 way back in 2003, but it doesn't look like it has been discussed or implemented yet. As far as I know, isoniazid has no MAOI or antidepressant efficacy, and iproniazid was the first synthetic MAOI and antidepressant. This is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1999242&amp;itool=iconabstr&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1999242&amp;itool=iconabstr&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">one source</a> which could be cited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, perhaps the article should mention that <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmala_alkaloids.html" title="Harmala alkaloids">harmala alkaloids</a> and other naturally occuring MAOIs existed and were used medicinally and spiritually long before the synthesis of iproniazid, although these MAOIs were generally completely impractical for the treatment of depression. Perhaps that belongs on the MAOI page, instead.<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluoborate_f829.html" title="User:Fluoborate">Fluoborate</a> 04:45, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>First of all, I reordered the classes list to put the drugs in rough chronological order. The MAOIs came first, then the TCAs, etc. Second, I removed the class of "norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor". I did this because, unlike serotonin, norepinephrine does not have a class of drugs that <i>selectively</i> targets its reuptake (at least as far as I know. If I am wrong, please correct me). Instead, there are a number of drugs, such as Venlafexine, Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine, the TCAs, etc, that target norepinephrine <i>as well</i> as either serotonin, dopomaine, or both. So a seperate class doesn't really fit. Thirdly, I removed the drugs given as examples after some of the classes. Having only examples for one or two classes seemed strange, and some of the examples were wrong. Mostly it just seemed like clutter. <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefenestration_a34b.html" title="User:Defenestration">Defenestration</a> 19:26, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I was wrong. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors DO exist, only they are called Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (NARIs), to avoid the confusion of mixing acronyms with SNRIs, I presume. Two exist, reboxetine and atomoxetine, though neither are approved for treating depression in the US. I added a link for the NARIs, and may getting around to writing up a page for them eventually. <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefenestration_a34b.html" title="User:Defenestration">Defenestration</a> 21:59, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To quote from the article: "Certain antidepressants can initially make depression worse, can induce anxiety, or can make a patient aggressive, dysphoric or acutely suicidal." Is what's being alluded to here by use of dysphoric the blanket concept of <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysphoria.html" title="Dysphoria">dysphoria</a> or the concept of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_dysphoria.html" title="Gender dysphoria">gender dysphoria</a>?

<dd>Dysphoric almost certainly refers to dysphoric mood in this context and definetly does not refer to gender dysphoria. Also while antidepressants would be prescribed to a transexual suffering from Major Depressive Disorder or an anxiety disorder, the suggestion that it is 'often' used to treat transsexualism is categorically wrong. djheart 19:46, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>This is unclear. What sort of "interaction" do occurs in the brain, when people take these drugs.</p>
<p>How does this affect mood? And who says so, and why do they only "believe" it? Don't they know for sure?</p>
<p>What sorts of studies have been done on the effectiveness of these medications? How much better are they than placebos? How much better than various kinds of therapy?</p>
<p>Dr. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_D._Burns_035e.html" title="David D. Burns">David D. Burns</a>, a practioner of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational-emotive_therapy.html" title="Rational-emotive therapy">rational-emotive therapy</a>, claims a high success rate.

<dl>
<dd>It is generally known that antidepressants interfere with neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. It has little to do with belief - this has been confirmed experimentally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All registered antidepressants have a measurable effect on mood. Some are only marginally better than placebos, while others can cause a significant improvement. Natural counterparts (St John's wort) do appear to have some effectivity but with more side-effects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rational-emotive therapy is one of the modalities used in clinical depression, and moderately succesful. It is not just Dr Burns who propagates this approach. Psychotherapy and cognitive therapy should ideally be offered to all patients with depression. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 03:46, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I moved the controversy efficacy section back up under mechanism of action. I know this may seem out of order. I did this because I think these drugs are too often considered to be amazing and mostly a positive treatment. So I wanted some questioning about that assumption to be right there near the top of the article. If that is unacceptable, and it MUST be moved then so be it.</p>
<p>I also added back the references because people should be able to access some of the studies question this treatment. The drug companies spend billions hyping themselves and never admitting to any wrong doing or problems - ever. So I think in this public forum, there should be some voice that allows for a different message - especially a message punctuated by researchers doing risky research.

<dd>Tshann, I agree there should be a section on this subject, but citing a long list of references is completely off-balance. Please select one or two solid studies or commentaries from this list, but do not flood the article just because these articles are mildly "critical of antidepressants". There's a lot of Kirsch work - are you sure the initial list was not an attempt at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Vanity</a>? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 08:23, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jfdwolff, I'm confused. Why is citing a long list of references off-balance? I think when you look at the overall size of this article on antidepressants - the bulk of it suggests that antidepressants are an application of scientific medicine. I think it is WAY to unbalanced in favor of that assumption. When reading through the articles on those links I've pasted in, it is quite clear that much of the reality of antidepressants is not much more than industry hype. The bulk of this article is about theory and opinion, but what about prove of efficacy. Medicine is suppossed to be able to show efficacy, otherwise theories are simply theories. Sure that is my opinion, but I think citing those studies is critical in balancing out the overhype that antidepressants get. In addition, the bottom of the article has little or no reference to the contoversy about antidepressants. As for Vanity in citing the articles, again I'm confused. I looked at the concept of vanity from the standpoint of Wikipedia. It suggests that authors are using an article to promote themselves in some way. I fail to see how citing some controversial antidepressant links/studies has anything to do with me, my image, or my gain. I'm sure you had more than a passing reason to use that term, so please explain yourself. ThanksTshann 16:42, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think so. Historically, it seemed to be a catch-all for anything that wasn't categorised as an MAOI, a TCA or an SSRI. I think I remember at one point the tetracyclics might've been included in that category. <a href="../../../c/b/h/User%7ECbh_2fae.html" title="User:Cbh">Chris</a> 15:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel the need to describe a few possible changes to this article, partly drawing together comments made by various people above which don't seem to have been acted on:</p>
<p>1) 'Antidepressant' doesn't necessarily mean a medication, or even treatment. This usage occurs in the titles of scientific articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T4S-49JVH73-7&amp;_coverDate=10%2F01%2F2003&amp;_alid=512766709&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=4982&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=29c308a15f82df9866679f1aa9267bf2" class="external text" title="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T4S-49JVH73-7&amp;_coverDate=10%2F01%2F2003&amp;_alid=512766709&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=4982&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=29c308a15f82df9866679f1aa9267bf2" rel="nofollow">Antidepressant effects of light therapy combined with sleep deprivation are influenced by a functional polymorphism within the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (2003)</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/8/M497" class="external text" title="http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/8/M497" rel="nofollow">The Efficacy of Exercise as a Long-term Antidepressant in Elderly Subjects (2003)</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/aseb/2002/00000031/00000003/00371756" class="external text" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/aseb/2002/00000031/00000003/00371756" rel="nofollow">Does Semen Have Antidepressant Properties? (2002)</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>and manuals e.g. "Seasonal affective disorder and the use of light as an antidepressant." from NIMH, 1988.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>or phrases like e.g. "Negative ions are a natural anti-depressant."</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps this page could include a section on non-medication usage, or are separate pages needed..</p>
<p>2) The layout seems quite unclear to me. I think the intro could be reworded and extended to cover the basics and range of issues more. I think there could be a subsection on efficacy/effectiveness, describing the assertions and counter-assertions and main related studies &amp; reviews (perhaps divided according to type med or disorder) rather than just a controversy section. What rationale is there for listing things like St John's Wort towards the end as 'Alternative' and not in the main section listing types of antidepressants. I think adverse effects would be a better subheading than side-effects and more consistent with the wikipedia page on that topic. Various random-seeming subheadings towards the end..</p>
<p>3) Does seem to need a footnote-type reference section, there being a lot of unsourced strong or informal claims, like "The main classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy", "Although these drugs are clearly effective in treating depression", "a successful antidepressant trial involves at least 50% of the test subjects on the drug responding to the medication", "It is generally not a good idea to take antidepressants without a prescription", "Use of antidepressants should be monitored by a psychiatrist, but..."</p>
<p>Don't mean to seem critical but didn't want to start over-editing without mention here.</p>

<p>I've rewritten the intro to try and frame the above points (+ avoid the copyright issue if there is one). I forgot to sign in first. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 23:34, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've rewritten and expanded the history section. I'm planning to reorganise the various sections below it some time soon, if there's no reply I'll take it as no objection (in advance at least) to the idea. I'll also make all the references inline. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 18:56, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a box listing all the classes &amp; members (ATC N06A box) and below that a near-duplicate list of classes. The ATC box is authoratative but dense and yet doesn't list notable trade names etc. I'm thinking this could go at the end of the article as a reference, to be used as the source for a more simple list of classes up-front (i.e. the one that's there).</p>
<p>The list of prominent antidepressants doesn't seem to be derived from an objective measure. I'm thinking it could be based on a recent list of the best-selling antidepressants, and matched up with most common trade names and the list of categories. I'll try something like this unless any objections or other suggestions <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 00:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've had a go at this, but keeping the ATC box (with an intro) and basing the notable list on 2005 US prescription sales from RxList<a href="http://www.rxlist.com/top200.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rxlist.com/top200.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Probably missed some in the list - just looked over it and only up to no. 100. Hopefully over time, other drugs that might be rated as notable by other methods, or by sales in other countries or globally, could be added to the list if they have a source. Don't konw whether it should be kept to a top 10 or top 15 or something... <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 21:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
