Ben Charles Padilla Pic added, hope it looks OK. Thanks for the Barnstar award, I'm delighted. Very thoughtful of you. I don't know how you can tolerate 106F, the max in Bristol today (2nd July) is 65F, it's well into summer yet we're getting frequent showers and the sun is weak. I'm on my summer holiday to the North Devon coast (only about 200km from here) from Wednesday July 7th to Tuesday July 13th. Our sons aren't coming (John and Michael) they don't like our kind of holiday which consists of lots of lazing about and shopping (at great length) in the local towns. So it's just the two of us (which is what I prefer). Best Wishes, Adrian, Adrian Pingstone 20:05, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

A page merge Hello again. The "List of Puerto Rican television series" was merged into "List of U.S. television series: There are now two main sections in that article.

Lori Hacking The information you're adding about her husband is an attempt at trying to make him guilty by winking. "We never said he was guilty, we just put all of this guilty-sounding stuff into the article." The items you had in there were more of the prosecution case. If he's brought to trial for her disapperance, then it could be added, but until then it's prejudicial. And her being Hispanic is unimportant. Laci Peterson is Hispanic, too. RickK 04:15, Jul 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not the WORDS you're using, it's HOW you're using them. You are using POV phrasing to make it clear that you believe that Mark Hacking is guilty. I will admit, that everything that I had read had led me to believe that he had voluntarily committed himself to the mental hospital, but now it looks like that's not true, and the police had him committed when they found him running around naked.

Thomas Hoffmarck Antonio, your Thomas Hoffmarck entry desperately needs updating. You posted it today, Aug 2, and you say he is about to go on a very long run (it started July 13).

Hello! Hello, Antonio. Thank you ever so much for the barnstar.&#160;:) I'm honoured that you consider me a friend, but I think you might have been misled in thinking I've done "great work at this site", and that I'm one of the "in crowd"! Didn't you hear that I joined the infamous Red Faction??&#160;:) Oh, but that page seems to have been deleted now. I wonder what happened to it... Anyway, I've been away from Wikipedia for the last few months. I got rather fed up with some of the ways in which it is run, and the direction in which it is heading, and I didn't feel I had the stamina to argue about it all. So I just disappeared instead. Yes, I know, it's terrible! But I haven't disappeared for good. I think there will always be mysterious forces pulling me back here... But anyway, how are things going with you? I see you're still working hard here, doing good stuff. I hope you're still having fun doing it.&#160;:) -- Oliver P. 01:21, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

Sigourney Weaver and the Marines At least four different people have questioned Sigourney Weaver's inclusion on List of actors who played Marines in movies but you keep putting her name back on the list. Maybe you should go back and rewatch the "Alien" movies; her character, Ripley, was a starship officer not a marine. There were marines in the second and fourth movies of the series, but Ripley wasn't one of them. MK 06:38, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm quoting an extract from the response Antonio posted on my Talk page. I've always found it easier to follow what's being said if both halves of the discussion are posted on the same page.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sigourmey was a "Space Marine" in the movie, which, assuming the movie was futuristic, because I havent seen it in about a year and a half, but remember the movie was released in 1979 and, well, soldiers in the sky..anyways, she was a "Space Marine" which means that the directors thought that in the future there would be Marines in space, which in turn makes her a...Marine. &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>The first movie in the series, Alien, was released in 1979. There were no Marines in that movie; the entire cast was the crew of a civilian transport ship.</p>
<p>In the second movie, Aliens (1986), there were Marines. Hicks was a Marine; Hudson was a Marine; Lt Gorman and Sgt Apone were Marines; Vasquez and Drake and Frost were Marines. But Ripley was not a Marine; she was a civilian. Just because she was on a planet with Marines doesn't make her a Marine. In the third movie she was on a planet with convicts; that doesn't make her a convict. MK 07:23, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thanks Antonio, thanks for the very kind words you left on my talk page. I'm glad to hear that your dad considers me a buddy (God knows, I don't need any ex-U.S. Marines on my enemy list) -- while I disagree with what he was doing with the title of those articles, there were a couple of comments sent his way that were definitely more harshly expressed that they needed to be. Re Sonora -- cool! I used to live in Hermosillo, working at the Ford assembly plant there. Never made it to Puerto Peñasco, though -- weekend trips were either down to the coast (Guaymas, Bahía Kino) or up to the border (Nogales &amp; Tucson). Saludos, –Hajor 14:34, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eroticism in film The place to discuss articles is on their respective "talk" page, not your personal page, Antonio. I'm posting this here just to make sure you get that message.</p>
<p>That list is useless for the purpose of advising parents of what movies are un/acceptable for their children. It is so astonishingly incomplete, and will always be incomplete, in part because there simply isn't room for every movie with nudity in it. If you're counting on it to be complete, you'll be making a grievous mistake. Just between you and me, if you did, I'd call you an unfit parent. A parent who wants that kind of information needs to use resources that are actively maintained by people who have an interest in providing that info (e.g. MPAA, Dove Foundation, and I'm sure there are others). In fact, I'm going to support the removal of that list just to make sure no parent makes the mistake of using it as a guide for selecting movies for their kids, because it's not. Tverbeek 21:55, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
reposted here from my Talk page, at Antonio's request:</p>
<p>From what Ive seen, youre pretty new here. No one has even given you a welcome salute.</p>
<p>I see no point in keeping everything ever put on my Talk page on display; I prefer tidiness. If you want to manage yours differently, that's up to you, but don't assume that we all do things your way. For what it's worth, I've used Wikipedia for quite a while, and edited articles for months before I bothered registering, so they don't show up in my history. And I've been online for over twenty years, working on collaborative resources for much of that time, first on CompuServe, later on Usenet, and on the web (i.e. running my own informational web sites) for 9 years so far. To say nothing of my offline experience as a freelance writer and an editor. Go ahead and dismiss me as a newbie if that'll help you feel better, but I'm just sitting here thinking that you seem pretty inexperienced. How dare you call me an unfit parent just because Id want more websites with information about which movies have nudity or not? If anything, that makes me a GOOD PARENT. Do you have children?</p>
<p>I didn't say you were unfit. I said that if you relied on that list to be complete, you would be unfit. I realise that English doesn't convey "subjunctive mood" very well, but that's what I was saying: If you did that, you would be unfit. If you're smarter than that, then good: maybe you're still a good parent. Your assesion that the list is unneccesary is entirely a point of view,</p>
<p>And your assertion that it belongs there is POV as well. Why should yours win? and what's more, no one had opposed before.</p>
<p>If you look at Talk:Eroticism in film, you'll see it has received criticism as a bad article. I think the reason no one removed the list before was a combination of two factors: 1) It's a pretty new article, and one that very few people have looked at (as you can see from its history), and 2) Nobody considered how misleading - and potentially harmful - the list would be if someone tried to use it the way you're suggesting. The more lists of movies with nude or sensual scenes we have for parents to decide on the net whether their children should watch it or not, the better.</p>
<p>That would only be true if they were all good lists. I'll explain further down why I don't think one is good for that purpose, and never will be. Furthermore, an encyclopedia is a palce to EDUCATE people accurately about all topics as much as possible,</p>
<p>"...as much as possible"? No. If it were, Wikipedia wouldn't put a 32K limit on articles. (There is no way to fit a list of all films with erotic content in a 32K article.) The purpose of a encyclopedia (and Wikipedia in particular) is to provide concise information that serves as an introduction to a topic. It is not - and never will be - complete. "More" is not always "better", and the mark of a good editor is knowing when to cut things out. and, the nature of Wikipedia makes it perfectly good for that list to be there.</p>
<p>I disagree completely. Wikipedia is good for collecting information that (pretty much) everyone agrees upon. There are arguments, but in the long run, it ends up with a consensus of what the facts are. The problem is that there is no consensus on what movies are inappropriate for children to see because of eroticism. That's not a matter of fact, it's a matter of opinion. You'll have a hard enough time getting people to reach a consensus on what eroticism is. Violent rape scenes? I don't think so. (They're not erotic, they're violent, which is a whole different issue.) But someone put several of them in the list. A half-second peek at someone's underwear? Not in my opinion; I'd be more concerned about an hour and a half of someone in a sexy outfit that didn't show any underwear or excess skin. But there are "peekaboo" scenes included in the list. And what about scenes where people keep their clothes on but talk about sex or use vulgar language? They're not in the list (no nudity or underwear), and if someone started adding them, you'd have people taking them out, because they don't think the films are erotic. Next, there's never going to be a consensus on what's appropriate for children. I think that Tom Cruise dancing in his underpants and a long shirt in an empty house in Risky Business is perfectly fine for boys of any age to see. (Perhaps you disagree, but that just proves my point.) But it's in the list, and there's really no way to tell from a list that it'd be OK for me and my 8-year-old son to watch that scene together, but that my 13-year-old daughter maybe shouldn't. The only way a list of films is going to be useful to a responsible parents is if that list has been compiled by someone who shares their opinions about eroticism and it's appropriateness for children. Some "family watchdog" groups have lists like that, and if you agree with their criteria, that'll help. But if you're going to do a responsible job of checking out movies before you let your kids see them, you need to do more than just read some lists. Read reviews of the movies. The MPAA explains why they gave a movie an "R" or "PG-13" rating. Most online guides for parents will go into even more detail. They do a much better job, because that's what they're there for. Wikipedia was not created to serve as a guide for parenting. It was set up as a repository for generally-agreed-upon facts, not subjective and inconsistent opinions of whether a given movie is "erotic" and whether the specific nudity or underwear seen is inappropriate for children of a certain age or gender. Most of these issues are covered in the article itself, by the way. Did you read it, or are you too fixated on the list? Before you know me, dont even come and judge my abilities as a parent. You don't know me, you can't judge me. And as far as talking to people on article pages, I think thats what chickens do.</p>
<p>That's funny, because that's exactly what I think of your approach. If you have the courage of your convictions, put your comments about the content of the article on the article's Talk page, where everyone with an interest in them can see them and criticise them if they're full of shit. Putting your comments in a single person's Talk page where only he is going to see them serves only one purpose: to hide them from the public. If you have something to say against someone, say it on the person's talk page.</p>
<p>I admit, I started talking about you personally, which is why I posted it on your personal page. But Tregoweth was talking about the article (not you), and you told him to put his comments on your Talk instead. That makes no sense (and strikes me as rather self-centered). Thank you and God bless you.</p>
<p>Can we please leave your religion out of this? (And what's with the link? Do you think we're too stupid to understand what "God bless you" means without it?) One last thing: As you go on at this website, you will learn not to be offended by people re editing what you did, and that you are not always right.</p>
<p>It wasn't my edit that you undid, Antonio (at least not the first time you did it). It was someone else's edit - which, after thinking about, I agreed with - that upset me. I had to learn that too.</p>
<p>It doesn't appear that you have learned that. So far you're reverted the edits of two people who think that the list should be removed, and you seem pretty intent on keeping it regardless of what anyone says. Sincerely yours, "Antonio WNBA players for sex Martin"</p>
<p>Is this the kind of example you set for your children? Tverbeek</p>
<p>Look Tverbeek, youre a retard. All your experience online doesnt prove anything.</p>
<p>It proves that I'm not some clueless newbie like you assumed. That's the only point I was trying to make. The way you answer my answers tells me youre a moron.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I'm not. I don't expect you to believe me (because I know you don't want to), but I scored in the 90th-99th percentile on the entrance exams for college and grad school (and law school, but I decided not to go), graduated from two colleges near the top of my class, and a couple IQ tests I've taken put me at 150 or above. I'm not trying to brag here... just to point out that you're very much mistaken. By contrast, the fact that you resort to childish name-calling like this doesn't make you sound all that smart yourself. Once again, youre a chicken for trying to answer me without me seeing.</p>
<p>You put your comments on my Talk page, so that's where I responded to them. I figured you'd look there, so I didn't think it was necessary to put them on your Talk page. (And I was right; you did.) I'm not trying to hide anything from you. But since you seem to want it on your Talk page, I'll repost this whole thing there. Will that make you happy? I am a VERY well respected member of Wikipedia and , maybe for your own chagrin, many of the most influential people here like the job that I have done.</p>
<p>That doesn't give you the right to go around calling people "moron" and "retard" just because you don't agree with them, or they said something that offended you. Looking at your Talk page, I see that there are people you chum around with who like you, but you've also had problems grasping how an encyclopedia should be written (and IMHO still don't really get it) and you also seem to have some problems getting in fights with people. Go figure. But you are one of those people who has to win every time.</p>
<p>Pot. Kettle. Black. IF YOU ANSWER ME IN ANY WAY AND IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT IVE SAID TO YOU, I WILL COMPLAIN TOO. I HAVE all the prove that you have attacked me and that YOU started this. So dont even SPEAK TO ME, ABOUT ME OR AGAINST ME IN ANY OTHER WAY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND????</p>
<p>You can throw tantrums like this and complain to mommy all you want, but I have every right to speak to you, to speak about you, and even to speak against you when I think you're wrong. Just like you're doing, posting personally insulting messages on my Talk page, way out of proportion to any implied insults I've posted regarding you. And at least I HAVE THE BALLS to talk to you straight to your face, not behind other pages. And I WILL ALWAYS SAY GOD BLESS YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE MY BROTHER IN GOD.</p>
<p>Is this how God calls you to treat your brother? Are these the kinds of things that Jesus would say? BUT YOU DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO. I CAN TELL PEOPLE AT THIS SITE WHATEVER IS IN MY MIND!</p>
<p>But you're telling me that I'm not allowed to? That's hypocrisy. So please put an end to all this stupidity you started.</p>
<p>God bless you and help you find a way to manage your own internal problems.</p>
<p>Best of luck with yours. Sincerely yours, "Antonio I Call Myself whatever I want Martin"</p>
<p>Go right ahead. It's your own credibility at stake. Tverbeek 13:21, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC) I appreciate your apology on my Talk page. I never intended to insult you, so I'm sorry if it came across that way. I guess we'll see what happens with Eroticism in film. I do want to clarify one point, though: I'm not a lawyer. I took the entrance exam for law school, but I was more interested in computer science and the creative arts, so that's what my two degrees are in, and what I currently do professionally. Law's just a hobby. Tverbeek 00:39, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

Mediation request Hi there Antonio -- before I did anything about the request, I wanted to find out if you have listed the article at requests for comment (as per the Dispute Resolution Policy).</p>

Southwest Airlines Antonio, your dad mentioned that you wanted to know if I work for Southwest Airlines. I'm sorry, but I don't. I work at a hospital. Just out of curiousity, what made you wonder if I worked for SW?  :-) SWAdair | Talk 03:00, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your user page Hi there. The Poems and 100 famous women I'd do sections of your user page seem like they might be inappropriate and potentially offensive. Wikipedia:User page#What should I avoid?) notes that</p>
<p>Discussion not related to Wikipedia Excessive personal information (more than a couple of pages) Opinion pieces not related to Wikipedia or other non-encyclopedic material should generally be avoided on user pages. Also, RuPaul is actually a guy. Cheers!</p>

Your father's nomination Basically, nominating your father makes it look like the nomination has to do with something other than his qualifications for adminship. Particularly when the nomination is repeated, it begins to resemble cases where someone was obsessed with getting adminship, like Alex Plank, which is a pretty sure way not to get it. If it was totally obvious that your father should be made an admin, it wouldn't bother me to let you "do the honors" and nominate him, but the first time around he was pretty clearly not qualified. This time it's a closer call, but having you as the nominator lets people suspect there is some kind of hidden agenda, which is detrimental to the nomination's chances for success. --Michael Snow 16:00, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

Barnstar Wow! Thank you for the barnstar. This has been a week of surprises. I had gone to my user page to click on my New pages link at the top and noticed something different. Wait. What's this?

Reply Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your message on my vote on your request to become a bureaucrat. I haven't been here as long as you have, but I've been around long enough to see some of your work. I do not have any doubt that you are a good and committed Wikipedian, but being a bureaucrat is pretty well the most 'elevated' role available to most of the community (I'm certainly never going to be a developer or have a Wikiholiday named for me) and I'd need to be able to take any request seriously before I could support it. At the very least, I'd expect the person making the request to have learned to spell bureaucrat, for example, and to display a greater understanding of why they want the role than the phrase 'sounds cool' implies.</p>
<p>Yours in Wikilove</p>

Bureaucrat ¡Hola Camarada Antonio! I seen you request for Bureacratship, personally I like you, and your father is a great editor but I'm unsure if your really up to it. Also the odd message you left on the didn't help but if you could convince me of otherwise i'll change my vote to support.--<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlato_bf19.html" title="User:Plato">Comrade Nick @)---^--</a> 11:13, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

Redaction Troubles Antonio, the whole User:AntonioMartin page is redacted in third person, but then there´s a parragraph wich starts "My father is Tony, who I am ... I officially became ..." where it should start like "Antonio Martin´s father is Tony...."</p>
<p>I also think that by voting yourself in a Presidential Election, you don´t became an official candidate for President. And in President of the United States you can find the proof which I quote:</p>
<p>"The president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States (or a citizen of the United States at the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted), be at least 35 years of age, and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years."</p>

Blacks in Puerto Rico You stated in the talk page that the last sentence didn't make any sense. Let me try to shed some light. In the USA if someone looks white, blonde hair, green eyes, etc.. but their great grandfather was black then that person is considered black for most people (the one drop thing), while in Puerto Rico, eventhough you might have black ancestry if you look white, then you are considered white. Phenotype, genotype. Phenotype is the way a gene shows physically, and the genoty is the gene you have, so in a way that's what i meant to say.. If you think of a better way to say it, feel free to edit. keep up the good work here.</p>

MacGyverMagic for adminship You welcomed me to wikipedia months ago. Well, I'm still here and I've decided to take the plunge and self-nominate for adminship to make the work I do a lot easier.

<p>Article Licensing Hi, I've started a drive to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer. The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles. Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles. Over 90% of people asked have agreed. For More Information:</p>

Newsletter from Adrian Hi Antonio from Adrian. I’m sorry I haven’t written to you for a long time, there’s no excuse, I’m just lazy! A few weeks back we went to London (without the kids) for five days and had a great time. It’s odd but our capital city is only 120 miles (190km) away and I’ve only been there for a couple of day trips! So we got a hotel in Westminster (near Parliament and the Thames) and saw the sights, using the underground, taxis and buses. I took zillions of photos and when we got home I put pics onto 63 London articles. The best bit was going on the London Eye, a gigantic wheel on the banks of the river. Its 450 feet high, so big that each capsule holds 25 people! You get one revolution of the capsule you’re in, which takes 30 minutes. We went to an evening sitting of Parliament but sadly no well known politicians were there. We queued for about an hour. The security was very tight, we were frisked and went through two metal detectors as well as filling in a form with our names and addresses.</p>
<p>Winter has just begun but it’s mild today (9C at midday). Winters have definitely been getting milder of recent years so we’ll probably only get a few days of light snow here in Bristol. Which means (if the Weather Gods are reading this) that we’ll certainly get several feet lingering for months like in 1947 and 1963.</p>
<p>I haven’t been photographing at airports since October, I can only go at weekends because Barbara needs the car all week. Some weekends she wants go shopping and do other trips so there’s not many days that I can go (and the weather has to be sunny). However, the very next nice weekend day I’m off to Heathrow.</p>
<p>I’m just starting on a major job of illustrating cars (old and new) from the car shows I went to through the year so that should occupy me for a couple of weeks. Best Wishes, Adrian - Adrian Pingstone 13:45, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

References please Hello. I recently saw your article about Angel Melendez, and when I did a Google search, I found no hits. Could you give me some references?</p>
<p>Thanks. --Fibonacci 02:56, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Copied from my talk page:</p>
<p>Hi Fibo! First of all, thank you for rwading the article about Angel Melendez that I originated. It is always charming to know someone else reads articles originated by me. Well, I saw "Party Monster", and I read about Michael Alig. I also used several Internet references, such as this one: one can find many features about Mr. Melendez here (<a href="http://americanmafia.com/" class="external free" title="http://americanmafia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://americanmafia.com/</a>). The fact I am interested in Latin Americans and I am Puerto Rican, and he lived in New York, New York, which made me think there was a possibility he was Puerto Rican, were also intriguing to me. He was, in fact, a Colombian. When originating articles, I realize we need to do research and stay as close to the information on other artickles, without adding or leaving anything out, but , at the same way, creating the article in our own way. Because this is a factual encyclopedia, I try to keep as close to a subject's information as I can. I suppose youre from Italy or Argentina. In either case, Im an aviation fan and Alitalia and Aerolineas Argentinas are among my favorite airlines! Thanks for everything and God bless you! Sincerely yours, "Antonio He-Man Martin" Well... first of all, thanks for answering me so quickly, and sorry for my delay. And thanks for the link. But, I could not find anything there that could lead me to think he was Colombian - or Latin American, for that matter (besides his surname - I think it's "Meléndez", with an acute accent over the 'e'). I did a Google search, but found no reliable sources. As you supposed, I'm Italian; Milanese in fact. But, as I wrote in my user page, I'm living in Colombia, and that's why I'm interested in this country and almost everything coming from or related to it. Are you Christian, by the way? I'm Catholic. God bless you too. --Fibonacci 00:57, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC) [edit] Good work on the Rumaisa Rahman article!</p>

<p>dogs and diabetes Answering your question on the reference desk: Yes, dogs can get diabetes (not as commonly as cats, but it happens), and frequent urination is a symptom (that doesn't mean that she necessarily has it, but she may).

<p>Julie Brown/Paris Hilton Could you please return to the Julie Brown page and uncensor your quote RE: Paris Hilton? Wikipedia is not a morally regulated space; to censor a quote is to express a point of view about that quote, and that is non-encyclopedic. Please change it to reflect the actual words spoken. Thanks! Pacian 10:51, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi honey. I appreciate you responding to my message. I also appreciate your respect for my spirituality though I assure you referencing your God will never offend me. RE: your need to respect the sensitivity of children, it is important that you rememeber that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and is meant to be neutral in it's point of view at all times. As such, you cannot censor a direct quote because of your personal concern for children (or anyone) because that would be you imposing your point of view on what someone else said; no matter your good intentions, it is a form of censorship, and censorship of fact does not belong in an encyclopedia. If you look at it from another angle, we must respect a child's right to know what has factually occurred (even with something as trivial as a quote from a comedienne,) and we must also respect a parent's ability to restrict their child's access to material that the parent may deem inappropriate for that child. It is not our responsibility as fact-reporting contributors to an encyclopedia to concern ourselves with the potential impact our entries may have on others; only that our entries are complete, factual, and neutral. Great tidings to you this new year! Pacian 18:40, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
