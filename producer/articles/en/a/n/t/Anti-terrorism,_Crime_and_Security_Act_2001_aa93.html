<p>The <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_Act_1971_68b1.html" title="Immigration Act 1971">Immigration Act 1971</a> allows for the deportation of those who are a threat to national security for cases where there is insufficient admissible evidence for prosecution, however a ruling by the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Court_of_Human_Rights_5e56.html" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> in the case of Chahal v United Kingdom in 1996, ruled that deportation of persons to another country was not allowed if there were substantial grounds for believing that the person would be subjected to torture. As a result, the government argued that this provision was necessary to overcome this conjunction of legal and security problems, and allow indefinite detention without charge or trial.</p>

<p>The Act did provide a process for appealing to a judicial tribunal against the Home Secretary's decision to detain in each case. However, the government had argued that a special appellate process was needed to deal with these appeals because of the possibility that much of the evidence or information upon which the Home Secretary's suspicions may be based was likely to be sensitive information of a confidential nature whose release to the person detained or the public, might compromise intelligence methods, operatives, and other persons. Therefore the process established by the ATCSA involved special rules of evidence which most notably permitted the exclusion of the detainees and their legal representatives from proceedings. In an attempt to ensure that their rights were safeguarded at these times, special security-vetted 'special advocates' were appointed in the place of their legal representatives. However there is some evidence that these special advocates experienced difficulties effectively protecting their interests, and two of the special advocates subsequently resigned from their positions following the December 2004 ruling of the House of Lords.</p>
<p>In October 2002 the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Immigration_Appeals_Commission_9ae9.html" title="Special Immigration Appeals Commission">Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> decided that the Home Secretary's derogation was lawful, and that there was indeed a "state of emergency threatening the life of the nation".</p>
<p>A series of legal challenges were made in respect of the powers and processes established under the ATCSA and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judicial_Committee_of_the_House_of_Lords_a937.html" title="Judicial Committee of the House of Lords">Law Lords</a> ruled that the powers of detention conferred by Part 4 of ATCSA were incompatible with the UK's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court ruled by a majority of 8–1 that the purported derogation was not authorised by <a href="../../../e/c/h/ECHR_f6be.html#Article_15_-_derogations" title="ECHR">Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a> since the measures taken could not rationally be held to be "strictly required by the exigencies of the situation", and were also discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the Convention.</p>
<p>The ruling could be summed up as follows:<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd041216/a&amp;oth-1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd041216/a&amp;oth-1.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>No detention pending deportation had lasted for more than 7 days, let alone 3 years.</li>
<li>The law was unjustifiably discriminatory. What if a British citizen was also suspected of terrorism which required that they be detained indefinitely without trial? There was no way to do it.</li>
<li>There was no observable state of emergency threatening the life of the nation. No other European country which had experience far more severe crises had declared such a state of emergency over such a long time period, and certainly without anyone noticing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Court quashed the order derogating from the UK's obligations under the Convention, and issued a declaration pusuant to section 4 of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Act_1998_1431.html" title="Human Rights Act 1998">Human Rights Act 1998</a> that the provisions of the ATCSA which empowered the preventative detention of non-British suspected international terrorists were incompatible with the European Convention. The effect of such a declaration in British law is not to deprive the legislation of legal effect, and Parliament may, if it wishes, refuse to repeal or amend any provision declared to be incompatible. However the making of a declaration of incompatibility carries strong moral force, and creates considerable political pressure to address the incompatibility.</p>

<p>To this end Part 4 of the ATCSA was replaced by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevention_of_Terrorism_Act_2005_2a71.html" title="Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005">Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005</a> in March 2005. This Act replaces detention in prison with "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_order.html" title="Control order">control orders</a>" which allow for the imposition of an extensive and non-exhaustive set of conditions on the movements of the suspected person with restrictions approaching a form of <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_arrest.html" title="House arrest">house arrest</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Part 4 of the ATCSA, the powers in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 can be applied to British and non-British suspected terrorists alike. At the time of its enactment there was considerable debate as to the compatibility of this Act's provisions with domestic and international human rights laws.</p>
<p>Eleven control orders were issued on the night the act passed on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">11 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> against the terrorist suspects who were due to be released. By October of that year only three were still in force.</p>
