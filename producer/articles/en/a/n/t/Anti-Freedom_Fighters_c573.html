	    <p>The <b>Anti-Freedom Fighters</b> are an organization of anthropomorphic, humanoid characters from the fictional universe of the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Archie_comic%29_3acf.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie comic)"><i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> comics</a>. They are the Anti-<a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobius_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_2e4b.html" title="Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Mobius</a> equivalent to the Freedom Fighters, and are a gang of punks intent on making life miserable for everyone they meet; however, with a lack of decent opponents on their own turf, they have occasionally crossed over to Mobius to spark trouble for the real Freedom Fighters. The team originally consisted of Sally, Antoine, Rotor, Tails, and their leader Sonic; all of whom were evil, of course. After a string of failures, most of them against the Anti-Mobius version of Dr. Robotnik (a kindly vet in this reality), they get rid of their leader, Evil Sonic, and line up under a real stinker, Evil Geoffrey St. John.</p>
<p>By the next time the Anti-Freedom Fighters appear, they have made a few more changes to the line-up. Evil Sally got bored of Geoffrey and dumped him—making herself leader, Anti-Bunnie joined the ranks to get revenge on Evil Sonic, and Evil Sonic replaced Anti-Antoine with the real <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_D%27Coolette_a0c0.html" title="Antoine D'Coolette">Antoine</a> to get revenge on both of them; Antoine is impersonating his evil double for fear that the others will turn on him if they find out the truth.</p>
<p>Sonic eventually figures out that the two Antoines have been switched, and undoes the change. Currently, the Anti-Freedom Fighters would consist of the Evil versions of Antoine, Bunnie, Rotor, Sally and Tails. However, Anti-Sally and Anti-Bunnie fell into a pit containing "Octopods," and it is unknown if they survived.</p>

<p><b>Evil Sonic</b> is the Anti-Mobius version of Sonic, and originally led the Anti-Freedom Fighters. After repeated failures, he was ejected from the group and forced to migrate to Mobius Prime. Following defeats at the hands of his Mobius Prime counterpart, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Archie_character%29_9044.html#Alternate_Versions" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)">Zonic the Zone Cop</a>, his counterpart from the <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Underground_e1c6.html" title="Sonic Underground">Sonic Underground</a></i> Mobius, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonia_the_Hedgehog_73f5.html" title="Sonia the Hedgehog">Sonia the Hedgehog</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manic_the_Hedgehog_3181.html" title="Manic the Hedgehog">Manic the Hedgehog</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html#Locke" title="Brotherhood of Guardians">Locke the Echidna</a> and teamups with Robo-Robotnik and <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouge_the_Bat_0118.html" title="Rouge the Bat">Rouge the Bat</a>, Scourge was transformed into a new and improved version of himself, who soon joined forces with <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Finitevus_6190.html" title="Dr. Finitevus">Dr. Finitevus</a> and his <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destructix.html" title="Destructix">Destructix</a> minions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Antoine/Patch">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Antoine/Patch</span></h3>
<p>Originally known only as <b>Anti-Antoine</b>, <b>"Patch"</b> takes his name from the eyepatch he wears. Despite this, Patch has full use of both eyes, both of which are the real McCoy—the eyepatch is to attract the ladies (something Evil Sonic chastizes him for). Patch, like the other Anti-Freedom Fighters, appeared with Evil Sonic to cause trouble on Mobius. He was defeated by his counterpart, and sent back home.</p>
<p>It was later revealed that, for at least two years, Antoine D'Coolette had been replaced by his counterpart from the Anti-Mobius zone due to the actions of Evil Sonic. It is not known exactly when the change occurred, but it is known to have happened after Evil Sonic escaped Zonic for the first time (when Antoine did not recognize him) but before Sonic returned from his interstellar journey (when Sonic noticed the change of demeanor and scar, but chalked it up to his long absence from Mobius). In the Anti-Mobius zone, Patch attempted to get rid of his greatest enemy, Evil Sonic, by using a zone transport device created by Evil Rotor to send Evil Sonic to the prime zone (where the normal action of the comic takes place). However, Evil Sonic defeated Patch in the ensuing fisticuffs, and switched Patch with the prime-zone Antoine. Thus, Evil Sonic got rid of his most frequent usurper, while making nobody suspicious in either zone.</p>
<p>Patch had many of the traits that Antoine did, but in a twisted, evil way; where his prime-zone counterpart was vain and cowardly, "Patch" was narcissistic and craven. He was able to cover his actual demeanor, and successfully act as if he were the actual Antoine, due to selfless actions performed after he crossed over. However, one notable change has been made by Patch: "Antoine"'s breakup with <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunnie_Rabbot_ca09.html" title="Bunnie Rabbot">Bunnie Rabbot</a>. The evil Antoine was not in love with <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunnie_Rabbot_ca09.html" title="Bunnie Rabbot">Bunnie Rabbot</a>, and after the transfer, broke up with her. This has resulted in a large change in Bunnie's personality.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 'real' Antoine was trapped in Anti-Mobius. He imitated Patch, knowing that if he was discovered, the "Anti-Freedom Fighters" would likely turn on him. He also met Bunnie's evil counterpart, Anti-Bunnie, but there was no suggestion of what kind of relationship they had, if any.</p>
<p>Anti-Antoine later reveals that he was biding his time, and has unleashed a plot to usurp King Acorn and take over his kingdom. He poisons the king, who then tells Princess Sally that she must ascend to the throne; but the kingdom needs a King and Queen, so Patch sets himself up as a suitor when King Acorn arranges Sally's marriage. His plan goes well, and despite Sonic's interference, Sally accepts her marriage to Patch. The last thing that stands in his way is the comatose king, but when he goes to finish him off with a lethal injection, Prince Elias returns to the castle to declare his right as heir to the throne. Patch immediately works on a plan to oust King Elias, and intends to poison him with the needle he was about to use on King Max; Sonic spots the needle, and thwarts the assassination. At first, Patch accuses Sonic of trying to murder him with the poison; but Sonic, after a previous altercation with the Anti-Freedom Fighters and the real Antoine, deduces the true deception. After defeating Patch, Sonic returns Patch to his dimension and gets the real Antoine back, who promptly proceeds to rekindle his relationship with Bunnie. Their feelings for each other, if anything deepened by their separation, soon led to their engagement.</p>
<p>It was subsequently revealed that Patch also used the poison on Antoine's father, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28comic_series%29_dcd5.html#General_Armand_D.27Coolette" title="Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog (comic series)">General D'Coolette</a>, but with a higher dosage than that of King Acorn. When Antoine and Bunnie went to see him, he died, making Patch the first and so far only member of the Anti-Freedom Fighters to actually kill somebody.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Sally">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Sally</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Acorn_09f1.html" title="Sally Acorn">Sally Acorn</a>'s evil counterpart, <b>Anti-Sally</b> is the current leader of the Anti-Freedom Fighters. Possessing Sally's talent for leadership, but nothing else positive, she is a ruthless leader, and former girlfriend of Evil Sonic. A tried and true sadist where Sally is compassionate, unlike on Mobius Prime where Robotnik threw Sally's father into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Void_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_0d75.html" title="The Void (Sonic the Hedgehog)">the Void</a>, Anti-Sally comments that she and Evil Sonic performed this ghastly deed themselves and looks back on it as 'good times.' Ultimately breaking up with anti-Sonic for his inability to lead, she hooked up with Anti-Geoffery who became leader himself, but she has since dissolved her relationship with him as well and taken direct command herself. Where Primary Sally feels for anyone under her command, Anti-Sally feels nothing. She was later thrown into toxic waters inhabited by creatures called 'Octopods' along with Anti-Bunnie during an encounter with Sonic Prime.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Evil Tails">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evil Tails</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles__Tails__Prower_8fae.html" title="Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower">Miles "Tails" Prower</a>'s alternate self, <b>Evil Tails</b> has Tails' flight ability, but none of the innocence. While the Primary Tails holds a great admiration for Sonic to the point of seeing him as family, Anti-Tails' 'sidekick' motif with Anti-Sonic was nothing more than a performance which he dropped the moment that Anti-Sonic fell out of favor with the rest of the Anti-Freedom Fighters.</p>
<p><a name="Anti-Rotor" id="Anti-Rotor"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Rotor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Rotor</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotor_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_3c60.html" title="Rotor (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Rotor</a>'s Anti-Mobius doppelganger, <b>Anti-Rotor</b> is an evil genius on par with Mobius Prime's Robotnik. Anti-Rotor has all of Rotor's muscle and intelligence, but the similarities end there. He is responsible for many of the Anti-Freedom Fighters' gizmos, including the device that allowed Evil Sonic to switch himself and Anti-Antoine for their Prime counterparts.</p>
<p><a name="Anti-Bunnie" id="Anti-Bunnie"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Bunnie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Bunnie</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunnie_Rabbot_ca09.html" title="Bunnie Rabbot">Bunnie Rabbot</a>'s evil double, <b>Anti-Bunnie</b> was one of Evil Sonic's girlfriends who learned of his infidelity and seeks revenge. It's noted that she is not half-roboticized like her Mobius Prime counterpart, due to the lack of a <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roboticizer.html" title="Roboticizer">Roboticizer</a> employing villain in their universe. She also seems to lack the southern accent of her kind-natured double. Her dress style is semi-goth, and she has none of Bunnie Prime's ability to feel for others. Anti-Bunnie and Anti Sally were later thrown into highly-polluted water inhabited by presumably hostile creatures called 'Octopods' during a fight with Sonic Prime.</p>
<p><a name="Evil_St._John" id="Evil_St._John"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Evil St. John">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evil St. John</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_St._John_dff7.html" title="Geoffrey St. John">Geoffrey St. John</a>'s counterpart, <b>Evil St. John</b> briefly led the Anti-Freedom Fighters. However, after repeated defeats, the others dumped him and Anti-Sally became the new leader. While he had almost no role, it can be assumed that he possessed all of his Prime verion's negative qualities with none of the positive.</p>
<p><a name="Enemies" id="Enemies"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Freedom_Fighters_c573.html" title="Edit section: Enemies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enemies</span></h2>
<p>In their dimension, the Anti-Freedom Fighters have free rein over most of the planet; however, they do have some opposition. In the Anti-Mobius dimension, Dr. Robotnik's alternate version is the kindly <b>Dr. Kintobor</b>, who is at first helpless against the miscreants. After their defeat at the hands of the Freedom Fighers of Mobius Prime, Kintobor became emboldened and did battle with them, succeeding to the point of the other Anti-Freedom Fighters dumping Evil Sonic.</p>
<p>Though Kintobor is the main opponent the Anti-Freedom Fighers face—apart from each other—one other known enemy fights against them. A version of Knuckles from Anti-Mobius, <b><a href="../../../k/n/u/Knuckles_the_Echidna_%28Archie_character%29_c651.html" title="Knuckles the Echidna (Archie character)">Anti-Knuckles</a></b> has all the physical attributes of his counterpart on Mobius Prime. Guardian of the Sunken Island, he was at first a pacifistic bystander; after Evil Sonic tricked him into going to Mobius Prime, he saw that the Anti-Freedom Fighers were evil and helped to defeat them.</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Freedom Fighters rose to power, they had to dethrone <b>Evil King Max</b>, the father of Anti-Sally and an evil version of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Acorn_6425.html" title="King Acorn">King Acorn</a>. Similar to what happened on Mobius Prime, the Anti-Freedom Fighters threw the king-who resembled Dr. Robotnik from Mobius Prime-into the Zone of Silence.</p>
<p>Of course, the list of Anti-Freedom Fighter enemies includes both their Mobius Prime counterparts and the zone cop <b>Zonic</b>.</p>
