<p>Wow. Tremendous improvement on this article over the last 24 hours. I am impressed. Thanks to all.</p>
<hr />
<p>How can you write about Santa Anna without mentioning the Alamo and talking about his defeat at the hands of general Sam Houston? Also, he called himself the "Napolean of the West" and obviously modelled his uniforms and that of his soldiers on the Napoleanic tradition. Seems like it's lacking some important details.</p>

<dd>Improvements are welcome, as always. Cheers, -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 00:07, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I was watching "Kind of the Hill" and one of their stories was about american soldiers stealing Santa Anna's wooden leg, and it being on display at some museam in Illinois. Is there any truth to that? .... I think it would be a great accomplishment to american imperialism if we really did it. Go team! Gimp that mexican!&#160;:)</p>
<hr />
<p>It seems odd that Jackson would meet with Santa Ana in 1837, considering that in the previous year SA had pursued a consistent policy of murdering American/Texan prisoners. I never had much regard for AJ for a number of reasons (the spoils system comes quickly to mind) but a sentence or two regarding their meeting would be appropriate.</p>
<p>Billy T May 06</p>
<hr />
<p>The article states that SA was president of Mexico eleven times; the infobox only has 5 terms of presidency. Which is correct? <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFeanorStar7_4f75.html" title="User:FeanorStar7">User:FeanorStar7</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Reply: From all published accounts that I've found to date, Santa Anna was president of Mexcio eleven times. Now how long each time lasted might make it harder to pin point.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../t/l/i/User%7ETlincoln_973e.html" title="User:Tlincoln">User: tlincoln</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Here are a few dates to ponder:</li>
</ul>
<p>30 March 1833/ 16 May 1833/ 3 June 1833/ 27 Oct. 1833/ 24 April 1834/ 20 March 1839/ 10 Oct. 1841/ 4 March 1843/ 4 June 1844/ 6 Dec. 1846/ 21 March 1847/ 20 May 1847/ 20 April 1853 Perhaps these can be collated with other dates to get an exact match. The following web sites all list his being president eleven times. www.historicaltextarchive.com / www.tamu.edu.ccbn/dewitt/santaanna.htm / www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people / www.mexconnect.com / www.libutexas.edu/benson/Mex_Archives Now let us not raise our blood pressure over this issue. A simple, intelligent, non-finger pointing debate session will be healthy. Isn't history wonderful? Thanks and enjoy.</p>

<p>So, should our subject be known as "López" or "Santa Anna". He is referred to as "López" once in the text, and an editor has just changed it so that he is sorted by "López" in categories. However "Santa Anna" seems to be the more usual name used. It'd be good to be consistent unless there's a reason. Any thoughts? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:41, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I would simply leave all references to him as Santa Anna. You're correct, he is almost universally recognized as Santa Anna. <a href="../../../t/l/i/User%7ETlincoln_973e.html" title="User:Tlincoln">Tlincoln</a> 17:46, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is true in Mexico as well. He never seems to be referred to as "López" and rarely as "Lopez de Santa Anna", almost always as "Santa Anna", which, by the way is pronounced as though it were spelled "Santana". Both the use of his second last name and the pronounciation are exceptions to the usual rules in Spanish. --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbraunwa_0d4e.html" title="User:Rbraunwa">Rbraunwa</a> 17:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benson Latin American Collection Rare Books and Manuscripts Inventory Antonio López de Santa Anna Collection Prepared by the Mexican Archives Project February 13, 1995 I thoroughly despise inconsistency..even when perpetrated by Wikipedia..if you state that Santa Anna was president of MEXICO "eleven times" ..then TELL ME WHEN AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THIS OCCURED.Don't say "eleven" times and then only tell me about "Five".I further suggest that you always give a month and a date where possible, and not just the year.This helps when you want chronological accuracy and one guy serves the 1st month of the year,and somone else finishes that same year in his stead.Due to the logical demands of the alphabet,the exact order in which they served may be skewed. If someone will check all the dates and history of the list of presidents of Mexico,you will find many such discrepancies... in the list itself..the dates..and who preceded and who followed who..There is a bright side to my general condemnation...In the process of being so rudely forced to check up on the "real" story...I learned a heck of a lot of Mexican history.."Fascinating" doesn't even come close... raedwulf</p>
<p>People also forgot to add that he was a brilliant military genius, he was after all elected to be president eleven times! I would also like to explain why he was called a so-called "dictator". He was called this because of a lie, a lie which currently is taught to nearly all texans alike! Texas was stolen from Mexico, but in your average textbook it says that texas wanted to be free! The point of the matter is that whoever wins a war or a conflict decides what is written in history instead of what really happened! I advice all people who are going to research something to research it right! P.S. I will write more comments. -Bobby</p>

<p>I deleted a few sentences that were incorrect. One of these stating that Santa Anna was Emperor. He was never an Emperor. Dictator, yes. I tried to fix his early military carreer so it appears a bit more chronological.</p>
<p>Santa Anna was such a powerful force in American history, and he such an enigma, that it's hard to note down all the details of his life. For sure he was in love with himself and power.</p>
<p>I stopped at the US mexican war. He played a huge part in defending Mexico, and it seems that one paragraph on this topic should not be enough. I will make additional changes, and invite others to do so. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkibofilms_a4c3.html" title="User:Skibofilms">Skibofilms</a> 18:19, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article needs some serious attention to make it clear, comprehensive and acurate (note disputes above). This perhaps may require an expert (which I am not).

<p>In his book about the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Revolution_278c.html" title="Texas Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duel-Eagles-Jeffery-Long/dp/0688109675/sr=8-2/qid=1158710601/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-5847930-2090364?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Duel-Eagles-Jeffery-Long/dp/0688109675/sr=8-2/qid=1158710601/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-5847930-2090364?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Duel of Eagles</a>, Jeffery Long reported that both Santa Anna and Sam Houston used <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laudanum.html" title="Laudanum">laudanum</a>, a then-common, opium-based medicine. Both were addicted to the point that it caused real problems for their judgement and health.</p>
<p>It should be noted that laudanum was not a recreational drug and was viewed at the time as a legitimate medicine (see the Wikipedia <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laudanum.html" title="Laudanum">article</a>). Most addicts innocently acquired the habit by using laudanum for pain or some other problem; I suspect that was the case with both Houston and Santa Anna.</p>
<p>The phrase "opium addict" may conjure up an image for some readers that does not exactly fit Santa Anna. I suggest any addition to the article use the more specific term, "laudanum", and note that Santa Anna became "addicted to laudanum, a widely used opium-based medication." --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<p>How do Mexicans view Santa Anna today? As a patriot? A brutal leader? A corrupt dictator? A good guy? A bad guy? --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 00:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

A nobody,almost.</p>
<p>Well, Santa Anna is seen today as one of the darkest (if not the most) figures of mexican history. He is remembered for his tyrannic regime and his 11 presidential periods, his mediocrity as a militar, his erratic behavior when supporting a cause (You must know that during the first decades of independent Mexico there was a continous struggle between two main factions: the liberals, that supported the creation of a federal republic, and the conservatives, the ones that believed a monarchy led by a european prince would be the best option for the country). The most remarkable fact of his presidency, and perhaps the most remembered one is that our country lost about half of his territory, which has annexed by the United States. So, as simple as that, we mexicans consider Santa Anna a miserable traitor.</p>

<p>The page at about 6:30 and until about 6:50 read 'HE WAS A BABY BACK BITCH' or something to that effect. I seem to remember seeing this before at school.

<dd>Yup, if you dig through the history tab you'll note many such occurrences. Rarely does the vandalism come from the same source, and rarely does it happen more than once a day or so. Not really often enough to semi-protect (block non-registered or new users). So we just keep our eyes on it and revert bad changes when they come up. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 00:10, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It isn't mentioned in the article, but I had always heard that after his defeat by the Texan/Tejano forces he abandoned his men and was captured in women's clothing (dress, bra, headscarf, etc.) while fleeing amongst a group of refugees. Is this true? If it is, we should probably add it to the article. Along with his other actions, this would make him the most dishonorable military commander, like, <i>ever</i>. It doesn't get much worse than abandoning your men and hiding among civilians in drag. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChilde_Roland_of_Gilead_846b.html" title="User:Childe Roland of Gilead">Childe Roland of Gilead</a> 05:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I don't remember the women's clothing, but he was captured by Samuel Highsmith wearing a Mexican Army privates' uniform (this is in James Haley's book Texas (the non-fiction one, not Michner's)</p>
