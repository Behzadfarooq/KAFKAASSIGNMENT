<p><b>This is a summary for uninvolved editors who come here after reading the Request for Comment.</b></p>
<p>There have been discussions and edit wars about Starčević's racism. What follows in this chapter are the summarized views of the two opposing sides, which we may call side A and side B.</p>
<p><i>NOTE TO THE OPPOSING SIDES: The summary of each side should not be signed by individual contributors, but should concisely present the opinions supported by that side. The total text for each side should not exceed 200 words. <u>Do not edit the other side's summary!</u></i></p>
<p><a name="Summary_for_side_A" id="Summary_for_side_A"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnte_Star%C4%8Devi%C4%87_f2e4.html" title="Edit section: Summary for side A">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary for side A</span></h3>
<p>In Croatia, Ante Starčević is revered as the "father of the nation", a major historical figure. His monument stands in the country's capital. Many schools and squares are named after him. He was also the major influence on the Croatian writers and publicists of the 19th and 20th centuries who mostly belonged to the liberal-democratic and socialist-communist ideologies.</p>
<p>We don't deny that Starčević had some <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">racialist</a> views. Those views should be included in a subsection of the article. But it needs to be done in an NPOV way, i.e. without giving undue weight to the issue, since it is quite secondary compared to his political and literary work.</p>
<p>The other side, however, is simply dumping texts about his alleged racism - which was in fact a form of underdeveloped <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">racialism</a> - into the article, blatantly breaching the official policy of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a>. In our view, these efforts, exerted continually and exclusively by certain wikipedians known for defaming and demonizing the origins of contemporary Croatia and Croat identity in general, are not useful contributions to a wiki article.</p>
<p><a name="Summary_for_side_B" id="Summary_for_side_B"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnte_Star%C4%8Devi%C4%87_f2e4.html" title="Edit section: Summary for side B">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary for side B</span></h3>
<p>It has been proven that Ante was a racist, and his writings are the obvious evidence. His racist views were the main part of his political views and a basis of his activities. You are free to add paragraphs describing other aspects of his life and work. Starcevic's racism is described in the NPOV manner already. As to the undue weight - it does not hold. His importance as a writer or a philosopher is nill and as a racist - his major 'achievement'. As per A.J.P Taylor - the Party of Right and, therefore, Starcevic's only only political activity is to make conflict with the Serbs.</p>
<p>If a man is a "father of his nation", and he's a racist, should we just hide that fact? Local perceptions of somebody's importance are not the global ones. So, stronger reference (than those - main historical figure, etc) here are needed when writing about this man.</p>
<p>The problem is that today's Croatia revives and tolerates neo-nazism [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] and whitewashed her racist past in the history textbooks, media and everyday life. Therefore, Ante's views of Serbs and Jews as second class citizens don't go to Croatians advantage, and they attempt to hide that fact as much as possible.</p>

<p>Purgers' addition</p>
<p>1. My contribution to this article was labelled as</p>
<p><i>deleted usual Serbian propagandist rubbish or rv, trolls with usual Serbian mis- &amp; disquotation disease-</i></p>
<p>and subsequently deleted. This 'approach' and all others supporting this one will be ultimately counteracted by reverting to my version without a comment or discussion.</p>
<p>2. As it was explained by an anonymous user:</p>
<p>- their (Gross, Barisic, Goldstein) findings about Starcevic's racism and anti-semitism are not scholarly questioned by any serious scholar/historian</p>
<p>- to describe Starcevic's racism and anti-semitism these historians used Starcevic's own words - literally copied from the Starcevic's works and correctly interpreted</p>
<p>- these Starcevic's words are correctly translated into spoken English inside this article</p>
<p>- this racist and anti-semitic attitude of Starcevic is nurtured and maintained inside his Party of the Rights for more than 60 years - in order to explode, in the most villainous way, in the years 1941-45 annihilating hundreds of thousands of innocent people of the wrong "breed".</p>
<p>The last conclusion is confirmed by the great British historian and the Oxford University professor - A.J.P. Taylor, too.</p>
<p>3. I am not interested in any other aspect of the Starcevic's life or work. Whoever wants to contibute about Starcevic as a writer, a philosopher, a historian - is free to do that provided not changing the findings about his racism and anti-Semitism. Any change of the existing contribution for better - is welcome provided that is really for better. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 22:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a>'s edit hardly follows the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> principle. This edit makes about 75% of the article about Starčević's supposed anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>I am not familiar with Mirjana Gross, nor with this book, but I am sure it mostly deals with politics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are not familiar - that's fine. But, then, avoid passing any judgement about her and her work.--<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.18.16.251.html" title="User:64.18.16.251">64.18.16.251</a> 15:33, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While this anti-Semitism may have been real, it shouldn't constitute three quarters of an article about a hugely important Croatian politician. There is obviously some POV agenda, since nothing about his politics or lasting legacy was contributed from a source book about the Party of Rights' "Ideology, Agitation, Movement".</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not interested in the matter mentioned above - his politics or lasting legacy. Leaving it to some other people.--<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.18.16.251.html" title="User:64.18.16.251">64.18.16.251</a> 15:33, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We can work out a compromise, but this edit cannot stand as is. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewanderer_2fd1.html" title="User:Thewanderer">Thewanderer</a> 03:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You can add more text about him - not related to his racism and anti-semitism and make this text you are targeting to be a contribution say of 30% only. Also, I do not think that Starcevic is more than a provincial politician - from the European prospective and this is the English language Wikipedia edition.--<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.18.16.251.html" title="User:64.18.16.251">64.18.16.251</a> 15:33, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As to the scholarly work of the three renown Zagreb University historians, M. Gross, I. Goldstein, and Pavo Barisic:</p>
<p>- their findings about Starcevic's racism and anti-semitism are not scholarly questioned by any serious scholar/historian</p>
<p>- to describe Starcevic's racism and anti-semitism these historians used Starcevic's own words - literally copied from the Starcevic's works and correctly interpreted</p>

<p>Therefore, marking their findings about Starcevic as questionable - is frivolous and groundless and, in all subsequent edits of this article, shall be ignored. --<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.18.16.251.html" title="User:64.18.16.251">64.18.16.251</a> 13:50, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Come on, people, stop reverting this article!!! Lets discuss about the content first! --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 06:05, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I am very serious about discussing this, but I see noone wants to discuss it, because the people, who are constantly reverting the page to the short text that was written long ago, don't have good arguments for denying the fact that Ante hated Jews and Serbs, and wrote articles about it. What are you guys trying to hide?? --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 03:38, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I made the article a little bit more in the style of "Historians claim he was... this and that...", so it's more neutral, and don't revert anymore. There is no reason for that, everything that is left is Historian's analysis and Ante's own quotes. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 03:40, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was difficult for me to understand the reason of this person signed up as Mir Harven - to mercilessly delete somebody's artice contributions leaving only polit-commissary's labelling of the removed text as <i>beginning of a major edit; deleted usual Serbian propagandist rubbish</i> or <i>rv, trolls with usual Serbian mis- &amp; disquotation disease</i>- to a reader. Even not noticing (or willing to notice) that the whole article contribution (Purger's) was exclusively based on the very Starcevic's works and findings of the Croatians scholars about this man!</p>
<p>I spotted this sentence in the latest Mir Harven change</p>
<p><i>Starčević's main influence in the area was that of a polemicist who first broke the silence about Greater Serbian ideology dressed up in the dialectological guise, as promulagated by Vuk Karadžić and his followers</i></p>
<p>What it shall be? Google searching "Mir Harven" I found a very interesting "talk" about the very nature of language this person had on sci.lang. I am quoting just two responses - for they are completely sufficient and reasonable - for this purpose:</p>

<p>As to the Karadzic's work and his time, and for those who might not know anything about him, here is the Goethe's opinion, also:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1987_July/ai_5148917" class="external free" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1987_July/ai_5148917" rel="nofollow">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1987_July/ai_5148917</a></p>
<p>In Vienna he met a Slovene scholar, Jernej Kopitar, who encouraged him and introduced him to such leading European writers and thinkers as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Jacob Grimm, Leopold von Ranke and Friedrich Engels. Karadzic's first collection of epic poems, published in 1814, brought him to the attention of an educated readership. In addition to his many other activities, he devoted his life to the collection and publication of works from the Serbian oral literary tradition, notably in "Serbian Folk Tales' (1821), "Serbian Folk Sayings' (1836) and, above all, the multi-volume "Serbian Epic Poems' (1814-1866).</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.richardwolf.de/latein/goethe.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.richardwolf.de/latein/goethe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.richardwolf.de/latein/goethe.htm</a></i></p>
<p>In dem Aufsatz "Serbische Lieder" findet sich auch eine Passage über Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic.</p>
<p>Alles dieses war jedoch von keiner Folge, wenn nicht ein tüchtiger Mann, namens Wuk Stephanowitsch Karadschitsch, geboren 1787 und erzogen an der Scheide von Serbien und Bosnien, mit seiner Muttersprache, die auf dem Lande weit reiner als in den Städten geredet wird, frühzeitig vertraut geworden wäre und ihre Volkspoesie liebgewonnen hätte. Er benahm sich mit dem größten Ernst in dieser Sache und gab im Jahre 1814 in Wien eine serbische Grammatik an den Tag und zugleich serbische Volkslieder, hundert an der Zahl. Gleich damals erhielt ich sie mit einer deutschen Übersetzung, auch jener&#160;»Trauergesang«&#160;fand sich nunmehr im Original; allein wie sehr ich auch die Gabe werthielt, wie sehr sie mich erfreute, so konnt ich doch zu jener Zeit noch zu keinem Überblick gelangen. In Westen hatten sich die Angelegenheiten verwirrt, und die Entwicklung schien auf neue Verwirrung zu deuten; ich hatte mich nach Osten geflüchtet und wohnte in glücklicher Abgeschiedenheit eine Zeitlang entfernt von Westen und Norden. Nun aber enthüllt sich diese langsam reifende Angelegenheit immer mehr und mehr. Herr Wuk begab sich nach Leipzig, wo er in der Breitkopf-Härtelischen Offizin drei Bände Lieder herausgab, von deren Gehalt oben gesprochen wurde, sodann Grammatik und Wörterbuch hinzufügte, wodurch denn dieses Feld dem Kenner und Liebhaber um vieles zugänglicher geworden. Auch brachte des werten Mannes Aufenthalt in Deutschland denselben in Berührung mit vorzüglichen Männern. Bibliothekar Grimm in Kassel ergriff mit der Gewandtheit eines Sprachgewaltigen auch das Serbische; er übersetzte die Wukische Grammatik und begabte sie mit einer Vorrede, die unsern obigen Mitteilungen zum Grunde liegt. Wir verdanken ihm bedeutende Übersetzungen, die in Sinn und Silbenmaß jenes Nationelle wiedergeben.</p>
<p>Am 20. Dezember 1823 schrieb er in einem Brief an Karadzic:</p>
<p>Ew. Wohlgeboren haben mir durch die Übersendung einer wörtlichen Übersetzung vorzüglich schöner serbischer Lieder sehr viel Freude gegeben, sodann aber solche durch Grammatik und Lexicon verdoppelt und verdreyfacht. Ihre bedeutende Sprache hat hiedurch sich auch bey uns den Weg gebahnt und unsern Forschern die Pflicht auferlegt, sich emsig damit zu beschäftigen.</p>

To su Slavosrbi. Kako to u svojoj monumentalnoj studiji opisuje Mirjana Gross u poglavlju o&#160;»slavorpskoj konstrukciji«&#160;kod Starcevica, pojam&#160;»Slavosrba«&#160;je najprije politicki: to su politicki protivnici, koji se&#160;»prodaju tudinskoj vlasti«. Zatim, to su svi oni koji s naklonošcu gledaju na ujedinjavanje Južnih Slavena, a da ih sve ne smatraju Hrvatima. Danas bi pravaši takve opisivali kao&#160;»unitariste«&#160;ili&#160;»jugonostalgicare«. No, i tu pocinje kljucni problem, Starcevic se s godinama sve više priklanja poimanju&#160;»Slavosrba«&#160;kao posebne etnicke skupine, i cak rase odnosno pasmine.&#160;»Židovi su manje škodljivi nego Slavosrbi.

M. Gross spominje kako Starcevic pod stare dane poistovjecuje Srbe sa pasminom slavosrpskom, i ruga im se za njihove davne poraze. Ove je rasisticke ispade pravaš Erazmo Barcic godine 1894., kako navodi ista autorica, opisao kao&#160;»nabacivanje blatom i najprostijimi infamnimi pogrdami«.

<dd>A classic of misrepresentation. Nenad Miščević is a well known pro-Yugoslav propagandist and vocal enemy of Croatian independence (good that we got such people to remind us, perpetually, what stench this Yugoslavia exuded). His words, in this article-pamphlet, are again an example of rather sloppy reasoning-a purpose is, I guess, easy to ascertain: Starčević had coined the terms Sclavus/slave and Servus/serf to designate slavish mentality of his political opponents. The main "Slavosrb" was bishop Strossmayer who, no doubt, could not have any ethnic link with anything Serbian in the modern sense of the word. Miščević's contention is simply a pamphleteer's generalization: shuffled at the end of the article, "corroborated" by the statement of a political and cultural non-entity no one has heard of. It is true that Starčević <b>never</b> accepted Serbian national affiliation of Orthodox Vlachs in Croatia and Bosnia. It is also true that to call his "racist" for that is plain stupidity, since his mother belonged to the Orthodox Vlachs, so he would be, according to the Miščević's concoction, a self-hating "racist". Starčević was a fierce enemy of Serbian national idea in Croatia and Bosnia, there is no question about it. It can be argued that he was wrong about it. But, to associate quasi-racial tags to it is pure distortion of the past in order to change the future.<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 19:48, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently, you won't be ashamed even if I offer photocopied pages of the M.Gross book as a proof. As of the nonsense claimed above <i>accepted Serbian national affiliation of Orthodox Vlachs</i> - learn the very first thing: national affiliation of each living man is a personal matter of that man - accepted or not by some 'notables'. Not a single Austro-Hungarian census of the 19. or 20. centuries (years 1869, 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910) ever mentioned any 'Orthodox Vlachs' Starcevic talked about and invented. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 20:43, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why you are vasting your time on this man? Are you really going to photocopy that book pages??? Go to see his stumbling across the notions of language, dialect, nation on the sci.lang. People whose profession and education is in the area of linguistics ridiculed him and refused him as an ignorant. He still kept resonding labelling one of them as 'trolitis acuta'. (Poor man, tried to impress his opponents hinting at his wouldbe knowledge of Latin language). Here he is not aware what he is talking about. Trying to prove as if Starcevic weren't a racist he claimed that Starcevic <i>never accepted Serbian national affiliation of Orthodox Vlachs</i>. What else is a man who denies peoples' identity (ethnic/national) if not a racist? At the end, this man keeps labelling his opponents in discussion as (Slavo)Serbs - the same way as his hero Starcevic - even not knowing a single thing about me, you, others.</dd>

<dd>What would you do&#160;? Xerox pages of a book I, unlike you, read 2 years ago&#160;? And which proves-what&#160;? That in Starčević's political career the term "Slavosrb" was used <b>exclusively</b> for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence&#160;? The main "Slavosrbs" were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called "Khuen Serbs"- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century, collaborators of Khuen regime&#160;? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally "awoke" as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the "Slavosrbs" tag in Starčević's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Starčević's followers (Stjepan Miletić, August Harambašić, Dušan Kotur, Dušan Vlaisavljević, Milan Ogrizović,..). No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. <b>But</b>, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology. And this must not be forgotten: who had begun with this game of denial&#160;? Who wanted another people's extirpation&#160;? Whose idenmtity was forged, among other things, upon cultural theft and misappropriations&#160;? Who spoiled the well&#160;? <a href="http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/" class="external free" title="http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/</a> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 22:09, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In her monumental monograph there are no such passages.

It is very, very obvious that this Serbian chauvinism has got one single goal: to defame the founder of modern Croatian ideology in order to show that racism, exclusivism and-why not, genocide- are the cornerstones of Croatian nation and contemporary Croatian state-hence, all Croats are, more or less, "genocidal", one way or another-from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ante_Star%C4%8Devi%C4%87_f86b.html" title="Ante Starčević">Ante Starčević</a> to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franjo_Tu%C4%91man_b3e8.html" title="Franjo Tuđman">Franjo Tuđman</a>, from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antun_Gustav_Mato%C5%A1_26af.html" title="Antun Gustav Matoš">Antun Gustav Matoš</a> to <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomislav_Ladan_3b09.html" title="Tomislav Ladan">Tomislav Ladan</a>.

<dd>Oh, yes! One thing more - here is more about Vuk Karadzic. I found it following the link given by the "user":
<dl>
<dd>During his lifetime Karadzic achieved a European reputation. In 1823 he was the guest of Jacob Grimm in Kassel and of Goethe in Weimar; the same year he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena. In 1824 he became a member of the Turin Society for Antiquities and, in 1825, of the Gottingen Learned Society. In 1842 he was awarded a gold medal for his scholarship and literary achievements by the Russian Academy of Sciences. He became a corresponding member of the Viennese Academy in 1848, the Berlin Academy in 1850 and the St. Petersburg Academy in 1851. He was also a corresponding member of the Paris-based African League for Combat Against Slavery.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It is apparent that European perception of the Karadzic's personality and work was above the one your hero Starcevic tried to sell. Looks as "pan-Serbian way", isn't it?--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 16:31, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This "user" would like to delete information about Ante Starčević and the formation of his ideological credo. In the typical pan-Serbian way, (s)he has delved into issues they actaully don't understand, and which do not belong to the article proper.</p>
<p>So, let's enumerate a few things (I'll use mainly English and German sources):</p>
<p>1. there is no way to distinguish between standard languages and dialects- something that has been addressed at sci.lang (strangely, this copy-paster has "ovelooked" the following exchange).</p>

So much for language.</p>
<p>Let's see the role of Vuk Karadžić:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Balkanic point of view - not even worth reading. Here is how that time Europe saw Karadzic</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>During his lifetime Karadzic achieved a European reputation. In 1823 he was the guest of Jacob Grimm in Kassel and of Goethe in Weimar; the same year he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena. In 1824 he became a member of the Turin Society for Antiquities and, in 1825, of the Gottingen Learned Society. In 1842 he was awarded a gold medal for his scholarship and literary achievements by the Russian Academy of Sciences. He became a corresponding member of the Viennese Academy in 1848, the Berlin Academy in 1850 and the St. Petersburg Academy in 1851. He was also a corresponding member of the Paris-based African League for Combat Against Slavery.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is apparent that European perception of the Karadzic's personality and work was above the one your hero Starcevic (and others you are calling upon) was trying to sell. Looks as "pan-Serbian way", isn't it? When editing an English Wikipedia article, we have to see the things outside Balkans blindness and hate, haven't we?--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 19:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/karadzic.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/karadzic.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/karadzic.htm</a></p>
<p>Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic (1787-1864) was a linguist and writer who travelled throughout the Balkan lands studying the various languages and dialects and collecting folk songs. He wrote widely on linguistic subjects and problems, and published many grammar books and a dictionary. He is rightfully considered the founder of modern Serbian language reform and Serbian culture in general.</p>
<p><b>One of the main themes of his work is that all speakers of the Stokavian dialect are Serbian (even though most Croatians speak a form of this dialect as well). This line of thinking is seen quite frequently in Karadzic's work, and influenced Serbian attitudes toward other Balkan nations. The article "Serbs All and Everywhere", first published in the book "Treasurebox for the History, Language and Customs of Serbians of All Three Faiths" in 1849, is a typical example of Karadzic's views on the language and ethnicity of Serbia's neighbors. He also tries to negate the existence of any significant number of Croats, distorting historic and linguistic facts to prove his arguments. At this time, the Croats, along with the Bulgarians, were seen as the biggest obstacle to Serbian dominance on the Balkans. In this way Karadzic, either consciously or unconsciously, fits into the scheme of Greater Serbian ideology quite well.</b> ......</p>

<p>POLITIKA U ZNANSTVENOJ SLAVISTICI ILITI POLITIČKO JEZIKOSLOVLJE</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>1. Nemali dio takozvane serbokroatistike temelji se na onome što je rekao, tj. napisao Vuk Stefanović Karadžić</p>
<p>Ideje J. Dobrovskoga i P. J. Šafaržika prihvaća Vuk Stefanović Karadžić i tako nastaje njegov članak Srbi svi i svuda. Već iz samoga naslova članka vidljive su političke namjere Vuka Stefanovića Karadžića. To je programski politički članak (11) u kojemu se htjelo uvjeriti svijet da su svi Srbi štokavci, kajkavci su Slovenci, a Hrvati su tek čakavci. Tim člankom koji tako napisan dovodi u sumnju sve što je Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (12) napisao, tim više što je on u kontradikciji s Vukom Stefanovićem(13) koji u predgovoru svoga rječnika u prvoj rečenici prvoga izdanja (1818. god.) piše: “Već ima blizu iljada godina kako Srblji imaju svoja slova i pismo, a do danas još ni u kakvoj knjizi nemaju pravoga svog jezika!” (Vuk 1818:111).</p>
<p>Zatim navodi:&#160;»Dva su velika uzroka ovoj nesreći našega jezika, i ovome (prije nečuvenom na ovom svijetu) pokoru našemu: prvo, što su naši spisatelji sve samouci u Srpskom jeziku: zašto mi nemamo još ni Bukvara Srpskoga, a kamo li što više«&#160;(Vuk 1818: V).</p>
<p>Dobro je poznato da je i rječnika i knjiga bilo koji su se na štokavskome temeljili. To je činjenica koje se treba svaki jezikoslovac držati. Jer kako reče A. Meillet:&#160;»La science ne vit pas de verites, elle vit de preuves (14)” (citirano prema Guillaume 1973: 50). Ili kako bi to rekao O. Guillaume: “La methode que je preconise en linguistique, et d’une maniere generale en toute matiere intellective, est 1’observation fine du concret rendue plus fine sans cesse par la reflexion profonde.” (Guillaume 1973: 50). A samo u svjetonazorima postoje “istine bez dokaza”, znanstvena se istina temelji na činjenicama i dokazima. Jasno je da Vuk Stefanović Karadžić nije mogao reći u vremenu kada je pisao rječnik da su knjige koje su do tada napisane bile srpske i da je jednostavno trebalo preuzeti, i to iz najmanje tri razloga:</p>
<p>a) tada se dobro znalo da su knjige (i rječnike) koje su već postojale pisali Hrvati,</p>
<p>b) naišao bi na još jači otpor svojim idejama unutar Srbije i među Srbima u Vojvodini, koji bi mu prigovarali da im nameće hrvatski ili barem hercegovački,</p>
<p>c) njegov rad onda ne bi bio “pionirski”.</p>
<p>Napisati to trideset godina poslije bilo je nešto sasvim drugo. Iz navedenoga slijedi da sve što je Vuk Stefanović Karadžić napisao treba dodatna proučavanja, i to posebnom metodologijom, kako bi se jasno razdvojilo što je u onome što on piše srpsko, a što nije. To nam potpuno zamagljuje znanstvenu istinu kojom bi nam bilo jasno što je srpski jezik u to doba uistinu bio. Tim više što se iz njegovih polemika i spisa jasno vidi da je malo tko osim njega znao onda srpski kakvim je on pisao. Put koji se nekritički temelji na Karadžićevim postavkama bio bi dakle politički odabir, jer je polazište Vuka Stefanovića Karadžića, poglavito u razdoblju poslije 1818. godine, ishodišno političko, a prije toga razdoblja njegovo je ishodište znanstveno nedovoljno jasno. Tim više što je sveukupni Vukov projekt pokrenuo Kopitar, a njegovi su motivi bili izrazito politički, što je u mnogim radovima pokazano. Da je u stvaranju samoga Rječnika sudjelovao i Kopitar jasno je iz navoda: “Što se tiče ovde Njemačkoga i Latinskoga jezika, o tom sam radio s G. Kopitarom, dvorskim bibliotekarom; ali opet ako se đe nađe, da su koje riječi rđavo prevedene, tome sam ja kriv, što mu nijesam znao pravo značenje kazati, a ne on, što ga nije znao Njemački ili Latinski istolkovati.” (Vuk 1918: VIII).</p>

<p>Let's see. As has been pointed out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ivan_Gunduli%C4%87#Serbian_misappropriations" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ivan_Gunduli%C4%87#Serbian_misappropriations" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, there is a pattern is behavior of some Serbian wiki users (I think I could pick up Purger (whatta idiocy), Bmalagurski, Milant, Mylan, Esta..whatever, they all look the same to me. Not to be confused with Miloš, Duja etc.). Their "contribution" and activity consists mainly in spreading anti-Croat propaganda in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>put out a distorted translation of quotation from some Serbian propagandist site</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>insist on drumming upon of "negative" aspects of Croatian history &amp; try to extend it, by projection, to the contemporary Croatian society and culture (main obsessions: Jasenovac, Ustaše, Homeland war,...). Avoid trying to explain why this right extremism had appeared at all, minimize Četnik atrocities, maximize (or, insist on absurd fihures) the Ustaše atrocities, keep silent about Croatian participation in WW2 partisan-Communist movement, ..</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>keep us posted on ICTY indictments against Croatian generals in the Croatian liberation war 1991-1995, while simultaneously whine about ICTY's partiality against Serbs. Looks like the ICTY is "right" when it indicts Croats, but wrong when it releases Kosovo Albanians</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>insist on the trait <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaven_Letica_7ef1.html" title="Slaven Letica">Slaven Letica</a> has called "pathological Serbian possessiveness": try to appropriate to the Serbian cultural and historical heritage the bulk of Croatian literature, architecture, historiography, history,..mainly in regions like Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, Slavonia, Bosnia, coastal Montenegro/Boka, Herzegovina</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>quote out of context, even misquote the sources. Find Croatian self-haters (for instance, journalists like Jelena Lovrić). Avoid quoting those who can be termed authorities in the field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>as regards the page on Starčević-it will be continued, don't worry. Without quotes from "srpska mreza" and similar "sources". It will be said that Starčević, along with other 19th century writers, shared racialist (not racist) worl-view that considered one ethnicity superior (in a more distant past, Shakespeare's English as a "happy race"), and others inferior or detestable. This was a world-view of Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Marx, Engels, Thackeray ("you are a French-beating animal"), Henley, Hegel, Schelling, Pushkin, Clausius, Nordau,...As for the alleged anti-Semitism: Starčević simply didn't care about Jews. He'd got a low opinion about them, <b>as did virtually everyone in the Western world from the Ancient Greece on</b>, which can be seen on the wiki page on anti-Semitism, or on linx that, although one-sided, give an array of not very favorable opinions on Jews (Voltaire, T.S.

<dd>I'm a little shocked by what you've admitted. You said that the homeland war is a negative aspect of Croatian history. Do you realize what you have said? Also, you put quotation marks for the word "negative" when reffering to Jasenovac, Ustase... Why the quotation marks? Are you saying that it's a joke? --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 18:27, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Don't worry, it was just a typo with brackets omitted (a frequent case with the longer sentences or those involving a few disparate concepts. Also: the quotation marks were intentional, because ustaše were not negative (nor positive): it was a historical reaction of the part of the Croatian nationalist movemnent to the years of the Serbian oppression. To define it as "negative" would be as absurd to define Soviet Communism, the most murderous regime on earth as "negative" or "positive". Those Croats and Bosnian Muslims who volunteered to take part in the Ustaška vojnica-more than 40.000 people in 1943.-cannot be labelled as war criminals, nor as traitors, as anti-Croat propaganda would have it in the Communist Yugoslavia period. The pathological murderers like Maks Luburić or totalitarian dictators like Ante Pavelić cannot cast the shadow on all the participants in the Ustaša military forces, any more than Joseph Mengele or Adolf Hitler can contaminate the memory of German soldiers, particularly Waffen SS who fought in the WW2. This is even more true about ordinary people or intellectuals who participated in the NDH regime (for instance, Adolfo Bratoljub Klaić, the author of famous <a href="http://www.sveznadar.hr/knjiga.aspx?knjiga=64936" class="external text" title="http://www.sveznadar.hr/knjiga.aspx?knjiga=64936" rel="nofollow">dictionary</a> of foreign words, or the sculptor <a href="http://www.mdc.hr/augustincic/eng/home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mdc.hr/augustincic/eng/home.html" rel="nofollow">Augustinčić</a>, who made a bust of Pavelić, but later switched sides. Do I have to repeat&#160;? The NDH was a quisling state. The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals. And, this is just the NDH talk. Let's not forget that, as far as resistance movement goes, the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to join the resistance (like the Serbs in the NDH), but did it out of ideals. And, in the percentage of participation, heavily outnumbering other nations in ex-Yugoslavia-except, pehaps, Montenegrins: <a href="http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/ww2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/ww2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/ww2.html</a> Hmmm...I haven't seen anything that would refute the claim that Serbian propagandists are vandalizing not a few wikipedia pages, solely with the aim of spreading anti-Croat chauvinist hatred. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 19:21, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know, I just read the first few sentences where you said that the Ustashe were not negative, and it just makes me sick. My Grandfather was killed by the Ustashe, his head was cut off, and his guts were nailed to the roof of his office at work.</p>

<dl>
<dd>And&#160;? Ustaše atrocities are not denied-as are Četnik or Communist ones. The above statement just corroborates what I've already said: your agenda is anti-Croat chauvinist one, since you claim (as far as I have read from the text) that <b>all</b> Ustaša soldiers were sadist murderers.

<p>When asked about Croatian attrocities, Franjo Tudjman said that others comitted crimes too. The interviewer told him, that doesn't make the Croatian attrocities right. We're not talking about Chetniks here, and you can't make the Croat attrocities less bloody by stating Chetnik attrocities, which I condemn. Both the Chetniks and the Ustashe are primitive organizations, bent on killing. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 23:08, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The sole purpose of the Ustashe was to exterminate the Serbs, unlike the Soviet Communism, which didn't have genocide as the goal of a nation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The sole purpose of the Ustaše leadership was to establish a Croatian state, which they did first as Mussolini's, and then as Hitler's puppets. As for many thousand members of Ustaška vojnica-and, as I said, they numbered between 40.000 and 70.000, the central goal was to defend their ethnic areas from Četnik and Communist intrusions and massacres. Another members of the Ustaše-led bureaucracy, like Bratoljub Klaić, writer of the 1944. etymological orthography, or Zvonimir Remeta, one of the best Croatian novelists of the 20th century, did not participate in any bloodshed, nor did they plan any. And this is a good litmus of what the entire thing is all about: those Croats and Bosniaks who participated in the Ustaša movement, more than 100.000-150.000 in 4 years, are stigmatized as murderers and criminals by default, by Serbian chauvinists.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Members of the Ustaše movement, and the part which can easily be catalogued, did commit atrocities and war crimes. But-the bulk of ordinary members of the Ustaša military forces-as I said, ca. 50.000 fightrs-were not war criminals any more than ordinary members of Četnik royalist or partisan communist movemensts. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 21:43, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, you're wrong, you're saying that only a few members of the Ustashe comitted attrocities.

<p>Reading about Starcevic from the edits commited by Mir Harven, I would ask a simple question:</p>
<p>What kind of knowledge brings writing about an, unknown to the World, Balkans politician (Starcevic) point of view about a great man (Karadzic)? Of an inferior intellect (Starcevic) if compared to the Vuk's?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What is the criterion for "inferior intellect"&#160;? Reading Starčević's polemics alongside Karadžić's, it is evident that Karadžić was inferior in any respect: erudition, knowledge of history, style,.. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As per your own words <i>Starčević is a figure of minor importance. He didn't devote much energy to the field probably because he realized that he was neither a qualified scholar nor did he possess a temperament for painstaking analysis needed for such a career.</i> Are you capable of grasping the fact that you already denied your own words while writing in the Discussion section of this article?</dd>

<dd>This is the last answer to this troll:don't twist my words. I didn't write anything about Strossmayer's invectives against Starčević, nor vice versa. Nor did I deny that Starčević was a superb polemicist, excellently versed in the knowledge of literary history. Just-he was not a scholar, nor did he bother to be. A brilliant polemicist should not be a scholar. In fact, the best polemicists have never been scholars. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 00:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About Karadzic as it was mentioned above <i>During his lifetime Karadzic achieved a European reputation. In 1823 he was the guest of Jacob Grimm in Kassel and of Goethe in Weimar; the same year he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena. In 1824 he became a member of the Turin Society for Antiquities and, in 1825, of the Gottingen Learned Society. In 1842 he was awarded a gold medal for his scholarship and literary achievements by the Russian Academy of Sciences. He became a corresponding member of the Viennese Academy in 1848, the Berlin Academy in 1850 and the St. Petersburg Academy in 1851. He was also a corresponding member of the Paris-based African League for Combat Against Slavery.</i></dd>

<dd>So what&#160;? I did not deny Karadžić's numerous contributions, field work or his role in shaping the Serbian language.

<dd>The question would be: what kind of European scholars were ever attracted by Karadžić's pan-Serbian linguistic ideology&#160;? The answer is-many, from Miklošič to Ausgust Leskien. And exactly this myth, which brought shame on Slavic philology amd its meanders, has been dismantled in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Karadžić's ideology of "dialectal" pan-Serbianism, which Starčević, Bogoslav Šulek and others had refuted, has fallen on deaf ears of their contemporaries. It was for this ideology Karadžić and his followers had been rightly debunked, not for his (Karadžić's) genuine contibutions to ethnography and philology. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 00:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>? This has been answered. Starčević was not a scholar, but a political fighter. The best answer is this: how many days did Vuk Karadžić spend in Austrian jail for political reasons&#160;? Did he ever clash with Austrian authorities&#160;?<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 00:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many of his writings I read and figured out that it was enough to read just a few. All the rest are repetitions of the same idiocies that can be extracted from just a few of them. Matos and Krleza? What they could see in the writings and speeches of that poor devil Starcevic?</dd>

<p>Starčević spoke Latin, Greek, French, German, Hungarian, Russian, Italian-apart from his native Croatian where he was an expert in Kačić, Gundulić and older Croatian historiography. Karadžić was unable to complete his dictionaries without the help of Kopitar and Daničić. As for "unknown to the world Balkans politician"-then, why do Serbian trolls so obsess about such an insignificant figure&#160;? Why is the page on Milan Babić overloaded with info&#160;? Croatian contributors would, in all probability, write a modest page on Starčević, hadn't Serbian obsessesives begun with the smear-campaign. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 23:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Google searching "Vuk Karadzic" I found the proof of a great interest in the works of Vuk Karadzic. Contrary to that, about Starcevic - we can see only some interest anomg Croats.</p>

<p>In comparison with Starčević, Karadžić got ca. 2 times more hits-a commensurable number. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 23:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As said before: Karadžić's works are the most important in the foundation of Serbian language, and, as such, it is understandable they are reprinted and written about.

<dd>2. Karadžić's work consisted, among other things, in misappropriation of Croatian cultural heritage 8the balald "Hasanaginica", first published by Fortis, has nothig to do with Serbs-or, Bosnian Muslims, for that matter. It is a purely croatian song which VK "sold" as a "Serbian song".) Also, his work in lexicography is unthinkable without Croatian heritage-for instance, in his 1847 translation of the New Testament, he explicitely stated he had coined ca. 300 new words. Later investigations <a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~vbockho/vbockhopublikationen.htm" class="external free" title="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~vbockho/vbockhopublikationen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~vbockho/vbockhopublikationen.htm</a> have shown that Vuk has simply took more than 90% of his "new words" from Joakim Stulli's Croatian dictionary.<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a></dd>

"..U prvoj skupini navodi 49 riječi za koje kaže da ih je preuzeo iz crkvenoslavenskog...Te se riječi..u narodu ne govore...Drugu skupinu od 47 riječi Kardžić označava kao posrbljenje crkvenoslavizme..Budući da V.S.Karadžić iza tih riječi navodi one koje je sam stvorio..može se zaključiti da ih je sam "posrbio", tj. prilagodio narodnom jeziku. U trećoj i najbrojnijoj skupini nalazi se 81 riječ.."Ima riječi 81 koje nijesam čuo u narodu da se govore već sam ih sam načinio"...U knjizi "Jezične koncepcije i njihovo ostvarenje u hrvatskoj i srpskoj leksokografiji" Volker je Bockholt usporedio riječi...s jedincama u Stullijevu "Rječosložju", najvećemu hrvatskom dopreporodnom rječniku....Od 49 riječi iz prve skupine u Stullija se nalazi 47....Polovica je Karadžićevih riječi iz prve skupine ...potvrđena hrvatskim "Glagoljskim brevijarom", a druga polovica nekolicinom djela hrvatskih pisaca ..a jedna riječ (smrtonosni) rusinskom Biblijom....Od Karadžićevih 47 riječi iz 2. skupine Stulić ne navodi njih osam...U tećoj skupini Stulić navodi više od polovive riječi......već je tvorbenim rješenjima Stulić donosio izbor današnjem hrvatskom (a i srpskom) standardu bliži nego što je pedesetak godina nakon njega činio Karadžić. Karadžić: grabljiv, kušač, mtvost, neposlušanje, prigotovljenje, vikač..Stulić: grabežljiv, kušalac, mrtvilo, pripravljanje, vikalac...Bockoltove spoznaje upućuju također da su mnoge riječi, koje nisu bile dio "narodnog jezika", već sastavnica hrvatskog književnog jezika, Karadžićevim posredstvom ušle u suvremeni srpski književni jezik...Karadžić skreće pozornost da Srbi s pisanjem na narodnom jeziku "nisu uranili prije druge polovine 18. vijeka, dok su braća zakona Rimskoga, osobito Dubrovčani i Dalmatinci, pisali u 16. vijeku u najveći jek&#160;!" <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 00:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This poor soul, Mir Harven, tried to prove as if Starcevic weren't racist giving further evidence of Starcevic's racism. Now he tried to show Starcevic's wisdom and knowledge and exposed Starcevic's stupidity and ignorance. We are losing a lot of time just to keep those like Harven away from editing this article. There must be an efficient way that an encyclopaedia shall adopt - if wanted to achieve some quality of information intended to be offered to a reader.
<dl>
<dd>Well, there is some knowledge in this Starcevic's rumbling against Serbs - but far more hate, forgery and primitive interpertations what he learned from the Constantine Porphyrogenites' book. Anyway - he was a hater and a racist
<dl>
<dd>Where is hate, forgery and racism&#160;? Actually, nothing "racist" appears in the Stačević polemic. Starčević's main claims, based on DAI and Croatian literary heritage were as folows:<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a></dd>

<dd>Again utter nonsense. The latest English edition of this book is the 1999 edition. This book references a great number of historical resources and clearly descibes the Serbs and their role in the history of and relationship with the Byzantine Empire thorugh centuries. As to the value of this book - <i>Long recognized as the basic history of the Byzantine Empire, this masterful work incorporates results of the vast expansion in Byzantine research in recent years</i> - back cover of the book. <i>History of Byzantine State contributes the canonical version of Byzantine history, superior to anything else in English</i> - Choice.

<dd>Do not vaste your time on this ignorant! For those that might know nothing about this topic, in the cemeteries of the places where the Serbs lived, there is a great number of tombstones on which there are inscribed (often long) messages addressed in the name of dead - to his/her son or daughter or even messages not addressed to anybody - written in the spoken Serbian language of that time - timestamped by the dates of the birth and death of the buried person. These tombstones are spanning centuries. I saw, by my own eyes - somewhere in Bosnia, a tombstone with the inscription that reads like: 'Ovdje pociva Srbin pravoslavni ... koji izrodi sa zenom mu ... sedmero djece koji ga hranise kad uzmogose ... pogibe od groma dok njivu orase ... 1758 godine ...'</dd>
<dd>Also, the Turkish Empire had many public proclamations, as the ones what to do in the time of plague, written in the spoken Serbian language which can be found (many of them!) in the archives of the Empire - again, spanning the centuries.</dd>

This book got all praise because there are virtually no newer investigations due to the lack of interest in English-language world. There are no new critical editions of the DAI, let alone critical histories of Serbs, Croats and Bosnians. One can just look up to a few litmus-concepts like "Serbo-Croatian language", "Croatian literature", "Urdu language" etc in the newest edition of the Britannica and see these articles and reviews are obsolete-even when written in 2004. So-<b>where are these proofs that some Serbian polity even existed in 800 or 900 or 1000&#160;? Where are material remnants&#160;? Names&#160;? Texts&#160;?

They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.</dd>

Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starčević polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations.

Onome, ko je proštio rečeni članak, ne-treba dokazivati istinitost ovih rečih. S toga nisam hteo ni jednu reč o njegovu sastavku progovoriti, nego sam čekao na „Srbski Dnevnik." Ovaj list zbilja očituje svoje mnenje, i, kako i „Srbske novine, napada na g. Ljudevita Gaja. Dakle za obranu nedužnosti u ovoj prepirki očitujem: da sam ja, kao tadašnji namestnik moga priatelja I. V., sudelo-vatelja kod „Narodnih Novinah," onaj članak napisao, i bez znanja g. Gaja dao tiskati, t. j. onaj članak od 18. kolovoza o. g., koi se piscu Srbskih novinah" nedopada, — i da je g. Gaj, saznavši za onaj moj članak već tiskan, nad njime svoje nezadovoljstvo očitovao; — izjavljujem takodjer, da sam dao i ovaj sastavak tiskati ne samo bez njegova znanja, nego tako, da on o njemu ništa i nebi mogao znati, jer se ni sada nenalazi u Zagrebu. Obćinstvo će dakle ovu prepirku samo meni podpisanom uračunati, a gg. pisci „srbskih" časopisah imati će odsele ne na g. Gaja, ali na koga drugoga, nego upravo na me svoje članke upravljati, kad ih nisu do sad upravljali na „Narodne Novine;" —jer još nisu tako daleko u publicistiki došli, da bi znali, da uredji-vatelji novinah nepišu sve ono, što u novinah stoji. Čini mi se, da dobro poznam gg. protivnike, ali ću im imena iz ljubavi prama siromašnima u duhu zamučati, te ću samo nešto odgovoriti na samu stvar, i to samo iz dogodjajnice. Uvrede ali svadju neka niko meni nepripisuje, to bo je ono, što ja nada sve merzim. Kako se dakle govori iz ljubavi i priateljstva, onako neka se uzme. Ovo je književna polemika, a ne narodni boj.</p>
<p>Gg. pisci pozivlju se na Šafafika, koi u 14. §. „narodopisa slovan-skoga" veli, da je ono srpski jezik, koi se govori po južnome delu negdašnje (!) Magjarske, po Slavonii, po delu Hervatske, Kranjske i Istrie, po Primorju negda magjarskom, po vojničkoj krajini, Dalmacii, kneževini Srbii, Bosni, Hercegovini, po staroj Srbii i po Cernojgori." Ali g. Šafafik ni najmanje nedokažuje ono, što veli, premda je deržanstvo svakoga pisca svoje reči dokazati; ja barem do golih rečih toliko deržim, koliko da ih i nije. Da bi ko o nami Hervatih tako beztemeljno pisao, mi bi ga najprie prosili, neka muči, ako li nebi hteo, mi bi njegovo delo preporučili za zamatanje papra, duhana, sira i sličnih stvarih. „Srbski Dnevnik" pristaje uz „Srbske novine," i veli, da ga tako dogodjajnica uči. Da vidimo dogodjajnicu ovih narodah samo u današnjoj njihovoj domovini.</p>
<p><b>Konstantin VII. (umrao 959.) u knjigi ,,o upravljanju carstva" na glavi 30. veli, da pet bratah Hervatah sa dvemi sestrami dojdoše u Dalma-ciu, ali da u njoj najdoše Avare. S njima dakle vojevaše nekoliko godinah, dok ih Hervati nadvladaju, i što poubijaju, što sebi podlože; da je jedna strana Hervatah iz Dalmacie izišla, i da je zauzela te takodjer i naselila Iliriu i Panoniu; on veli, da su Hervati dalmatinski proti Frankom sedam godinah vojevali, i da su ih nadjačali; on zapadnu stranu primorske Hervatske proteže od Cetine do Labina istrianskoga, a u širinu, veli, da se više Istrie pruža; on k onoj strani Hervatske broji 11 županiah, izvan toga Liku, Kerbavu i Gacku, dakle barem do Kapele daje širinu. O Hervatih u Bosni, u Slavonii i u Kupo-Dravju ništa nepiše. Gl. 31. veli, da Hervati terguju po svemu moru jadran-skome tia do Mletakah, da imaju jako veliku moć na kopnu i na moru, da moraju tu vojsku deržati zbogu čestoga naserćanja Frankah, Turakah (t. j. Magjarah) i Pacinecitah.</b></p>
<p>Što veli o „Srbih?"</p>
<p>Glav. 32. — „Jedan brat uze polovicu puka i zaprosi cara He-raklia, da bi mu dao pristanište; car ga primi i dade mu mesto kod Tesalonike, koje se od onda prozva Serbliom. A Serbli se rimskim jezikom zovu Servi (= sužnji, sluge) odtuda Serbula = sužanjska obuća; i Serbuljane zovemo one, koji su priprosto obuveni. Serbli se s toga tako zovu. što su rimskim carem služili. — Za nekoliko vremena svidi se Servom, da se povrate u staru svoju zemlju, i zbilja car ih odpusti. Ali kad preidoše preko Dunaja, pokajaše se, te kroz pretora bel-gradskoga prosiše cara, da bi im drugu zemlju za stan dao. I zbilja car im dade zemlju, koja se danas (949) zove Serblia, Pagania, zemlja Zahumacah, Terbunia i Kanalis. — Dalje piše Konstantin, da je Šimun Bogar sve Serve „od maloga do velikoga" odveo u Bugarsku, izvan onih nekoliko, koji su u Hervatsku utekli, te tako da im je ostala zemlja pusta. A kad Bugari s vojskom udariše u Hervatsku, sve su ih Hervati poubijali. — Nakon sedam godinah vrati se Sebeslav u Serviu, te najde u njoj 50 mužkaracah bez ženah i dece, koji živihu o lovu, itd., on veli, da su „Servi" vazda bili podložni caru rimskome, t. j. u novie vreme bizantinskome. — Dalje mi netreba iz Konstantina vaditi. <b>Prispodobite, gospodo, i s g. Šafafikom, Hervate i Serble, ili Serve. Hervati bojnim mačem u junačkoj ruci vojuju proti strašnim Avarom, ukrote ih i načine si novu domovinu; a Servi prose Bizantinca za komad zemlje. Neusudjuju se bez dopusćenja ni koraciti iz opre-deljenog im mesta, prose i dobivaju po drugi put stan od Bizantinca. To je jedini puk srednjega veka, koi je bez kervi dobio komad zemlje.</b></p>
<p>Hervati imaju deržavu uredjenu, imaju svoje županie, koje su i Magjari od njih uzeli, imaju vosku na kopnu i moru, imaju tergovce, rečju Hervati su narod u deržavi; a kod Servah o tome ni glasa nj traga, samo je kad kad čuti ime ž u p a n i a, koje su od Hervatah primili, i poglavar s posve zameršenim zlamenovanjem. — Hervati nakon sedam godinah nadvladaše carstvo, koje Karlo veliki složi skoro iz celoga zapada; a šaka Bugarah na sedam godinah zasužnji puk ser-vianski onako, kakono Babilonci sa židovskim učiniše. — Papa rimski ište od Hervatah prisegu, da neće na nikoga s vojskom udarati, van da će se samo braniti.</p>
<p><b>Gospodo, nekome je moglo tesno biti, kad se je ova zakletva od</b> samih Hervatah iskala. Hervati su se, gospodo, hervali, a nisu ro bovali, nisu prosili dronjke od Bizantinacah.Narod je her vatski, gospodo, staru Iliriu od Avarah oslobodiu, pa je uzeo u njoj mesto, koje je sam hteo, a ne koje su mu Bizantinci odredili; narodu hervatskome, gospodo, plaćala je mletačka republika morna- rinu (Dandulo kod Lucia knj 2. gl. 1.), narod hervatski upleten je jačje u dogodjajnicu Rima, Mletakah, Magjarah, Frankah, Bizantinacah —nego li Servianci u dogodjajnicu Servie. —</p>
<p>Ali gdje je stanovao taj narod hervatski? Da vidimo. Konstantin VII., kako vidismo, veli, da se je jedna strana njegova naselila u Iliriu 1 u Panoniu, ali do kuda, kako daleko, to on nekaže. Pogledajte, gospodo, darovnicu Terpimira, vojvode hervatsko-ga, od g. 838. (Lučio knj. 2. gl. 2.), pa ćete naći, da se nadbiskupstvo Solinsko proteže do obale Dunaja, ,,i skoro preko svega kraljevstva hervatskoga." Što je to? Upitajte g. Šafafika, neka vam kaže. Ja znam, da cerkva nije bila vazda razdieljena polag političkoga uredjenja deržavah, ali je cerkva hervatska služila se od početka i služi se i danas svojim hervatskim jezikom. Meni je za sada dosta, da je od mora jadranskoga do Dunaja bio narod, koi se je služio u cerkvi jezikom hervatskim.</p>
<p>Pogledajte, gospodo, u „Arkiv za jugoslavensku poviestnicu" knj. 2. razdel 1. str. 4., ali još ćete pametnie učiniti, ako pogledate u „Carrara, Archivo capitolare di Spalato" str. 67. — pa ćete naći, da je kod Her-vat ah bio običaj, da sedam banah narodu hervatskome kralja izabire. Gospodo, i ovu su deržavnu ustanovu Magjari od Hervatah pri-gerlili i dugo vremena deržali, a na skoro su ju i Nemci primiti do-stojali. Koji su to bani bili? Ban hervatski, bosanski, slavonski (Kupo-Dravski), požežki (iz današnje Slavonie), p od-r a niski (iz Bosne oko reke Drine), arbanaski i ramski (iz iztočno--južne Bosne). Odovuda učite se i s g. Šafarikom, kako treba razumiti reči Konstantinove, koi hoće — želeć prava Bizantinacah na Hervate protegnuti — da su Zahumci i ostali puci od Cetine prama Dubrovniku servianskoga kolena, a ona strana Dalmacie poznana je, gospodo, pod imenom Cerljene Hervatske. To vam s g. Šafarikom budi za sada dosta.</p>
<p><b>I zbilja, kako vi s g. Šafarikom tumačite Konstantina, kad veli na jednome mestu, a na drugom o pitanju ništa nezna — da je car bizantinski dopustio Hervatom Avare proterati. To ćete mi drugi put kazati. Kako razumite Konst. kad veli, da su se Servi naselili u cerljenu Hervatsku, t. j. od Cetine niz berdo, — u zemlju, koju su Hervati oteli i zauzeli? I to ćete drugi put kazati. — Razgledajte se sada po onome prostoru, u koi ste bili s g. Šafarikom nekakov Srbež razkopitili.</b> —</p>
<p>Još mi ostaju dva extrema, t. j. Istria i Dubrovnik. Vi velite, da su Istrianci nekakvi Srbi; ali gospodo pogledajte u „istrianske razvode" od god. 1325. (Arkiv za jug pov. knji. 2. razdel 2. str. 232—268.) pa ćete videti gde Istrianac veli da piše jezikom hervatskim. Upitajte g. Šafafika što je to. — <b>Vi velite, da je knjižtvo Dubrovačko serbsko knjižtvo, t. j. da su Dubrovčani plemena servianskoga, ali gospodo, Zlatarić veli, da Sofokleovu Elektru i Ljubomira Tasova prevodi na hervatski jezik. O poganac ga neprekinuo što to kaže! Čavčić Vetranić kaže da Hekubu prevodi na hervatski jezik. O gutunar ga neudavio što to veli! Pa kako pišu ti ljudi? Onako, kako i Lučić, i Ranjina. i Mažibradić, i Lukarević i Hektorević i mnogi drugi hervatski pisci iz Dalmacie. U ostalom ja deržim Dubrovčane za pohervatjene Latince. Kažite sve ovo i g. Šafafiku, pa ga upitajte za ovako staro domaće pismo o Rusih, Poljacih ali Česih, kao što je Terpimirova da-rovnica — Tako je kod Hervatah.</b></p>
<p>Kako stoje tako zvani „Srbi?" Gospodo to je jedini puk, koi nezna ni sam samcat kako mu je ime. Upitajte g. Šafafika, nebi li znao za još koi takov puk. Kažite mi, gospodo i s g. Šafafikom, ima li se govoriti: Srb, ali Srbin, ali Srbljin, ali Srbalj, ali Srbianac, ali Srbljanin itd. Ovako se danas taj puk sam zove, a to valjda znate i vi i g. Ša-fafik, da je ta zemlja, stara Mysia, i Dacia od sredine VII veka — do najnoviih vremenah poznana kod svih europejskih narodah pod imenom „Servie." — Ime Servus (sužanj, sluga), koje su oholi tudjinci davali jednoj strani naroda našega, nije nikada bilo ime narodno, nego ime tugje, kome su se svi pametni nanašinci vazda uklanjali, i uklanjaju mu se i danas. <b>Slušajte dobro: neima ni pedeset godinah, što je taj preterani srbež nekoje ljude snašao. Otci i dedi onih, koji se danas za srbstvo nadimlju, nadimaše se za Ilirstvo.</b></p>
<p>Pogledajte gospodo kirilsko knjižtvo. Da vam samo nešto o srbstvu napomenem. Vaš „lietopis" od g. 1827. del II. str. 172. veli da ste se vi sami prozvali Srbi i Srbi i. — — Što ćete s onima pismi, iz kojih ste ne pred-a mnom samim — „narod ilirski" prepisali „narod srbski" — pa ste to tako i naštampali. U vaše „sedmice" broju 7. piše beogradski mitropolit god. 1735. da je on „iliriko-rascianskago (a ne srbskoga) naroda strojasčijasja itd. protektor."</p>
<p><b>Gde su pisci, gde su pisma toga naroda srbskoga? Gde je taj jezik? Pravo rekuč pisalo se s malom iznimkom — u kirilici do jučer jezikom cerkvenim, a gospodo Hervat je prie imao i svoju cerkvu i u njoj svoj jezik, nego li se za Srbe znalo. Sva pisma kraljah hervatskih pisana su, gospodo, jezikom hervatskim. Pod Krešimirom velikim pokazala je bila Latinština roge, te se i u njoj pisalo, ali je vazda ono isto bilo i hervatski pisano.</b> <b>Pogledajte u diplomu Krešimira velikoga, od god. 1067. (Lučio knj. 2. gl. 8) pa ćete videti, da je vladika Zadarski ono pismo morao napisati i „lingva rustica" — t. j. pučkim jezikom. —</b> Gde je, gospodo, taj srbski jezik? Pogodite se o njemu barem vi sami, a nepišite kako sada. — Jer „Dnevnik" veli, da naša zmija iz Kotara ravna — Ante Kuzmanić nepiše srbski, a on piše onako, kako su pisala oba Kačića, oba Relkovića, Katančić, Došen, Margitić, i mnogi drugi hervatski pisci; — „novine" i ovaj jezik derže za srbski, a „srbin katolik iz Savonie" kaže, da je čakavština jezik hervatski. Načinite se gospodo medju se!</p>
<p>Pogledajte, gospodo, u hervatsku kroniku iz 12. ali najdalje iz 13. veka (Arkiv za jug. pov. knjiga 1. str. 4—37) pa vidite skupa s g. Šafafikom kako onaj kronista piše, i — čudite se, — veli, da piše jezikom hervatskim. — Hervati, gospodo, imaju i slova svoja, koja nije Graeculus iznašao, nego narod hervatski. Za ova slova upitajte i veliku Rusiu i izobraženu Česku, pa će vam znat kazati. — Sto još da vam kažem o jeziku? znate li, da su kroz belgradskoga praetora prosili Servi novi stan? Dakle je Belgrad stao, dok su se Servi u Tesalii gnjezdili, stao je i narod, koi ga je tako zvao. Jest gospodo, stanovao je tu puno prie narod panonski, narod slavjanski, pa su se Servi s onim narodom pomešali, kako i Hervati jedni s Avari, a drugi isto tako s Panonci. Servi Konstantinovi, to je temelj vaš. Možda ćete se vi i g. Šafafik nada time čuditi, ali se nečude istinu ljubeći ljudi. — Odkuda ima naš narod oko Beograda i po Sremu e u rečih n. p. dete, lepo, mleko itd.</p>
<p>Gospodo, kažite g. Šafafiku i g. Miklošiću da je to glas kajkavacah, kažite im, da je tamošnji jezik još i danas pun kajkavštine. Ja sam vidio, da nekoi Sremac piše otcu: „dragi otac!" To je gospodo,</p>

<p><i>On Croats</i> .........</p>
<p>But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. <b>After they had fought one another for some vears, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them.</b> And so from that time this land was possessed by the Croats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince&#160;; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia&#160;; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country&#160;; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. <b>The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous</b>,.... .................. <b>These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own&#160;; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so</b>&#160;; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories. ............... Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacharias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. <b>Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans' that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince&#160;; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they instantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia&#160;; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats.</b></p>
<p><br />
<i>On Serbs</i> ........</p>
<p>But when two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking a moiety of the folk, claimed the protection of Heraclius, the emperor of the Romans, and the same emperor Heraclius received him and gave him a place in the province of Thessalonica to settle in, namely Serbia, which from that time has acquired this denomination. <b>'Serbs' in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves', whence the colloquial 'serbula' for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi' for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Heraclius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in.</b> And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelled from those parts the Romani who now live in Dalmatia and Dyrrachium), therefore the emperor settled these same Serbs in these countries, and they were subject to the emperor of the Romans; and the emperor brought elders from Rome and baptized them and taught them fairly to perform the works of piety and expounded to them the faith of the Christians ........... and there they were all slain by the Croats. <b>Seven years afterwards Tzeeslav escaped from the Bulgarians with four others, and entered Serbia from Preslav, and found in the country no more than fifty men only, without wives or children, who supported themselves by hunting. With these he took possession of the country and sent a message to the emperor of the Romans asking for his support and succour, and promising to serve him and be obedient to his command, as had been the princes before him.</b> ...............</p>

<p>What the heck are you guys doing over here? You're arguing more than possible to follow. What's wrong with Ante Starcevic? Sure, he claimed that the Serbs (Darkness) will probably be consumed by the Croats (Light), but he was just an excentric. Not even slightly excentric than the Serbian claims that the Croatian nation is going to be melted into the Serbian through the Serb migrants from Ottoman invasions. I guess that the only real rhethoric nonsence that he endorsed was his historical POV-pushes regarding Red Croatia, and how the <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemanjic.html" title="Nemanjic">Nemanjic</a> dynasty was Croatian, so that Croatia's historical borders must be restored by all costs (from Istria to Attica), lol...&#160;:) He considered Stefan Dusan to be a greater Croat overmaching Tomislav. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 10:30, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know what of your comment above should be taken seriously. One thing I do not like, whether serious or not, is labelling people (<i>Serbian POV-pushers</i>) - practiced by Harven, too. I was the main contributor about Starcevic's racism and anti-Semintism. My findings are exclusively based on the works of the Croatian historians - Gross, Barisic, and Goldstein and some verifications of these findings in the Starcevic's works in the Zagreb University library. Also, I did not delete anything from the previous versions of this article - even though I did not find some of them reasonable. Finding my contribution wiped out, labelled as <i>Greater Serbia propaganda</i> etc. - I could only restore the article to the previous version waiting on honest people who a) could contribute that part of Starcevic's biography not yet touched by others and that might be worthwhile reading b) discuss honestly the existing contributions. Once more, skip labelling people this or another way - not knowing about them anything.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 13:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your third sentence does not make sense to me too - I am not writing about a <i>Father of a Nation</i>, nor I ever regarded him this way.

<p>I suggest that anonymous stops inserting this higly controversial tag, especially due to the fact that according to that logic one can tag almost any nationalist of the romanticism era as a crypto-fascist. Infact, it's no secret that a lot of romantic nationalist were both racist and anti-semite, and not only nationalists for that matter, even socialists like <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, but I really don't think anyone in the right mind would call one of the fathers of modern anarchism a fascist... However, I do support the addition of a subsection in the main article explaining his position on racism and anti-semitism, but it needs to be done in a NPOV way with respectable, verifiable sources, and not the way it has been done in the previous version of the article, which was written from a Serb extremist point of view, and was infact nothing more than a propaganda pamphlet. Therefore, I'm removing the tag, and would ask those who truly wish to improve this article to do it the right way, without causing unnecessary controversy and flame wars. Thank you. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 22:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, my friend, Starcevic's racism and anti-Semitism is verifiable with the most <i>respectable, verifiable sources</i> - his own works as it was stated in my contribution. Also, the same racial tenet of his is correctly spotted and quoted by renown scholars and historians - P.Barisic, M.Gross, I.Goldstein, A.J.P. Taylor. <b>So, when using somebody's (Starcevic's) work <i>as is</i> it is completely neutral way of saying something about him. But for you and a number of other people - everythong is POV whatever is not to your liking.</b> Puting Bakhunin in this context does not make sense to me at all. Bakhunin had not entertained ever an idea describing people like an animal breed (<i>pasmina</i>) - which Starcevic does. Bakhunin never wrote or talked about people that had "just half of the human mind" and, for that reason, they "shall be governed by people of the human nature". It was just Starcevic. Bear in mind that Starcevic's racial tenet was part of Pavelic's program of extermination of those who had "just half of the human mind" - Jews, Serbs, Romas.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 11:48, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, "my friend", two can play that game. If you tag Starcevic as fascist, I can tag almost any serbian nationalist from Vuk Karadjic to Vuk Draskovic as fascist too. And I'm sure you wouldn't like that. Why? Because it's biased POV, just as your POV here. And infact, even Bakunin DID talk about Jews in a similar manner - "this entire Jewish world, which constitutes an exploiting sect, a people of leeches, a voracious parasite, closely and intimately connected with another, regardless not only of frontiers but of political differences as well -- this Jewish world is today largely at the disposal of Marx or Rothschild... etc". In the historical context it is certainly not uncommon for 19th century Europe. Again, you could have made this abundantly clear in "your" version of the article, but instead chose to resort to drawing low propagandist punches. So, what will it be? Will you compromise or will we continue this rv war? --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 12:13, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are free to put your tag whenever you want - I am not concerned about it, and it is not related to this article. As to the Bakhunin's writing - it is not still comparable to those of Starcevic's. My <i>low propagandist punches</i> are findings of the renown scholars and historians - P.Barisic, M.Gross, I.Goldstein, A.J.P. Taylor - presented <i>as is</i>. And also, do not try to relativize Starcevic's racism and anti-Semitism. It is only what shall be known about him - for an European reader. Philosopher? Writer? Historian? What else? Compared to Bakhunin - just an obscure little provincial politician - like it or not!--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 13:43, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now listen here, you little vandal! This encyclopedia isn't your playground or the place to vent out your childish frustrations! Its objective is to be neutral and truthful, and to present as much relevant information as needed. Who the fvck are you to judge if this man was or wasn't a relevant philosopher, writer, historian or anything else?? He is certainly significant as far as Croatia is concerned, an in that sense everything relevant about his life and work needs to be presented! You have stepped over the line too many times for me to just let this slide. If you continue with your campaign of vandalization of Croatia-related articles I promise you I will make it my personal mission to see you and your vandal buddies Medule, Mostassa, Purrger, etc. banned from Wikipedia FOREVER. Again, I'm not saying anti-semitism and racism info about Starcevic shouldn't be included in the article, I'm saying it needs to be presented in a NPOV way. Every single administrator out there will support this. It's your choice, stop vandalizing or else. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 14:29, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>...was a Croatian politician, philosopher, and writer</i>. A philosopher? Very interesting. And, what was his monumental philosophical work? Maybe "How to crow like a rooster"?--4.249.6.18 00:35, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user "Purger" (sometimes as "Purrger"-probably in order to avoid blockage) is spreading anti-Croat propaganda (one can easily check on their contrib page). Also, I won't deign to address his hysterical jabber about my anti-whatever intolerance and/or prejudice. Let's stick to the facts.</p>
<p>1. this user hasn't contributed anything that is not related to some dark sides of Croatian history (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Ante_Paveli%C4%87_dbef.html" title="Ante Pavelić">Ante Pavelić</a>)- <b>and</b> to the pages he would like to "paint them black" (Starčević etc.). In short, all "contribution" of this user can be summed up thusly: Croats are Fascists/Nazis/demons/"bad". This is all what we can expect from this user. Well, he nicely fits in one of the categories described in the page on Croatophobia.</p>
<p>2. what about this page&#160;? He's chopped out quotes from Ante Starčević, mainly posted on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a> sites for propaganda purposes &amp; tries to recycle them endlessly, in a smear campaign aimed at the "father of the nation" (Starčević honorific title). Well-if the "father of the nation" is a racist, "fascist", bad, bad, bad,...then, I guess, are his national &amp; ideological descendants who include virtually all Croatian people.<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 22:37, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Anyone conversant with the texts of a polemical author (Starčević wrote numerous articles-his collected works are contained in a few books (I forgot how many), say, 4-5) knows that <b>anyone</b> who wrote more than 1,000 pages on politics can be accused on virtually anything. The user "Purger" did not-it is evident- read anything Starčević wrote. He's a complete ignoramus re Starčević's influence on major Croatian intellectual figures, most notably the best Croatian (and, btw, a Communist) writer of the 20th century <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miroslav_Krle%C5%BEa_5674.html" title="Miroslav Krleža">Miroslav Krleža</a>.<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 22:37, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trivia. Today's the most ardent follower of Starcevic (a philosopher) is a well-known man, Anto Djapic. The named Anto is the head of today's Croatian Party of Rights - whose political views and programme are exactly the same as those of Starcevic's. Anto is a member of the Croatian Sabor (Parliament) for over the last 15 years. Anto entered the law graduate studies at University of Split and mastered his M.Sc. thesis using the omnipotent scientific method called 'copy and paste'. Naturally, he failed to earn the M.Sc. degree for being exposed and his scientific work, therefore, annulled. But he is still the MP and even once he was the presidential candidate. He even tried to be a member of the Croatian state government - which was resolutely prevented by some EU politicians. So, the Starcevic's legacy is alive - racism, criminal, lies, forgeries.--4.249.0.92 17:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He knows nothing what Mirjana Gross, a pre-eminent authority on Starčević (and, herself a Jewsess) has written in her magnum opus, a monumemtal monograph on Starčević "Izvorno pravaštvo". He doesn't know that this most thorough monograph is a monument to Starčević, not a defamation of any kind. He's just sliced a few nasty &amp; one-sided propagandist pieces that purport to intepret Gross's book and glued them in an effort to throw mud on Starčević's person &amp; image.

This ludicrous claim (no people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox cultural sphere did participate in the Renaissance) is aimed to discredit Starčević's contentions, expressed in a polemic against the proponents of pan-Sertbian followers of <a href="../../../v/u/k/Vuk_Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87_dba3.html" title="Vuk Karadžić">Vuk Karadžić</a> who tried to appropriate Croatian cultural heritage). Why this arcane, actually utterly bizarre contentions&#160;? Why bother with what some Croatian political &amp; cultural writer said ca. 150 years ago&#160;? Simply-Starčević had unmasked pan-Serbian ideology that had caused numerous wars in the next 100-150 years. And, this unmasking-<b>hurts</b>. Especially those who follow in the footsteps of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a> ideological fantasies on power, expansion &amp; misappropriation.</p>
<p>3. what about Starčević's claims this user considers are of so vital importance that must constitute the bulk of the page&#160;? A part of them that is true will (and, already is, albeit partially) be incorporated and <b>explained</b>, in the historical context, in the main body of the text, for the sake of giving the complete picture of Ante Starčević. That's all. For the rest, this walking example of Croatophobia should better seek a psychiatric treatment. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 22:37, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mediation will obviously not work if the parties involved are not willing to give it a try. I believe at this point it is the only option. No admin or bureaucrat would get involved on what they would see as a "content dispute". Banning people is not a solution either as a new username can be created at any time.

His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy, which he calls "the science of life".

<p>There is nothing to add to these accolades - except that all these 'achievements' are not of European level of that time nor his work ever atracted anyone in Europe of that time - nor today.</p>
<p>I do not know how a reader might find it educative or interesting to learn about 'four plays written - and only one preserved' or about 'critical review of Đurđević's Pjesni razlike'. Why not to have all above exclusively within the Croatian Wikipedia article about Starcevic only?</p>

<p>I will remove a whole chapter, "Starcevic's racism and its followers", which consists of two large paragraphs. Here are the reasons:</p>
<p>First paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Starcevic's racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar [pseudonym L. V. Sudland], in his work Die Sudslawische Frage und der Weltkrieg, which was published in 1918. The topicality of this racist work is seen from the fact that it was reprinted in 1990. In the preface to this edition, Dr. Vladimir Veselica, president of the Croatian Democratic Party, expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given "relevant answers" at the highest intellectual level. What thrilled him so was the consistently expressed racist hatred against the Serbs. It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book, which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs: " it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition, how a bent for conspiracies, revolutions and coups is in their blood. "</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What has this got to do with Starčević??? Even if it was true (and I doubt it), it is totally unrelated to Ante Starčević. --<a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmaj_19ba.html" title="User:Zmaj">Zmaj</a> 06:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Strictly related to Starcevic. Pilar elaborated further Starcevic's racist tenet. This book (Die Sudslawische Frage und der Weltkrieg) strictly references Starcevic's works and ideas.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Croatian racism on which Starcevic's Party of Rights was founded had its worthy heirs. The British historian A.P.J. Taylor wrote (pages 188-189)</i></dd>
<dd><i>The Croat Diet was dominated by the Party of Right, which continued to demand the "state rights" of Croatia and still lived in the dream world of medieval law from which the Hungarians had escaped. The Party of Right was clerical, conservative, and pro-Habsburg; its only concession to nationalism was hostility to the Serbs, ... When some members of the Party of Right hesitated to make conflict with the Serbs their only political activity, the majority of the party reasserted itself as the Party of the Pure Right - meaning pure of any trace of reality.</i></dd>
<dd><i>In his book, this famous and world renown historian even did not mention Starcevic as a political figure - paying a fair amount of his attention to the ideas and work of Starcevic's worst enemy - Strossmayer (pages 189-191, 193).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, nothing to do with Starčević. The <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_Party_of_Rights_d938.html" title="Croatian Party of Rights">Croatian Party of Rights</a> has its own article, so this can (maybe) be moved over there. The user who added this paragraph even admitted that Taylor says nothing about Starčević, so why is this here??? I would like to assume good faith, but it seems this entire chapter was added with the intention to smear Starčević. --<a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmaj_19ba.html" title="User:Zmaj">Zmaj</a> 06:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Utter nonsense. Starcevic's racist tenet was a foundation of the Party of Rights. Starcevic led this party for more than twenty years. Taylor did not mention Starcevic - rather his racism mirrored in the Party of Rights political activity. There was nothing wise nor necessary in his racism to be elaborated further in this great book. Starcevic was a dirty politician - so nothing to smear! His racism is the sound proof of his dirty political activity.</dd>

<p>There was a sentence in the article that went like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Starcevic said the following words: "self-determination of the Croatian people is only possible at the expense of denying and exterminating the Serbian people."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Even though there are many suspicious quotes in the article, this one really stood out. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnte_Perkovic_0b1b.html" title="User:Ante Perkovic">Ante Perkovic</a> questioned its truthfulness, correctly pointing out that it was slander until proven true.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">Bormalagurski</a> added the source of that quote: <a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/pisma/l-a.little.more.truth.html" class="external text" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/pisma/l-a.little.more.truth.html" rel="nofollow"><i>A Little More Truth</i></a>, an open letter by Mr. Todorovic, Public Affairs Officer of SAVA, the organization of Americans of Serbian heritage.</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> says, a quote from the Internet means nothing by itself, since anyone can post anything on the web. Secondary sources are reliable if they are written by reputable scholars, people that can be trusted. I read the entire text by Mr. Todorovic and can say with absolute certainty that the man not only cannot be trusted, but is extremely biased and unreliable. This is what Mr. Todorovic says of the Croats:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I agree, there is a difference, when you compare the average Croatian coward to people like Vietnam War hero, Lance Sijan, a Serb.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, I agree with you, there is a cultural difference between the Serbs and the Croats, our illiterates make most Croats appear stupid.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And this is what he says about modern Croatia:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>How self-righteous of both of you to ignore the fact that since 1990, the Croatians have succeeded in cleansing 600,000 Serbs and nearly every Jew from Croatia, to fulfill their Nazi dream of a Greater Croatia.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Mr. Todorovic generously extends his disdain to Muslims too:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is little doubt that after 500 years of Ottoman slavery, the Serbian people have a right to despise the Muslim Serbs who betrayed their faith and enslaved their own brothers.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>No comment. Such displays of hatred are both ridiculous and sad. However, the use of such "sources" indicates that some contributors (and proven sock puppets) have a POV agenda and that every claim against Starčević needs to be thoroughly checked. Still, I am confident that we will eventually get rid of all the defamation and give Starčević the article he deserves. --<a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmaj_19ba.html" title="User:Zmaj">Zmaj</a> 07:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>In the Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar (December 8, 1851) he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. He would continually have disputes with the followers of Karadžić. Starčević already elaborated his linguistic ideas in 1850 in his foreword to Istarski razvod, a crucial Croatian document from 1325 which he transcribed from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet. His foreword points out that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects (Shtokavian, Chakavian and Kajkavian) and the Krajina dialect is called the Croatian language, which Starčević considers from the perspective of its six hundred years of history. Starčević accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life, considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian.</i></p>
<p>The whole paragraph is about a man's (Starcevic's) thinking about language - who (Starcevic) never was educated as a linguist nor he had any practical knowledge about the matter (language) he tried to elaborate. As a result - the whole Starcevic's writings about language did not attract any attention of the contemporary linguists that time, nor those writings have any value today.</p>
<p>I just wonder how this scribling about such man's ideas might benefit a reader of this article?</p>
<p>This gravely damages the Wikipedia integrity and credibility - compromising serious attempts to hold a respectable level of the encyclopaedia editorial policy.</p>

<dd>for the more general linguistic issues, he is far from unimportant.

<dd>Well, Istarski Razvod was written by Josip Bratulic, not Starcevic. Secondly, I'm sure there are lots of people who "didn't make it" and "didn't get much attention from the big guys", tough luck. Besides, you have not provided sources, but I trust that you and many Croats consider him an important figure in the world of linguistics.

It is a medieval legal document, which was first published in modern times by Starčević in the 19th century and critically analyzed by Bratulić in the 20th century.

<p>I stumbled across this article accidentally - searching some references about the Austro-Hungarian empire. Reading this heated discussion above, I was prompted to check a few things:</p>
<p>- part of the Starcevic's racism and its followers based on and quoted from the A.P.J. Taylor's book is correct</p>
<p>- in this book - History of the Balkans (The Joint Committee on Eastern Europe Publication Series, No. 12) by Barbara Jelavich, Cambridge University Press 1983</p>
<p>I found another confirmation of the Starcevic's racist attitude:</p>
<p>page 66</p>
<p>Among the nationalists, the most popular was Ante Starcevic, the head of the Party of Rights, whose doctrine had strong anti-Serbian overtones.</p>
<p>Starcevic and those of similar views regarded the Serbs simply as second-rate Croats. They could be 'croatized' just as the Hungarians were attempting to magyarize their minorities.</p>
<p>page 67</p>
<p>He contiued to regard the Serbs as Orthodox Croats.</p>
<p>Also, there is no Starcevic's biography in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica - contary to the fact that there are entries about his political enemy Strossmayer and his language reform rival - Karadzic. Searching further (www.amazon.com) found a pitty fact: Starcevic's works and works about him are only in the Serbo-Croatian - zero availability, zero interest in those works.</p>
<p>Advice to the contributors - pay attention to the (linguistic, literary, political - if any) results of this man and not to his political activities, fightings or beliefs. Nobody is famous for his fightings or beliefs. Only clear results and valuable ideas that survived a man and passed the borders of his contemporary realm and the time in which he lived - are the things making that man famous.</p>

In fact, Starčević was a typical 19th century liberal, English-type, who mixed sympathies for idealized Islamic polity as exemplified in Turkey, dislike of all things Byzantine &amp; Russian czarist and the nascent ideas of social Darwinism (which didn't play much role in his worldview, since his outlook has remained essentially pre-scienfic). His "racism"-to call it that- was a minor thing compared to Marx's and Engels's <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50724" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50724" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>presentation of his "Slavoserb" neologism is incorrect. Its implication is that a contemporary nation, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>, are an "entity" he attached this neologism to. In actuality, main "Slavoserbs" ("Slaves" plus "Serfs" (nor an exact translation- "Servus" is a servant, or someone with subservient mentality) were his political opponents- most notably archbishop Strossmayer, a Croat of half-German extraction. True, Starčević was fierce in his political/polemical attacks (anyway- is there such thing as equanimous polemic&#160;?) &amp; frequently harsh and one-sided. But-to proclaim him to be a "racist" is a complete nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a non-negligible part of the article is a lie. For instance, it claims that the top expert on Starčević, Croatian historian of Jewish origin, Mirjana Gross, has claimed that Starčević was an anti-Semite &amp; racist. This is as far from the truth as possible. Whoever read Gross's monumental monograph on Starčević (ca. 800 pages)- and <b>not</b> distorted misquotations published in ideologized provincial papers, knows that such allegations are pure fiction.</li>

STARČEVIĆ, Ante, političar i književnik; r. 23. V 1823. u Žitniku, u. 28. II 1896. u Zagrebu. Gimnaziju završio u Zagrebu; 1848. promoviran u Pešti za doktora filozofije. God. 1861. izabran je za velikog bilježnika Riječke županije, ali je 1862. suspendiran i kao protivnik režima osuđen na mjesec dana zatvora. Za nar. zastupnika Hrvatskog sabora biran je 1861, 1865, 1871. i od 1878. do kraja života. Pored polit. aktivnosti S. se bavio poviješću, filologijom, knjiž. kritikom, filozofijom, a pisao je i pjesme, drame i polit, satiru (Pisma magjarolacah). Osnivač je i ideolog Stranke prava. S. i njegova stranka od 1861 — protivno od svih ostalih građanskih stranaka u Hrvatskoj, unionističke, samostalne i narodno-liberalne (od kojih je prva bila apsolutno za Peštu, druga za Beč, a treća se kolebala između Beča i Pešte) — zastupaju politiku pune nacionalne slobode i nezavisnosti: ni pod Beč, ni pod Peštu, nego za slobodnu, samostalnu Hrvatsku. Od prvih svojih napisa iz 1861. do zadnjeg svog govora S. je punih 30 godina neumorno dokazivao da je glavna i najpreča stvar osloboditi se austrijskoga sužanjstva i da za hrv. narod nema života ni sretnije budućnosti&#160;»dok bude pod Austriom-Madjarijom«. Dosljedno je zauzimao krajnje neprijateljski stav prema&#160;»umišljotini koja se zove Austrija; u kojoj su se vlade i vladari... urotili protiv narodima«. Najvećim neprijateljem hrv. naroda i glavnim uzročnikom svih njegovih nedaća S. je smatrao habsburšku dinastiju. — Prije F. Supila i S. Radića S. je bio od strane klerikalaca najviše napadani hrv. političar. Godinama su ga oni žigosali i denuncirali kao&#160;»buntovnika, neznabožca, antikersta«, koji&#160;»ruši sve naredbe Boga, ljudi i crkve«. To dolazi otuda što u drugoj pol. XIX st. nitko nije tako oštro i tako argumentirano ustajao protiv negativne uloge klera u nacionalnom i polit, životu Hrvatske, kao što je to desetljećima činio S. Tri su glavna uzroka njegova antiklerikalizma: što je crkva kulturno unazađivala narod; što je služila tuđinskim ugnjetačima Hrvatske; što je različitost vjerske pripadnosti zloupotrebljavala za širenje nacionalnoga razdora u jedinstvenome narodu. Sjeme razdora u narod baciše&#160;»Isusovci i Austrija«&#160;{Djela III, 214).&#160;»A u puku zapadne crkve, gde potiče štogod dobra i poštena, to prečesto dolazi samo otuda, što on ne sluša i ne sledi popa«&#160;{Djela III, 216). — S. je u drugoj pol. XIX st. najuporniji i najdosljedniji pobornik demokr. narodnih prava i polit. sloboda, uvjeren da je narod potpuno sposoban da sam upravlja sobom i državom:&#160;»Moje tverdo osvedočenje stoji: da se sam puk najbolje upravlja«&#160;{Djela I, 188). — Vjerujući u nar. jedinstvo Južnih Slavena, S. je neko vrijeme smatrao da se to jedinstvo treba manifestirati i u jednom jedinstvenom, hrv. imenu, otklanjajući svako drugo ime, a naročito ime Serb kao nenarodno, pa i pogrdno. Ali kada su se pokazali negativni rezultati tog nastojanja da svi naši narodi prihvate hrv. ime, on je napustio svoje stajalište. U Slobodi od 23. marta 1883. S. je izrazio svoje shvaćanje da nije važno ime, nego zajednička borba za stvaranje slobodne i samostalne države:&#160;»Glavna je stvar, da svi rade za narod i za domovinu, a neka se zovu kako im drago... Naše cepanje, naša nesloga stoji samo zato, jer ih izvana uzdržavaju i ojačuju... mi ne verujemo, da je gladnu i na studeni na pr. Srbu drugačije, nego na pr. Hrvatu... Zato, makar se svi proglasili za Hotentote ili nas se svaki zvao posebnim imenom, samo da budemo svi slobodni i srećni!«</p>

<p>Antun Gustav Matoš: Strossmayerov spomenik (esej u knjizi «Vidici i putovi», 1907; prenesno iz A.G.M: Izbor iz djela, knjiga 2., str.31., PSHK, Zora-Matica hrvatska, 1967.)</p>
<p>... Pa ipak taj muž ne bijaše dugo samac. Ostao bi odista bez mjerila u baruštini Hrvatske Raucha i Hedervarvja, da ne dobi dostojnog savremenika u Antunu Starčeviću, blago nama!</p>
<p>Popunjavahu se, ali ne kao Schiller i Goethe, već kao suprotni karakteri i ekstremi koji se dodiruju. Starčević je bedemska planina, zatvorena, puna vuka i ličkog hajduka, Strossmaver je blaga i bogata slavonska ravnica. Stari ima znanje solidnije, Strossmaver opsežnije. Prvi je ekskluzivan, drugi tolerantan. Prvi je učitelj energije i mržnje (egzistencija žuči je opravdana), drugi profesor ljubavi i poezije. Stari je stoik i velik prijatelj Muhamedov. Biskup je fini kršćanski epikurejac, nježan kao sv. Ivan, najdraži Spasiteljev učenik. Strossmaver je svjetski čovjek sa ponašanjem opata i virtuoza Liszta, ljubimac dama; Starčević je plebejac&#160;»hiperdemokratskog nosa«&#160;(Kovačić), divlji ikonoklast s obličjem Silena i djevičanstvom pustinjaka. Ovaj diplomat, onaj doktrinar. Satirik i apologista. Puritanac i katolik. Pazarište i Osijek. Literat, boem — i velikaš hrvatski i grof rimski. Jedan dervišina narodne pjesme, drugi biskup V. Hugoa. Oportunist i radikal. Cinik i retor. Mrzilac plastike i njen obožavalac. Veliki književnik Starčević prezire dangubice književničke; Strossmayer, obožavalac beletristike, nije književnik. Demokrat i aristokrat. Starozavjetni moral u demagoškom civilu i galilejska tolerancija u katoličkoj uniformi. Dva pretendenta kao Rousseau i Voltaire, Tolstoj i Turgenjev. Dva tipa našeg narodnog karaktera i naše cerebralnosti, i odsele se ne može roditi inteligentan Hrvat bez sličnosti s njima. A obojica bijahu u mladosti klerici. Obojica su klasici svojim obrazovanjem i karakterom, zdravljem i umjerenošću, antikvarni legitimiste, lojalni i odviše vjerni, prijatelji francuske politike i kulture, energični do tvrdoglavosti, pomalo sektari, inadžije i nenavidnici, i kao Štroca što ne nađe svog Saint Simona, tako Stari nema hrvatskog Boswella. Jedan i drugi ljubljaše hrvatsku kapljicu. Bijahu ljubomorni, jer im je jedina ljubav bila ova naša nesrećna, nesrećna zemlja..... ...</p>

<p>ANTE STARČEVIĆ</p>
<p>LUCIDNOST Koliko god to paradoksalno zvučalo, ipak je istina: najlucidnija naša glava, koja je našu stvarnost promatrala s najpreciznijom pronicljivošću i koja je o toj stvarnosti dala slike za čitavo jedno stoljeće književno i govornički najplastičnije, jeste glava Staroga Ante Starčevića. Bio je to čovjek, koji je jasno gledao bezizlaznu&#160;»krivuljaču«&#160;hrvatske politike i, braneći&#160;»žlicu našeg mora«&#160;i stopu gladnog našeg primorja od madžarske grofovske bagre, on je kroz nekoliko decenija pljuvao po našim pripuzima, šuftovima i huljama, po nitkovima i varalicama, krivokletnicima i opsjenarima, koji tjeraju našu&#160;»seljačku marvu«&#160;da brsti trnje pod tuđinskim, madžarskim i bečkim zastavama. U sveopćem bezglavlju i bezakonju devetnaestoga stoljeća, između bunjevačke dogmatike, krpa, zakrpa, prikrpa i sveopće kulturne&#160;»kerpljačine«, mučen ubitačnim slutnjama, Starčević je gledao madžarske pre predene "tate slobode", urotu naše gluposti, krštenu našu dijetenklasnu živinu, nakot, blago, marvu i prokletu pasminu našeg prošlog stoljeća u magnatskim sur kama, gdje prodaju narodne interese za bijedne peštanske stipendije, a kao Starčević tu našu stvarnost nije gledao tako jasno nijedan naš umjetnik onoga vremena. 1933</p>
<p>MRZITELJ AUSTRIJE Starčevića je anektirala ultramontana desnica, crno-žuta mafija, najperfidnija i najgluplja od svih u našoj novijoj političkoj historiji, a između tolikih drugih naših spomenika i Starčević očekuje svoje pranje. Starčević je zamrzio Austriju zbog jedne, po vojničkim oblastima nepravedno odsječene graničarske ruke, a ta odsječena graničarska ruka bila je pravoslavna, dakle srpska. Starčević je volio da se&#160;»utopi u slavjanskome moru«&#160;više nego da krepa pod kopitom&#160;»germanskoga kerda«. On se usprotivio uvođenju njemačkoga jezika u naše škole, on se usprotivio da se na Harmici podigne spomenik Jelačiću, koga je smatrao narodnom sramotom, mizerijom i sažaljenja dostojnom kreaturom. On je pozdravio hiljadugodišnjicu kijevske biskupije telegramom, koji je bio zaplijenjen, i u Skerlićevoj ocjeni toga čudaka ne bi trebalo mnogo mijenjati, čovjek, koga je formirala jedna nepravedno odsječena pravoslavna ruka, imao je više moralne fantazije nego sveukupna naša inteligencija sve do ruske revolucije i austrijskog sloma, a naročito pak ona, koja se isključivo time pak ona, koja se isključivo time i bavila da siječe ruke na temelju Starčevićeva programa. 1947</p>
<p>SNAGA JEZIČNOG IZRAZA</p>
<p>Sve je kod Starčevića ostalo verbalna pobuna državnopravnog, jednostranog ma nijakalnog saborskog govornika, ali da je on, promatran iz današnje retrospektive, jedini temperamenat i jedina glava, koja je umjela da se uzdigne do proročke snage jezičnog izraza, to je nesumljivo. U mračnom klupku samostalaca, praktičnika, domorodaca, rodoljuba, ilira, nazovipoštenjaka i narodnjaka, u sveopćem siromaštvu, pokvarenosti, žalosti, pijanstvu i bijedi madžarskog robovanja, pun gnušanja i gađenja nad tim trubilima, što črčkaju gluposti pod naoblačenim madžarskim nebom, zaglušen od govedarskog čavrljanja naših otimača i lopova u plemićkoj surci, on je gledao naše sive smrdljive dronjke stvarnosti jasno, i u tom "čehanju čunja" našega prošlostoljetnog politikantstva, on je prezirao sve povukodlačene fantome naše stvarnosti, i taj svoj prezir izražavao glasno i smiono decenijima. 1933 ....... To be continued, along with the comprehensive rewriting of a very stongly biased text. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 05:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
