<p>A majority of scholars of new religions supported these movements and invented various scientific theories that purportedly proved the danger of "cults".</p>
<dl>
<dd>Never "a majority of NRM scholars" supported anti-cult movement and invented the "brainwashing" and "mind control" theories. The wording is misleading, I suggest to rephrase. - ExitControl.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I don't understand the meaning of the following passage:</p>
<p>Supporters of purported cults state that the term "anti-cult movement" is an attempt to create a grand conspiracy theory, which suggests that there is a vast, organized network of individuals and groups who are dedicated to wiping out these organizations, out of religious intolerance, obscurity or bias.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cultists "state" that they invented the label "anti-cultists" to accuse anti-cultists in conspiracy to wipe them out? Obvious absurdity, anti-cultists may say so, but surely not "cult supporters" (even if we assume "cult supporters" are somehow connected to each other). Removed. - ExitControl</dd>

<p>"In the 1970s the new concept of "moral panic" was developed (see Jenkins 1998) in order to explain how some social problems become overconstructed and generate exaggerate fears. Moral panics are defined as socially constructed social problems characterized by a reaction, both in media representation and in political forums, out of proportion to the actual threat, often based on folk statistics that, although not confirmed by scholarly studies, are repeated from media to media and may inspire political measures." *<a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Vienna.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Vienna.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>One area where reports of Type II are still very much uncertain is mind control ... . They seem to believe that a real problem exist and that something should be done. It seems that the radical extent of criticism of the brainwashing theories by most (English-speaking) mainline scholars has not yet been appreciated even by Type II reports. Behind these labels, however, there is often in Type II reports a legitimate concern for consumer protection. *<a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Vienna.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Vienna.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<li>I think, it is important to note that there is more than just difference of opinions among scholars: "cult-lovers" are commonly accused not in naivety, but is being funded by the cults, connection to paedophiles, participation in Vampire fan groups etc. At the same time, anti-cultists are not only relatives or "victims", there are anti-cult scholars and there are people who receive pay for "deprogramming" (and many of the latter served prison terms for that - kidnapping+bodily harm). IMO that means that there is some (probably government-endorsed as the below reference to MK-Ultra suggests) more or less organized anti-cult hysteria campaign, of which conformist academics play an important role.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The AFF attracted criticism because several of its advisors had "hands-on" experience with brainwashing, by virtue of their association with the CIA's MK-ULTRA project: these were Margaret Singer, Robert J Lifton, Louis Jolyon West, and Maurice Davis."</li>

<p>I added a brief note on Jolyon West; I will see if I can provide more comprehensive references over the weekend when I am less pressed for time.

<p>Since <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a> has its own article, there is no reason for this article to describe it with the oversimplification of "now discredited". Changing the description from "existing theory on brainwashing" to "now discredited theory on brainwashing" also restores the incorrect impression that brainwashing was a theory proposed by the anti-cult movement in the 1960 and early 1970s to explain the behavior of middle-class youths doing things their parents didn't understand, rather than proposed a decade earlier to explain far more dramatic apparent alterations of people's beliefs and behavior. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:49, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't, actually. Your version makes numerous POV and unsourced statements which can most charitably be called oversimplifications, and none of them are really necessary, since the question is rather properly addressed in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a> article itself.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Criticisms and controversies</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Critics of the anti-cult movement often accuse that it has done the following:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>* created a moral panic and witch hunt through exaggeration of the harm and dangers of new religious movements;</i></dd>
<dd><i>* generalized inappropriately, lumping together relatively harmless groups with dangerous groups, such as the Peoples Temple;</i></dd>
<dd><i>* endorsed pseudoscientific theories regarding brainwashing and mind control;</i></dd>
<dd><i>* infringed religious freedom through deprogramming;</i></dd>
<dd><i>* polarized the debate over new religious movements due to its focus on the negative aspects of these groups.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Vocal critics of the anti-cult movement include J. Gordon Melton, the sociologist David G. Bromley, and to a lesser extent the Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The religious movements may see the activities of their opponents as unjustified stigmatization and persecution. See Hate groups and NRMs</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So in your compartmentalized mind, any criticism <i>of</i> the anti-cult movement can be made without citation or attribution, but any <i>response</i> to those criticisms must be reverted endlessly with puerile, transparent demands for citation and attribution. Like hell. You don't give a damn about NPOV, you just find it a convenient way to push your POV, and nothing stands in clearer testament to that fact than this jaw-dropping double standard under which you purport that NPOV means "both sides of the debate <i>can</i> get heard, except that while one side gets to push unattributed claims about what the entire scientific community believes, the other side needs citations and attributions <i>just to respond to the accusations against them.</i>" You can't have it both ways. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:30, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The fact is that you were allowed to put in that "criticism and controversies" section all the many things that cults/NRMs accuse the anti-cult movement of, because it's common fact and we all know it and NPOV is not a codeword for "harass anyone you don't like by pretending they need citations for the obvious".

If you want to play that game, then guess what? It's already referenced. Yes indeed, somewhere in the references section is all the attribution that is needed, and until you've read through each and every thing referenced there, you can't say that it isn't and you have no justification for trying to remove it.

<li>The coercive persuasion theory that plaintiffs advance is not a meaningful scientific concept, and proffered expert testimony in support of that theory was properly excluded.</li>
<li>The theory of coercive persuasion plaintiffs advance is not accepted in the scientific community.</li>
<li>The conclusions of drs. singer and benson are not recognized as scientitic conclusions in the relevant professional communities</li>
<li>The methodology of drs. singer and benson has been repudiated by the scientific community.</li>
<li>Given the inadequacy of the scientific support, plaintiffs' claim of coercive persuasion is, as the courts below concluded, simply a negative value judgment in scientific garb.</li>

<dl>
<dd><i>CESNUR, the Center for Studies on New Religions, was established in 1988 by a group of religious scholars from leading universities in Europe and the Americas. Its managing director, professor Massimo Introvigne, has held teaching positions in the field of sociology and history of religion in a number of Italian universities. He is the author of twenty-three books and the editor of another ten in the field of religious sciences. CESNUR's original aim was to offer a professional association to scholars specialized in religious minorities, new religious movements, contemporary esoteric, spiritual and gnostic schools, and the new religious consciousness in general. <b>In the 1990s it became apparent that inaccurate information was being disseminated to the media and the public powers by activists associated with the international anti-cult movement.</b> Some new religious movements also disseminated unreliable or partisan information. CESNUR became more pro-active and started supplying information on a regular basis, opening public centers and organising conferences and seminars for the general public in a variety of countries. Today CESNUR is a network of independent but related organizations of scholars in various countries, devoted to promote scholarly research in the field of new religious consciousness, to spread reliable and responsible information, and to expose the very real problems associated with some movements, while at the same time defending everywhere the principles of religious liberty. While established in 1988 by scholars who were mostly Roman Catholic, CESNUR has had from its very beginning boards of directors including scholars of a variety of religious persuasions. It is independent from any Church, denomination or religious movement. CESNUR International was recognized as a public non-profit entity in 1996 by the Italian authorities, who are the main current contributors to its projects. It is also financed by royalties on the books it publishes with different publishers, and by contributions of the members. As a public non-profit entity, accounts of its projects are filed with the Region of Piedmont, in Italy.</i></dd>

<p>Larry Shinn has critized the anti-cult movement for its ridiculous, distorted way it depicted the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hare_Krishna_734d.html" title="Hare Krishna">Hare Krishna</a> movement <a href="http://www.skepticfiles.org/rumor/cultbook.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skepticfiles.org/rumor/cultbook.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> but later endorsed a publication by <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/f96/muster.html" class="external text" title="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/f96/muster.html" rel="nofollow">Nori Muster</a>, an apostate ex-member, who complains about criminal gurus and sexual abuse of minors in ISKCON and rejects brainwashing. Is Shinn an anti-cult activist or not? I think Zappaz was right when s/he wrote that it is wrong to make generalizations about people who oppose certain cults. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 05:52, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think I wrote down a bad definition, "In a wider sense, the term encompasses all groups and individuals that actively oppose a certain cult, new religious movement, or sect. " Many "anti-cult activists" do not do more than criticizing (often mostly on the internet). Not actively oppose. But we can not include everyone who has criticized a NRM because then we would have to include all NRM scholars (except may be Melton). I think the definition should be somebody who criticizes several movements and sees that NRMS as part of a wider, general problem with cults, not as individual cases. I think Bromley wrote something like that. Have to check. Such a definition would exclude several people, like Lane and most apostates of cults. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:58, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I changed the definition to what Bromley and Shupe had written "organized opposition to NRMs" and changed the list of anti-cult activists accordingly. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:52, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. Makes sense, although some individuals and not organizations, such as Hassan and Ross do not belong to an organization... Somehow you need to add some text to include them. I am adding some text so that it includes anti-cult activists.</dd>

<dd>Unacceptable or not, it was, don't play the offended virgin, and don't hide behind the readers. Just look at the various edits and discussion in the cults and guru articles. You even invented critics by a non existing organization (the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Convention_of_Human_Rights_9c7c.html" title="European Convention of Human Rights">European Convention of Human Rights</a>, which in fact is a tready) and you made believe that some apparently lofty official conference criticized a French law about cults when in fact it was the cult representatives that made the criticism.

<p>P, you know by now which side I'm on, and it's not pro-cult. But your recent edits <i>are</i> POV, which is why I actually ended up being the first to revert them. Take this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>One of those reproaches is that many cults are organized for the only personal advantage of their money-seeking and power-seeking <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">gurus</a> (in the Western sense of the word), at the expense of their adepts.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Even without the emotional loading of "money-seeking and power-seeking", this commits a version of the existential fallacy by describing the dispute in terms that can only be endorsed by one side of the dispute. I mean, which of these is a neutral statement of the debate here?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Critics of Pgreenfinch say that many of his statements violate NPOV.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>or</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Critics reproach the anti-cult fanatic Pgreenfinch for violating NPOV in order to soothe the dark rage in his twisted heart.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>While that's exaggerated for effect, the principle really is the same; your imaginary critics should not be prejudicing the debate by talking about your 'twisted heart' and your 'dark rage' -- and you shouldn't be prejudicing the debate by talking about their 'money-seeking and power-seeking gurus'. It's easy to phrase it in such a way that both sides can clearly agree that that is what one side <i>claims</i>, at which point it is NPOV:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>One of the claims made by critics is that many cults are only organized in order to deliver money and power to their leaders, at the expense of their adepts.</i></dd>

<p>Andries, please explain why did you removed the text about apostates. As explained in the opening sentence, the "anti-cult" movement is composed of organizations as well as individuals.

<dd>The current text accurately states that some critical former members of cults form or are associated with the ACM. The former text that I moved suggested that all or most apostates of cults are involved in the ACM which is not true.

<dd>I disagree with the idea that everything referenced deserves to go in and everything unreferenced deserves to go out. For instance, Massimo Introvigne does not speak for the anti-cult movement; his eight-point "apology" in which he presumes to speak for them and explain their supposed criteria merits, <i>at best</i>, a condensed summary. Gems such as asserting that the anti-cult movement states "scholars can't be trusted" are not less <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw men</a> just because it's not an editor <i>here</i> doing the misrepresentation. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:39, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Andries I checked 3 encyclopedias in the library and could not find any information on the "anti-cult" movement. The only place I found a mention is online at the Encarta encyclopedia. The definition in Encarta is supportive of the current definition in the article.</p>
<p>This is what Encarta says: <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580494/Cult.html#p18" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580494/Cult.html#p18" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580494/Cult.html#p18</a> ... a pretty good NPOV summary.</p>
<p>Regarding the anti-cult movement allegations against cults, I found a good reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomas Robbin and Dick Anthony, <i>Cults in the late Twentieth Century</i> in Lippy, Cgarles H. and Williams, Peter W. (edfs.) <i>Encyclopedia of the American Religious experience. Studies of Traditions and Movements</i>. Charles Scribner's sons, New York (1988) Vol II pp. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-684-18861-9</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Critics of cults, recognizing the diversity of groups lumped under this label have identified of "cult", or "destructive cults", as the object of their concern. The criteria offered generally involve communal totalism, authoritanism, charismatic leadership, manipulative and heavy-handed indoctrination, deceptive proselytization, violence and child abuse, sexual exploitation, emotional intensity in group life, and alleged use of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>. Other controversies postulated by these critics, include tax privileges, public solicitacion, faith healing and rejection of modern medicine, mental health jeopardy to participants, and corporal punishment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would suggest replacing the section you added with this (from the above book). --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 14:34, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not see the use of scholar when the evidence can be directly linked to with attributed accusations against specific groups instead. That is closer to NPOV than general unattributed statements without mentioning the specific group.

<dd>Seems Zappaz doesn't understand, or want to understand, that the allegations are obviously from "anti-cultist". It is even superfluous to give all those sources as seeing their content they are obviously from that side, if not who from&#160;!!! Just a harassment method by Zappaz to block the article with his overattribution craze. Wikipedia doesnt want to go to such extremes as giving attribution to all sentences as long that it is common sense that they are not inventions from the writer. Imagine the mess if any article was peppered with references all along! Interpreting so narrowly a rule is changing is nature. In French, this is called an "abus de droit". I think we are going for a big conflict of principles here. --<a href="../../../p/g/r/User%7EPgreenfinch_6111.html" title="User:Pgreenfinch">Pgreenfinch</a> 16:45, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pgreenfich &amp; Zappaz, I think that ex-member <i>Joe Blow</i> can be more accurate, fairer, and certainly more up to date than those sociologist and the French govt. Most of the negative information of these sociologists and governemnts come from <i>Joe Blow</i> ex-members. Though I have to admit that Joe Blow's testimonial may be colored by his sense of betrayal, esp. when he has just left the movement. I would appreciate help in finding more references and attributions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:10, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>New expanded intro para</li>
<li>Created appropriate subsections on "Allegations against cults"</li>
<li>Removed NPOV tag for that section</li>

<p>Can somebody please explain me why those scholars can make all kinds of charicatural generalizations about former followers who speak out about abuses that they observed, documented or experienced? In contrast, all the accusations by former followers are attributed, specific and documented. I think the current version shows a lack of balance and fairness in that respect. Another reason why I think this is unfair is that the current version of the <i>cult</i> article tends to avoid generalizations about cults. It is insulting and unfair to subject the testimonies of former members to excessive skepticism. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:20, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where do you see that unfairness? After reading the article, with the huge list of allegations made by ex-members (I think that the only allegation missing is drinking the blood of little children in the sabbath), what do you expect? I would say that it <b>begs</b> skepticism. If you are in favor of the anit-cult movement, I would argue that by putting that list in the article you are not doing your movement any favors. As per Pgreenfinch words in the edit summary, that my edits are "vandalism", I would argue to quite the contrary. He has been deleting whole sentences, for no apparent reasons. The fact that I edit anonymously does not give you the right to trash my edits or treat me with disrespect. --38.119.107.72 23:14, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I do not think that the list begs skepticism. I challenge you to find one false allegation in the list. It is just a natural consequence of the great power that gurus have over their disciples. One person I know quite well almost committed suicide due to a this SSB guru whom I followed for 9 years. Scholars can and are sometimes wrong e.g. George Chryssides wrote that SSB practiced what he preached! Read the well documented scholarly article "A Guru Accused" by Alexandra Nagel on <a href="http://www.exbaba.com" class="external free" title="http://www.exbaba.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbaba.com</a> And I also know other stories about a still well-respected guru that I am not allowed to tell. One of the reasons that the list is so long is because there are so many different gurus, NRMs and cults. Only a fraction is mentioned.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 23:27, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your remark is inconsistent with your refusal to give a definition of the term, the first thing to do in a summary. And historical considerations are not what makes a good summary. I suggest to include instead, following a short definition, the two types of oppositions. After seeing your asymmetric requirements in various articles, it seems to me, but I'm not Sigmund, that you are so routinely used at playing games to others that you don't realize when you trap yourself in them.

<dd><i>Critics affirm, without clear evidences, that the anti-cult movement exacerbated the fanatical reaction of destructive cults by encouraging a cult phobia among the public and authorities, that helped to precipitate mass tragedies like Jonestown, Waco, and the Heaven's Gate.

<p><i>Opponents of the view that cults are rarely harmless and that apostates testimonies cannot be relied upon are the scholars David C. Lane, Benjamin Zablocki, and Stephen A. Kent.</i></p>
<p>This line is almost nonsense. If I understand it correctly, it means that Stephen Kent thinks that cults are usually harmless and that apostates cannot be trusted. This is obviously not true, as anyone who have studied his work can testify to. --62.107.36.217 12:31, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmmm... you have a good point on one part but I think you're misreading the other. To rearrange the pieces of that sentence:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"the scholars David C. Lane, Benjamin Zablocki, and Stephen A. Kent" ...</li>
<li>are "Opponents of the view that" ...</li>
<li>"cults are rarely harmless" and that ...</li>
<li>"apostates [sic] testimonies cannot be relied upon".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Treating the third and fourth segments separately, the fourth looks correct: Lane, Zablocki and Kent (as far as I'm familiar with their views) oppose the notion that apostates should be looked on as any less reliable than current members. The third, however, does not fit. Perhaps it was meant to be "rarely harmful", or it was originally describing Lane et al. as <i>supporters</i> of the idea, and the idea was not changed when "supporters" was changed to "opponents". I don't know which one more accurately captures the actual views of Lane et. al.</dd>

<p>Hi Fossa. In kicking out the Scientology section on <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements.html" title="Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Opposition to cults and new religious movements</a>, despite my elaboration in the section, you give this edit summary: "rv a) undue weight b) this is not about the opposition to cults in general, but Scientology in particular, c) even if it was, the connection would need to be demonstrated more clearly". Some questions...</p>
<p>(a) Practically the whole article is POV in favor of NRM theory, so I don't understand your basis for complaining that a Scientology paragraph gives "undue weight" to anything.</p>
<p>(b) Where does it say that the article has to be about opposition to cults in <i>general</i>?</p>
<p>(c) I think the connection is pretty danged clear. The section is about an attempt by one of the most powerful and dangerous<a href="http://www.xenu.net/fairgame-e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xenu.net/fairgame-e.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> groups that I can think of to quash a small number of those who (extremely bravely) try to express their "opposition" to a "cult". It is <i>totally</i> "connected". <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 01:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(a) I dunno what you're talking about.</dd>
<dd>(b) Quite simple: This is an article about the opposition to all sorts of "cults", Scientology is just one of hundreds, if not thousands of groups, and it is not even a very typical case: Why should it be given space?</dd>
<dd>(c) Please don't link to xenu.net's fairytails, when you want to explain something. Do you have an academic source that explicates the particular importance of Scientology for opposition against "cults", as opposed to, say, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a>? <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 12:34, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The distinction betweem ACM and CCM is a <b>minority opinion</b> in academia. Even those who propose the distinction acknowledge that fact. Wikipedia is not the place to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">minority opinions</a>, but instead should follow the majority opinion. Wikipedia should use the lemma that is the most common label for this opinion: "Anti-cult movement". <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 12:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
