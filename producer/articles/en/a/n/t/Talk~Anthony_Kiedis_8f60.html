<p>"While one cannot simply "learn" to sing, Kiedis has learned to control his vocals more and more with each album." Whoever said this is obviously not a vocalist. As someone who has had no natural singing ability and now fronts a band, I can say that this is very debatable. A person can learn to recognize the different pitches, breathing and other techniques which all means that anyone can, in essence, learn how to sing no matter what their natural voice is like. Learning to control your vocals is in fact the same as learning to sing and in effect, this is a contradiction. Agree/Disagree? Just type "learn to sing" in google. The first result gave me the following site: <a href="http://www.vocalrelease.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.vocalrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vocalrelease.com/</a> which states: "Great singers aren't specially gifted from birth. They have not been born physically different than anyone else. If you learn the right techniques you could be well on your way to singing just as well, if not better, than your favorite singers today."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the claims by the website, however, I agree that Kiedis has developed into a better singer through his career. I would also like to add that, in my opinion, the "system" that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have going definately suits his voice and talents. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeda777_8f6f.html" title="User:Cheeda777">Sunshine</a> 17:28, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole section needs a re-write; it's all based on opinion, not verifiable fact, and doesn't cite any sources. And anyway, it's not accurate in that it implies Kiedis never sang in a melodic fashion before "Knock Me Down"; "Behind the Sun" and "If You Want Me to Stay" are both sung melodically rather than rapped and both songs pre-date "Knock Me Down"by at least two years. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarengo71_c3b2.html" title="User:Varengo71">Cris Varengo</a> 01:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Around this time he revealed that he considered himself to be bisexual and that he was having a non-romantic sexual relationship with band mate Anthony Kiedis; the two were often to be seen kissing or fondling one another in public and in fact had a high-sexual kiss in the video "Warped"."</p>

<p>I disagree. Anthony has said many times that he only kissed in the video to shock people, and there was no relationship of any kind involved. Besides, he's cute!!!!</p>

<i>He lost his virginity at age 12 with an 18-year-old redhead named Kimberly Smith, who at the time was the girlfriend of his father.</i> Classy.</p>
<p>A selection of lyrics quotes does not belong here, it belongs on wikiquote - and further there is no indication that these lyrics were even penned by Kiedis himself, just that he sung them. I am removing them. Also it is standard to refer to the subject by last name, not first.</p>
<p>Surely he wrote all the lyrics. Thats what he does (he's a great singer). He wrote a song about Sinead O'Conner. Hope he keeps off the smack. kkll;;;;;;;;;; anymore? and if that is true, remember at the end of scar tissue he said his dog was a big part of him staying clean....</p>

<dl>
<dd>Since one does it naturally follow that a singer writes all his own lyrics?? I'm sure Kiedis probably writes the MAJORITY of the lyrics, but "that's what he does (he's a great singer)" is not really the ultimate word of authority on whether he writes ALL of them. A lot of people think Roger Daltry of the Who is a great singer and he wrote almost no lyrics for the Who.<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarengo71_c3b2.html" title="User:Varengo71">Cris Varengo</a> 01:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i agree-this one is real outdated.-S</p>
<hr />
<p>Anthony could not have spent much of his youth listening to Grandmaster Flash since GMF's first single ("Superappin'") did not come out until the very end of 1979, when Kiedis was 17. Kiedis likely did not listen to much Flash until 1981 or 1982 (when "The Message" was released). At that time, he was 18 or 19 years old. He likely did not see GMF in concert until 1983, when he was 20.</p>
<p>Kiedis did note in a 2002 interview that an early 1980's Flash concert inspired him.</p>

<p>Why was the part stating "He is currently dating 19 year old model Heather "Nika" Christie." removed? Is this fact no longer true?</p>
<p>^ I could be wrong, but I don't think so....the statement "=he broke up with her because she didnt want to have his kids." applies to his previous girlfriend Yohanna Logan, not Heather Christie. If I am wrong, and it applies to Heather as well, please state your source.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Didn't he break up with Yohanna ("Claire Essex" in Scar Tissue) because it just didn't work out, and they kept fighting etc after they tried doing drugs togethe</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, he's still dating Heather. They've kinda been an on-off couple but they've been going strong for at least a couple years now.</p>
<p>^"going strong for at least a couple years now"? No, untrue. Kiedis dumped her ass back in Dec. 05 and was without her until he took her back around March 06. He dumped her to F@#! supermodel Jessica Stam, who I think is a million times hotter than Heather. They also broke up in Fall '06 briefly. I would hardly call this going strong!</p>

<p>The article states that he is also known as 'Antwan the Swan', but I think this is not correctly spelled. The lyrics of "Out in L.A" from their self-titled cd state (Quote from the cover/lyrics booklet) "Antoine the swan was a bad motherjumper you could tell he was strong".

<p>Anthony's hair has always been striking and has changed radically over the years. Perhaps something about that could be worth mentioning?</p>
<p>it was long for like 20 years, then short and blond, then longish again... whats radical about that? Hardly worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeakeyjee_eac0.html" title="User:Leakeyjee">LeakeyJee</a> 10:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Don't forget about the mohawk, whenever that was.</p>
<p>at one of the big day outs i think, the whole band apart from Chad had mohawks, and he had a reverse mohawk. --<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeakeyjee_eac0.html" title="User:Leakeyjee">LeakeyJee</a> 10:54, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>His hair has gone long again after a good while now (Although obviously not as long as it used to be) but how come it looks so different now compared to about ten years ago (in both style and colour tone)? What has Anthony done (or not done) for it to look different this time round?</p>
<ul>
<li>hes probabaly dyed it loads to cover the greys (in one pic i can see grey stubble anyway but i mean he's how old&#160;!) he also probanly didnt use as much product in the 90's whereas today (more than ever) its perfectly normal for aguy to do "girlie" stuff to his hair</li>

<p>Isn't it such a shame that Anthony is back on heroin? It's a real pity.</p>
<p>well apart from the fact that he's not... --<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeakeyjee_eac0.html" title="User:Leakeyjee">LeakeyJee</a> 02:14, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The last time he did Heroin was in the early 90's. <a href="../../../n/s/r/User%7ENSR77_65d9.html" title="User:NSR77">NSR77</a> 23:55, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>the last time he did any drugs was in early 2000, then he got clean in december of that year.</p>
<p>so has he defo not been on it since dec 2000???</p>
<p>He has been clean since December 24th 2000. My friend though, thinks he is doing drugs again because the lyrics in slow cheetah. But the first person who posted a comment, where did you get this info?</p>
<p><br />
Well, I also read somewhere that he and John have tried drugs again during the SA tour but that might be trash (like some people always do). It was also said that they did it just for one night, they felt like taking drugs. And remember, Anthony said in Scar Tissue that he felt the rush and feeling of the drugs more and better when he had been clean for a while. And Buster had died who helped him staying clean. All reasons for a relapse. I hope he's not doing drugs again. GTM: 19:59, 4 January 2007</p>
<p>But then, he promptly got more dogs. He is probably trying to do his best to stay clean, and that why I respect the hell out of him. There we go. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDracwolley_f57b.html" title="User:Dracwolley">Dracwolley</a> 18:14, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Kiedis is 5 ft 8.5 in. [celebheights.com]</li>
<li>He has ten tattoos.</li>
<li>He met the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> during a trip in India at the end of 1996.</li>
<li>While actually only part Native American, Kiedis has exhibited strong interest in that heritage, showcasing it in the tribal tattoo on his upper back, and he has used it as lyrical inspiration in songs such as "<a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Men_Don%27t_Kill_Coyotes_4580.html" title="True Men Don't Kill Coyotes">True Men Don't Kill Coyotes</a>", "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Ghost_Dance_541e.html" title="American Ghost Dance">American Ghost Dance</a>", "<a href="../../../a/p/a/Apache_Rose_Peacock_cf56.html" title="Apache Rose Peacock">Apache Rose Peacock</a>", "<a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Like_a_Brave_e5c6.html" title="Fight Like a Brave">Fight Like a Brave</a>" and "Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky".</li>
<li>The song "<a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Like_A_Brave_a157.html" title="Fight Like A Brave">Fight Like A Brave</a>" was written on an airplane. Anthony had gone back to his hometown of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Rapids_c456.html" title="Grand Rapids">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> to recover from his drug addiction after being fired from the band. He managed to kick the habit and wrote the song on the return flight. On his arrival he was asked to re-join the band and despite the fact that he started using again within weeks, the song was recorded.</li>
<li>Since the death of his dog Buster, Kiedis has acquired a pair of <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesian_Ridgeback_c96e.html" title="Rhodesian Ridgeback">Rhodesian Ridgebacks</a>, named Katie and Sammi.

<li>He appeared in the video for <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_1edc.html" title="Johnny Cash">Johnny Cash</a>'s "God's Gonna Cut You Down".</li>
<li>Kiedis apparently has a bad relationship with <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Patton_5f5c.html" title="Mike Patton">Mike Patton</a> as well as his now defunct band <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Bungle_fffc.html" title="Mr. Bungle">Mr. Bungle</a>.

<li>Kiedis strongly dislikes "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Greeting_Song_4ffb.html" title="The Greeting Song">The Greeting Song</a>" and its lyrics.</li>
<li>Kiedis once was diagnosed with <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hep_C_a79a.html" title="Hep C">Hep C</a>, which he mentions in his memoir <i><a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar_Tissue_%28book%29_6f6e.html" title="Scar Tissue (book)">Scar Tissue</a></i>

<p>I just noticed that there is only one cited source in this article. I'm thinking about going in and citing things, especially things with a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> ( or {{fact}}) tags, with <i><a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar_Tissue_%28book%29_6f6e.html" title="Scar Tissue (book)">Scar Tissue</a></i>, in appropriate citation format. Does anyone object to this? I have read it, so it's not like I'm just doing it randomly. I know what is and isn't in the book. However, recently a friend of mine and I were talking about it, and he said something along the lines of, "yea, his life is pretty weird...You know its all bullshit that he made up, right?" If the book is "bullshit", it, obviously, isn't a reliable source. Does anyone agree that it is unreliable? Thank you, and it looks like this article is slowly changing from a bunch of goat shit into a good article. Keep up the good work. -<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeda777_8f6f.html" title="User:Cheeda777">Sunshine</a> 02:21, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uhh... He made the book, it's his memoirs. Why the hell would the book be all bullshit?</p>
<p>However, don't go making every citation needed to his book. I mean, something that happened recently wouldn't be in there, for example, as the book came out in 2004.</p>

<p>In the article <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahican.html" title="Mahican">Mahican</a>, it states that Kiedis is a member of that tribe, and this article puts him in a "native american musicians" category, but there is no source given for any of this, and it's not mentioned in the text of the article. Would anyone care to explain? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 05:43, 15 March 2007 (UTC) people are idiots, that is the only explanation for this oversight. He is not a member of any native american tribes. His ancestral roots include some stems of mohican lineage, I believe he states in "scar tissue" the book.</p>
