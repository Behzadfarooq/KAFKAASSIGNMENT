<h2><span class="mw-headline">Religion automatically means Christian???</span></h2>
<p>In Taxonomy, it says: ..." Religious and secular</p>
<p>Two main types of opposition to cults are differentiated:</p>
<pre>
   * Religious opposition is related to theological issues. Such individuals and groups are collectively called the Christian countercult movement
</pre>
<p>"...</p>
<p>That is far from NPOV if, as it seems to be, it implies or assumes that the term "Religious" somehow implicitly means or implies "Christian". Surely it should say "Christian opposition is related to theological issues" rather than "Religious opposition is related to theological issues" since it goes on to label the adherents of the position as Christian ???</p>

<p>What are the ante? Show me the money before I take a side :-)). I imagine that some cult coffers are overflowing with dough. Could be interesting to start an aricle cults and money. In fact, I will not take side in your challenge, as I'm sure everybody can find sources going one way and others going the opposite one. What I would say is that your attribution game gets more and more tedious. And, as long as you quote the massimo and hadden grotesque duet, it's a bit hard to take your challenges about "research" seriously.

<dd>Zappaz, yes, I know it from personal experience but apart from that the term <i>cult watchers</i> is also used by Barrett and Barker. Besides, how can you seriously doubt it? There are so many ex-websites with several persons involved i.e. for 1st &amp; 2nd generation ex-<a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">Family</a>, ex-<a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Churches_of_Christ_4f57.html" title="International Churches of Christ">International Churches of Christ</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-premie.html" title="Ex-premie">ex-premies</a>, ex-<a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>, ex-<a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a>, etc. etc. To think that this is not a grassroot affair but instigated by the ACM is, I agree with Pgreenfich about that, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>. For example, AndrÃ© van der Braak ex-<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Cohen_79a3.html" title="Andrew Cohen">Andrew Cohen</a> has nothing in common with the history, beliefs and methods of the ACM but still he wants to warn people against Andrew Cohen with his memoirs.

<dd>Btw, Zappaz, as I said, I will not take side. But seems to me that you forgot to delete Hadden's fancy original research. That the poor guy cannot protest anymore is no reason to ridicule him.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Scientific status of mind control theories</span></h2>
<p>The following sentence is misleading:</p>
<dl>
<dd>the brief did not characterize the theory of brainwashing as disproven or as unscientific (as some comentators assert) -- only as not scientifically proven</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are three options for describing a scientific theory:</p>
<ol>
<li>proven to be true</li>
<li>indeterminate</li>
<li>proven to be false</li>
</ol>
<p>Theories which are 91) "proven to be true" become part of science, i.e., scientists pretty much stop questioning it, and courts consider it to be reliable.</p>
<p>Theories which are either (2) indeterminate or (3) "proven to be false" are not considered part of science.</p>
<p>What happened with Singer is that she claimed mind control was part of science (i.e., #1, proven to be true). The APA has said that it is "not part of science", which leaves two possibilities: (2) that it's indeterminate or (3) that it has been proven false.</p>
<p>Anti-cult groups are <b>correct</b> in saying that the APA didn't label mind control false (i.e., #3). But if they are using the <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excluded_middle.html" title="Excluded middle">excluded middle</a> fallacy to imply that "not proven false" means it "must be true" then that's the misleading part.</p>
<p>The article text I quoted above makes two tangled-up assertions, which I untangle here:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the brief did not characterize the theory of brainwashing as "disproven" but as "not scientifically proven"</li>
<li>that the brief did not characterize the theory of brainwashing as unscientific</li>
</ul>
<p>The first assertion is correct. The secord assertion is false (or at best, misleading).</p>
<p>It hinges on the meaning of the word "unscientific". It seems to <b>deny</b> that APA had contradicted Singer's claim that her mind control was (a) scientific and therefore (b) admissible as <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expert_testimony.html" title="Expert testimony">expert testimony</a> in court. However, Singer herself obviously did not take it that way. In fact, she sued the APA (at least once), because their statement had the effect of getting courts to believe that her theory was <b>not</b> scientific or proven or part of science, and she <b>lost money</b> because she couldn't get anyone to pay her to give expert testimony any more.</p>
<p>This needs to be clarified. I have presented this analysis, but I don't know how to word it in the text. Can anyone help me here? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 14:36, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not agree. I just quoted a few preceding sentences of what Barker had written, in addition to the very selective part of the sentence that you had quoted. See her article. I did not leave out quotes or something. The quote contains the words "perceive themselve" so she is not implicitly explaining their beliefs. I found it very POV of you that you quoted very selectively a part of a sentence. The complete sentences that I added make it far more NPOV. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 08:16, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Given the question they are addressing, it is not surprising that CAGs paint a picture of the movements that highlights what they see as the "bad" characteristics, while ignoring anything that could be seen as praiseworthy or even ordinary. The analogy has been made with asking a divorce lawyer what marriage is like. Members of cult-awareness groups associate with those who have suffered (especially parents and former members) and encourage them to define their experiences in terms that stress the role of the NRM and minimize the responsibility of the "victim." Particularly impressive witnesses for CAGs are the apostates who testify to the horrors they underwent while in an NRM; they (like the divorcee) were there - unlike academic researchers who, the argument goes, see only what the movementâs hierarchy wants them to see.<a href="http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-cult_movement.html" title="Anti-cult movement">anti-cult movement</a> (ACM) opposes NRMs they believe to be cults, generally citing concern that the religions will cause harm to society and followers.

The existence of mind control is widely disputed, and sometimes dismissed as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo_science.html" title="Pseudo science">pseudo-scientific</a> by the psychiatric establishment and social scientists. A 1983 <i><a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_curi%C3%A6.html" title="Amicus curiÃ¦">amicus curiÃ¦</a></i> brief by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> states that the brainwashing hypotheses are "little more than uninformed speculation, based on skewed data" and that "[t]he coercive persuasion theory ... is not a meaningful scientific concept".</dd>

They accuse them of being naive, bad scholars and above all reproach them of not warning people who should be warned, as well as of being funded by the cults themselves. Hein is quoted by Douglas Cowan as writing:</dd>
<dd><i>A cult apologist is someone who consistently or primarily defends the teachings and/or actions of one or more movements considered to be cultsâas defined sociologically or theologically . . .

<dl>
<dd>"Ross became concerned about controversial religious groups in 1982, when a controversial religious group that targets Jews for conversion infiltrated the Jewish nursing home in Arizona where his grandmother was a resident. Working with the director of the facility and the local Jewish community, Ross managed to stop their involvement. This led to work with the Jewish Federation of Greater Phoenix, and an appointment to two national committees by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), one which focused on cults and and another concerned with interreligious affairs. During the 1980s Ross also represented the Jewish community on the Religious Advisory Committee to the Arizona Department of Corrections and was later elected its chairman. He also served as the chairman of the International Coalition of Jewish Prisoners Programs sponsored by B'nai Brith in Washington D.C. Ross' work within the prison system included inmate religious rights and educational efforts regarding hate groups. Ross was also a member of the professional staff of Jewish Family and Children's Service (JFCS) and the Bureau of Jewish Education (BJE) in Phoenix, Arizona."</dd>

<dd>I don't, the origin of his anti-cult interest activities was within the Jewish context and he worked for years for some Jewish organizations before he became private consultant. Also his "What in God's Name is going on in Arizona" shows a decidedly religious viewpoint (not Christian, though, so he sure would not be at home in the counter-cult movement). I've not the least idea about his present religious convictions, but as to origins of his opposition to cults, he belongs into the "Established religion" section.</dd>

<dd>Well Barker has five categories from very anti-cult to very pro-cult - this covers the whole spectrum of attitudes and they are described without using words which imply negative values - such a classification can used as-is in Wikipedia. It could even be used without attributing to anyone and still would be NPOV (though not polite towards Eileen Barker).</dd>
<dd>Hadden, on the other hand, uses words like "is professed to be the manifest goal" "apostates" "the anti-cult movement has actively encouraged former members of religious groups to interpret their experience in a "cult" as one of being egregiously wronged" "Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain." "A few entrepreneurs have made careers by creating organized opposition" - and such expressions do imply negative views - in other ways "this is not their real goal" "cult members tell only of negative experiences because they are encouraged to see their experiences negative by ACM" "people work only in the field to get lots of money". No matter, if correct or not, such statements are controversial and can only be used in NPOV texts with exact attribution. So it is definitely not NPOV to add Rick Ross there (especially not as only example) - Hadden himself has not given any examples.</dd>
<dd>I have now formatted Hadden as a quote, so it is NPOV. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 13:42, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Asserting that <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Henson_dfaf.html" title="Keith Henson">Keith Henson</a> is a freedom of speech activist, is quite a stretch.

<dd>Well, the free speech activism (also independently of Scientology ) of these people is documented: Touretzki has been active for first amendment in other cases as well (see the bomb stuff in his article), Spaink publishes on her site abortion documents which don't agree with her views (Nuremberg papers) because they are suppressed elsewhere ""Why I believe that suing anybody over their opinion is wrong. Freedom of speech cannot protect only some opinions while banning others." Ron Newman is a netizen free speech activist ""When the CoS began canceling Usenet messages and tried to get [alt.religion.scientology] removed, I was outraged because of the obvious threat to free speech on the Internet," and Andreas Heldals first statement regarding his website 1996 was "I hereby protest against The Church of Scientology, they do not deserve nor have earned to protect their destructive sides behind the law of copyright. That's not what the law was made for in my humble opinion. In this case freedom of thought and speech is what's at stake. Being allowed to see the real face of the church is the only possible method to protect ourselves against it. " For Henson I found no pre-Scientology evidence, only later statements that this was his motivation - well, leave him out. There are others as well, by the way, e.g. in Germany and Italy. The point is, that Scientology did try to shut down a usenet group and used DMCA against critics (which is not the purpose of DMCA precisely) - and that got free speech activists active also against Scientology. That's the common history of those people - they did not come into the fight because they were specially interested in heresies, brainwashing and other such issues or because they had personal experiences with Scientology. So I'll put it back. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 20:08, 31 July 2005 (UTC)\</dd>

<dd>You need to then make a clear distintiction between anti-scientologists claiming to be freedom of speech activists and these that have no relation to scientology. As it reads now, it is an attempt to dress an anti-scientology POV, with the "nicer" dress of freedom of speech activism. Heldal-Lund, Spaink and Newman are all noted anti-scientologist, not noted free-speech advocates.--<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User%7E38.119.107.70.html" title="User:38.119.107.70">38.119.107.70</a> 21:17, 31 July 2005 (U</dd>

That has nothing at all to do with Scientology, but much with free speech. Also she is be far not fulltime anti-scientologist.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Taxonomy and the existential fallacy</span></h2>
<p>If I was a professor with an ax to grind, I could write something like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cult apologists usually have some sort of awful hidden secret that causes them to exist in a constant state of denial, and then they find it easy to extend this loud willing ignorance to others in exchange for rewards. Some cult apologists are repressed homosexuals, and their need to deny their own sexual shame causes them to be quite eager to cover up the sexual exploitation committed by cult leaders. Other cult apologists are slaves to the bottle or street drugs, and their reward for turning a blind eye to what they see is money to support their expensive habits...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, if I did that, I would be quite <i>rightfully</i> challenged and criticized. Where is my proof? they would say. Where is my research backing up my words? Who am I referring to when I talk about cult apologists who are repressed homosexuals, who have drug or drinking problems, and can I substantiate <i>any</i> of those allegations?</p>
<p>Of course, what I could do instead would be to create a "taxonomy". This would just be a simple classification system:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple taxonomy of cult apologists:
<ul>
<li>Repressed homosexuals
<ul>
<li>Very good at overlooking sexual indiscretions</li>
<li>Often get the pick of cult followers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Druggies and drunkards
<ul>
<li>Favor cults with connections overseas who can score good hashish</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone challenged me or criticized me, I would simply treat them as if they were mad. This is a <i>taxonomy</i>, I would explain condescendingly. I'm simply differentiating between different kinds of cult apologists. The fact that I've created categories whose identifying factor happens to be a very serious accusation, and that the existence of the category invites the reader to commit the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_fallacy.html" title="Existential fallacy">existential fallacy</a> and infer that the category must at some point been verified to contain at least some members -- why should this matter to me?</p>

<p>As some phenomena seems to happen again, including some cultist forgetting all sense of ridicule reverting its own text twice, wondering under what outside influence or orders, it makes me think of the following theoretical case:</p>
<p>Let us suppose some cult propagandists want to beat the system. Of course they would not dare, that would be very cheap;-)) But if we follow that hypothesis, they might do it this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) remove a perfectly true and legitimate text that gives account of the notorious worries in the general population and in media about the extreme danger of some cults, something supported by 236 000 google occurences. Just common knowledge to sum it up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) each time it is reinstated, cancel it again, and use some redtape about sourcing, npov, original work, english wording, not enough salt or too much pepper, or whatever.</li>

<dd>No, that's an expression mainly used by opponents of "cults" and usually not meant as a compliment. In case of religious "cults", "adherents of NRMs" would be better encyclopedical style. In the case of non-religious "cults" (that exists also), it is difficult to avoid the expression altogether, but one could say "adherents of cultic groups" - "cultic groups" is more neutral than "cults", it is used mainly in descriptive context and not as disparaging label, and it refers to sociological and psychological group structures, not to religious beliefs. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 10:49, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not at all - we should link to their articles where we have time and place to describe their views from their works and activities. And we should trust into some intelligence on part of our readers: That Hadden is no fan of cult opposition is shown by his categorizing and people who disagree with him regarding cult attitude probably are not wholly on the same side as he is.</dd>
<dd>The NPOV point there is, that Hadden's categorizing is not NPOV (in contrast to Barker's), and therefore we cannot let it stand in the article as uncontested fact - so we mention some who disagree with his attitude on cults to keep the balance. Another option would be to skip Hadden completely here - actually I think Barker's categories are so markedly superior, that we could leave all others out. But that's not only for me to decide. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 15:13, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to explore this further. I think that you have a slight misconception of NPOV. NPOV is a priciple that applies to Wikipedia articles and not to scholars. Each scholar has a POV and that includes Barker, Zablocki and Hadden. The NPOV principle states that we ought to represent the different POVs of a controversy fairly. It does not state that we need to find NPOV statements by <i>A</i> or <i>B</i>, just to describe the POVs involved, attribute statements, and reference our edits. There is no such a thing as a POV that is NPOV!--<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">ZappaZ</a> <a href="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Yin_yang.svg/12px-Yin_yang.svg.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" longdesc="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" /></a> 17:20, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Of course, every scholar has his POV - also Barker. But there are texts of scholars where such a POV is clearly expressed and there are texts of scholars where no POV is visible (texts which are perfectly acceptable to people with a completely different POV). In Wikipedia we have the responsibility to represent the different POVs fairly, as you say. This does not only mean attribution of every POV text, in an encyclopedia article also factors like balancing volume of POVs, placement in key positions, etc. play a role.
<ul>
<li>If we put a clearly POV quote in a section where opposing views are detailed <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements.html#Polarized_views_by_scholars" title="Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Polarized views by scholars</a>, there is no qualification needed and the balance is managed by adding quotes of other POVs.</li>
<li>If we put a clearly POV quote in a key section <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements.html#Taxonomies" title="Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Taxonomies</a> where there is no balancing quote, then the POV quote has to be represented fairly in some other way - e.g. by adding that this is no overall accepted definition (which is best done by referring to people which don't agree),</li>

<dd>I understand, and what you say makes sense. But we in this case (Hadden and balance by Zablocki and Hallahmi) need to be qualifed by the fact that these two scholars espose an anti-cult POV. Can we say something such as ... "Hadden's attitude towards NMRs and towards what he calls "the anti-cult movement" has been sharply criticized by psychology Professor Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi and sociology Professor Benjamin Zablocki, <b>both of which have written extensivley against cults</b>", or something along these lines? ---<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">ZappaZ</a> <a href="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Yin_yang.svg/12px-Yin_yang.svg.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" longdesc="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" /></a> 01:03, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's necessary to squeeze them into a drawer - for one thing, it is pretty obvious that they are not specially pro-cult just by the fact of the critique (and their references can be read which makes it even more clear) and for the other, it gets again an imbalance, because Hadden's quote is not qualified.</dd>
<dd>Right now we have it balanced:
<ul>
<li>Hadden: negative statements on anti-cult movement</li>
<li>Zablocki and Beit-Hallahmi: negative statement on Hadden and pro-cult</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If we'd add a qualifier on one side, we'd have to add another one on the other side, so (but this looks rather clumsy to me):
<ul>
<li>Hadden who wrote extensively defending NRMs: negative statements on anti-cult movement</li>
<li>Zablocki and Beit-Hallahmi who wrote extensively against cults: negative statement on Hadden and pro-cult</li>

<p>Some "allegations" of the opposition I moved to the top, because they are uncontested distinctives of the cult opposition.</p>

<ul>
<li>We favor religious freedom, but "cults and "sects" are not religions.</li>
<li>When pressed to define what is a cult and what is a religion, anti-cultists reply:People join a religion voluntarily, but they are induced to join a cult through psychological manipulation (ie."<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a>").</li>
<li>When confronted with skepticism from scholars who have refuted the accusations of "brainwashing" and psychological manipulation, the anti-cultists state that:
<ul>
<li>Scholars can't be trusted.</li>
<li>The way to determine if a group is a cult is to ask the people who have left the organization (ex-followers or <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostate.html" title="Apostate">apostates</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When challenged that studies have shown that many more people who leave such groups state that they were not manipulated as those who state they were and that the majority of those who leave these organizations are indifferent, the anti-cultists then assure legislators that there are organizations (anti-cult organizations) who specialize in these matters and they can help determine who are reliable witnesses (referring to those apostates who are working with them).</li>

<p>Removed those two quotes because they refer to "stereotypes in journalism dictated by secularism" and "dominant culture als environment of religious persecution" - these are not specific to to NRMs or cults, so they are no great help here. Also the (IMO excellent) Dart &amp; Allen paper "Bridging the gap" (dating from 1993 and not 1983) is not about NRMs and cults but about press and religion. I moved the quotes here, they might be good food for an article "Religion and Media", but in the article here they make just for length and religious anti-media bias and do not contribute to the subject as such. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 10:29, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Newspaper columnist Cal Thomas makes reference to stereoptypes in journalism dictated by "[...] a raging, unforgiving, imposing, intolerant, arrogant secularism that claims that any idea or authority that comes from a source higher than the mind of humankind is to be a priori overruled as unconstitutional, immoral, illegal and ignorant."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Michael Horowitz, a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, characterizes the dominant culture as an environment of religious persecution: "Today's elites find it hard to believe that Christians can possibly be the persecuted rather than the persecutors â¦ Believing Christians have been patronized as polyester bigots against whom a modern, thinking, caring culture must protect itself."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a survey conducted in 1983 by John Dart and Jimmy Allen it was found that an "unhealthy distrust exists between religionists and journalists. Religious figures fear being misunderstood and misrepresented; journalists fear making mistakes and incurring religious wrath.[...] The resulting apprehensions inhibit the free flow of information and only add to misunderstanding."</dd>

<dd>Again, I object to your removal of well researched and highly relevant text from this article. In an article about opposition to new religious movements, the position of the media on this and related issues is as important as any other text. Particulary concerning the important part that media plays in the shaping of public opinion regarding new religions. Text is now restored. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">ZappaZ</a> <a href="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Yin_yang.svg/12px-Yin_yang.svg.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" longdesc="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" /></a> 15:16, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Dart and Allan made the survey 1993 (not 1983!) and wrote an (BTW excellent) 120 page report "Bridging the Gap" (also 1993) which has been updated in 2000. The survey went to journalists and leaders of mainstream religions and the religions covered in the report are Catholicism, Mainstream Protestant, Evangelical, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism - NRMs are not mentioned! The quote is not from the report but from Moffit and it gives a very wrong impression of the report which is impartial and very moderate in tone, shows positive and negative points and errors on both sides of the gap, and advises both sides in detailed points on how to improve mutual relations. Moreover, the 2000 update (subtitled "The Gap is Narrowing") which included another survey, lines out that things have been improving sind 1993. Report is available online.</li>

<li>The Cal Thomas quote (probably taken from Moffit) is from a discussion on "Religion and Politics in the Culture Wars". The discussion does <i>not</i> mention the media, and NRMs are not mentioned in the discussion either. BTW, several pages later, in another discussion (without Thomas) there is restriction of religious liberty for minority religions discussed: an American Indian who had been fired in Oregon in 1990 for chewing peyote and Santeria in Florida 1992 forbidden to sacrifice animals within the city limits. No mention of the media here, either, the discussion is about legislation and courts only. Report is no more available at fac.org but I found it on the wayback machine.</li>

<li>The Horowitz quote is also taken from Moffit - I did not find the original online, so I could not see how the quote relates to it, but in view of the above examples which I did research, I'd say Moffit is as a source to be used <i>cum grano salis</i>. Horowitz concentrates on persecuted Christians in Sudan, China and North Korea, and he talks of persecuted Christians. This is not a NRM subject. There is no mention of media in the quote, and even if there was, persecuted Christians in Sudan and North Korea are regarding media coverage a very different subject from NRMs.</li>

<p>Excellent, Irmgard. Why don't you start an article on Religious intolerance in the media in which we can explore and expand on the above? Then we can add a summary here. From my perspective, making a distinction between "new" reeligion and and established one in respect to intolerance and freedom of belief, is POV and innapropriate. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">ZappaZ</a> <a href="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Yin_yang.svg/12px-Yin_yang.svg.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" longdesc="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" /></a> 16:10, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zappaz, this is an encyclopedia which is structured in articles (in contrast to, e.g. a blog which contains whatever comes next into the mind of the author and whatever else the author thinks as important). Encyclopedia articles have specific subject and talk about that specific subject - they can, of course, link to other subjects, which is definitely part of the fun. Now in this article the subject is opposition to cults and NRMs, so we write about opposition to cults and NRMs and quote what people are saying about religion and NRMs (everything else is cheating the reader who expects to hear about the subject in the title).</p>
<p>Of course, someone can start an article about religion and media - but it should definitely not be called Religious intolerance in the media because that is POV already in the title. I am not a media expert, and even less a media expert regarding the US, so I'd rather leave such an article to someone else. The quotes could be incorporated, e.g., in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Bias_73d5.html" title="Media Bias">Media Bias</a> for the moment. Cal Thomas, though, rather fits into a general context of secular society and religion - maybe there's an article on that already.</p>
<p>I'll remove the quotes in question here again , and make a link to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Bias_73d5.html" title="Media Bias">Media Bias</a>. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 18:11, 21 September 2005 (UTC) When discussing religion in general, this means established and new religions - when discussing NRMs this means NRMs - when discussing the East-West schisma this means Orthodox and Catholic</p>

<dd>I moved the article, because the euphemism is not known outside wikipedia. It has been invented by anti-cult activists, who for some reason do not like to appear as a collective entity.

<dd>There used to be two article and there should be two articles because 1. opposition to cults and new religious movements is much broader than the anti-cult movement that is defined by Bromley as the groups that believe in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">Brainwashing</a> 2. the existence of the anti-cult movement is undisputed.

<dd>Fossa seems to be under the strange misconception that every article title <i>must</i> refer to an entity, rather than to a topic. That's the only sense I can make out of his obscure reference to "the euphemism"; it's as if he thinks that someone is trying to say that there's an entity euphemistically called "opposition to cults and new religious movements", rather than that this is the article about <i>the topic of</i> opposition to cults and new religious movements. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:34, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I myself distinguish between the more secular ACM and Christian Apologetics. Recently, these two currents have become closer to each other in terms of ideology, though. I have no qualms to lump them together in one ACM, or, as Bromley&amp;Shupe call them "organized opposition against cults." As an aside, there are no clear-cut definitions in sociology that would compare to definitions in physics or mathematics.--<a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa">Fossa</a> 23:34, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I think that Melton made a distinction between the Christian apologetic <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-cult_movement.html" title="Counter-cult movement">counter-cult movement</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-cult_movement.html" title="Anti-cult movement">anti-cult movement</a>, but the latter is difficult to define. Do you have references to back up your statement that Bromley called the ACM "organized opposition to cults", because it clearly is a different defintion than I have read from them. This article used to have a better definition provided by me, based on the book by Barrett. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 23:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have been waiting since February 2006 for removal of off-topic material. I will remove off-topic again in 6 days regardless if it is merged. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:12, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Jossi, you reverted back to a version that contained a factual inaccuary i.e. that Wilson coined the term atrocity story. I will give the article a disputed warning. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:15, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also think that the name should be Bromley and not Bromfield. I will give the article a factual accuracy warning. Now it is time for others, not just me, to do some effort to improve it, instead of giving a mass-revert. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:25, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that the only innaccuracy? That is easily fixable.

<dd>It seems that the term is explained in <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrocity_story.html" title="Atrocity story">Atrocity_story</a>.

<dd>You may be right, but note that it is poor style to remove content before a merge, as content that editors worked hard to source and edit gets lost that way.

<dd>If you think that the contents is not off-topic then please explain why the folllowing sentence about the Christian counter cult activist belongs here. Please provide references for the assertion that Hein is not a Christian counter cult activist but a anti-cult activist. The sentence either belongs at <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_group.html" title="Hate group">hate group</a> where at already is, or at <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> or at Christian counter cult movement but not here. This is just one example of the off-topic contents. More will follow.
<dl>
<dd>" <i>Advocates who regard certain fringe religious organizations, new religious movements or (controversially) "cults" as spurious and condemn their methods, also call them "hate groups". For example, the prominent Dutch Christian counter cult activist Anton Hein considers Scientology a hate group because that religious movement has, in his opinion, a long, documented history of hate and harassment activities[6], whichâalong with lying and deceptionâare condoned and encouraged in Scientology's own 'scriptures.'

<dl>
<dd>"<i>Elan Vital, an NRM and an organization that supports the work of Prem Rawat, accuse its vocal critics that call themselves "Ex-Premies", to harbor the hatred and ill-will typical of a hate group, such as hate speech and harassment. The Ex-Premies reject these accusations asserting that the evidence for these allegations is uncorroborated, and assert that they are performing a public service by providing information not disclosed by Elan Vital.'"</i></dd>
