Sometimes the term <b>Japanophobia</b> is also used <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

Anti-Japanese sentiments range from animosity towards the Japanese government's actions and disdain for <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Japanese culture</a> to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> against the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese people</a>. Sentiments <a href="../../../d/e/h/Dehumanization.html" title="Dehumanization">dehumanizations</a> have been fueled by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Japanese_propaganda_9c22.html" title="Anti-Japanese propaganda">anti-Japanese propaganda</a> during World War II.</p>
<p>In the past, anti-Japanese sentiment contained innuendos with Westerners viewing Japanese people as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">barbaric</a>, while at the same time Japanese people sometimes described westerners as "white barbarians" or "savages." Japan was intent on adopting Western ways in an attempt to join the West as an industrialized imperial power. <a href="../../../f/u/k/Fukuzawa_Yukichi_47ae.html" title="Fukuzawa Yukichi">Fukuzawa Yukichi</a>'s <i><a href="../../../d/a/t/Datsu-A_Ron_1e83.html" title="Datsu-A Ron">Leaving Asia</a></i> was the 1885 article that provided the intellectual basis for Japan's modernization and Westernization. However, a lack of acceptance of the Japanese in the West made integration and assimilation difficult. One commonly held view was that the Japanese were <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-human.html" title="Sub-human">sub-human</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolutionarily</a> inferior. Japanese culture was viewed with suspicion and even disdain.</p>
<p>Today, anti-Japanese sentiment continues based on Japanese military aggression in the early 20th century, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_war_atrocities_199d.html" title="List of Japanese war atrocities">war atrocities</a> committed by the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Army_18cd.html" title="Imperial Japanese Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_75b5.html" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> before and during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and Japanese governmental corruption and unfair trade practices sometimes encountered more recently. While passions have settled somewhat since Japan's defeat in World War II, tempers continue to flare on occasion over the widespread perception that the Japanese government has made insufficient penance for the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_War_bded.html" title="Pacific War">Pacific War</a>, or has sought to <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">whitewash</a> the history of these events. Also, some anti-Japanese sentiment originates from business practices used by some Japanese companies, such as <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumping_%28pricing_policy%29.html" title="Dumping (pricing policy)">dumping</a>.</p>
<p>Periodically, individuals within Japan spur external criticism. Former Prime Minister <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junichiro_Koizumi_c729.html" title="Junichiro Koizumi">Junichiro Koizumi</a> was heavily criticized for annually paying his respects to the war dead at the <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a>, which enshrines all those who fought and died for Japan during World War II, including 1,068 <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Military_Tribunal_for_the_Far_East_b0d0.html" title="International Military Tribunal for the Far East">convicted war criminals</a>. Right-wing nationalist groups have produced history textbooks that critics claim whitewash Japanese atrocities; the recurring controversies over these books occasionally attract hostile foreign attention. Others, particularly Japanese, believe that much regional anti-Japanese sentiment stems from <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentrism.html" title="Ethnocentrism">ethnocentrism</a> and government-run <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> campaigns, particularly in the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/international/asia/15china.html?ex=1271217600&amp;en=a26d8a2aa464ce14&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/international/asia/15china.html?ex=1271217600&amp;en=a26d8a2aa464ce14&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pre-Twentieth Century</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, anti-Japanese sentiment had its beginnings well before the Second World War. As early as the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">1800s</a>, Asian immigrants were subject to much racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed that openly discriminated against Japanese, as well as Chinese, Koreans, and Filipinos. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become citizens of the United States and could not hold basic rights, such as owning land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Exclusion_League_fabe.html" title="Asiatic Exclusion League">Asiatic Exclusion League</a> as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.</p>
<p><a name="Early_Twentieth_Century" id="Early_Twentieth_Century"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Early Twentieth Century</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">twentieth century</a> many Americans regarded Japan as an enlightened country in the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_East_982f.html" title="Far East">Far East</a> that had success in emulating the West and exerting itself as a colonial power, much like many powerful European countries at the time. However, this perception began to change as more reports of Japanese brutalities in its conquered territories began to pour into the American press and helped change public opinion.</p>
<p>The Japanese invasion of China in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> and the annexation of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> was widely criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by the <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_lobby.html" title="China lobby">China lobby</a> for American intervention to push Japan out of China also played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japan came to the attention of American government, <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embargo.html" title="Embargo">embargoes</a> on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, partly out of genuine concern for the Chinese populace and partly out of concern for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European-American_58cc.html" title="European-American">European-American</a> population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-Japanese_War_%281937-1945%29_f457.html" title="Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> broke out in 1937, European-American public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African-American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Movement_of_the_Eastern_World_9187.html" title="Pacific Movement of the Eastern World">Pacific Movement of the Eastern World</a> {PMEW} which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">white supremacy</a> with the arrival of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_Imperial_Army_9382.html" title="Japanese Imperial Army">Japanese Imperial Army</a>. This included stockpiling arms.</p>

<p>The most profound cause of anti-Japanese sentiment had its beginning in the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, which propelled the United States into <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> against the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Japan_4a4a.html" title="Empire of Japan">Empire of Japan</a> and <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers.html" title="Axis powers">its allies</a>. Many Americans regarded the Sunday-morning surprise attack as an exhibition of cowardice and was taken by complete surprise. Japanese conduct during the war did little to quell anti-Japanese sentiment; fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other western <a href="../../../p/o/w/POW_17fa.html" title="POW">POWs</a>, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bataan_Death_March_01eb.html" title="Bataan Death March">Bataan Death March</a>, the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">Kamikaze</a> attacks on American ships, and atrocities committed on <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Island_804a.html" title="Wake Island">Wake Island</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>An estimated 112,000 to 120,000 Japanese migrants and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_American_2d8f.html" title="Japanese American">Japanese Americans</a> from the West Coast were <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_American_internment_6fab.html" title="Japanese American internment">interned</a> regardless of their attitude to the US or Japan. They were held for the duration of the war in the inner US. The large Japanese population of Hawaii was not massively relocated though in spite of their proximity to vital military areas.</p>
<p>In addition, the extreme Japanese reluctance to accept defeat and extensive <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> dehumanized the Japanese in American eyes — this is illustrated by the American <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_film.html" title="Propaganda film">propaganda film</a> <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Japan_6349.html" title="My Japan">My Japan</a>. Interestingly, this film's portrayal of the Japanese is very similar to the way they are portrayed in the Japanese government's own propaganda films.</p>
<p>A detailed treatment of the mutual animosity between the U.S. and Japan during the war is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Dower_218d.html" title="John W. Dower">John W. Dower</a>'s <i>War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War.</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-394-75172-8</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Since World War II</span></h3>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the waning fortunes of heavy industry in the United States prompted layoffs and hiring slowdowns just as counterpart businesses in Japan were making major inroads into U.S. markets. Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the lethargic <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Three_8674.html" title="Big Three">Big Three</a> automakers (<a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_Corporation_a513.html" title="General Motors Corporation">General Motors</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler_Corporation_347c.html" title="Chrysler Corporation">Chrysler</a>) could only watch in horror as their former customers turned out in droves for Japanese imports from <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota.html" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan.html" title="Nissan">Nissan</a>, a consequence of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> oil crisis. The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars and, most shockingly, in the 1982 murder of <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Chin_7c76.html" title="Vincent Chin">Vincent Chin</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_American_7e72.html" title="Chinese American">Chinese American</a> beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.</p>
<p>Other highly symbolic deals — for instance, the sale to Japanese firms of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_Center_92b1.html" title="Rockefeller Center">Rockefeller Center</a> building — further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment. The unease continued well into the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Popular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan. The discomfort many Americans felt about Japan's domination of certain industries and their continuing acquisition of US businesses was clearly manifest, particularly in futuristic period pieces such as <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_II_2bf3.html" title="Back to the Future II">Back to the Future II</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robocop_3.html" title="Robocop 3">Robocop 3</a>, where Americans are frequently shown as working precariously under Japanese superiors. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crichton_1cc6.html" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> took a break from <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> to write <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rising_Sun_%28novel%29_9db5.html" title="Rising Sun (novel)">Rising Sun</a>, a <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder_mystery.html" title="Murder mystery">murder mystery</a> (later made into a <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rising_Sun_%28film%29_78ff.html" title="Rising Sun (film)">feature film</a>) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, In <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Clancy_22e8.html" title="Tom Clancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s book, <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debt_of_Honor_dbf8.html" title="Debt of Honor">Debt of Honor</a>, Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.</p>
<p>The animosity which peaked in the 1980s, when the term "<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_bashing.html" title="Japan bashing">Japan bashing</a>" became popular, had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan's waning fortunes, coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off, largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media, which has turned to other issues.</p>
<p>On 2 March 2007, "The comfort women" issue was raised again by Japanese prime minister <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinzo_Abe_1fbc.html" title="Shinzo Abe">Shinzo Abe</a>, in which he denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during World War II in an orchestrated way. He stated, "The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion in <i>narrow sense</i>." Before he spoke, a group of Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers also sought to revise Yohei Kono's 1993 apology to former comfort women. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> - The New York Times editorial quickly refuted Abe's statement: “These were not commercial brothels. Force, explicit and implicit, was used in recruiting these women. What went on in them was serial rape, not prostitution. The Japanese Army’s involvement is documented in the government’s own defense files.” <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>There is anti-Japanese sentiment in China. Some will speak openly of Chinese 'national hatred' (民族仇恨).<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> There may be some regional variation in the intensity of anti-Japanese sentiment, which is thought to be weaker in areas not subjected to Japanese military occupation and, ironically, in areas under long-term occupation by the Japanese.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The roots of this dislike lie in history. Japan started off like other Western powers by annexing land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with the settlement and the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-One_Demands_67c2.html" title="Twenty-One Demands">Twenty-One Demands</a> by the Japanese government led to a severe <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott_of_Japanese_products_28e0.html" title="Boycott of Japanese products">boycott of Japanese products</a> in China. (see: <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_Fourth_Movement_1a68.html" title="May Fourth Movement">May Fourth Movement</a>.)</p>
<p>Most anti-Japanese sentiment in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> can be directly traced to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Sino-Japanese_War_80fe.html" title="Second Sino-Japanese War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, which was one theatre of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. As a direct consequence of the war, China suffered over 20 million civilian deaths and 3 million military casualties<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>, as well as another 23 million ethnic Chinese civilian deaths in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>. In addition, the war caused an estimated $383.3 billion USD in damage and created 95 million refugees. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> came under Japanese control in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> as a puppet state named <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchukuo.html" title="Manchukuo">Manchukuo</a>. Many major cities thereafter, including <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanjing.html" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> were occupied in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> by the Japanese. Notable atrocities committed by the invading Japanese forces included the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_of_Nanking_8f49.html" title="Rape of Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a>. In Manchuria, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_731.html" title="Unit 731">Unit 731</a>, a medical unit of the Japanese army, researched <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_warfare.html" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a> using Chinese civilians as test subjects. Women from many Asian countries, including China, were forced to serve as <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_slaves.html" title="Sex slaves">sex slaves</a> in military brothels under Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>This was compounded by the arrogance and contempt, fed by the ideology of pre-war <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_nationalism.html" title="Japanese nationalism">Japanese nationalism</a>, with which many Japanese in this period regarded China, and the brutality of discipline within the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Army_18cd.html" title="Imperial Japanese Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>.</p>
<p>There is a widespread perception in China that Japan has not shown true repentance for its actions during World War II. The Chinese believe that Japan has gotten off lightly for the damage and suffering it caused. There is also mistrust of Japan's sincerity for its wartime behavior as being slow in coming, vaguely worded and insincere. This impression is backed up by the careless words and deeds of some Japanese politicians and the assertion by some nationalist elements in Japan that wartime atrocities never took place.</p>
<p>There is also deep resentment at the veneration of Japanese war veterans in <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a>, where a number of war criminals are enshrined, and treated as <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kami.html" title="Kami">kami</a> or gods, and which openly states that the purpose of Japanese military involvement in Asia was done to bring prosperity and liberation for Asians. This is further exacerbated by attempts to whitewash Japan's role in the war in certain school history textbooks, such as by softening some statements and removing others. That some popular media such as comics <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/12/wcomic12.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/12/ixworld.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/12/wcomic12.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/12/ixworld.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, books, movies, or documentaries depicting Japanese wartime involvement in atrocities are withdrawn due to nationalist or popular sentiment further contributes to this image. Books such as <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iris_Chang_7265.html" title="Iris Chang">Iris Chang</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rape_of_Nanking_%28book%29_6bcf.html" title="The Rape of Nanking (book)">The Rape of Nanking</a> generated enough controversy to be withdrawn from planned publication, while scenes of the <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanking_Massacre_ec33.html" title="Nanking Massacre">Nanking Massacre</a> were censored from the Japanese theatrical release of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Emperor_4143.html" title="The Last Emperor">The Last Emperor</a>.<a href="http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/133p/133p04papers/JChapelNanjing046.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/133p/133p04papers/JChapelNanjing046.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Although Japan never paid formal war reparations to China, it did give ODA (official development assistance), amounting to 3 trillion yen (30 billion USD) in grants and loans. In Japan, this was perceived as a way of making amends to China for past military aggression. Japan is, in fact, China's largest financial donor, giving more than all other governments combined. According to some estimates, Japan accounts for more than 60 percent of China's ODA received. About 25 percent of the funding for all of China's infrastructure projects between 1994 and 1998 — including roads, railways, telecom systems and harbours — came from Japan.<a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB12Ad07.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB12Ad07.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> This was rarely formally publicized to the Chinese people by the Chinese government, until Japan announced that aid was to be phased out.</p>
<p>There is a perception among some Chinese that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> are attempting to contain China. Japan's more recent debate to revise <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_9_of_the_Japanese_Constitution_7649.html" title="Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution">Article 9</a>, the "No War" clause, is viewed with suspicion of possible re-militarization. Anti-Japanese sentiment in China is also highlighted by the branding of several prominent Taiwanese politicians (especially those who advocate <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a>) as "Japanese <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lackey.html" title="Lackey">running dogs</a>" by the state-run media. However, some critics of China, in the U.S. and elsewhere, have accused the People's Republic of China of exploiting anti-Japanese sentiment in order to redirect criticism of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_China_8300.html" title="Communist Party of China">Communist Party of China</a>, transforming it into criticism of Japan, and building nationalism out of it.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

Except for the match against Bahrain, Japanese supporters were instructed by the local police not to use "banners, flags, musical instruments, or wear team uniforms" and were asked to refrain from cheering. The flight to <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, the venue of the final match against China, was delayed for two hours due to Chinese protesters at <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing_International_Airport_0ecc.html" title="Beijing International Airport">Beijing International Airport</a>. After defending champion Japan defeated China in the final by 3-1, in which the second Japanese goal appeared to be a handball, a Chinese protest broke out, and the Japanese ambassador's car was severely damaged.</p>
<p>Continued visits by Japanese politicians to the <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a>, and the recent approval of a textbook that downplays the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_of_Nanking_8f49.html" title="Rape of Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a> and the role of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_slaves.html" title="Sex slaves">sex slaves</a> in the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Army_18cd.html" title="Imperial Japanese Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> have further aroused Chinese sentiment. Japan's campaign to become a permanent member of the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_Security_Council_53d3.html" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a> has met with stiff opposition among Chinese people, and the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaoyu_Islands_e5bf.html" title="Diaoyu Islands">Diaoyu Islands</a> / <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senkaku_Islands_83f6.html" title="Senkaku Islands">Senkaku Islands</a>, currently controlled and claimed by Japan, but claimed also by both PRC and ROC, continue to be a sticking point and a symbolic focus of anti-Japanese sentiment in China.</p>
<p>The buildup of anti-Japanese sentiment, aided by websites, had already been noted by Western media in early 2005. In spring 2005, <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_2005_anti-Japanese_demonstrations_in_China_f748.html" title="Spring 2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations in China">anti-Japanese demonstrations</a> were organized by anti-Japanese elements in several cities across China. The Internet, including instant messaging services, was used in organizing groups of demonstrators to take part in protests. Many were calling for a <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott_of_Japanese_products_28e0.html" title="Boycott of Japanese products">boycott of Japanese products</a>. Outside China, these demonstrations were viewed with cynicism, partly since the Government of China does not usually permit demonstrations without government approval. The result was another apology by the Japanese PM, which was somewhat spoiled by visits to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese lawmakers on the same day.</p>
<p>Concern at anti-Japanese sentiment is believed to be behind the decision of Chinese censors to ban the film <i><a href="../../../m/e/m/Memoirs_of_a_Geisha_%28film%29_abd9.html" title="Memoirs of a Geisha (film)">Memoirs of a Geisha</a></i> on February 1, 2006. The fact that Chinese actresses played Japanese geisha, often wrongly perceived as prostitutes in China, had caused considerable controversy among some elements of the Chinese population.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The Sinocentrism Factor</span></h3>
<p>Other explanations have been offered for the extraordinary persistence of virulent anti-Japanese sentiment in China. One theory is that China's perceptions of Japan is influenced by the historical concept, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinocentrism.html" title="Sinocentrism">Sinocentrism</a>, as well as the nature of the historical relationship between the two countries, of which many Westerners are only dimly aware.</p>
<p>China had been a regional <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> for thousands of years before the emergence of Japan in the late 19th and early 20th century, and many now-independent countries were <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tributary_state.html" title="Tributary state">tributary states</a> to China, including Japan. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_philosophy.html" title="Chinese philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucianism.html" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> figured prominently in the development of East Asia. As such, China saw itself as the center of civilization, perhaps giving rise to the Chinese people's name for their country, the "<i><a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Kingdom_34d6.html" title="Middle Kingdom">Middle Kingdom</a></i>" (中國). During the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tang_Dynasty_fbdb.html" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a>, Japan sent emissaries to China (see <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_embassies_to_China_f545.html" title="Imperial embassies to China">Imperial embassies to China</a>) and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a> to learn Chinese, technology, and theology. Much of Japanese culture and society subsequently was heavily influenced by Imperial Chinese models.</p>
<p>The alleged <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinocentrism.html" title="Sinocentrism">Sinocentrism</a> of China has as an element the characterization of non-Chinese groups as uncultivated people.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> All foreign groups, from other Asians like Koreans and Japanese, to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europeans</a> and people from other parts of the world, were referred to and thought of as <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">barbarians</a></i> bereft of proper Confucian morality and hence, civilization.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Modern <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_nationalism.html" title="Chinese nationalism">Chinese nationalism</a> is to a considerable extent a reaction against the violent intrusion of the West into this picture in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, as typified by the <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium_Wars_fbbd.html" title="Opium Wars">Opium Wars</a>, which shattered China's self-perception and forced her to accept an economically and developmentally inferior position in a Western-dominated multipolar world. However, the greatest anger is reserved for Japan's aggressive conduct in the 19th and 20th centuries, which many Chinese regard as an arrogant attempt to usurp China's dominant role in East Asia and a betrayal of Chinese tutelage. Some Japanese now view anti-Japanese sentiment in China as a continuation of a kind of ancient Chinese cultural "chauvinism," even though the existence of such chauvinism lacks historical justification<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.

<p>Some take the view that anti-Japanese sentiment in China is a result of political manipulation by the Communist party and the Chinese Government.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to this view, <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and the Communist party claimed the victory against the Japanese invaders as part of their legacy. Initially, there was no need to resort to anti-Japanese sentiment because the principal enemies of the new country were the United States and later the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>After the failure of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Leap_Forward_dece.html" title="Great Leap Forward">Great Leap Forward</a> and the disruption of the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_Revolution_5b68.html" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deng_Xiaoping_1b22.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> and other leaders decided to take the country on a path of economic development based on the market economy, without relinquishing the party's grip on political power. According to this view, the government resorted to nationalism, including an appeal to the&#160;CCP's anti-Japanese credentials, in order to reassert its legitimacy to lead the country and defuse the inevitable tensions that would accompany rapid economic growth. This tendency was intensified by <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Zemin_0f0a.html" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, under whose leadership, many foreign scholars and Japanese believe, Chinese schools began instilling anti-Japanese rhetoric into students.</p>
<p>Some argue that this viewpoint is overly simplistic, however. Anti-Japanese sentiment is found not only in China itself but also amongst Chinese overseas, as it is closely associated with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_nationalism.html" title="Chinese nationalism">Chinese nationalism</a>, particularly among youth. Government handling of anti-Japanese sentiment needs to be considered in concert with many factors, including the interests and strategies of different power groups within the ruling party, the need to be seen as patriotic and strong in dealing with foreign countries, and fear of the potentially destructive effects of nationalism if it gets out of hand.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese government succeeded in dampening the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_history_textbook_controversies.html" title="Japanese history textbook controversies">anti-Japanese demonstrations</a> of 2005, attempts by elements within the government to defuse anti-Japanese sentiment have not met with general success. In 2003, the concept of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China%27s_peaceful_rise.html" title="China's peaceful rise">China's peaceful rise</a> was floated in an attempt to contain aggressive nationalist energies but failed to make headway and largely faded away during 2004.</p>

<p>Just prior to the annexation of Korea, Japanese agents also killed the Queen of Korea, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Myeongseong_of_Korea_9223.html" title="Empress Myeongseong of Korea">Queen Min</a>.

<p>After the annexation of Korea, Japan enforced a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_assimilation.html" title="Cultural assimilation">cultural assimilation</a> policy. Koreans were forced to adopt the Japanese family name system, change the official religion to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinto.html" title="Shinto">Shinto</a>, and they were forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools, businesses, or public places.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> In addition the Japanese altered or destroyed various Korean monuments such as <a href="../../../g/y/e/Gyeongbokgung.html" title="Gyeongbokgung">Gyeongbokgung</a> palace and documents which portrayed the Japanese in a negative light were revised, this methodical alteration process was called the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseonsa_Pyeonsuhoe_1e56.html" title="Joseonsa Pyeonsuhoe">Joseonsa Pyeonsuhoe</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1940's, the Japanese extracted things made out of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">metal</a>, including spoons, bowls, and chopsticks, because they needed it to make weapons. They also conscripted young men from Korea for labor and military service.

<p>Much of Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea is also due to the Japanese government's textbook <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism.html" title="Revisionism">revisionism</a>. Even Japanese comic books like <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga_Kenkanryu_2c22.html" title="Manga Kenkanryu">Manga Kenkanryu</a></i> are guilty of historical revisionism. It is a comic book that twists Japanese wrongs in history and downplays everything in Korean history. Also, there are scenes in the comic that never really happened but is called "fact" and also depicts Koreans with exxagerated "Asian" features while depicting the Japanese as Caucasian.</p>
<p>During the time Junichiro Koizumi was prime minister, he has also done a lot of things to anger the Korean people, such as honouring the war criminals in Yasukuni and saying things that angered Koreans about Dokdo.</p>

<p>After <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>'s defeat in the World War I, the Japanese were a target of discrimination along with <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, as many Germans resented the Japan's seizure of its colonies in the Pacific. In <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>, Japanese are described as an inferior people.</p>
<p>Many people in countries which were <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allies</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> continue to campaign for compensation for being subject to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_labour.html" title="Forced labour">forced labour</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malnutrition.html" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, preventable illness and other hardships, as <a href="../../../p/o/w/POW_17fa.html" title="POW">POWs</a> of Japan during World War II. For example, some elderly people in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> express anti-Japanese sentiment, insisting there was unjust and abusive treatment by the Japanese in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a> during the Japanese occupation of the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_East_Indies_f394.html" title="Dutch East Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> during 1942-1945. Together with people from the former <a href="../../../k/n/i/KNIL_e7ac.html" title="KNIL">KNIL</a>, they have protested repeatedly against the visit of the emperor of Japan to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, the <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australia_Policy_da7a.html" title="White Australia Policy">White Australia Policy</a></i> was partly inspired by fears in the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> that if large numbers of Asian immigrants were allowed, they would have a severe and adverse effect on wages, the earnings of small business people and other elements of the standard of living. Nevertheless, a significant numbers of Japanese immigrants did arrive in Australia prior to <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> (perhaps most significantly in the town of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broome%2C_Western_Australia_806d.html" title="Broome, Western Australia">Broome</a>). By the late <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, Australians feared that Japanese military strength might lead to expansion in South East Asia and the Pacific, perhaps even an invasion of Australia itself. This resulted in a ban on <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_ore.html" title="Iron ore">iron ore</a> exports to Japan, from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. During World War II atrocities were frequently committed to Australians who surrendered, or attempted to surrender to Japanese soldiers. An example of this was the Tol Plantation massacre, where about 150 Australian troops were bayoneted to death by Japanese soldiers, which occurred during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Rabaul_%281942%29_01ca.html" title="Battle of Rabaul (1942)">Battle of Rabaul (1942)</a></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the Japanese victory in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Japanese_War_956c.html" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a> in 1905 halted Imperial Russia's ambitions in the East. Later, during the Russian Civil War, Japan was part of the Western interventionist forces that helped to occupy Vladivostok until October of 1922 with a puppet White government under Grigorii Semenov. At the end of WWII, the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Army_7542.html" title="Soviet Army">Soviet Army</a> in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_August_Storm_df9e.html" title="Operation August Storm">Operation August Storm</a> captured nearly 600,000 Japanese POWs. Of these, 473,000 were repatriated, with 55,000 having died in Soviet captivity and the fate of the rest being unknown.

It is the resting place of thousands of not only Japanese soldiers, but also Korean soldiers killed in various wars, but mostly in World War II. The shrine includes 13 <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_against_peace.html" title="Crime against peace">Class A criminals</a> such as <a href="../../../h/i/d/Hideki_Tojo_0712.html" title="Hideki Tojo">Hideki Tojo</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hirota_Koki_a657.html" title="Hirota Koki">Hirota Koki</a>, who were convicted and <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution.html" title="Execution">executed</a> for their roles in the Japanese invasions of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>, and other parts of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a> after the remission to them under <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_San_Francisco_953c.html" title="Treaty of San Francisco">Treaty of San Francisco</a>, A total of 1,068 convicted war criminals are enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Yasukuni Shrine has become a sticking point in the relations of Japan and her neighbours. The enshrinement of war criminals, honoring them for having fought and died for their country (even though the Japanese constitution implies the separation of church and state) has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by those same men. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that "[war] was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors" and that the war criminals were "cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces". In fact the fairness of these trials is a controversial subject among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan. The former <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister_of_Japan_5591.html" title="Prime minister of Japan">prime minister of Japan</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junichiro_Koizumi_c729.html" title="Junichiro Koizumi">Junichiro Koizumi</a>, has visited the shrine 5 times; every visit caused immense uproar in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>. His successor, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinzo_Abe_1fbc.html" title="Shinzo Abe">Shinzo Abe</a>, is a usual visitor of Yasukuni too.</p>
<p>Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">In Chinese</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>小日本 (xiǎo Rìběn) — Literally "Little Japan"(ese). This term is so common that it has very little impact left. The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese. "小", or the word "little", is usually construed as "puny" or "lowly", not "spunky".</li>
<li>日本鬼子 (Rìběn guǐzi) — Literally "Japanese devils". This is used mostly in the context of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Sino-Japanese_War_80fe.html" title="Second Sino-Japanese War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China.</li>
<li>倭 (Wō) — This was an ancient <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Chinese is usually intended to give a negative connotation (see Wōkòu below). The character is said to also mean "<i>dwarf</i>", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See <a href="../../../w/a/_/Wa_%28Japan%29_392e.html" title="Wa (Japan)">Wa (Japan)</a>.</li>
<li>倭寇 (Wōkòu) — Originally referred to Japanese pirates and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ming_Dynasty_71f3.html" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> (see <a href="../../../w/o/k/Wokou.html" title="Wokou">Wokou</a>).

<h3><span class="mw-headline">In Korean</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>왜놈(倭奴, Waenom) — Means "short bastard" or "shortie". This term refers to the ancient name of Japan given by China, Waeguk (倭國) (see <i>Wō</i> above). Koreans also use this term to make fun of the common stereotype there of Japanese people being short.</li>
<li><a href="../../../../ko/%EC%AA%BD/%EB%B0%94/%EB%A6%AC/%EC%AA%BD%EB%B0%94%EB%A6%AC.html" class="extiw" title="ko:쪽바리">쪽바리</a> (Jjokbari/Tchokpari) — Literally meaning "pig's feet", this term refers to the thonged sandals that traditional Japanese people wore in a negative context and the exxageration that Japanese people have small feet and overall inferior physically to Koreans.</li>
