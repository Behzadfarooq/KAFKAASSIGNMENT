<p><b>Anton Bruckner</b> (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">4 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/2/1824.html" title="1824">1824</a> – <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_11.html" title="October 11">11 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>) was an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> composer. Bruckner's reputation is based on his <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony.html" title="Symphony">symphonies</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">masses</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motet.html" title="Motet">motets</a>. The symphonies are often considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_music.html" title="Romantic music">Romanticism</a>, due to their rich harmonic language, complex <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyphony.html" title="Polyphony">polyphony</a>, and considerable length. They have gained detractors (especially in English-speaking countries) owing to their large size, repetition, and the fact that Bruckner, sometimes with the assistance of his colleagues, produced several <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bruckner_Problem_d391.html" title="The Bruckner Problem">versions</a> of many of his works, of which the composer often seemed indecisive which he preferred.</p>
<p>Bruckner's biography is unusual for a composer, and commentators have struggled to settle on a straightforward account of his life and music. Many anecdotes portray Bruckner as a country bumpkin, with conservative manners and mores that were strikingly out of step with those of cosmopolitan <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. On the other hand, Bruckner's music helped to define musical radicalism at the time, owing to its <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consonance_and_dissonance.html" title="Consonance and dissonance">dissonances</a>, unprepared <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modulation_%28music%29.html" title="Modulation (music)">modulations</a>, and roving <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmony.html" title="Harmony">harmonies</a>. Unlike other radicals, such as <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagner.html" title="Wagner">Wagner</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Wolf_6f76.html" title="Hugo Wolf">Hugo Wolf</a> who fit the <a href="../../../e/n/f/Enfant_terrible.html" title="Enfant terrible">enfant terrible</a> mold, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagner.html" title="Wagner">Wagner</a> in particular. Many musicians and writers have struggled to accommodate these different facets of Bruckner, often with different pictures emerging according to their different levels of sympathy to Bruckner's music. It is only relatively recently that Bruckner has become fully respected in his own right, neither the musical "drunkard" portrayed by the conservative <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanslick.html" title="Hanslick">Hanslick</a> nor as the "half-baked" genius that many of his allies believed him to be.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Bruckner_e2ed.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Anton Bruckner was born in <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansfelden.html" title="Ansfelden">Ansfelden</a>. His father, who was a schoolmaster and organist, was also his first music teacher. He worked for a few years as a teacher's assistant, fiddling at village dances at night to supplement his income. He studied at the Augustinian monastery in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Florian%2C_Austria_4490.html" title="Saint Florian, Austria">St. Florian</a>, becoming an organist there in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a>. He continued his studies to the age of 40, under <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Sechter_3689.html" title="Simon Sechter">Simon Sechter</a> and Otto Kitzler, the latter introducing him to the music of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, which Bruckner studied extensively from <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a> onwards. Bruckner's genius, unlike that of a child prodigy (<a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart_a085.html" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, for example), did not appear until well into the fourth decade of his life. Furthermore, broad fame and acceptance did not come until he was over 60. A devout <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> who loved to drink beer, Bruckner was out of step with his contemporaries. He had already in 1861 made acquaintance with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Franz Liszt">Liszt</a> who, like Bruckner, was religious and who first and foremost was a harmonic innovator, initiating the new German school together with Wagner. Soon after Bruckner had ended his studies under Sechter and Kitzler, he wrote his first mature work, the <i>Mass in D Minor</i>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> he accepted a post as a teacher of music theory at the Vienna Conservatory, during which time he concentrated most of his energies on writing symphonies. These symphonies, however, were poorly received, at times considered "wild" and "nonsensical". He later accepted a post at the Vienna University in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a>, where he tried to make music theory a part of the curriculum. Overall, he was unhappy in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, which was musically dominated by the critic <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduard_Hanslick_589b.html" title="Eduard Hanslick">Eduard Hanslick</a>. At that time there was a feud between those who liked Wagner's music and those who liked Brahms's music. By aligning himself with Wagner, Bruckner made an unintentional enemy out of Hanslick. He did have supporters; famous conductors such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Nikisch_bafe.html" title="Arthur Nikisch">Arthur Nikisch</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schalk_1c8c.html" title="Franz Schalk">Franz Schalk</a> constantly tried to bring his music to the public, and for this purpose proposed 'improvements' for making Bruckner's music more acceptable to the public. While Bruckner allowed these changes, he also made sure in his will to bequeath his original scores to the Vienna National Library, confident of their musical validity. Another proof of Bruckner's confidence in his artistic ability is that he often started work on a new symphony just a few days after finishing another.</p>
<p>In addition to his symphonies, Bruckner wrote <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28music%29.html" title="Mass (music)">masses</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motet.html" title="Motet">motets</a>, and other sacred <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choral</a> works. Unlike his <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_music.html" title="Romantic music">romantic</a> symphonies, Bruckner's choral works are often conservative and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpoint.html" title="Counterpoint">contrapuntal</a> in style.</p>
<p>Bruckner was a very simple man, and numerous anecdotes abound as to his dogged pursuit of his chosen craft and his humble acceptance of the fame that eventually came his way. Once, after a rehearsal of his <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._4_%28Bruckner%29_216f.html" title="Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)">Fourth Symphony</a></i>, the well-meaning Bruckner tipped the conductor <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Richter_%28conductor%29_b2a7.html" title="Hans Richter (conductor)">Hans Richter</a>: "When the symphony was over," Richter related, "Bruckner came to me, his face beaming with enthusiasm and joy. I felt him press a coin into my hand. 'Take this' he said, 'and drink a glass of beer to my health.'" Richter, of course, accepted the coin, a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Theresa_thaler_dc93.html" title="Maria Theresa thaler">Maria Theresa thaler</a>, and wore it on his watch-chain ever after.</p>
<p>Bruckner was a renowned organist in his time, impressing audiences in France in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, and England in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, giving six recitals on a new Henry Willis organ at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Albert_Hall_a74f.html" title="Royal Albert Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and five more at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crystal_Palace_5132.html" title="The Crystal Palace">the Crystal Palace</a>. Though he wrote no major works for the organ, his improvisation sessions sometimes yielded ideas for the Symphonies. He taught organ performance at the Conservatory; among his students were <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Rott_01dd.html" title="Hans Rott">Hans Rott</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schmidt_a451.html" title="Franz Schmidt">Franz Schmidt</a>. <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Mahler_fb2a.html" title="Gustav Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>, who called Bruckner his "forerunner", attended the conservatory at this time (Walter n.d.).</p>
<p>Bruckner died in Vienna in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>. He never married, though he proposed to a number of astonished teenage girls. He had a morbid interest in dead bodies, at one point cradling the head of <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a> in his hands when Beethoven was exhumed. He left extensive instructions that he was to be embalmed.</p>

<p>Sometimes Bruckner's works are referred to by WAB numbers, from the <i>Werkverzeichnis Anton Bruckner</i>, a catalogue of Bruckner's works edited by Renate Grasberger.</p>
<p>The revision issue has generated controversy. A common explanation for the multiple versions is that Bruckner was willing to revise his work on the basis of harsh, uninformed criticism from his colleagues. This explanation was given enormous cachet when it was championed by Bruckner scholar <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Haas_%28musicologist%29_f770.html" title="Robert Haas (musicologist)">Robert Haas</a>, who was the chief editor of the first critical editions of Bruckner's works published by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Bruckner_Society_3e0c.html" title="International Bruckner Society">International Bruckner Society</a>; it continues to be found in the majority of program notes and biographical sketches concerning Bruckner. It was however sharply criticized by scholars such as Haas's successor <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_Nowak_f132.html" title="Leopold Nowak">Leopold Nowak</a>, Benjamin Korstvedt and conductor <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Botstein_51b8.html" title="Leon Botstein">Leon Botstein</a> who argue that Haas' explanation is at best idle speculation, at worst a shady justification of Haas' own editorial decisions.</p>

<p>Bruckner's Symphonies are all in four movements, starting with a modified <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonata_form.html" title="Sonata form">sonata form</a> allegro, a slow movement, a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scherzo.html" title="Scherzo">scherzo</a> in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_signature.html" title="Time signature">3/4</a> time, and a modified sonata form allegro finale. (In the Eighth, Ninth, and one version of the Second, the slow movements and scherzi are reversed.) They are scored for a fairly standard orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, two or three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani and strings. The later symphonies increase this complement, but not by much. Notable is the use of <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagner_tuba.html" title="Wagner tuba">Wagner tubas</a> in his last three symphonies. With the exception of <i>Symphony No. 4</i>, none of Bruckner's Symphonies has subtitles, and most of the nicknames were not thought up by the composer. Bruckner's works are trademarked with powerful codas and grand finales, as well as the frequent use of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unison.html" title="Unison">unison</a> passages and orchestral <i><a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutti.html" title="Tutti">tutti</a></i>. His style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but by the middle of the 20th century musicologists recognized that Bruckner's orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">pipe organ</a>.</p>
<p>Otto Kitzler, Bruckner's last composition teacher, set him three final tasks as the climax of his studies: a choral work, an overture, and a symphony. The latter, completed in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, was then Bruckner's <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._00_%28Bruckner%29_8423.html" title="Symphony No. 00 (Bruckner)">Study Symphony in F minor</a></i>. Bruckner later rejected this work, but he did not destroy it. While it certainly reminds one of earlier composers such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Schumann_9001.html" title="Robert Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, it undeniably also bears the hallmarks of the later Bruckner style. Kitzler simply commented that the work was "not very inspired". It was first performed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> and not published until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> and is usually listed as <i>Symphony No. 00.</i></p>
<p>Bruckner's <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._1_%28Bruckner%29_2425.html" title="Symphony No. 1 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 1 in C minor</a></i> (sometimes called by Bruckner "das kecke Beserl", roughly translated as "the saucy maid" <a href="http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogues_extensions/2002_03season/2003_1_10/korstvedt1_10.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogues_extensions/2002_03season/2003_1_10/korstvedt1_10.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) was completed in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, but the original text of this symphony was not reconstructed until 1998. Instead, it is commonly known in two versions, the so-called <i>Linz Version</i> which is based mainly on rhythmical revisions made in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, and the completely revised <i>Vienna Version</i> of <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>, which begins to reveal his mature style, e.g. <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._8_%28Bruckner%29_d686.html" title="Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 8</a>.</p>
<p>Next was the so-called <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._0_%28Bruckner%29_8952.html" title="Symphony No. 0 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 0 in D minor</a></i> of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, a very charming work which was so harshly criticized that Bruckner retracted it completely, and it was not performed at all during his lifetime, hence his choice for the number of the symphony.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._2_%28Bruckner%29_baab.html" title="Symphony No. 2 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 2 in C minor</a></i> was revised in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>. It is sometimes called the <i>Symphony of Pauses</i> for its dramatic use of whole-orchestra rests, very nicely accentuating the form. In the Carragan edition of the <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a> version, the Scherzo is placed second and the Adagio third.</p>
<p>Bruckner presented his <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._3_%28Bruckner%29_13a8.html" title="Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 3 in D minor</a></i>, written in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, to Wagner along with the Second, asking which of them he might dedicate to him. Wagner chose the Third, and Bruckner sent him a fair copy soon later, which is why the original version of this <i>Wagner Symphony</i> is preserved for us so nicely despite revisions in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>/<a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>. One thing that helped Wagner choose which Symphony to accept the dedication of was that the 3rd contains quotations from Wagner's music dramas, such as <i>Die Walküre</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i>. These quotations were taken out in revised versions.</p>
<p>Bruckner's first great success was his <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._4_%28Bruckner%29_216f.html" title="Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 4 in E flat major</a></i>, more commonly known as the <i>Romantic Symphony</i>, the only epithet applied to a symphony by the composer himself. The <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a> version has been seldom played and success came only after major revisions in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, including a completely new scherzo and finale, and again in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a>/<a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>, once again with a completely rewritten finale. This version, premiered in 1881 (under the conductor <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Richter_%28conductor%29_b2a7.html" title="Hans Richter (conductor)">Hans Richter</a>), Bruckner made more minor revisions in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>.</p>
<p>Bruckner's <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._5_%28Bruckner%29_5197.html" title="Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 5 in B flat major</a></i> crowns his most productive era of symphony-writing, finished at the beginning of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>. The original version seems unrecoverable and we know only the thoroughly revised version of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>. Many consider this symphony to be Bruckner's lifetime masterpiece in the area of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpoint.html" title="Counterpoint">counterpoint</a>. For example, the Finale is a combined fugue and sonata form movement: the first theme (characterized by the downward leap of an octave) appears in the exposition as a four-part fugue in the strings and the concluding theme of the exposition is presented first as a chorale in the brass, then as a four part fugue in the development, and culminating in a double fugue with the first theme at the recapitulation; additionally, the coda combines not only these two themes but also the main theme of the first movement.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._6_%28Bruckner%29_5c22.html" title="Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 6 in A major</a></i>, written in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>, is an oft-neglected work; whereas the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruckner_rhythm.html" title="Bruckner rhythm">Bruckner rhythm</a> (two quarters plus a quarter triplet or vice versa) is an important part of his previous symphonies, it pervades this work, particularly in the first movement, making it particularly difficult to perform.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._7_%28Bruckner%29_6703.html" title="Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 7 in E major</a></i> was the most beloved of Bruckner's symphonies with audiences of the time, and is still popular. It was written <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a> and revised in 1885. During the time that Bruckner began work on this Symphony, he was aware that Wagner's death was imminent, and so the Adagio is slow mournful music for Wagner, and for the first time in Bruckner's oeuvre, the <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagner_tuba.html" title="Wagner tuba">Wagner tuba</a> is included in the orchestra.</p>
<p>Bruckner began composition of his <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._8_%28Bruckner%29_d686.html" title="Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 8 in C minor</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a> Bruckner sent the work to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Levi_a24f.html" title="Hermann Levi">Hermann Levi</a>, the conductor who had led his Seventh to great success. Levi, who had said Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony was the greatest symphony written after Beethoven, believed that the Eighth was a confusing jumble. Bruckner revised the work, sometimes with the aid of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schalk_1c8c.html" title="Franz Schalk">Franz Schalk</a>, and completed this new version in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>.</p>

<p>The final accomplishment of Bruckner's life was to be his <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._9_%28Bruckner%29_8dff.html" title="Symphony No. 9 (Bruckner)">Symphony No. 9 in D minor</a></i> which he started in April <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>, and which he dedicated "To God the Beloved." The first three movements were completed by the end of <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>, the Adagio alone taking 18 months to complete. Work was delayed by the composer's poor health and by his compulsion to revise his early symphonies, and by the time of his death in 1896 he had not finished the last movement. The first three movements remained unperformed until their premiere in Vienna (in <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_L%C3%B6we_f53e.html" title="Ferdinand Löwe">Ferdinand Löwe</a>'s version) on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">February 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>.</p>
<p>Bruckner suggested using his <a href="../../../t/e/_/Te_Deum_366c.html" title="Te Deum">Te Deum</a> as a Finale, which would complete the homage to <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._9_%28Beethoven%29_2ce8.html" title="Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)">Ninth symphony</a> (also in <a href="../../../d/_/m/D_minor.html" title="D minor">D minor</a>). The problem was that the <i>Te Deum</i> is in <i>C Major</i>, while the 9th Symphony is <i>D Minor</i>, and, although Bruckner began sketching a transition from the Adagio key of <i>E Major</i> to the triumphant key of C Major, he did not pursue the idea. There have been several attempts to complete these sketches and prepare them for performance, as well as completions of his later sketches for an instrumental Finale, but only the first three movements of the Symphony are usually performed.</p>

<p>Bruckner wrote a <i><a href="../../../t/e/_/Te_Deum_366c.html" title="Te Deum">Te Deum</a></i>, settings of various <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalms.html" title="Psalms">Psalms</a>, (including Psalm 150 in the 1890s), various <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motet.html" title="Motet">motets</a>, and at least seven <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28music%29.html" title="Mass (music)">Masses</a>. His early Masses were usually short Austrian <i>Landmesse</i> for use in local churches and did not always set all the numbers of the ordinary. The three Masses Bruckner wrote in the 1860s and revised later on in his life are more often performed. The Masses numbered 1 in D minor and 3 in F minor are for solo singers, chorus and orchestra, while No. 2 in E minor is for chorus and a small group of wind instruments, and was written in an attempt to meet the Cecilians halfway. The Cecilians wanted to rid church music of instruments entirely. No. 3 was clearly meant for concert, rather than liturgical performance, and it is the only one of his Masses in which he set the first line of the Gloria, "Gloria in excelsis Deo", and of the Credo, "Credo in unum Deum", to music. (In concert performances of the other Masses, these lines are intoned by a tenor soloist in the way a priest would, with a psalm formula).</p>

<p>As a young man Bruckner sang in men's choirs and wrote music for them. This music is rarely played. Biographer Derek Watson characterizes the pieces for men's choir as being "of little concern to the non-German listener". Of thirty such pieces, <i>Helgoland</i> is the only secular vocal work Bruckner thought worthy enough to bequeath to the Vienna National Library.</p>
<p>The <i>Overture in G minor</i> is occasionally included in recordings of the Symphonies, and it is one of the works Bruckner wrote during his apprentice with Otto Kitzler. At that time he also wrote a March in D minor and three short orchestral pieces. These works already show hints of Bruckner's emerging style.</p>
<p>A <i>String Quartet in C minor</i> was discovered decades after Bruckner's death, but is only of interest as a student composition. The later <i>String Quintet in F major</i>, contemporaneous with the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, has been frequently performed.</p>
<p>There is an orchestral <i>Symphonic Prelude</i> that is sometimes attributed to Bruckner and sometimes to Mahler. It was discovered in the Vienna National Library in 1974 in a piano duet transcription and later orchestrated by Albrecht Gürsching. It is likely the work of one of Bruckner's students.</p>
<p>He also wrote <i>Lancer-Quadrille</i> for piano. Among his most unusual and evocative compositions is the choral <i>Abendzauber</i> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>) for tenor, yodelers and four alpine horns. It was never performed in Bruckner's lifetime.</p>

<p>The study of Bruckner today remains prominent among orchestrators and composers to address the problems Bruckner encountered in an age when the <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a> itself was expanding in size.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party_8d44.html" title="National Socialist German Workers Party">National Socialists</a> approved of Bruckner and <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> even consecrated a bust of Bruckner in a widely photographed ceremony in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regensburg.html" title="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>'s <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walhalla_temple.html" title="Walhalla temple">Walhalla temple</a>. This was in part because Hitler, like Bruckner, hailed from near <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz</a> -- Hitler from Braunau-am-Inn, Bruckner from Ansfelden. In addition, Bruckner, like Hitler, idolized Wagner and Hitler also identified with Bruckner as an artist rejected by the establishment in Vienna (which included Jews). Thus Bruckner's humble origins and <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagnerism.html" title="Wagnerism">Wagnerism</a> were emphasized while his religiousness was downplayed. When <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_von_Karajan_296a.html" title="Herbert von Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> wanted to play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in <a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachen.html" title="Aachen">Aachen</a> together with the motets, the Party disapproved. The Adagio from Bruckner's 7th Symphony was broadcast by the German radio (Deutscher Reichsrundfunk) upon announcing the news of Hitler's death on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>.</p>
<p>The music of Anton Bruckner found advocates in prominent conductors such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Furtw%C3%A4ngler_2651.html" title="Wilhelm Furtwängler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Walter_6bd8.html" title="Bruno Walter">Bruno Walter</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_von_Karajan_296a.html" title="Herbert von Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergiu_Celibidache_a227.html" title="Sergiu Celibidache">Sergiu Celibidache</a>, and especially <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugen_Jochum_445b.html" title="Eugen Jochum">Eugen Jochum</a>.

<p>Because of the long duration and vast orchestral canvas of much of his music, Bruckner's popularity has greatly benefited from the introduction of long-playing media and from improvements in recording technology.</p>
