<h2><span class="mw-headline">I had problems with the thirteen points</span></h2>
<p>Here's why: it implies that a criticism of a given group of people, when forming a nation, and taking a specific political course (in that nation), is (by way of criticism) an indictment of the people of the nation. That would imply that americans are anti-native, jewish people are anti-gentile, or that criticising nazi germany is anti-german. While I agree with some of the 13 points, in totality, the points argue that if Israel murdered every non-jew in it's borders, and was criticised for doing as such, the criticism would be "anti-semitic", rather than "anti-current-Israeli-policy". <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 09:21, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It does not imply so, just the opposite. From the removed text: <i>"...none of this is intended to suggest that Israel is somehow above the law, or that Israel is not to be held accountable for any violations of law. On the contrary — Israel is accountable for any violations of international law or human rights like any other state."</i> Cotler is an authority enough to be quoted in an encyclopedia. Let's have a serious discussion if possible, simply removing the section doesn't fly. --<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>|<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 18:29, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What about point 2: <i>Political anti-Semitism (a): the discrimination against, denial of, or assault upon the Jewish people's right to self-determination</i>? This seems to mean that a non-zionist is an anti-semite. Point 3 makes this even more clear. If you go against <i>the core of Jewish self-definition at any moment in time</i>, which according to the author includes Israel, you are an anti-semite. Besides, point 3 is incredibly broad. For instance, it is hard to deny that the current Jewish self-definition includes the belief that the Messias has not yet come. Therefore, any Christian would go against the core of Jewish self-definition and is therefore an anti-semite. On the other hand, some of the points are not political and very good indicators of 'old' anti-semitism (1 and 10-13). However, the other points simply employ the doublespeak of 'new' anti-semitism. Instead of simply arguing about Israel's politics in terms of fairness, legality, etc, a word with nasty implications is used to attack the opponent. It reeks very much of the word 'anti-revolutionary,' which was used by Stalin to eliminate all opposition, simply by associating someone or something with it (or communism with McCarthy). 'New' anti-semitism is similarly malleable, especially when defined by these 13 points. The result is that the meaning of 'anti-semitism' becomes part of the debate and it becomes very difficult to claim that everyone should be against anti-semitism. The reason is that the word has been disassociated from it's original meaning and reduced to a political tool to score easy points.</p>
<p>The statement by Cotler that he doesn't want to deny people the right to criticize Israel is a sham. When he feels that you are unfair towards Israel (which happens very quickly), he will start accusing you of anti-semitism. At that point you can no longer have a meaningful debate. This is described very well by Klug in <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug" class="external text" title="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug" rel="nofollow">The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism</a> (page 2).</p>
<p>As a general aside, in todays society, it seems very common for criticism versus the policy of a state to be considered personal. As an example, people who disagree with the policies of the American government are often called anti-American, with the assumption that that person also hates Americans. Similarly, certain actions by the French government are often taken personally against the French people. In such a dishonest climate, it is not surprising that criticism of Israel is considered to be anti-Jewish. --Wfzelle 15:19, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The right to self-determination is a human right. If you deny this right to Jews, you deny it to Palestinians as well. Moreover, self-determination need not mean statehood (this is an issue concerning Kurds for example, vis a vis Turkey and Iraq). Also, I wouldn't read no. 3 as saying that Christianity is inherently anti-semitic, although most Jews think it is -- or is anti-Jewish or something for which we do not have a good name (because Christianity claims a universality while refusing to recognize different people's right to be distinct). In any event, to respect someone's core beliefs does not mean that you have to agree with them, right? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Self-determination does not mean that you have the right to expel others from their lands.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You state that Israel does not have a right to expell others from their lands. So you <i>do</i> agree that Jews do have a right to self-determination, in general or in principle? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In principle &amp; in general (is there a difference?), I don't believe that people of a certain faith (Jewish, Christian, Muslim or whatever) have a right to their own country. For instance, I also disagree with the Arabic state as desired by Bin Laden and his ilk. Now, it is true that Jews have been persecuted for a long time and that is a reason for giving them their own country (again, I don't want to get into the debate whether it is sufficient justification or what that country should be), but then we are talking about an exception to the rule. The rule is that you should try to use democratic means to 'get your way' within the country that you live. For instance, US Jews have the right and the ability to get their voices heard in politics. They are not discriminated against or denied their own culture. In some other countries that is not possible, but even then, there is no right to a seperate state, but people should either try to work within the current system or flee to a country where they have this possibility.<br /></dd>
<dd>AFAIK, all this nonsense about this human right to self-determination comes from a biased reading of the UN's <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html#Article%201.1" class="external text" title="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html#Article%201.1" rel="nofollow">Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> which states that "All peoples have the right of self-determination." However, peoples clearly refers to a state as a whole (certainly in the context of the entire document) and does not grant that right to an individual or an ethnic or religious group. Wfzelle</dd>
</dl>
<p>Would Afro-Americans have the right to take an American state and kick all others out? Do catholics have the right to do the same? I don't think so. Jews have been living outside of Israel for thousands of years and they don't have the right to suddenly go back and kick the people out who were living there. What would happen if everyone could do so? The US would stop existing for one, since it would be given back to the Indians. Clearly unrealistic and unacceptable.<br />
<br />
No, the only reason why the creation of Israel was allowed was the Holocaust. Jews were allowed something which is hardly ever tolerated (N-Cyprus, Kurds, Kosovo). Now, I don't want to argue about the wisdom of doing so, but it is clearly not true that Israel had a right to exist in international law or when compared to other UN decisions about new states. To claim this as a human right or to compare it to the Palestinians who were already there (and who might have not been allowed a seperate state if Israel wouldn't have existed) is quite deceitful.<br />
<br />
As for Christianity being anti-semitic, you must clearly have missed Enlightment and the rise of secularity. Non-fundamentalist Christians do not claim universality or refuse to recognize different people's right to be distinct (within the limits of law, of course).<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>You must clearly not have read or understand what I wrote. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is what I understood, please explain to me what you meant by "Christianity claims a universality while refusing to recognize different people's right to be distinct," especially with regard to Judaism. Wfzelle</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, respect for someone's core beliefs does not require agreement, but it does require enough commonality of basic norms and values. I cannot respect a belief which requires the killing of innocent people for instance (such as the attacks by Hamas on civilian targets or 9/11).</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is insulting on its face, and <i>perhaps</i> anti-Semitic, to suggest that Judaism requires killing innocent people. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wanted to give an example of extreme beliefs that I cannot respect. I explicitly used the examples of Hamas and 9/11 because I didn't want you to see this as an attack on Israel, but somehow you were able to see it that way. Wfzelle</dd>
</dl>
<p>Israel is also doing many things which go against my norms and values.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like many Zionists and Jews, you can criticize many of those things. Expelling people from their land, or detaining people illegally, or assasinating people are certainly not core beliefs of Judaism. In any event, "criticism" implies non-agreement. The point that one can respect someone else's core beliefs without agreeing with them stands. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is you who sees criticism of Israel as criticism of Judaism. The point of the 'new anti-semitism' debate is that they are not the same. You seem to agree with me because you say: Israeli politics&#160;!= Judaism politics, so why do you accuse me of criticising Judaism??? Wfzelle</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Israeli government (and its supporters) also want to deny me the right to honestly talk about my grievances, by calling it anti-semitism (a new Godwin's law it seems).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Calling you an anti-Semite does not deny you any rights. In the United States, at least, even anti-Semites enjoy the right to free speech, protected by law. That does not mean that others have to agree with you. For you or anyone to demand that others agree is to deny others the right to free speech. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, anti-semitism is (rightly so) forbidden in my country. Secondly, I do not require that someone agrees with me, but I don't want to be demonized. It is similar to being called a child rapist (without evidence). Technically it might not take any rights away from you, but in practice, people will think "If there is smoke, there is fire" and your life will be affected. That is also why there are slander &amp; libel laws, even in the US. Clearly, free speech does not give you the right to malign people unfairly.<br /></dd>
<dd>Now, people are free to call me unfair towards Israel or otherwise attack my arguments in a respectful manner, but the right to free speech does not give them the right to slander me. Wfzelle</dd>
</dl>
<p>Using those dishonest tactics also goes against my norms and values and makes me respect the person who uses those tactics less.<br />

<dd>This world is not fair. I have read something about the earliest German jet pilot's fates -- When they were shot down, they were denied of human rights, because they were flying a more advanced aircraft than the US's.

<dd>Personally, I think those GIs and "private contractors" in Iraq do not deserve any protection once they are caught by the Iraqis. They have much superior weapons and training. The Iraqis have nothing. No one could even sell any weapons to them. The whole war is like the movie <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_4f6b.html" title="Independence Day">Independence Day</a>, only this time the flying saucer guys are from the US. Did the US ever care about other people's rights? Since in the movie you did not care about alien invaders' rights (same in the real world). Your rights shall not be honored.</dd>

<p>The Arabs have 22 huge and resource-rich states but prefer to deny Jews a single tiny sliver of land where Jewish presence is uninterrupted for 3.5 millenia, way before the Arab settlers came from Arabia or way before the Islamic conquests of the 7th century.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nice spin, if highly debatable (what were the original settlers there? Japanese?). Christians have had a presence there for just as long, (as christianity is a sect of Judaism) so maybe the christians could claim it as their home state, and "get angry that jews are trying to take their homeland from them."&#160;:) It's still not an argument against (or for) jews as an ethnography, or race,, it's an argument about territory. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 06:36, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Don't blame the arabs for lack of compromises when Israel refuses to honor its 1947, or even 1968, boundaries, and blame both parties for the insanity. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 11:33, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above discussion belongs on a different page (Israel, Israel-Palestine conflict), not here. This article simply states, accurately, that one person claims (reasonably, in my opinion) that attacks on Israel may and have been veiled forms of anti-Semitism. It does not claim that all or any attack on Israel is anti-semitic. If someone is so convinced that their criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitic, then do not bring it up on the anti-Semitism talk page. Moreover, talk pages are only for improving articles. This is not a list serve or discussion group and not a venue for expressing personal opinions. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<p>The EUMC recently issued a two reports on anti-semitism in europe and whether or not there are links to anti-zionism. suprised that they are not referenced here. <a href="http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=1" class="external free" title="http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=1" rel="nofollow">http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=1</a></p>

<dd>A precursor to that report was in the encyclopedia a while back, but I removed it. One of the problems was that there was no clear point made by referencing the report. The report's main purpose seems to be collect data about anti-semitism, but it is the first study of its kind, so it cannot be used to prove an increase or decrease in anti-semitism (since no baseline exists).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the links to anti-zionism, this is already explored in the encyclopedia. The report does not add anything, as it mirrors what is already under discussion. Basically, anti-zionism is not regarded as anti-semitism, unless "Israel is seen as being representative of 'the Jew'". That is so obvious and non-commital that it can be accepted by the groups who push 'new anti-semitism' and those who are against the use of the term. The difference between the groups is how easy they blame people for being anti-semitic when Israel is criticized. The report does not dare to take a real standpoint on that matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So concluding, you are free to add the report if you can make a nice story around it. For instance, I see a good story in the report's conclusions that the perpetrators of hostility against Jews are now often Muslims (where it used to be the extreme right) and that the situation in the Middle East is a strong influence (perception of Israel as hurting Muslims leads to anti-semitism, since Israel is considered to be 'Jewish'). --Wfzelle 15:36, 12 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed this new paragraph from an anonymous user, and would like to explain why. This paragraph is from a Christian group that i attempting to convert Jews away from Judaism, and into a fundamentalist form of Christianity. A very large percent of Jews see these "messainic Jewish" groups as subtly anti-semitic themselves, even if members of these groups do not. Most Jews, even secular Jews, bristle at their theology and beliefs - which teach that all adherents of Judaism will burn forever in hell unless they renounce their traditional faith and accept Jesus as their messiah. Rightly or wrongly, Jews who hear this view are angered and offended, and will react with hostility. For Jewish readers, seeing members of such a group weigh in on anti-Semitism is a deliberate insult. (Many liberal Christians and Catholics also do not like such groups, for other reasons: While they agree with Christianity, they see messianic Judaism as false advertising in the name of Jesus.) Given the hundreds of other authorities we can quote, both Christian and Jewish, I see no need to quote this figure in the article, as I suspect it will cause multiple flame-wars. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>Messianic Renewed Rebbe <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julio_Dam_371b.html" title="Julio Dam">Julio Dam</a> defines anti-Semitism in light of its <b>spiritual</b> origins thus: "It is the demonization of the Jews and their religion by ha satan, so that their conexion with the only true Elohim/"God" cannot be pursued. This was especially done in such a way so that the early followers of the Jewish Messianic newly found faith because they could not accept joining a Jewish movement such as Messianic Judaism, led by the Rebbe Yeshuah in the first Century of our Era.Thus was Christianity first unofficially founded by the "Fathers of the Church," all of them furious anti-Semites, which led to the founding, in 321, of the Roman Catholic Church. What Rebbe Dam calls "the FIRST Reformation, that of Luther´s, did not diminish in any way anti-Semitism, but only continued its long and painful (for the Jews) His-story.</p>

<dd>I see, then you have a good reason to edit this article. You also forgot the wells poisoning and using DU bullets. Last time I checked, Arabs in Israel prosper and enjoy all freedoms of democracy, unlike Jews in Muslim countries (about a million in 1948, almost non-existent today). Blaming those mean Jews for Arab rejection of every one of numerous partition plans, or for winning existential wars waged against Israel or for not absorbing hostile population is misleading. Curiously, at the same time Jews are being accused in having victimhood mentality, or being overly sensitive.

<dd>The issue is far more complex, Mustafaa. Just who "exiled" the Palestinians, and whether or not it was "their" land or "stolen" are hotly debated, and central to the issue. As for the question of "return", the vast majority of the Palestinians still live in "Palestine", and the vast majority who wish to "return" to the State of Israel have never lived there. As I said, the issue is far more complex than the shouted slogans would have one believe. Not that the debate is overwhelmingly relevant to an article on anti-Semitism, except perhaps as a putative cause for it.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 18:30, 9 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have considereably reworked parts of this article. To begin with, I substituted inflammatory language like "hatred" and "contempt" with the more neutral "prejudice". I also removed the two quotes in the intro. "An encyclopedia article is a work of synthesis, not regurgitating raw source materials" (who said that?). Quotes are useful for representing specific POVs, which in this case is not the case. I also merged the Roots of Anti-Semitism and Background of Anti-Semitism sections and adjusted the section hierarchy somewhat. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 10:03, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Simonides keeps deleting sources and facts which back up the claims in this article, and then he makes polemical remarks about howthe resurgence of anti-Semitism is untrue and baseless. Well of course the article may appear baseless if he keeps deleting all the source material and references. But he is the one doing the censoring! Unless he wishes to accuse the EU, the Secretary General of the UN, all of he recently cited authors, and the ADL all of conspiring to lie about this rise in anti-Semitic activity, we can only conclude that he is a crank trying to make it look like Jews are liars.

<dd>I mostly agree with RK on this point. Regardless of whether or not there is a resurgence of anti-Semitism, it's been widely reported that some people allege there is, so we of course should report that as well. Perhaps Wikipedia should not say "there has been a rise in anti-Semitism", but we should certainly say something like "Several groups have noted a rise in anti-Semitism, among them [blah blah], who say, 'blah blah' [1]".

<dd>Delirium, our rather over-sensitive friend is prone to exaggeration, to put it mildly. Why don't you check the differences between RK's version of the article and mine, and report back to me on what is being ignored - (a quote by a talk-show host, which hardly counts for objective and authoritative opinion, and a second quote from Cotler's article in <i>FrontPageMag</i> (heh) which repeats the earlier quote that is also linked) - and let me know which version is closer to factual accuracy and NPOV. I did not notice the links RK added later, so their removal was an honest mistake, but most of his "information" is not objectively and independently verifiable; not to mention I had to make corrections to his own links, dates and names. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 07:27, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A number of political and social leaders in the European Union have become concerned with the new wave of anti-Semitism that is sweeping over Europe. As such, a report on this phenomenon was written at the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism, at the Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. This report was written on behalf of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC.) The February 2003 version of this report is available online</p>

<dd>Calling anything that doesn't suit your POV censorship is a tired old canard. For anyone who is interested, please look at the edits made and the context for these changes, instead of listening to these hysterical yarns - I don't enjoy wasting my time on defending myself against outright lies, but this is for the benefit of observers. 1) The report was not removed, but balanced by reports which are contrary or provide balance to the article - there is, after all, no statistical data in the report, and the only statistical study made contradicts its conclusions - I suppose that makes the study "anti-Semitic" in RK's view; 2) the books RK mentions are all polemical, not factual, and I changed the passage to read that both those kinds of books and works opposing their views were frequently published. The titles removed are not "sources" because they are not factual works, just rants - look up the titles in a bookstore or on Amazon. 3) I removed the Annan statement because it is not based on any actual data - Annan and other politicians mention a new issue everyday, and one can't take them at their word because there is usually a motivation for such speeches, such as calming or escalating conflict for political ends; besides, there are already several quotes which say exactly the same thing, so why do we need more than one example of the same view? 3) When RK said he was reverting my article yesterday, I thought he simply replaced it with the old one, so I replaced it with mine again; I did not check to see whether he added new links, and deleting those was a mistake - he is welcome to have them on the page, and they are now. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 22:04, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

A source is something credible, not a random quote; if you want to quote, the quote should be backed up by data or contain a widely accepted point of view.

<p>What research groups have presented evidence that back up any of Simonides' claims? He provides none. What scholarly sources does he have? He shows us none. Who is accusing UN Secretary General and the European Union of lying? Simonides doesn't say. He just keeps on accusing the Jews (whom he refers to a "special interest groups") of lying. That isn't scholarship. Its just the same old anti-Semitic conspiracy theories we always see. Simonides is saying that "the special interests" (i.e. the Jews) have conspired to control the statements of the UN and the European Union, and of the many scholars who have documented this phenomenon. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 16:56, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no evidence for your claims, so I did not "claim" anything, I merely stated so. I did not say the Jews were special-interest groups - that's your usual paranoic interpretation, and if you want to stick to it, fine, but again, don't confuse opinion with fact. There are no actual scholarly documents for your claim, and for those that pretend to be scholarly, there are equally scholarly rebuttals, which deserve to be mention - the latter is called NPOV, not a willful omission of facts. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 22:04, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simonides is right on track. An article by BRIAN KLUG in the February 2, 2004, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nation_3a20.html" title="The Nation">The Nation</a>, "The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism" <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, deflated these tired arguments. Yep, a growing number of people around the world are criticial of Israel and oppose its policies towards the Palestinians. Nope, this not anti-Semitism, but the distinction is probably lost on the zealots here. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 18:35, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Viajero, I am trying to figure out how you couldbe confused. Please re-read the article. <b>Simonides deleted multiple sources, then claimed that these sources do not exist</b>. Without any exagerration, this behaviour is called "Lying to one's face", and is one of the definitions of trolling. Also, you seem very confused about that one magazine article. Let me enlighten you: Any person can make up any half-truths they want in a amagazine article, but this one man's view does not dispute any of the statistics and events described in the many sources this article once provided. Are you saying that one can rewrite history by deleting sources?! <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:13, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, this article is <i>not</i> about the policies of Israel towards Palestinians; I have no idea why you bring this up. The problem here was Simonides' repeated vandalism, and his conspiracy theory about "special interests", i.e. the Jews. Yet you are responding to statements that no one here is making, and issues that have nothing to do with this article's topic. If you want to issue polemics about the Jews and Palestinians, please do so elsewhere; your personal anger at Israel is off-topic for this discussion. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:13, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Viajero misunderstands the issue, which is NPOV. Yes, some people consider it a form of, or motivated by, anti-semitism. Others don't. It is not our task to say who is right. It is our task to provide both points of view. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<dd>We can't present <b>any</b> points of view if Simonides keeps deleting all the sources documenting an acutal phenomeon (attacks on Jews, synagogues being burned, cemetaries being desecrated, death threats, etc.) and then denies that such sources exist. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:13, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does Viajero misunderstand the issue or have you failed to follow the edits? I am the one trying to provide both points of view - this article almost only has one point of view, and RK considers anything else anti-Semitic. Apparently he has a long history of killing time in this manner, but I am not interested enough in this debate to justify myself at every turn, so I don't wish to add anymore to the discussion - I have requested a comment from sysops. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 22:04, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is totally untrue; <i>I never said any such thing</i>. Presenting other points of view has never been a problem. Please, if you have some academic sources which analyze the same data yet offer differing conclusions, please mention them. But you haven't. The only problem here is that you keep deleting sources, then claiming that no sources exist, and then claimed that "the special interests" (i.e. the Jews) were frabricating all this data for their own purposes. Your non-stop anti-Jewish conspiracy theories are a violation of Wikipedia etiquette and of our NPOV policy. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 01:06, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps irony escapes you, RK, as does much else - I posted data (the only real data in the section, in fact) stating that anti-Semitism may actually be in decline, but you have just deleted it. In any case, you haven't addressed any of my points and there does not much point in discussing anything with you since you are convinced I am anti-Semitic; so I will just revert your edit. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:38, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
