<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Trollope_d6f7.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Anthony Trollope's father, Thomas Anthony Trollope, worked as a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrister.html" title="Barrister">barrister</a>. Thomas Trollope, though a clever and well-educated man and a Fellow of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_College%2C_Oxford_e952.html" title="New College, Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, failed at the bar due to his bad temper. In addition, his ventures into farming proved unprofitable and he lost an expected inheritance when an elderly uncle married and had children. Nonetheless, he came from a genteel background, with connections to the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landed_gentry.html" title="Landed gentry">landed gentry</a>, and so wished to educate his sons as <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentlemen.html" title="Gentlemen">gentlemen</a> and for them to attend <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. The disparity between his family's social background and its poverty would be the cause of much misery to Anthony Trollope during his boyhood.</p>
<p>Born in London, Anthony attended <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow_School_01a8.html" title="Harrow School">Harrow School</a> as a <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_pupil.html" title="Day pupil">day-boy</a> for three years from the age of seven, as his father's farm lay in that neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school, he followed his father and two older brothers to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_College_f4f0.html" title="Winchester College">Winchester College</a>, where he remained for three years. He returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce the cost of his education. Trollope had some very miserable experiences at these two <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_schools.html" title="Public schools">public schools</a>. They ranked as two of the most élite schools in England, but Trollope had no money and no friends, and got bullied a great deal. At the age of twelve, he fantasized about suicide. However, he also daydreamed, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds.</p>
<p>In 1827, his mother <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Trollope_694a.html" title="Frances Trollope">Frances Trollope</a> moved to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">America</a> with Trollope's three younger siblings, where she opened a bazaar in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati.html" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, which proved unsuccessful. Thomas Trollope joined them for a short time before returning to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father's affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and fled in 1834 to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruges.html" title="Bruges">Bruges</a>, where they lived entirely on Frances's earnings. In 1835, Thomas Trollope died.</p>
<p>While living in Belgium, Anthony worked as a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classics.html" title="Classics">Classics</a> usher (a junior or assistant teacher) in a school with a view to learning <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>, so that he could take up a promised <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioned_officer.html" title="Commissioned officer">commission</a> in an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> cavalry regiment, which had to be cut short at six weeks. He then obtained a position as a civil servant in the British <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Office_4bd6.html" title="Post Office">Post Office</a> through one of his mother's family connections, and returned to London on his own. This provided a respectable, gentlemanly occupation, but not a well-paid one.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Trollope_d6f7.html" title="Edit section: Time in Ireland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Time in Ireland</span></h3>
<p>Trollope lived in <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_house.html" title="Boarding house">boarding houses</a> and remained socially awkward; he referred to this as his "hobbledehoyhood". He made little progress in his career until the Post Office sent him to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1841. He married an Englishwoman named Rose Heseltine in 1844. They lived in Ireland until 1859 when they moved back to England. Despite the calamity of the famine in Ireland, Trollope wrote of his time in Ireland in his autobiography:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It was altogether a very jolly life that I led in Ireland. The Irish people did not murder me, nor did they even break my head. I soon found them to be good-humoured, clever - the working classes very much more intelligent than those of England - economical and hospitable."</dd>
</dl>
<p>His professional role as a post-office surveyor brought him into contact with Irish people.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Trollope began writing on the numerous long train trips around Ireland he had to take to carry out his postal duties. Setting very firm goals about how much he would write each day, he eventually became one of the most prolific writers of all time. He wrote his earliest <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novels</a> while working as a Post Office inspector, occasionally dipping into the "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_letter.html#Mail" title="Dead letter">lost-letter</a>" box for ideas. Significantly, many of his earliest novels have Ireland as their setting — natural enough given his background, but unlikely to enjoy warm critical reception, given the contemporary English attitudes towards Ireland.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Trollope_d6f7.html" title="Edit section: Return to England">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to England</span></h3>
<p>By the mid-<a href="../../../1/8/6/1860s.html" title="1860s">1860s</a>, Trollope had reached a fairly senior position within the Post Office hierarchy. Postal history credits him with introducing the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillar_box.html" title="Pillar box">pillar box</a> (the ubiquitous bright red <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail.html" title="Mail">mail</a>-box) in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a>. He had by this time also started to earn a substantial income from his novels. He had overcome the awkwardness of his youth, made good friends in literary circles, and hunted enthusiastically.</p>
<p>He left the Post Office in 1867 to run for <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> as a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> candidate in 1868. After he lost, he concentrated entirely on his literary <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career.html" title="Career">career</a>. While continuing to produce novels rapidly, he also edited the <i>St Paul's Magazine</i>, which published several of his novels in serial form.</p>
<p>His first major success came with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Warden_ed53.html" title="The Warden">The Warden</a></i> (1855) — the first of six novels set in the fictional <a href="../../../c/o/u/County.html" title="County">county</a> of "Barsetshire" (often collectively referred to as the <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronicles_of_Barsetshire_ec5e.html" title="Chronicles of Barsetshire">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a></i>), usually dealing with the clergy. The comic masterpiece <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barchester_Towers_3bf3.html" title="Barchester Towers">Barchester Towers</a></i> (1857) has probably become the best-known of these. Trollope's other major series, the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palliser_novels.html" title="Palliser novels">Palliser novels</a>, concerned itself with politics, with the wealthy, industrious <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenet_Palliser_0485.html" title="Plantagenet Palliser">Plantagenet Palliser</a> and his delightfully spontaneous, even richer wife Lady Glencora usually featuring prominently (although, as with the Barsetshire series, many other well-developed characters populated each novel).</p>
<p>Trollope's popularity and critical success diminished in his later years, but he continued to write prolifically, and some of his later novels have acquired a good reputation. In particular, critics generally acknowledge the sweeping satire <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Way_We_Live_Now_4e5b.html" title="The Way We Live Now">The Way We Live Now</a></i> (1875) as his masterpiece. In all, Trollope wrote forty-seven novels, as well as dozens of short stories and a few books on travel.</p>
<p>Anthony Trollope died in London in 1882. His grave stands in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensal_Green_Cemetery_1cbb.html" title="Kensal Green Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>, near that of his contemporary <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilkie_Collins_9173.html" title="Wilkie Collins">Wilkie Collins</a>. <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._P._Snow_6642.html" title="C. P. Snow">C. P. Snow</a> wrote a biography of Trollope, published in 1975, called <i>Trollope: His Life and Art</i>.</p>

<p>After his death, Trollope's <i>Autobiography</i> appeared. Trollope's downfall in the eyes of the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output (and the same went for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>), but when Trollope revealed that he actually adhered to a definite schedule, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. The <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muse.html#Function_in_literature" title="Muse">Muse</a>, in their view, <i>might</i> prove immensely prolific for Trollope, but she would never ever adhere to a schedule. (Interestingly, no-one has decried <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustave_Flaubert_5d09.html" title="Gustave Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> for diligence, though he too worked on a schedule-scheme similar to Trollope's.) Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false and foolish. The Muse, claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_James_3a8a.html" title="Henry James">Henry James</a> expressed mixed opinions of Trollope. The young James wrote some scathing reviews of Trollope's novels (<i>The Belton Estate</i>, for instance, he called "a stupid book, without a single thought or idea in it ... a sort of mental <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pabulum.html" title="Pabulum">pabulum</a>"). He also made it clear that he disliked Trollope's narrative method; Trollope's cheerful interpolations into his novels about how his storylines could take any twist their author wanted did not appeal to James' sense of artistic integrity. However, James thoroughly appreciated Trollope's attention to realistic detail, as he wrote in an essay shortly after the novelist's death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"His [Trollope's] great, his incontestable merit, was a complete appreciation of the usual...he <i>felt</i> all daily and immediate things as well as saw them; felt them in a simple, direct, salubrious way, with their sadness, their gladness, their charm, their comicality, all their obvious and measurable meanings...Trollope will remain one of the most trustworthy, though not one of the most eloquent of writers who have helped the heart of man to know itself...A race is fortunate when it has a good deal of the sort of imagination — of imaginative feeling — that had fallen to the share of Anthony Trollope; and in this possession our English race is not poor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James disliked Trollope's <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">breaking the fourth wall</a> in addressing readers directly. However, Trollope may have had some influence on James's own work; the earlier novelist's treatment of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a> tensions, especially between fathers and daughters, may resonate in some of James' novels. For instance, Alice Vavasor and her selfish father in the first of the so-called <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palliser_novels.html" title="Palliser novels">Palliser novels</a>, <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Can_You_Forgive_Her__1e7d.html" title="Can You Forgive Her?">Can You Forgive Her?</a></i>, may pre-figure Kate Croy and her own insufferable father, Lionel, in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wings_of_the_Dove_f68e.html" title="The Wings of the Dove">The Wings of the Dove</a></i>.</p>
<p>Writers such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thackeray_46e1.html" title="William Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Eliot_fae2.html" title="George Eliot">Eliot</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilkie_Collins_9173.html" title="Wilkie Collins">Collins</a> admired and befriended Trollope, and George Eliot noted that she could not have embarked on so ambitious a project as <i><a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlemarch.html" title="Middlemarch">Middlemarch</a></i> without the precedent set by Trollope in his own novels of the fictional — yet thoroughly alive — county of Barsetshire.</p>
<p>As trends in the world of the novel moved increasingly towards subjectivity and artistic experimentation, Trollope's standing with critics suffered. In the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, Trollopians made attempts to resurrect his reputation; he enjoyed a critical Renaissance in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, and again in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>. Some critics today have a particular interest in Trollope's portrayal of women — he caused remark even in his own day for his remarkable insight and sensitivity to the inner conflicts caused by the position of women in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> society.</p>
<p>A Trollope Society flourishes in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, as does its sister society in the United States.</p>
