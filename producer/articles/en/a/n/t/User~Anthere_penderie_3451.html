<p>Hi, I know you guys already gave me permission to use the wikimedia and wikipedia logos to be used on the CVU images. Several users appear to have concers if I actualy got the permission or not. It might be best for you to mention that I/We have permission to use the wikipedia/wikimedia logos on wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification - as I've said, my biggest concern is the use of the logos to suggest that the Foundation is endorsing sockpuppet claims and the like.

<p>So I've been going through the admin list to see if the inactive list needs updating and I am making comments where edit summary use is particularly low. In your case it's only around 10 or 20% percent. Sorry to be a busybody, just that edit summaries are becoming more of a criterion on RfA and it seems only fair to ask current admins to keep up the habit if we're judging potential admins that way.

<p>Salut Florence. Can you have a look at the article and especially the talk page to understand what's really going on there (where one wikipedian are trying to push his way against the will of 4 established one). I made a reference to <a href="http://lmsi.net/article.php3?id_article=413" class="external text" title="http://lmsi.net/article.php3?id_article=413" rel="nofollow">Laurent Mucchielli, the CNRS expert in the field</a> and also to his book from Le Monde Diplomatique.

<p>I'm not sure if we have encountered each other before but I would like to request your opinion. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> and <a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">myself</a> have been discussing the merits of actively <a href="../../../h/i/s/Wikipedia%7EHistorically_Black_College_and_University_recruitment_cde8.html" title="Wikipedia:Historically Black College and University recruitment">recruiting students and faculty</a> from <a href="../../../h/b/c/HBCU_eb84.html" title="HBCU">Historically Black Colleges and Universities</a>. We have identified <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiley_College_c8f6.html" title="Wiley College">Wiley College</a> as an ideal candidate for several reasons: they are the oldest HBCU west of the Mississippi, they have been a pioneer in the usage of computer technology in college education in Texas, and their location allows the outreach to send a representative in person, me. However, I have been putting it off because I realized that it would be odd to walk into Wiley to recruit on behalf of Wikipedia just because Joe and I think its a good idea. I thought it would be best if I consulted Angela, Jimbo and you and see what ya'll think before running off and making an appointment to discuss an outreach. Please respond as soon as you can. Thanks. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 08:42, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The idea is to recruit faculty and students from <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiley_College_c8f6.html" title="Wiley College">Wiley</a> as regular conributors in an attempt to diversify the community and soften our systemic bias. <i>Please see:<a href="../../../h/i/s/Wikipedia%7EHistorically_Black_College_and_University_recruitment_cde8.html" title="Wikipedia:Historically Black College and University recruitment">Wikipedia:Historically Black College and University recruitment</a></i> I'd write more but I have a class in six hours and no sleep yet. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 09:06, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for you patience. What we would hope to achieve with a meeting is to see if Wiley is interested in encouraging its faculty and students to become regular contributors. Specifics really can't be known until a meeting takes place, e.g. if Wiley would want to do something formal or informal, or even if they are interested at all. My primary reason for requesting your opinion is to see if the outreach might have your support. Without the support of Jimbo, Angela, and yourself I really don’t feel qualified or comfortable meeting with Wiley to ask them to help us recruit new wikipedians from their ranks, as that creates an environment in which I could easily be mistakenly identified as an official representative of Wikipedia. Basically all that I need to know right now is that if I meet with Wiley, may I enjoy your support in that effort and that you will be interested in what Wiley had to say. If you would like more details about the outreach, please read <a href="../../../h/i/s/Wikipedia%7EHistorically_Black_College_and_University_recruitment_cde8.html" title="Wikipedia:Historically Black College and University recruitment">Wikipedia:Historically Black College and University recruitment</a> or contact <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Jmabel</a>, this is really his idea, I’m only helping.

<p>Re: Image:Molsoncentre.jpg. This image was available for free download from the official webpage of the Molson Centre. As the centre has subsequently been renamed the Bell Centre, the original webpage no longer exists. I cannot comment on who the copyright holder is as I have no way of determining.

<p>Hello, Anthere. You don't know me, but I have just seen a message that you wrote to the Christmas Pudding <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristmas_pudding_7de9.html" title="Talk:Christmas pudding">talk page</a> in February of last year, saying that you would love to have a recipe. I just wanted to let you know that I made my puddings today, and took a photo to upload to Wikipedia for the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_pudding.html" title="Christmas pudding">Christmas pudding</a> article, which had some photos that were tagged as having doubtful copyright status.</p>
<p>I don't know if you have found a recipe that you were happy with, but I'm writing to offer you mine. I'm extremely fortunate in having it. An old woman, now dead, who used to teach piano at the school where my father was director, used to make us a delicious pudding every year, and, at my father's request, parted with the recipe. It was far better than the one my mother used to make; it was far better than various puddings I tried from books by famous writers such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delia_Smith_0f79.html" title="Delia Smith">Delia Smith</a>. I began to sell them for charities, and people would sometimes phone me and order more, saying that they were the best Christmas puddings that they had ever tasted. A lot of Christmas puddings are too dark, and are a bit heavy. Mine is light and moist and fruity.</p>
<p>Let me know if you'd like me to e-mail you the recipe, using the link at the left of your user page. I realize, reading this, that it looks a bit like spam, but I assure you, you won't find this message on any other talk pages. I just wrote to you because I saw your message on the Christmas pudding talk page. Also, in the true Wikipedia spirit, I'm not trying to <i>sell</i> the recipe!</p>
<p>By the way, I'm not a professional cook, but it's a hobby that I love. I spent August at the <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Cordon_Bleu_996c.html" title="Le Cordon Bleu">Cordon Bleu School</a> in Paris last year; it was a fantastic experience.</p>

At <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy</a>, a couple users and myself are attempting to gather consensus about a possible change in editing.

<p>Greetings! I hope you're well. As you may be aware, significant discussions are underway (including prior polls) regarding the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_fb11.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006">upcoming Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) elections</a>. As a result of the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Straw_poll_4c77.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Straw poll">recent poll</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_fec6.html#Election_procedure" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005">Jimbo has indicated</a> that we should proceed with a hybrid voting/nomination process that garnered a <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plurality.html" title="Plurality">plurality</a> of support in the poll.</p>
<p>As a political animal and committed Wikipedian, I have taken an active interest in this issue and in ensuring an effective process this year. To that end, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_3e6f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005">a number of Wikipedians have had additional discussions</a> and developed a provisional ruleset to give form and detail to this year's process (we've also designed a <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Vote_e7f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Vote">provisional vote page template</a>). While <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is neither a democracy nor bureaucracy</a>, the ruleset is designed to give the electoral process legitimacy and with the hope of obviating potential challenges and additional <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" rel="nofollow">instruction creep</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">as some would say of last year's election</a>). For instance, a prominent characteristic with political elections is the presence of a neutral, <i>ad hoc</i> body/administrator to ensure elections are conducted properly and fairly.</p>
<p>During our discussions, your name was suggested as an ideal Wikipedian to function as an electoral officer for this process, whom we've entitled the <i>Wikipedia Electoral Officer</i> (<i>WEO</i>). Interested volunteers upon the WEO's approval – e.g., me! – can act to help administrate the WEO's mandate and the many ArbCom candidate pages as <i>Wikipedia Electoral Monitors</i> (<i>WEM</i>s).</p>
<p>Would you be willing and able to function as the WEO and to 'sanction' the rules/process we've developed for the ArbCom election? In any event, would you be able to peruse the ruleset and suggest any process improvements? All of these are works in process (as is Wikipedia), but everything should be fixed prior to the election and once there's agreement and consensus.</p>
<p>Please let me or us know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you so much for your consideration and co-operation, and I hope to work with you in the time ahead! E Pluribus Anthony 11:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again! I hope you're well. Recently, <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (a current ArbCom member who is running for re-election, as you likely know) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AE_Pluribus_Anthony%2FCorpus_callosum%2FElection_rules&amp;diff=31787527&amp;oldid=31780166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AE_Pluribus_Anthony%2FCorpus_callosum%2FElection_rules&amp;diff=31787527&amp;oldid=31780166" rel="nofollow">commented on the proposed ruleset</a> above and indicated that she felt it constituted 'instruction creep' (harking of the comments of one other user) and wasn't derived through consensus. I responded. I'll gladly grant that everything is a work in progress and encourage any and more input from Wikipedians, not less.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Numerous Wikipedians have commented on the talk page and where the rules are being drafted. KM was not among them. Though she participated in <i>prior</i> discussions, it is odd that KM would evince <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> (or perceived lack thereof) at this late juncture when she has not participated <i>at all</i> in current discussions regarding Jimbo's hybrid option (i.e., since Jimbo selected it), nor when developing the ruleset presented (except her only note, prompting this one to you).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe this may be a belated attempt by KM to derail this well-intentioned effort to organise and codify some sort of system (particularly given the pitfalls of last year's process, which I was not involved in). I also believe her recommendations and her contacting you to discuss another approach/advocate – no matter how good-intentioned (and as much as I or others may support <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Ryan_e158.html" title="User:Mark Ryan">User:Mark_Ryan</a>) – constitutes a conflict of interest regarding the ArbCom election process. In the very least, <i>she</i> is acting/recommending without any mandate or consensus regarding the proposed process, not me or my fellow Wikipedians.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will cease and desist completely if you indicate that I should, but again I believe this effort can serve as the basis for a salient and effective improvement for the election process. I look forward to hearing from you, and thanks again for your consideration. E Pluribus Anthony 23:38, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DG – yes: how relevant is this? It was an abortive attempt that I still support, but accepted the decisions of the ArbCom without dispute. Herein: I and others are merely trying to develop a ruleset for an effective process – whatever that is – KM initiated contact with me recently and expressed solitary dissent. Fine, but DG's recollection of this is analogous to other users (for example) dredging up another current Arbitrator's disbarment in public life (and I won't name names), so I believe this is an attempt to obfuscate one prior issue with the current one: to sully the process and to sling mud. Lastly, I'm not running for the ArbCom, so this is unjustified and KM's actions still (IMHO) constitute a conflict of interest. Anthere: please respond when able. Thanks.

<dd>Whether DGs recent diffs are enlightening or merely producing a shadow is an entirely other matter: DG's initial note of my prior unsuccessful ArbCom case is wholly unjustified. I'm just a regular Wikipedian who initiated a case erroneously (and with all the feedback garnered) and has put it behind me. I and others have been long discussing and are <i>attempting</i> to formulate rules and achieve or ID consensus to ensure an effective process (i.e., perhaps not there yet). KM did not comment previously, so I question her approach but not some of her suggestions. Moreover, I believe DG (as an Arbitrator "Away") has entered the field and dealt with this (through his "one explanation") in a <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">dispirited and distasteful manner</a> – a "poison pill."</dd>

<p>Hello again! Have you been able to assimilate or arrive at any decisions regarding the requests above? The natives are getting restless, so to speak: given the timing of the election, I believe this requires your neutral (or similar) leadership. As well, IMHO, the discussion has taken a life of its own and is getting rather circular: too many ArbComm candidates are now commenting when they perhaps shouldn't be and I do not feel I should comment on that much more. And, separately, I'd like for you to weigh in regarding the "poison pill" cited above.</p>
<p>I realise you must be crazy-busy, but your prompt feedback and guidance would be appreciated. Thanks again! E Pluribus Anthony 16:20, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi there. I completely understand: absolutely no problem! There have been some interesting developments (with some rumblings about timing), but there's still no clear plan of attack nor neutral party to lead and move things forward effectively. I'm sure we all look forward to you weighing in and hopefully participating somehow. Thanks again for your attention and consideration ... and happy holidays!&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony 17:11, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I made my userbox like 30 minutes ago and it got deleted with the apparent grounds of me being the only 'contributor'? Considering it's a template I wouldn't expect it to be contributed to very often, if at all. Could you please recreate my userbox?</p>

<p>Look VERY carefully 82. On my user page, there is no userbox. You have no idea what my wikimood is. You have no idea which browser I use. If I could take that decision, I suspect that all userbox unrelated directly to Wikipedia would disappear. In effect, wikipedians mood IS actually important to the community. In effect, which browsers are used is also an interesting information how Wikipedia appears to readers. Which hand is used to masturbate self is of no interest within wikipedia activity, except if you are actually masturbating yourself in writing on a user talk page. In this case, I highly recommand you go to one of the usual porn site as it is more likely to trigger an interesting reaction. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthere</a> 23:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Next time you try to force the french wikipedia to move such pages to meta against their will, you'll be blocked. Each project is free to decide what to do with such pages. Please do not mix with other projects habits. Make the move to meta if you wish, but do NOT impose english habits on other languages (in short, do not impose moving the pages over there).

<dd>I dare you to block me for that, I merely tried to unite interwiki communities on a bold attempt.

<dd>you can not unite communities in forcing them to move to another place where the language is essentially english. Which most do not speak. That makes no sense. I do not complain about you trying, I complain about the answers you gave to those non-english complaining of your bold move on your talk page and I complain about you reverting back when local communities opposed the move and reverted what you did. This is the problem, not the bold attempt. You must be aware that non english communities do not have the same rules than the english communities and that this MUST be taken into account and respected as long as it is not hurting the project. Typically, having community pages on local projects is a local decision to be respected. Forcing them to follow english rules is plain non acceptable. If they like the rules, they will adopt them themselves, or they will accept your bold moves. But if they revert your changes, you MUST accept that, with a smile. So, I repeat, on the french project, which is MY community, I can tell you this will not be acceptable. And we do not have to justify this. You do not UNITE people in imposing them your own rules of organisation. Please understand that. There are many things to do on meta, but sorry, not this. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthere</a> 22:32, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not forcing anyone to do anything. I only made an effort to convince people, that's called persuation. I only reverted a nl wikipedian reverting me on practicaly on all other languages and I only reverted him once on each. The "Nl guy" decided for the local comunities including en.wikipedia. I did absolutely nothing wrong for pushing the matter untill people at local comunities decide.</dd>
<dd>META is NOT english only. Thats like saying commons is english. Also pages I moved to meta were identical copies of the pages on every language wiki.</dd>
<dd>I blanked pages to take the attention of the local comunities. Never the less you threat worked! Farewell. I shall not be a part of a comunity that threatens me with blocks over two edits. MARMOT is given greater tolerance and I was not even vandalising. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 13:51, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I still <b>dare</b> you to block me. See blocking policy for christ sake, you cannot threaten random people with blocks whenever you feel like it. I havent even violated 3rr on any of the language wikis (assuming they have a policy such as 3rr). I am highly disapointed given you are a board member that should know better.

<dd>This was not an iddle threat. You do not even know that 3RR is a rule of the english wikipedia. I think this is a point enough. For the rest of it, I'll let your comments stand. I stick to my opinion. Even if that means I am less tolerant than Marmot. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthere</a> 21:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Surely if a nl guy was wikistalking Cool Cat through different languages this should be something we frown upon, Anthere? Sorry for meddling, but if what Cool Cat says is correct, this is a cause for concern. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 15:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No you got it all wrong. Marmot is not the tollerant one, Marmot is the one being tollerated and he writes vandalism bots unlike me who is been threatened with blocks for making 2 edits on fr.wikipedia. What you are saying is you prefer people writing vandalism bots over bold users (I wouldn call 2 edits I made as "bold"). In fact I am suprised you dont know about MARMOT.</dd>
<dd>I do know 3rr applies to en.wikipedia (and MAYBE other wikipedias). I also know every wikipedia has their rules ranging from wikipedia policies to how copyrights are handled. Don't treat me like a newbie. This is never the less is en.wikipedia and anything happening in Fr.wikipedia is not in anyway of en.wikipedias concern and you are conflicting yourself.</dd>
<dd>This raises an interesting question: "Whose policies are you enforcing?" also "Which policy are you enforcing?". When threatening me with blocks are you wearing your "fr.wikipedia" hat or "en.wikikpedia" hat? I can basicaly cause havoc on fr.wikipedia at my whim which cannot in anyway affect my en.wikipedia experience in any way. I have no reason to do that since I am not a malicious user even though you treat me worse than how malicious users (ex:<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARMOT_55be.html" title="User:MARMOT">User:MARMOT</a> who recieved Jimbos personal grace) are treated.
<dl>
<dd>I have never threatened to block you on en.wiki&#160;! What you do here is your own business. However, yes, I indeed say that should you try to impose again to the french community any decision you take *alone*, yes, you could end up blocked. Because blanking pages repeatedly for no reason or for a reason the french community will not recognise valid is bordering vandalism action. If any *stranger* of the english community came today here and decided on his own, to move the arbcom pages to meta and to blank the relevant pages here, I am pretty sure he will be blocked in NO time. I will not try it to make my point, but I am completely convinced nevertheless. And I think that the french community would do the same thing to protect itself from an outsider. This is the basic of wiki. People can try to be bold. But if the community is not happy with the boldness, the community will either protect the page or block the outsider. And the outsider can always afterwards try to screen "sysop abuse", or play Calimero as much as he feels like it, it will be correct that he is blocked, because it is the way wikipedia has always protected herself. So, now, take it the way you want. Do it again, but if you get blocked (by anyone, not only by me), do not come crying that the so-bad french admins blocked you, You would have deserved the block. OR, listen to what I suggest and do not impose your views on other communities you do not belong to. Suit yourself. I just wish you try to *read* what I am trying to tell you rather than pleasantly repeating to yourself that you are such a poor sad lonely cowboy. Get real CoolCat.</dd>

<dd>This conversation has been most disgusting and I am walking away from it. I will not run around screeming "admin abuse" nor will I take any of the threats here seriously as they neither have any policy or logical basis. Also I do not see how your threats poised at me making wikipedia a better encyclopedia. Fr.wikipedia is not any special wikipedia. It is just another wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Hi Anthere. I'm one of Cool Cat's mentors appointed by the Arbitration Committee on English Wikipedia. I'm advising Cool Cat not to meddle with thecontent of other Wikipedias, and instead to put notes, in local languages where possible, on the talk pages of the relevant articles pointing out the existence of the copies on meta and leaving it to local policy to decide whether to redirect or to keep the local copy.</dd>
