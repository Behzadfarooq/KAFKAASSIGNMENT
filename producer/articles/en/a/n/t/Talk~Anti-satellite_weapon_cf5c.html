<p>I suppose it would be off-topic to discuss the hazards of anti-satellite weapons such as the EMP shockwave amplified by the atmosphere (in greater detail) when using nuclear weapons in near-Earth space, or the plume of debris left by exploding missile shells and their targets left in orbit. I'd like to hear other peoples' view, though, because it's a bit of a reach. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanhahn_678f.html" title="User:Oceanhahn">Oceanhahn</a> 10:53, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is some discussion at <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_altitude_nuclear_explosion.html" title="High altitude nuclear explosion">High altitude nuclear explosion</a> about using nuclear weapons in space. In all, it's not especially dangerous to those of us on the ground. I suppose the altitude of the satellite in question is important, but really, the radiation, and certainly not any of the other blast effects, aren't going to reach us. Satellite chunks falling from the sky are problematic, but most satellites are less than a ton or two and wouldn't provide much of a problem. They'd break up into much smaller pieces on reentry, and are of course only 30% likely to hit land. Debris in orbit is much more of a problem, of course, but near earth orbit is chock full of debris anyways. One satellite isn't going to pose a great threat to anyone. If there were a sustained campaign against satellites, there would be far greater havoc on the ground than in orbit. Remember also that the debris itself is subject to reentry. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 19:48, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was also a Russian equivalent of ASAT being developed in late 80s till mid 90s, this was using a mofified MiG-31 (MiG-31D to be exact) with a Vympel developed missile - I have the designation somewhere but would have to find it. The project was initially abandoned in early 90s but resurrected around 2000 with commercial satellite launches in mind this time. Note that the system was intended to be used against LEO satellites as the missile mass was significantly below US ASAT. The program has apparently now been restarted post treaty demise. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.112.30.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.30.77_e687.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.30.77">contribs</a>) May 11, 2006.</small></p>

<p>Um why? Until they would use laser, or shoot down another satellite, short notice with altitude in km/m, and description of orbit suffice. It would be also nice a link to the missile they used. Raghar 03:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The new section on the Chinese missile launch suffers from <a href="../../../r/e/c/WP%7ERECENT_2836.html" title="WP:RECENT">recentism</a>. There is nothing historically important in this launching, in relevance to this article. The technology and capabilities have been around for 20 years. It does not warrant it's own section. Significant enough to add to the article? Yes! Significant for its own separate section? No! Do not be so quick to justify its notability simply due to a news-crazed and sensationalistic network trying to catch viewers. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 01:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's shocking because the US will now develop their own space weapons. Actually US was already developing space based weapons. In any case, things will be quite interesting in the coming years for sure.</p>
<dl>
<dd>there is at least 2 active US space weapon program (both by lockheed martin) at the time of china's ASAT test. US had and are developing space weapon(or defenses as they put it) so what china did was just being the 1st to lanuch a test in 21st century; in PRC opinion, it might have seen US and Russia had already demostrated their capability, hence they were just playing catch up to show they are "up there" with the leading nations. on defensenews, an analyst opinioned that the GPS is quite safe from this ASAT since there are backup system and they operate very far away from earth, and the ASAT china used is design more to take out spysat, such as those ROC-Taiwan is using to spy on China. as there is usually no redundancy spysat to get back online quickly, it could have a serious effect on intelligence during short hostility. i agree on it being sensationalized; it is quite a big thing "now", and maybe we can keep it around abit until it settledown.

<dd>Haven't all the US tests been either outright failures or ridiculous charades, with the targets emitting homing signals rather than counter-measures? Isn't hitting a real target more than the USA has managed during the last 24 years? If so, I think that would make the Chinese efforts notable. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 10:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually both the USA and Russia have successfully done the same thing China did, except they did it over 20 years ago. One reason (I would argue the main reason) they stopped was because of the space pollution it caused. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 23:26, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
