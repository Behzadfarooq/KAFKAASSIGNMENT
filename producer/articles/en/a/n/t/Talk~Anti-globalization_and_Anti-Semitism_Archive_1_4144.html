<p>Christiaan, if you want to place the POV tag on the article, could you say here which specific points need to be addressed to make it NPOV? If you don't make specific, addressable points, the tag is being misused. I'd also like to note here for the record that Christiaan is going around deleting links to this article on relevant talk pages, perhaps in order to show that, because it links nowhere, it deserves to be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:10, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly am deleting links. I'd like to note here for the record that SlimVirgin is going around slapping links to this POV fork perhaps in a concerted effort to justify the article which is little more than an effort to discredit leftists. The whole article is pretty much worthless, and anything of remote interest can easily be covered in in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalisation.html" title="Anti-globalisation">Anti-globalisation</a>. —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 22:16, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is very far from being a worthless article, and if you would read the references, you'd see that it is legitimate. The article has not been deleted, so don't act as though it has been, or as though it's a foregone conclusion, and do NOT delete any more of my edits, or I'll report you for vandalism and violation of 3RR. If you have addressable concerns about this article, please address them here; otherwise you are simply misuing the POV tag. Note: I want this article to be NPOV just as much as you do. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:21, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Then we are on total disagreement. As I said anything remotely of interest in this POV fork can be covered in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalisation.html" title="Anti-globalisation">Anti-globalisation</a>. —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 22:27, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Christiaan, this is a new article, and the POV tag we're discussing is here not on some other article, so <i>this</i> is the talk page to raise your concerns. As you know, I've not been involved in this before; therefore, please say here what your addressable concerns are regarding NPOV, so that we can work to address them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:36, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My concerns are not addressable by tinkering with this POV fork, it is inherently POV, which is why I have voted for it to be deleted. —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 22:39, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's fully referenced, and the references are to mainstream, credible sources, such as an article reproduced on a website run by <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>. <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791" class="external autonumber" title="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> If you would actually read the references, you'd see that commentators on the left and right express concerns about anti-Semitism within this movement; as such, it is very obviously a legitimate, non-partisan subject. Below are the reversions you and a number of other editors made in an effort to keep the material out of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> and even to keep out a link to this article. That is clearly POV-pushing, and it isn't acceptable. If you have material you'd like to add to this to make it, in your view, NPOV, please do so; but if you don't offer some addressable concerns here, you're misusing the POV tag. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:39, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a little challenge for you SlimVirgin. Please point out any edit of mine that that does anything apart from remove a link to this POV fork. After that, you might like to apoligise for your concerted effort to try and paint me as someone pushing a POV. You seem to have a real habit of labelling your political opponents. —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 23:55, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not going to get into a fight with you over this. Our energy would be better expended in trying to improve the article: I've done something to try to improve it today so perhaps you could do likewise. In the meantime, please list your addressable objections on this talk page. As <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El C</a> points out on your talk page, it's a little odd to have a POV tag that directs the reader to this talk page, when in fact, there's no relevant discussion here. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:03, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see nowhere on this talk page any justification for the <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> tag. I do not have any problem with users adding the tag but I don't like it when users assume we are mind readers. Even if it is obvious why the article is <a href="../../../p/o/v/Pov.html" title="Pov">pov</a> other users should not be forced to read the entire article. It is basic couracy to assume that an article that is marked as <a href="../../../p/o/v/Pov.html" title="Pov">pov</a> has the potential to be fixed until such a time as it is deleted! Just write a breif paragraph explaining what it would require to make the article <a href="../../../p/o/v/Pov.html" title="Pov">pov</a> or why you don't think it is possible. If a specific phrase or paragraph strikes you as biased, please point that out here too. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 02:11, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also haven't seen any argument as to why this article is inherently POV. I'd agree if it was a tiny-minority opinion, but it seems to be of sufficient concern to be discussed by journalists and writers on the left and on the right; and has also been talked about by Naomi Klein, a leading member of the anti-globalization movement. She denies that the movement is anti-Semitic, but her comments indicate that she understands why the label sticks and that the movement isn't doing enough to shed it. That mixture of partisan and non-partisan interest in this topic makes it a legitimate topic for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:17, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would agree with <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> on this. I make a similiar argument in favour of the article Circumcision and Anti-semitism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opening paragraph is POV</span></h2>
<p>Here is the current opening paragraph of this article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Opponents and supporters of the anti-globalization movement have expressed concerned over what they see as the rising acceptance of anti-Semitism within the movement.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As someone who has been involved in the anti-globalization movement for many years, I certainly have never heard a supporter expressing concern over the <i>acceptance</i> of anti-Semitism within the movement. I'm rather outraged and appalled at the suggestion, as would be my many Jewish friends in the movement. In all my years I have never witnessed any <i>acceptance</i> of anti-Semitism in any anti-globalization organization. Quite the contrary. Anti-Semetism is absolutely not accepted by any mainstrean anti-globalization groups. I'm sure there are fringe anti-Semetic groups and anti-Semetic people who are also anti-globalization, but the movement has certainly never tolerated any expressions of Anti-Semetism. Frankly I find the opening paragraph to be both biased and slanderous and I would challenge whoever claims that it is NPOV to cite references from the left complaining of anti-Semetic acceptance rather than just from the right. Which "supporters" have claimed that there is too much acceptance of anti-Semetism in the anti-globalization movement? There is, after all, a huge difference is stating that "anti-Semetism exists in the movement" vs. "anti-Semetism is accepted in the movement". The word "acceptance" is this context is blatantly POV. Unless someone can back it up with sources from both sides (since it says that both "opponents" and "supporters" are of this opinion), I'm putting a POV tag on this article. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 03:50, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article opens with a quote from Dr. Phyllis Chesler, a feminist activist, who identifies herself with the Left, saying: "[L]eftist anti-Semitism is directly connected to the Left's dedication to anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism and anti-globalization." Naomi Klein, another feminist activist and support of the movement, expresses concern that not enough is being done by the movement to combat the image some have of it as anti-Semitic. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:11, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Phyllis Chesler may be a feminist, but she is certainly not a "supporter" of the anti-globalization movement. She is widely regarded as a Zionist and has often portrayed mere criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism. Her views on this issue would not be indicative of or respected by the mainstream left, regardless of her position on feminist issues. Naomi Klein, on the other hand, is very respected in the anti-globalization movement. I do not see, however, how her statement could be construed as an admission that the globalization movement is too accepting of anti-Semitism. In fact, if you read the entire article the quote is taken from, you'll see she is actually stating the opposite:
<ul>
<li><i>"There is no connection whatsoever between French fascism and the “free Palestine” marchers in Washington"</i> (referring to Jean-Marie Le Pen, the anti-Semitic French politician)</li>
<li><i>"The globalization movement isn’t anti-Semitic"</i></li>
<li><i>"the most powerful images from Saturday’s protests were rabbis walking alongside Palestinians"</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The article is about how a false perception of anti-Semitism has been thrust on the left by certain fear-mongering right-wing politicians, and how the anti-globalization movement should fight especially hard against anti-Semitism in order to counter this propaganda (of which I would include large portions of this article). <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 06:17, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand the juxtaposition of the first two sentences: "she is certainly not a supporter of the anti-globalization movement. She is widely regarded as a Zionist." Are you saying there is a connection? And how do you know whether her views would be supported by the mainstream left, and what <i>is</i> the mainstream left, and in which country? If you've read any of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Cohen_7f7b.html" title="Nick Cohen">Nick Cohen</a>'s work, you'll know that the left in Europe, and particularly in the UK, has been making alliances with the right that ought to be worrying. And Naomi Klein argues that it is "possible to be pro-Palestinian independence without adopting a simplistic pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel dichotomy ..." which implies she believes that's what the anti-globalization movement does. But I can change opponents and supporters to commentators on the left and right, if you prefer, because however you want to characterize her, Phyllis Chesler identifies herself with the left, and she should know. Or perhaps you could make a suggestion for an introduction you'd feel happier with. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:28, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, there is no connection (that I know of) between the fact that Phyllis Chesler is not a supporter of anti-globalization and the fact that she is regarded as a Zionist. The 2nd sentence is an additional supporter of the conclusion made in the 3rd sentence; it is not itself a conclusion drawn from the 1st sentence. Truthfully, I can't say for sure that her views on this issue would not be supported by the mainstream left, or any part of the left, but that doesn't really matter. What matters is that she is most definitely NOT a SUPPORTER of the anti-globalization movement, and thus your use of her statement as an example does not counter my argument. Regarding Naomi Klein's statement that the anti-globalization movement has adopted an "anti-Israel" stance, I would completely agree with that, as would anyone who knows anything about activist politics whatsoever. But, of course, "anti-Israel" doesn't necessarily mean "anti-Semitic". Being anti-Israel, however, can lead to perceptions of anti-Semitism whether or not real anti-Semitism exists or not. This is what she's trying to warn activists about.</dd>
<dd>So, back to my original question: Can you cite <i>supporters</i> of anti-globalization who are concerned that there is too much <i>acceptance</i> of anti-Semitism in the movement? <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 06:49, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Klein is saying more than that. She's implying that the movement has adopted a simplistic pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel position. It is this position (among others) that is interpreted by many as anti-Semitic, and it's not for Wikipedia to argue whether they're right or wrong to interpret it that way, because no one can say what motivates any individual protester (and even the protesters themselves may not know). If you want other names, I can cite former supporters who withdrew their support from the anti-globalization (and anti-war) movement because of the perceived left-right alliance. Or, as I said above, we can change the first sentence to "commentators on the left and on the right"; or rewrite it entirely, which would be my preference. If we were to rewrite it, would you have a suggestion? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:04, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with most of what you have said, but I still don't think the wording of the opening paragraph is verifiable or from a neutral point of view. There are many ways it could be rewritten to improve it. Most critically, I would remove the word "supporters" from the first sentence. The view that anti-Semitism is becoming accepted in the anti-globalization movement is overwhelmingly put forth by opponents of anti-globalization, not supporters. Just do a Google search for <i>anti-globalization</i> and <i>anti-Semitism</i> and see what shows up. Next, I would add a second sentence to the intro paragraph which states the opposing view of the supporters, namely that allegations of anti-Semitism in the anti-globalization movement are exagerrated in order to discredit the movement and deflect criticisms of Israeli policies. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 07:21, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've rewritten the intro and have used "critics" rather than opponents and supporters. This should only be a temporary intro because it isn't strictly true as it stands. Phyllis Chesler, for example, gives the impression that she might have been a supporter were it not for the perceived anti-Semitism; whereas starting with "critics say that" suggests they would have been critics anyway and are making the claims only because they're critics. We'll need much more analysis generally, not just for the intro, but I don't want to put a lot of work into it right now in case it's deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:24, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hang on, hang on. Slim, you seem to me to be pushing the line -- distressingly common these days -- that anti-Zionism is identical with anti-Semitism! You should take care not to fall foul of that yourself. It's fine for the rabid right demagogues to indulge in that nonsense but you should try not to let it infect your editing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should add info on allegations of anti-Semitism as attempt to undermine movement</span></h2>
<p>If this article isn't deleted I think it would be appropriate to add detailed (and cited of course) info on the allegation that claims of anti-Semitism are made against the anti-globalization movement for the sole purpose of discrediting it (labeling something anti-Semitic is a good way of tricking most people into not taking it seriously, the goal for any wikipedia article should be to encourage people to think about the issue for themselves).

<p>On a more fundamental level I think the article should convey the scale of alleged anti-Semitism within the anti-globalization movement, because the article makes it seem rampant with no context. Also, the article should make a large distinction between anti-corporate, pro-nationalist, pro-human rights and many other related movements which have all been lumped together under the term "anti-globalization", this has added to the confusion we currently find ourselves in. Pro-nationalist movements are highly likely to be anti-semitic, but that is unlikely with the pro-human rights movement and some of the other related movements I believe. From the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> article it seems people in the movement actually prefer the term "globalize liberation" which clears up at least some of the confusion.</p>

<dd>Thanks for providing those references, zen master. I'll take a look at them later. One thing I wanted to say: we have to be careful not to use articles to build a case for or against. We can only use arguments that have been published somewhere. It might be best to read through <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> because this is the type of article where it would be easy to fall into original research simply because this is a new phenomenon, or new allegations. We should probably start with a very brief backgrounder on the movement, and then trace how and where the anti-Semitism allegations started. I'm not keen on doing that until the vote's over, because it'll be a lot of work and could end up being deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:24, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>...we have to be careful not to use articles to build a case for or against</i>", I completely agree, that is why I have been trying to fix the titles' of many articles the last few days. Prior to the great edit you made this article didn't even mention the possibility that anti-globalization protesters might be not only anti anti-semitic, but also might have valid criticisms against the government of Israel's policies. Though, the title of this article arguably implies that anti-globalization is rife with anti-semitism which is why i think "allegations" should be added to the title. What specifically have I added to any article that your consider to be original research or was your point a more general one, something to watch out for? In this case, I consider my POV criticism of this article to have been vindicated by the edit you made.

<p>Dbachmann, I think the point of the Sharon-mask reference in the cutline is that it's unclear what Sharon, as an Israeli, has to do with globalization, and therefore unclear why an anti-globalization protestor would focus on him. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:57, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I assumed the description was given by the uploader, my mistake. Still, I don't think this image is a good representation of the correlation between anti-globalization and anti-Semitism. It seems to be presented out of context and without evidence that it actually has anything to do with anti-Semetism. In fact, placing it within the context of this article seems to color its interpretation considerably. Without evidence as to what this image is actually about, it seems disingenuous to ostensibly present it as an example of anti-Semitism. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 19:01, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that it's not ideal. I suppose the intention of the editor who put it there (and that wasn't me) was to question the appropriateness of representing Sharon, or any other Israeli, at an anti-globalization protest, given that Israel has nothing to do with the main issue. If the article survives the VfD, it would make sense to look for a more appropriate photograph, if one exists. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:29, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not just the Sharon mask, but all the imagery. Why would it be necessary at a WEF protest to use this kind of imagery?

<p>I think I can answer SlimVirgin's question about the mask of Sharron:</p>
<ul>
<li>in anti-globalisation-like communities, Sharron is widely percieved as the personification of the oppression of the Palestinians, the butecher of Shabra and Shatila, the man who started the Al-Aqsa Inti-Fada, etc. (the correctness of these points vary, naturaly). He personifies the "dark side" of Israel.</li>
<li>On the other hand, Rumsfeld is considered as one of the masterminds of neo-conservatism, the man who manipulates George Bush, who ploted for the invasion of Iraq since the 90s, who gains unclear personal benefits from the weapon industry, etc. (there again, the correctness of these points vary -- by the way, I do not endorse anything of this, I am only discribing what I have understood).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, no wonder that these personalities are not popular in this middle. Now, the globalisation is often associated with the idea that the USA are pushing for it, that they are perhaps its initiators and that it has a tendency to reinforce the power of the USA. The actual foreign policy of the USA takes, in some places, a violent form. A form which reminds the way that violence rages in Israel (Iraq is often seen as the US version of the Palestinian quagmire). And on the top of this, add the well-know support of the USA for Israel... Also, in this crowds, you will find a lot of idealistic people who will protest against war, for gay rights, refugees or Palestinians in mostly any case. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 20:40, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The photograph shows one star, as far as I have seen, and it is on "Rumsfeld". This can be interpreted in two ways:
<ul>
<li>We have a truely anti-semitic band whose argumentation relies on the idea that the evilness of these two fellows comes from their "jewry". In this optic, Sharron doesn't need to wear a star, since anybody knows he is a Jew, but Rumsfeld must have one, either to expose that he is a Jew (by religion or by "race" (his file on Wikipedia doesn't seem to suggest that he is either)), or to suggest the "jewness" of his actions.</li>
<li>We have a bunch of cretinous protestors who wanted to derisively paint Rumsfeld as a sherrif (the "cow-boy" imagery is popular among people hostile to the USA) and who did not think about what a six-pointed yellow star would look like.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It would be interesting to see where the original caption of the image comes from. If the journalist actually spoke to the protestors or had some way to acertain the intended meaning. In any case, for what I see, there is nothing irremediably anti-semitic in the photograph -- even if the star does indeed look awkard. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 21:03, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rumsfeld is not a Jew, so far as I know. My guess is that the star is exactly what it looks like. We have no reason to make excuses by guessing that they meant a sheriff's star: that's a bit of a stretch, and it's not our place to guess anyway: we can only go by what people say (or draw in this case). Rumsfeld is routinely accused of being a Jewish "lackey" to quote anti-Semitic websites; he's a neocon and all neocons are either Jews or lackeys of Jews. Here's a very typical view from the anti-Semitic side (and this is almost certainly why the star appears in the photograph, though I agree it would be helpful to find the source): "Their Loyalty is to the Six-Pointed Star: The loyalty of the Bush neocon dual loyalists is not to the stars and stripes but to the six-pointed star, better known as Solomon's Seal, the witches hexagram, Rothschild's choice of occultic symbol for the Israeli flag.

<dd>Slim, I think your analysis misses an important point, were someone to say that Rumsfeld is a Jewish "lackey" that does not make them an anti-Semite necessarily (though I agree a true anti-Semite likely has said that), but there is a high degree of probability that the anti-globalization protestor is calling him that because of Rumsfeld's and the U.S.'s unflinching support for the policies of the government of Israel. We need to be very very careful about mingling such concepts. What the article really needs is evidence of <i>mass</i> or even <i>significant</i> true anti-Semitism within the anti-globalization movement. Such a protest can be construed as anti-Semitism I agree (and should be investigated) but it can also be interpreted as a harmless example of someone excersizing their free speech rights by effectively stating that the U.S. does whatever Israel wants it to. It's not clear cut. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:22, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that would make Rumsfeld an Israeli lackey, not a Jewish one, but the former is never heard. I think it's a mistake to try to guess the motives of people expressing anti-Semitic (<i>Judenhass</i> or hatred of Jews) attitudes: their motives may be opposition to Israel, opposition to Zionism, support for the Palestinians, or something else. It becomes <i>Judenhass</i> when a degree of hatred and irrationality is evident, as with all bigotry. Very few racists admit to being such, or form racist intentions; nevertheless, racist <i>behavior</i> and racist <i>effects</i> can be evident, and people belonging to the target race can feel attacked. The intentions of the apparent racists (what is going on inside their heads) are not available to us, and may not even be available to them. We can only study and report <i>behavior</i>. Therefore, having Rumsfeld wear a yellow six-pointed star is behavior, regardless of anyone's intention, that reminds us of the Nazi era, and which seems to single Rumsfeld out because of his perceived connection to or support for a certain ethnicity. It's dangerous and stupid bigotry, as it would be were blacks being singled out, or women, or gays, and it shouldn't be covered up, or allowed to call itself by other names. But nor, of course, should we see it where it doesn't exist.

<dd>Can someone conclusively be a racist if they are, perhaps indirectly, accusing Israel of racism? I suppose that is possible but certainly not the majority of the anti-globalization movement are racist I don't believe. Some consider religious Zionism to be the root of the problem with the government of Israel's policies (apartheid against Palestianians), so in this case religion and governmental policies are overwhelmingly intertwined, which I think you'll agree is unfortunate. The quotation and the photo of the t-shirted protestor are two separate things, let's not commingle them. Here is a similar example to the point I am trying to make: President Bush stated (later retracted) that the War on Terror is a "crusade", by your logic that is literally true and Muslims should be preparing for a Christian invasion? We can't begin to understand the issue without full context, which is exactly the problem we find ourselves in. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 00:12, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone can certainly be a racist while accusing others of racism. I also don't believe that the majority of anti-globalization protesters are racist, but I believe they may (stress: may) be engaging in anti-Semitic, bigoted behavior, regardless of their intentions. It starts as support for the Palestinian people; it becomes opposition to Israel's refusal to withdraw to the pre-67 borders; then it's opposition to the Israeli people's desire to have a Jewish state; then it's opposition to the very existence of Israel; then it's suddenly claiming that Israel is, in fact, in control of the American govt; then it's Zionists who are in control, then it's Jews; and then we're into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> territory, <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_claims_regarding_Jews_or_Israel_189b.html" title="9/11 conspiracy claims regarding Jews or Israel">Jews being text-messaged</a> to get out of the World Trade Center, and how there's no smoke without fire. The morphing happens rapidly: some of the various stages are legitimate, some not, some clearly defined, some not; and the intentions of individual protesters are lost, if they ever knew what their intentions were, because what's happening is essentially <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a>, where all kinds of behaviors are expressed which, at an individual level and with hindsight, might be regretted. But the individual regret doesn't change what was done; if whoever placed the Star of David on Rumsfeld didn't intend to be anti-Semitic, that doesn't make the photograph disappear or make it look less anti-Semitic. An excellent film to watch about this issue is <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoah_%28movie%29.html" title="Shoah (movie)">Shoah (movie)</a> by Claude Lanzmann; hard to watch because it's nine and a half hours and painful, but it shows clearly how, step by tiny step, Germans and Poles took part in the anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust, or at best ignored what was happening around them. There have been very few truly evil individuals like Hitler: most of the evil in the world is carried out by ordinary people who don't rise above their immediate circumstances, and who don't learn how to name their own behavior, until they see, too late, what they were part of. So yes, the point you make is crucial: context is everything, and we have the benefit of being able to step back and interpret actions within a wider context; actually within a number of contexts, which means we also have to decide, without doing original research, which contexts matter. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:39, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there are very few anti-globalization protestors that don't understand there are numerous Jews that also disagree with the policies of the government of Israel. Is there another easy way a protestor could visually signify that Rumsfeld does what Israel wants? If he was wearing an Israeli flag t-shirt would that have been better? Would there have been fewer accusations of anti-Semitism? I think Israel's documented racism against Palestinians is 1,000,000 times more significant than all anti-globalization movement anti-semitism. Let's not forget scale and context here, a random anti-globalization protestor has little power, Israel's policies regarding Palestinians are of daily importance just considering the perception of the U.S. in the Middle East and around the world.

<p>Yes, it would be better to signify that Rumsfeld supports Israel with an Israeli flag. If people mean Israel, they should say so. (But does whatever Israel wants? Hardly.) I don't think you should try to separate Israeli actions from the effects of anti-Semitism around the world. Israel feels embattled and is acting accordingly, and it will only get worse. People who criticize her have a responsibility to inform themselves (i.e. read some history textbooks), but that's takes longer and is less exciting than waving a placard and shouting. I don't mean to be disrespectful of all these protesters by the way, but there's clearly a sizeable chunk of them who'd have difficulty pointing to Israel on a map. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:18, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Slim, you wrote above: "My guess is that the star is exactly what it looks like. We have no reason to make excuses by guessing that they meant a sheriff's star: that's a bit of a stretch, and it's not our place to guess anyway: we can only go by what people say (or draw in this case)."

<dd>This makes the image symptomatic of the overly bloated mess that arises around the subject, more than of a problem of anti-semitism. Ultimately, the image proves absolutely nothing, neither in one way, neither in the other, and it is therefore most remarkable that such a fuss has been made around such an unconclusive document.

If this article is allowed to stay, then everyone editing it will have to stick to Wikipedia policies to avoid edit disputes. This means the debate should be described, not engaged in. We're not here to attack <b>or defend</b> the anti-globalization movement. We have to write as though we don't care about it. We're also not allowed to do any original research, which means no jumping to our own conclusions, and no reporting of personal experiences. If something looks like the Star of David and outside credible commentators say in print that it's the Star of David, then we write that it's the Star of David, <i>even if we personally believe it to be something else.</i> And we use only credible sources: academics, good journalists, respectable political commentators; we augment these sources with partisan sources defending their positions, but we don't give the partisan sources center stage, and we also don't decide for ourselves who is or isn't partisan. That is, we don't say of Phyllis Chesler "oh, she doesn't count as leftwing," just because we don't like her politics. We don't say of two academics: "They don't count because they've spoken to frontpagemag.com." (!)

<dd>One can naturally interpret this as one wishes, but I think that "a yellow star with the word 'sheriff' on it" makes a strong case for "sheriff star" -- just like a one-candle Menorah is just a candelabrum. The star on the image looks more like a WWII star than a sheriff star, there is no doubt about this, but there would be very plausible technical explanations for the protestors to have crafted this item like this.

And elsewhere you wrote (based on your ONE source): "we have every reason to believe not to depict an anti-semitic display." Rama, you have a computer. Download the star and blow it up. You'll see for yourself that the word "sheriff" is not on it. I think I'm going to stop posting here, because it's clear that no one's reading what I'm writing. Perhaps I'm being too long-winded, so I'll stop. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:21, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did in fact. There seems to be something written on the star but the photograph which we have here is unreadable. However, all people who have seen the star from close enough seem to agree that there wae "sheriff" written on it. Some of the numerous people who are outraged by "the Nazi star" have not even studied the scene closely enough to understand why Sharron is macked here.</dd>
<dd>I am not trying the defend anything, I just say that I don't see why the accusation of anti-semitism about this photograph should be relayed without a word of caution while we have no proof at all that there was anythin even borderline anti-semitic here. What I would aim at would be:
<ul>
<li>display this photograph with a label such as "this phtograph was used to symbolyse antisemitism, though this particulas scene was not proved to be antisemitic (the yellow star seems to have been intended to have been a sheriff star)"</li>
<li>find another photograph of people wearing Che Gevary t-shirt and "kill the Jews" pannels or something like this.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>But by merely stating "illustration of antisemitism: these protestors wear masks of Sharron and a yellow star", we run the risc of using the photograph of perfectly innocent people to illustrate a grave matter, which would no only be diffaming, but also plain ridiculous on our part. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 09:43, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How would it defame anyone? They're wearing masks. Anyway, I've used another program and I've now managed to see what's written on the star. It isn't sheriff. I'm not going to say what it is, because there's another editor who claims he was there and has personal knowledge, so I'm going to let him tell us what's on it.

<dd>This is just to let you know that I'm having nothing more to do with this article. I became involved only because I read it on the VfD and saw there were uncited quotations, so out of instinct more than anything (because I care about references not because I care about anti-globalization), I went and found the citations, and did a general copy edit to try to make it more presentable, and noted that I had done that on the VfD page. Then I let myself get drawn into defending it, until now I seem to be the only person doing that, and I've now been accused of trolling as a result. You can go ahead and delete it but I hope you'll all take some stock. I am a reasonable and fair editor, and I always try to be encyclopedic. I'm not saying I always succeed, but I do always try. But my experience with some of you over the last few days has been enough to make me want to leave Wikipedia altogether. I won't, of course, but I don't think you should make good-faith editors feel that way. You've successfully kept the material out of the original article, and you're about to succeed in keeping it out of Wikipedia, but that's not something to be proud of.

Slim, if you think LittleGreenFootballs represents the "majority view", I'm afraid I will no longer be able to take anything you have to say seriously. That's like saying that Al Sharpton is a child molester because everyone on Stormfront.org says so. I am disappointed at your unwillingness to participate in an honest evaluation of the material of this article.

<p>I have just been trying to get my head around all the stuff that has been written about this, particulary on the issule of the picture. I am personaly convinced that the protest wasn't anti-semitic (though sheriff star was a stupid mistake) or even anti-Zionist for that matter (not that the two are the same) but I think it is fair for the picture to be used as part of alligations of anti-semitism as there are people who have interpreted it in this way. (NPOV requires that if we can't deside the facts we should represent both view points). One thing that still puzzels me is <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin's</a> claim to have found something else written on the star, since <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> has given up editing the page it seems we will never find out what that was&#160;:-S --<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 11:35, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The picture has now been put back in (no doubt some one will remove it again soon (possibly me). As I see it we should not use the picture because 1)The meaning of the symbolism is not something we can determine/agree on. 2)There has been no notable discution of the picture or of the use of similar symbols on anti-cap' demos in general (I may be wrong about this)<br />
However, if it disided that the picture should remain then there needs to be some context to the picture mearly having it in the article (leaving the reader to interpret it) pushs the POV that it is a clear display of anti-Semitism (why else would it be in the article with no explanation?).<br />

<dd>Thanks. It would be great to hear other voices on this, for I fear I shall become repetitive (perhaps its too late for that:)). I would like to have a discussion about this page, rather than the 5 billionth discussion on consensus.

<dd>No, Mrfixter is wrong. There is no need for any more debate. The best way to improve the article is by making it a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a>. Consensus is not required for making redirects, and more people think there should not be an article here than do. If anyone honestly doesn't understand this, e-mail me and I'll explain in even greater detail. If anyone dishonestly opposes this, (Mrfixter and co.) then there is nothing you can do but accept it. &#160;:) — <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelpful_Dave_4207.html" title="User:Helpful Dave"><i>Helpful Dave</i></a> 13:35, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The debate was had on the VfD, the decision didnt go HD's way, and now these attemtps at redirects. Redirecting this article is not a keep, as outlined above. I obviously reject the smear that I am dishonestly opposing the outcome of a VfD. Majority is not consensus, but I find it increasingly unlikely that you are even able to understand that concept. *sigh* --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 13:46, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to echo Christiaan there. In addition, you're missing the point JK. We're not talking about deletion here. I'm not an admin, so I can't delete stuff anyway. I'm talking about making this a redirect, which anyone can do unilaterally, as with any edit. The only question is, "is that an edit that others can legitimately and repeatedly revert?". The answer to that is no, because the VFd, although it technically failed in the sense that a consensus for deletion wasn't reached, did play the important role of a poll on the community's opinion of this article. And that opinion is clear: the majority thought it shouldn't exist. Minorities thought it was fine as it was, or that it should be rewritten, or it should be renamed. By making it a redirect (which makes it no longer really exist as an article), I am implementing (a) the will of the majority, and (b) general Wikipedia policy on the creation of POV forks. I think this stuff should be in the anti-globalization article, but edited so that it does not distort it as you warn it might.</dd>

<dd>In summary, I unfortunately did not form a consensus for my remerge proposal, but Sam Spade definitely didn't form a consensus for his fork proposal. I at least have a majority on my side. It would be sad if my proposal is not implemented due to Mrfixter's obfuscations or his side's greater will to engage in revert warring. &#160;:) — <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelpful_Dave_4207.html" title="User:Helpful Dave"><i>Helpful Dave</i></a> 20:30, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about the rant&#160;;-) The bit about bashing a Nazi was just a recomendation of a good way to relive stress. My main point is that you shouldn't treat wikipedia battles as real world political battles. Polemic aside I also think hunger for deleting this kind of stuff will come back to bite us when we (i.e. lefties) are trying to promote the existance of pages on Lefty issules that others think are non-notable.<br />
Anyway, Ur proposal is essencialy to delete the contence of the page (craftly you whant to do this by making it a redirect ==&gt; tecnically muddying the water about procedure). As far as I can tell the current rules (such as they are) are biased in favour of keeping matterial/pages. Keeping dosen't require concencous, deleting does. As an after note, I agree that this page may have problems ever becoming NPOV and interesting (i.e. more then just a few quotes), If after some time it fails to do so it should be binned.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 08:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Never mind about punching and battles. We're building an encyclopaedia. Most people (rightly) think that this article is unencyclopaedic. The content deserves to be summarised in another article, as it was before Sam Spade unilaterally made it a separate article. I am fully within my rights to unilaterally make it not a separate article, and I am backed up by a majority on that. &#160;:) — <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelpful_Dave_4207.html" title="User:Helpful Dave"><i>Helpful Dave</i></a> 09:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Opps I've just got in trouble with Sam Spade (defender of the rights of fascists) for advocating their being punched. So I withdraw that comment. Insteed, only punch them if the treaten u or your community, in self-defence (i.e. within the law). Anyway, on the article, when there is conflict on the encyclopaedicness or otherwise of an article --&gt; we have a vote on its deletion (the deletion of content + redirect amounts to same thing). Prosess is biased in favour of the stuff staying because a rough consensous must be reached inorrder for it to be deleted. No such thing was reached in this case. Thus Mrfixter has every right to revert your delete/redirect. Sorry, and remember don't punch a Nazi on my advice or apparently Wikipedia could get sued.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 10:46, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HD's consistent refrain about a majority backing him up is a red-herring, 1stly because no-one voted for redirect/merge in the VfD, and 2ndly (and more importantly) VfD is decided through consensus, which is NOT simple majority, see Carbonite way above. Please stop using this argument, HD. Or do, but expect me to correct you time and time again. The redirect has no consensus in the community, it being (rightly) characterised as de facto deletion of this article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page is still missing context</span></h2>
<p>This page is missing a more complicated context provided by the New Internationalist magazine special issue on Judeophobia where the issue of antisemitism was teased out to explain that many pro-Zionist activists conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism, but that there is still too much antisemitic stereotyping by left and liberal Middle East and anti-globalization activists. I actually think the position of Klein is misrepresented in the current draft. She has a more complex analysis that admits there is too much antisemitism on the left.
