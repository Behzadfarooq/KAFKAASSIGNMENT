<p>"Pavelic's Ustashe regime was the most murderous regime in the whole that time occupied Europe?" Who is writing these articles, Chetnik Youth? This whole paragraph (all the way to Malaparte quotes) should be deleted for two reasons: 1) Useless, non-encyclopedical garbage that can be used for propaganda only 2) Even if you ignore that you can see how badly is that text incorporated with the rest of the article (i.e. you just can't put such paragraph on the end of the article. Articles should end with place, time and circumstances of death info).</p>

<dd>About the term "most murderous regime": this is first subjective and prone to edit wars as I see here and second, the situation in occupied parts of Soviet Union with partisan activity was possibly as bad or worse. I would recommend to stick with version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ante_Paveli%C4%87&amp;oldid=32153961" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ante_Paveli%C4%87&amp;oldid=32153961" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> by 83.139.82.247. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 02:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sourcing is given below. This regime is known for the bestialities that surpassed anything seen in the wartime. Even German and Italian occupying forces were prompted to stop Ustashi in commiting them - horrfied by what they had seen. I'm afraid that the numbers of the corpses per Ustashi capita are much bigger than the ones that could be calculated for Germans.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 16:59, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>sourcing. For example, someone coming to this page who isn't an expert would probably assume Nazi Germany was the 'most murderous regime' of the period - concentration camps directly run by the Nazis were responsible for a good few million murders, even before we look at occupied Russia. So, to be blunt, if the Croats are going to beat the Germans they are not going to do it on sheer number of corpses. Maybe on some measure such as number of murders per German/Croat citizen, per square mile of occupied territory, or per head in teritory under their control. Quite possibly you're right, but we could do with a citation to demonstrate it.81.41.90.223 20:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everyking, it's unclear to me what the long paragraph about the book accomplishes.

<ol>
<li>(The last paragraph is a total bias opinion and should not be found in an encyclopedia, considering you can not label Ustase as the worst murderers in all of Europe)</li>
<li>(Ustase were not a fascist organization by definition even though they might have taken on many fascist ideologies. Also FICTIONAL books such as Kaputt should not be used as a refrence.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The person's identification - 72.139.243.79 (IP Address)</p>
<p>To disjudge those who might trust this person - here are the quotes worth of reading:</p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>In April 1941 separatist Croats of the fascist terrorist organization 'Ustasha' set up in Zagreb an Independent Croat regime with Dr. Ante Pavelic as fuehrer, or "Poglavnik," and with Marshal Slavko Kvaternik as minister of war.</p>
<p>The new state, organized on strictly fascist and authoritarian lines, excelled quickly by the special ruthlessness and cruelty with which it persecuted, and partially exterminated the large Serb minority and the small Jewish population...</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<pre>
"Encyclopedia Britannica, 1943 - Book of the year," page 215, Entry: 'Croatia' 
</pre>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Slavko Kvaternik explained [in a radio program on April 10, 1941, the day the 'Independent State of Croatia' was formed] how a pure Croatia should be built - by forcing one third of the Serbs to leave Croatia, one third to convert to Catholicism, and one third to be exterminated. Soon Ustasha bands initiated a bloody orgy of mass murder of Serbs unfortunate enough not to have converted or left Croatia on time.</p>
<p>The enormity of such criminal behavior shocked even the conscience of German commanders, but Pavelic had Hitler's personal support for such actions which resulted in the loss of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<pre>
'Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations,' Europe, edition 1995, page 91, entry: 'Croatia.' 
</pre>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The Orthodox recipe of Ante Pavelic, Ustashi leader and Croatian Fuehrer, reminds one of the religious wars in [their] bloodiest aspects: one-third must become Catholic, one-third must leave the country and one-third must die. The last item was executed. When the leading men of the Ustashi movement are stating that they have slaughtered one million Serbs (including infants, children, women and aged) this in my opinion is a self-praising exaggeration. According to the reports that have reached me, my estimate is that the number of those defenseless slaughtered is some three-quarters of a million.</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>

Herman Neubacher, "Sonderauftrag Sudosten 1940-1945. Bericht eines fliegenden Diplomate," Goettingen, 1956
</pre>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>In Croatia the indigenous fascist regime set about a policy of 'racial purification' that went beyond even Nazi practices. Minority groups such as Jews and Gypsies were to be eliminated, as were the Serbs: it was declared that one-third of the Serbian population would be deported, one-third converted to Roman Catholicism, and one third liquidated. ... Ustasha bands terrorized the countryside. The partial collaboration of the Catholic clergy in these practices continues to be a component of Serb-Croat suspicion.</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<pre>
'Encyclopaedia Britannica,' Edition 1991, Macropedia, Vol. 29, page 1111. 
</pre>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Nonpartisan sources agree that mass genocide was authorized by the state of Croatia. They concur the state instigated, planned, and executed masses against the Serbian Orthodox minority... and that the Catholic clergy approved, led, or failed to denounce these massacres. The Croats' collective hatred of the Orthodox Serbs was explicit in folk sayings such as ["Srbe o vrbe" -] "Serbs to the willows [hang the Serbs]." ... By June 1941, signs on public establishments read, 'NO SERBS, JEWS, NOMADS ['Gypsies'] AND DOGS ALLOWED."</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Even the most extraordinary massacres in the darkest era of history would not soil its name - Croatia... Kill, kill, scream the Ustashi against Serbs. And they cut their heads off and throw bodies away into the Sava River which flows slowly and gravely in the direction of Belgrade...</p>
<p>"Go back to your motherland, go back to your motherland.</p>
<p>"Neither Fascists nor Nazi have the remotest resemblance to the Ustashi, they are a fauna absolutely extraordinary and strange..."</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>

Alfio Russo, "Revoluzione in Jugoslavia," Roma 1944 
</pre>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>For now I began to get news from Croatia that told of slowly rising tide of murders, of unrepeatable atrocities, of massacres of defenceless Serbs by berserk-mad Croatians and by [fascist] Moslems in Bosnian Croatia. In the little back parlors of trusty men, the tales were whispered. I could not believe a quarter of them. Unfortunately, I was soon to know that they were a weak understatement of the truth. Men were to arrive in Dubrovnik itself, hung with strings of Serbian tongues and with bowls of Serbian eyes for sale.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Jasenovac [was] the largest concentration camp in Croatia. Jasenovac was in fact a complex of several subcamps, in close proximity to each other, on the bank of the Sava River... established in August 1941 and was dismantled only on April 1945...</p>
<p>Some six hundred thousand people were murdered at Jasenovac, mostly Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and opponents of the Ustasha regime... The living conditions in the camp were extremely severe... A particularly cruel regime, and unbelievably cruel behavior by the Ustashe guards...</p>
<p>The acts of murder and of the cruelty in the camp reached their peak in the late summer of 1942, when tens of thousands of Serbian villagers were deported to Jasenovac from the area of the fighting against the partisans in the Kozara Mountains.</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>In the concentration camp at Jasenovac, on the night of August 29, 1942, orders were issued for executions. Bets were made as to who could liquidate the largest number of inmates. Peter Brzica cut the throats of 1,360 prisoners with a specially sharp butcher's knife. Having been proclaimed the prizewinner of the competition, he was elected King of the Cutthroats. A gold watch, a silver service, and a roasted sucking pig and wine were his other rewards...</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The greatest genocide during World War II, in proportion to nation's population, took place, not in Nazi Germany but in Nazi-created puppet state of Croatia. There in years 1941-1945, some 750,000 Serbs, 60,000 Jews and 26,000 Gypsies - men, women and children - perished in a gigantic holocaust. These are the figures used by most foreign authors, especially Germans, who were in the best position to know...</p>
<p>...The magnitude and the bestial nature of these atrocities makes it difficult to believe that such a thing could have happened in an alledgedly civilized part of the world...</p>

<p>The Ustashi murdered and tortured Jews and Serbs in indescribably bestial fashion. One of the most notorious camps in Hitler's Europe, Jasenovac, was in Croatia. Here the Ustashi used primitive implements in putting their victims to death—knives, axes, hammers and other iron tools. A characteristic method was binding pairs of prisoners, back to back, and then throwing them into the Sava River. One source estimates that 770,000 Serbs, 40,000 Gypsies and 20,000 Jews were done to death in the Jasenovac camp</p>

<p>Misha Glenny, The Balkans, Penguin Books 1999 Page 500</p>
<p>In July 1941, for example, some 500 Serbs, including women and children, from Glina, a small town 65 kilometres south-east of Zagreb, were arested and shot dead. As a consequence, the peasants from the surrounding villages hid themselves in the woods. The Nuremberg Tribunal described what happened next.</p>
<p>The Ustase offered an amnesty if they would convert to Roman Catholicism. A majority of peasants agreed and returned to their villages.</p>
<p>"The mass conversion was organized and the peasants duly arrived at the Serbian Orthodox church in Glina. 250 people turned up for the event. They were greeted by six members of Ustase. When all were inside, the chuch doors were locked shut. The peasants were forced to lie on the ground and the six Ustase begin hitting them with spiked clubs. More Ustase appeared and one after another every single peasant was murdered in this fashion"</p>
<p>The quote above comes from the Nuremberg Trials, quoted in</p>
<p>Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat Der kroatische Ustascha-Staat, 1941-1945 Stuttgart, 1964, page 101</p>
<p>"The horrors that the Ustashi have committed over the Serbian small girls is beyond all words. There are hundreds of photographs confirming these deeds because those of them who have survived the torture: bayonet stabs, pulling of tongues and teeth, nails and breast tips - all this after they were raped. Survivors were taken in by our officers and transported to Italian hospitals where these documents and facts were gathered."</p>
<p>(Commander of the Italian Sassari Division in Croatia, 1941)</p>
<p>"Increased activity of the bands is chiefly due to atrocities carried out by Ustasha units in Croatia against the Orthodox population. The Ustashas committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age, but especially against helpless old people, women and children. The number of the Orthodox that the Croats have massacred and sadistically tortured to death is about three hundred thousand."</p>

<p>Zu diesen explosiven Nationalbestrebungen kommen religioese Gegensaetze zwischen Katholiken, Pravoslaven und Muselmanen. Als ich einmal einen in Montenegro beruemht gewordenen Cetnikfuehrer zuredete, di Muselmanen in Ruhe zu lassen - er hat mir versprochen und sein Versprechen gehalten - erhielt ich eine Antwort, die aus den Tuerkenzeit-Anekdoten des Marco Miljanow stammen konnte: " Wer diesen Glauben hat, ist keine Serbe mehr!" Das Pravoslavenrezept des Ustaschafuehrers und Poglavnik ( Staatsfuehrers ) Kroatiens, Ante Pavelic, erinnert an Relilgionskriege blutigsten Andenkens: " Ein Drittel muss katolisch werden, ein Drittel muss das Land verlassen, ein Drittel muss sterben!"

<p>When the leading men of the Ustashi movement are stating that they have slaughtered one million Serbs (including infants, children, women and aged) this in my opinion is a self-praising exaggeration.

<p>The crimes of the Ustasha documented by the Zagreb indictment included the murder of hundreds of specifically named Serbs, Gypsies, and Jews; the creation of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where hundreds of thousands of individuals were killed; and the following specific cases of barbarism:</p>
<p>1. tying families by their hands with wire, forcing them into a pit, and cracking their skulls with sledgehammers;</p>
<p>2. operating a crematorium at Jasenovac into which persons were flung alive;</p>
<p>3. herding Serbs into their Orthodox churches ... and then butchering them with knives;</p>
<p>4. medical experiments into the perseverance of human organisms;</p>
<p>5. slitting open the bellies of pregnant women;</p>
<p>6. drinking blood from the slashed throats of the victims;</p>
<p>7. inducing cannibalism among camp inmates;</p>
<p>8. mutilation of the living and the dead;</p>
<p>9. raping schoolgirls before their mothers;</p>
<p>10. catching infants on bayonets;</p>
<p>11. inventing new methods of torture;</p>
<p>12. throwing burning lime on the living in execution pits;</p>
<p>13. feeding food laced with caustic soda to starving children.38</p>
<p>The evidence against Artukovic also included, in addition to evidence about his role in the above activities of the Ustasha, various affidavits from witnesses who had been in a position to observe his activities during World War II.</p>

<p>A basket of oysters</p>
<p>While he spoke, I gazed at a wicker basket on the Poglawnik's desk. The lid was raised and the basket seemed to be filled with mussels, or shelled oysters - as they are occasionally displayed in the windows of Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly in London. Casertano looked at me and winked, 'Would you like a nice oyster stew?'</p>
<p>'Are they Dalmatian oysters?' I asked the Poglawnik</p>
<p>Ante Pavelic removed the lid from the basket and revealed the mussels, the slimy and jelly-like mass, and he said smiling, with that tired good-natured smile of his,</p>
<p>'It is a present from my loyal ustashis. Twenty kilos of human eyes.'</p>

<dd>Fictions, cook-books, fitness, yoga are the book-shelvers classifications that might be seen in the book stores and libraries. The valid academic terms are: novels, dramas, tragedies, comedies, poems, short stories, essays, etc. About scholars - Sigmund Freud highly regarded Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov as a psychoanalytical study, Balsac's novels are regarded by French historians as social studies of the French society, Andric's The Bridge on the Drina is a scientific reference in the books of the world-renown historian W. H. McNeill (Europe, Ottoman Empire) and a part of the history curricula (University of Missoury, Kansas City Dr Carla Klausner: [<a href="http://cas.umkc.edu/history/Schedule-Syllabi/2003/HIST445%20545%20Fall%2003.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://cas.umkc.edu/history/Schedule-Syllabi/2003/HIST445%20545%20Fall%2003.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]).

<p>Pavelic's regime was clearly not "the most murderous regime in the whole that time occupied Europe". In fact, Ustasha murders and crimes were nowhere near as organized as German or even Soviet/Allied ones. Most of the people comitting these crimes were uneducated thugs. Gestapo certainly had more organized methods of torture, while concentration camps in Germany took far more lives than those in Croatia.</p>

<p>This is conjecture and as such has no place in Wikipedia. The fact that the author cannot cite definite numbers and uses generalisations: "close to one third Serbs, even if not more." weakens the text. For this reason alone it should be removed.</p>
<p>The extent of this campaign against the Serbs was a real <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, because they aimed to exterminate a third of them, expel another third, and Catholicize another. The Ustaše succeeded in reaching their first goal - they exterminated close to one third Serbs, even if not more.</p>

<p>What place has this discussion of literature and poetic descriptions of Ustashe activities got in a encyclopedic article about the leader of the Ustashe? If it belongs anywhere (which is quite questionable) it belongs under the Ustashe entry.</p>
<p>Utashe atrocities made a strong impression on literature and poetry. "Basket of Oysters", a chapter of Curzio Malaparte's novel Kaputt, depicted Ustashe's widespread practice of gouging out the eyes of Serbs. In Jama ("The Pit"), Ivan Goran Kovačić wrote of how Serbs were wrapped in barbed wire and dropped into pits. Other works inspired by the Ustashe were Oljača's Kozara and Svetina's Volčiči ("The Wolf Puppies").</p>

<p>A lot that is written about Pavelic is fiction and propagnada. Yes he was a Nazi but more like a Nazi Puppet. He had little power. This guy just did as ordered by nazis. But wait a minute didnt most of Europe..wasnt just him. One has to remember the Ustashe and Ante Pavelic were a ""minority"" of Croats who fought alongside the Nazis. ""Most Croats"" and Tito himself fought against the Nazis. It hurts me when people label Croats and single them out ---but forget all the other countries who had nazi forces and in much bigger numbers. WW1--- WW2 was a dark time in history but the truth needs to be told and not hyped up by ignorance. ANTE PAVELIC was anti his own people ...he disliked the Dalmatian Coast (Croats too) and offered them to Italy...so i wouldnt say he was very Croat in any shape or form. Pavelic was just a puppet on a string...but so was most of Europe..including Italy France Hungary Estonia Serbia etc...</p>

There were handschars, cetniks and ustase who were all against their own people... how can we single only the croats out when serbs and bosniaks did equal collaboration?

<p>Ante Pavelic was kind but nieve because he agreed to Italy if Hitler won the war the region of Istria and Dalmatia would be given to Italy. Even though Ustahes did Kill a lot of serbs it wasn't that much as the serbs clamied. Franjo Tudman had a look at how many Serbs were killed during the Second world war he got a total of 38,000.

<p>First of all i read the artical and somewhere there it saids that there was a lack of Documented evdience to show how many serbs were killed by the Ustase. They say a estimate of 25,000 to 1,000,000. But ask yourself where did the estimates come from, Probley from the communist of Yugoslavia who won the war which was lead by Tito Brojz and we know how much propaganda the communist Yugoslavs have put on Croatia after World War 2 and onwards. --Marbus2 5 13:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Fascism as it is generally used is the broader term - it can be used specifically to refer to the Italian variety, but also more widely for a range of related movements and positions. That is - the ustashe definitely can be filed under fascism (in the broad sense); Nazism is more debatable.

You'll find there a great number of the bestialities described in details. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 00:26, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>The Extradition of Nazi Criminals: Ryan, Artukovic, and Demjanjuk</i></dd>
<dd><i>by Henry Friedlander and Earlean M. McCarrick</i></dd>
<dd><i>Andrija Artukovic, the highest ranking Nazi criminal to find refuge in the United States, was born in 1899 in Austrian Herzegovina, which after World War I formed part of Yugoslavia. Trained as a lawyer, he participated in the prewar politics of Yugoslavia as a member of the extremist Ustasha, whose aim was the creation of an independent Croatia and thus the destruction of a unified Yugoslavia. During World War II,13 when the Ustasha assumed power in the Nazi puppet state of Croatia, Artukovic served as Minister of Internal Affairs. As such he was in charge of the police and paramilitary units that imposed the Ustasha system of terror. These forces established death camps where they murdered large numbers of men, women, and children including Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and Moslems. As the second highest ranking member of the Ustasha regime and as the man in charge of internal security, Artukovic was implicated in these crimes.</i>--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurger_3536.html" title="User:Purger">Purger</a> 13:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be more specific, Britannica claims that Pavelic was 'revolutionist'? As much as Hitler was or maybe more? Very poor reference.

<dd>I have quoted what I think are reputable, representative reference works. Surely the fact that all of them call Pavelic a fascist and none of them calls him a Nazi has significance? "Revolutionist" - Pavelic certainly was one, because before he was installed in power in 1941 he had been a leader of what was a radical insurgent organization that proclamed its aim of overthrowing the Yugoslav state. He was also a politician (besides being a criminal and a mass murderer), just like Hitler, Stalin and Mao were politicians. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElephantus_ade7.html" title="User:Elephantus">Elephantus</a> 05:24, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kovacic, himself Croat, never mentioned ustashe or Serbs in his poem "Jama". He was talking about innocent victims of war and their inhumane executors that were present on all sides with nationalist hatred during the WW2. Not to mention that the poet himself was killed by the Serb nationalist chetniks! This shameful abuse of a great poem for Serbian nationalist propaganda is a disgrace for Wikipedia. Things like this should be moderated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/4/User%7E194.152.217.129.html" title="User:194.152.217.129">194.152.217.129</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/User_talk%7E194.152.217.129.html" title="User talk:194.152.217.129">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.152.217.129_9ed6.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.152.217.129">contribs</a>) 09:46, 17 Jul 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Kovacic did not talk about 'innocent victims of war and their inhumane executors that were present on all sides' - he was talking about Ustashi - even when not mentioning them. Kovacic was killed by Tito's henchmen - the same way they killed Mladen Stojanovic. Then he invented stories about chetniks - as their killers.--72.75.55.21 21:27, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So we have a dead poet's mind reader here. What he ment Kovacic said in his poem. Will someone with authority remove Kovacic from this article? I repeat: such abuse of a great poet is a disgrace for Wikipedia.<a href="../../../1/9/4/User%7E194.152.217.129.html" title="User:194.152.217.129">194.152.217.129</a> 11:27, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand why people would call Ante a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_criminal.html" title="War criminal">war criminal</a> (in my opinion, deservedly so). However, the Wikipedia <b>Category:War Criminals</b> is for people <i>convicted</i> of war crimes (or at least so the description on its page says). Therefore, if Ante was never convicted of war crimes, neither during his life nor posthumously, he should not be put into that category, though I see nothing wrong in saying somewhere in the article that he fits the conventional definition of a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_criminal.html" title="War criminal">war criminal</a> pretty well. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInt19h_42b2.html" title="User:Int19h">-- int19h</a> 07:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ante Pavelic got the Death penalty - he was convicted by the Partisan court. Ante <i><b>was convicted</b></i>; the difference is that punishment <i>wasn't executed</i>. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 18:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He was never convicted in any court. Show trials in dictatorships without <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_law.html" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>, and withouth any jurisdiction over Pavelić, who lived in a different country and was a citizen of a different state (Croatia), doesn't count. North Corea may declare Bush to be a war criminal, but it's only the POV of North Corea and no basis for categorizing him as such. <a href="../../../s/h/g/User%7EShgoals_068a.html" title="User:Shgoals">Shgoals</a> 02:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ante Pavelic was the leader of Ustase, but the Ustase were not national-socialists (who were the German NSAPD party led by Adolf Hitler) nor were they fascists (who were Italian led by Mussolini). The Ustase were a nationalist party (movement) and their agenda was that of Croatian nationalists (establishment of the Croatian state). However, they did not share the same ideology as the NSAPD or the Italian Fascists. Their ideology would find a counterpart in Franco's Spain, perhaps.Lusich 04:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Clearly this article has heavy POV problems, including both Anti-Pavelić and Anti-Croatian (denying the Croatian people the right to independence) as well as pro-communist/pro-Serbian bias. <a href="../../../s/h/g/User%7EShgoals_068a.html" title="User:Shgoals">Shgoals</a> 02:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The very bad thing that your 'POV problems' <b>is a POV</b>. You did not provide any valid references supporting your claim. Also, the existing edits preceding your changes, which I removed as not not sourced at all, is not POV due to the fact that it is very good editorial work where the editors did not put anything which cannot be found in the references.--<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryMar_838a.html" title="User:BarryMar">BarryMar</a> 00:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
