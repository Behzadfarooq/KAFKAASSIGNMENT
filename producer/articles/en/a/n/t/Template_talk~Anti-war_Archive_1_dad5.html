<h2><span class="mw-headline">Work in progress</span></h2>
<p>At the moment, this seems to focused on the U.S. and too focused on recent events.</p>
<p>Also, is this to be specifically opposition to <i>wars</i> or also to militarism? I ask because there is a lot related to the Middle East peace movement that is not so much in opposition to some particular war as pro-peace. I think some of that belongs here. Consider, for example <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Accord_23b6.html" title="Geneva Accord">Geneva Accord</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:45, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Our_template_is_too_fat" id="Our_template_is_too_fat"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Our template is too fat</span></h2>
<p>Our template is too "fat" - too wide side-to-side. I'm going to see if I can make it skinnier, because I think it has too large of a horizontal footprint on the top of the articles, which is causing me considerable frustration in trying to stick images up there and format everything properly.</p>
<p>So we shall see what I come up with. Trying to make it a little smaller and neater like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">Template:Anarchism</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fixed "fat" template</span></h2>
<p>Fixed the old "fat" template. What I did is I took the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">anarchism</a> template and built a new template for anti-war based on that one. It is definitely a lot more streamlined, though it is longer than before. It's also locked to the right side now, where it used to be variable. Provides some uniformity. I'm going through now to fiddle with a number of the pages that this template resides on in order to make them all look right. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">Schuminweb</a> 01:15, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you were right to but the template on a diet as it was hard to fit it in with articles with pictures. Its a shame though as it was more sexy before the diet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Afghanistan War Protests" widest thing on the template</span></h2>
<p>In order to keep the template down to size, at least as far as width is concerned, let's agree that the link to "Afghanistan War Protests" will be the widest thing on the template, and that anything wider than that gets a line break to bring its width back a bit.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will continue to help keep our template from getting too "fat" again. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 21:22, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Organizations</span></h2>
<p>The section on Organizations is getting huge, it might be better if we created some articles on the varrious anti war groups (say U.S anti-war groups, U.K. anti-war groups etc.) and had those pages listed on the topics bar.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 13:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whilst I agree in principle that the list needed to be trimmed down, the organisations that have been left seem rather abitary.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 07:46, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My intent was to try to have the "big ones" listed directly on the template and then have the link to the list. Thus why I put ANSWER, UFPJ, etc. on there. I'm open to further refinement on that front, since I was kind of like, "umm, sure" on some of those. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 06:17, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, she as a person is undeniably notable and anti-war, not?</dd>
<dd>But, okay... no individuals or more indivuals.</dd>
<dd>How about also adding <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Galloway_f81f.html" title="George Galloway">George Galloway</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>?</dd>
<dd>By the way, these are not just any anti-war individuals. Specifically, each of these individuals has the same impact on the general opinion as anti-war organizations have / are trying to have: Seehan's campaign at Bush's Ranch, Galloways campaigns and US hearing, Moore's 'Fahrenheit 911'.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not necessarily opposed - that's a decent list - but the template is already pretty large, and if we add individuals we ought to add historically important individuals as well as currently important ones. Who that means, I don't know, necessarily, but we've already got too much of a current-events bias in this area. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 22:33, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) I agree. A wiki-template should not cause disorder on wikipedia: by being too large for a page, or by causing endless discussions about who to include and who not to include. Let's leave it this way.</dd>
<dd>(2) How about adding the template to the three persons pages?</dd>
<dd>(2+) and to other pages? We have to be careful, and not add the template to just any wikipage about a person who is opposed to a war! <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Lee_91fb.html" title="Spike Lee">Spike Lee</a>, for example, is opposed to the current American war in Iraq. He is known for his anti-racism and deserves an anti-racism template, but only when asked does he speak out against the current war. So he's not notable in the anti-war movement. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Brando_e47f.html" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, however, was opposed to the Vietnam War, protested, played in an anti-war movie <i>Burn!</i>, and financially supported the latest anti-war movement (just before he died). I think he is therefore a candidate for an anti-war template.</dd>
<dd>(3) We have a list of anti-war organisations. How about compiling a list of prominent anti-war individuals? (maybe the same page?)</dd>
<dd>-- <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 04:07, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) I agree.</dd>
<dd>(2+) I think that the criterion for inclusion of the template - or on a list of anti-war individuals - should be that the person is primarily known for their anti-war position, or at least as known for that as for anything else (which would mean that, say, Moore and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Zinn_965b.html" title="Howard Zinn">Howard Zinn</a> would be included). Brando is known significantly better as an actor than an anti-war figure, so I don't think that he should get the anti-war template.
<dl>
<dd>I've now added the template to Sheehan, Galloway, Moore, and Zinn. We'll see whether it stays. The problem with adding it to individuals is that its default space is also where their picture defaults to, so one ends up getting pushed way down the page. I don't know if this is avoidable, or how much it matters. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 17:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(3) I am strongly in favor of this. It should be a seperate page, IMO, because the organizations page is already quite long and, if it ever gets decent coverage outside the U.S., will be much longer. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 17:19, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's already a category, "Anti-war people". It's not very full, but we could take advantage of it. I would imagine that the number of people included in this category would also be larger than the number included in a list/with anti-war templates. Do you agree? <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 17:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, a category is even better! The category list updates itself everytime a person page is categorized as anti-war. Then there is no need for making a list of persons. Adding cat to a page is also less intrusive because the template is not inserted. (some pages do need the template, though) I would suggest to add one single link in the template: a link to the anti-war persons category list. And place it just below "other anti-war organisations". (and "other anti-war organizations" should be "other organizations" for reasons of size and obviousness) -- <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 07:25, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ok. Want to go ahead and add the category link? We can then make an effort to increase the coverage of the category. Right now very few people are in it. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 16:03, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure whether the anti-war topic template should be added to the Galloway article as it is about all of his activities not all of which have been concerned with opposing war. C.f. Cindy Seehan, all most all of her artlce is about her opposition to war. I have made a <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_Galloway_14a1.html#Anti-war_topic_template" title="Talk:George Galloway">coment on the Galloway page</a>--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 14:27, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's remove it. As someone pointed out wrt the template I added to the Zinn page, since it doesn't list individuals specifically it's out of place unless someone is known pretty much exclusively for anti-war work. We should be very sparing in adding it to bio pages. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 15:41, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we're going to include opposition to all individual wars large and small for which there are articles, the template will get unmanageably large.

<p>First off, I have no problem with the link to the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copperheads_%28politics%29.html" title="Copperheads (politics)">Copperheads (politics)</a> article. In fact, I think it's a great addition to the template. I do, however, have issue with it being listed in two different places. It's listed by name as an organization, and also listed at the top under opposition to the American Civil War. My issue is that this is redundant, and makes our template unnecessary long, thus one should be removed.

<dd>I don't think that the Copperheads really count as an organization. That was, after all, a label attached to a faction of Democrats and others by the Republicans. All the other groups listed as organizations are actually formal/legal organizations.

<p>Copperheads (Politics) should be re-added. Here's why. The topic shows the historical context of why some take an antii-war position to gain political power, regardless of whether it is best for the nation or not. In the Civil War, the Copperhead Democrats were willing to allow the Union to disolve and allow the continuation of slavery to regain the White House from President Lincoln.</p>
<p>One could argue that there are some polititians who seem to be taking the same anti-war positions now out of political expedience and to gain political power versus making a well thought out decision based on what is best for our national security.</p>
<p>People need to understand this historical context, and how elections and power can drive people to make decisions based on the wrong reasons. Whether you agree with the war or not, the practive of polititians taking postions for the sole purpose of garnering personal power is wrong.</p>

<dd>I have no opinion on the question of whether a non-organization should be listed, but the analogy to G.W. Bush is totally flawed.

<p>At the currently ongoing TfD discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_20#Template:Anti-war_topics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_20#Template:Anti-war_topics" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> there has been suggestion that the template is too long. While I am not certain that it is too long, it is longer than templates like <a href="../../../c/h/r/Template%7EChristianity_d7bc.html" title="Template:Christianity">template:Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">template:Islam</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">template:Anarchism</a> (from which this template's design takes much inspiration).</p>
<p>If it does need to be split, then I suggest that the possibly the best way to do this would be to split the anti-war organisations section (the longest) into a separate {{Anti-war organizations}}* template would make a useful template on its own, leaving a link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anti-war_organizations.html" title="List of anti-war organizations">List of anti-war organizations</a> on the main template and possibly a very few (about 3 at most) of the most notable (perhaps <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_in_Our_Name_1f13.html" title="Not in Our Name">Not in Our Name</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_the_War_Coalition_2b62.html" title="Stop the War Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament_1b48.html" title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a>).<br />

I suspect it might be javascript or something). I'm personally abviliant about whther it needs to be split or not, but the opinion has been expressed at the TfD.

<p>On the right you see several possibilities to shorten the template without loss of info:</p>
<ul>
<li>two or three links in one line (books - films - peace symbol)</li>
<li>smaller but still readable font size</li>
<li>no horizontal lines between sections, only titles</li>
<li>no open lines</li>
<li>left out the very first line: "part of something on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>" because the bottom has the politics portal already</li>
<li>(list of organizations should have been added in there... you get the pic)</li>
<li>gain: 13 horizontal lines less. however: a little bit wider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember the right reason for making the thing smaller. There's only been one user so far who says this template is "ludicrously" long. He nominated it for deletion straight away, without informing this discussion page, without making any suggestions, without giving advice, bypassing the users in the Anti-War portal concerned. If he was serious about the length, he would not have wanted this template deleted but shortened. Still he hasn't engaged in the discussion here. Are we shortening the template just for this one user? <b>If</b> the template is to be made shorter, it should be done so according to the Anti-War portal and wikiarticles requirements. -- <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 19:05, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Honestly, I believe that this template wasn't actually nominated on its own merits. I believe it was nominated in retaliation for the successful deletion of the {{headgear}} template, over which the nominator and I had sparred in the past. Thus I feel this whole thing is more about revenge than anything to do with the box.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I think the template as it presently exists is fine, and we're giving too much sway to this one editor who seems bent on revenge. The proposed revision that's displayed at right seems too wide, and keeping it narrow has been a big thing with this template, as that's where its beauty lies. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 04:01, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">reorganization</span></h2>
<p>The template needs some kind of reorganization of the categories. I think that Stevertigo was right that the number of organizations listed was getting out of control, but the only non-arbitrary solution I can see, since we don't have a good way of comparing organizational importance and picking the best 5-7, is to just link the list. But now we need some other way of organizing the template - it's silly to have an 'organizations' category with only one member. And the other existing categories have problems as well - "General Anti-War" is explicitly a lump, while "Criticism of Anti-War" is badly named, because the senses in which an article on militarism and an article on appeasement contain criticisms of anti-war movements are opposite. Any suggestions for a new set of categories? <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 00:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to remove the "Criticisms" section entirely, because I think that the articles therin a bit of a stretch in the first place, regardless of what you call it. I'm going to wait to see what others think on that one, though. Otherwise, I like the fact that the list of organizations is now entirely on the list and off the template.

<p>Schuminweb,</p>
<p>Why was "Fellow Traveler" not "close enough"? 90 percent of the people who are ensuring the list is biased have self-proclaimed Socialist or Commumist worldviews that are their "sources of opposition". The term "fellow traveler" seems to be the best descriptor to capture this wide ranging source of opposition. Thank you for your time.</p>

<dd>It's not specifically anti-war, but seems to be much more a general thing. I would, however, consider myself a "fellow traveler" for a number of anti-war and activist organizations in the DC area, but as it's not specifically an anti-war concept, it's not template material. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 05:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Schuminweb,</p>
<p>I would propose that if being a "fellow traveler" is the "source of opposition" for large portions of the Anti-War proponents, then it fits. For the listing to be neutral (as many people have used for their reasoning) then it should list all the primary motivating factors in the "source of opposition" list.</p>
<p>For example, if you look at the "User pages" for those in the "history" editing list, almost all of them are self-proclaimed Socialists, Communists, followers of Trotskyism, etc.. All the edits they make could be what wikipedia calls "vandalism" since they have a set agenda in only showing one side, versus listing the other links that would not be a palpable.</p>
<p>For example, "consciencious objector" is listed, however "draft dodger" is not, nor is "deserter". "Anti-imperialism" is listed, however "Socialism" doesn't get the green light...and yet "militarism" does? "Peace movement" can be listed, and yet the Socialist leadership behind many of these organizations is never addressed?</p>
<p>Again, I would propose (for neutralities sake) if we are going to have an Anti-war list, it is only fair to address the 'fellow traveler" angle under "sources of opposition".</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure I get what this has to do with the template. For example, a draft-dodger (currently in the template) is not necessarily anti-war, he just doesn't want to go (look at Dick Cheney; no, on the second thought I'd rather not). "Fellow traveller" is about a political relationship to a party. In the period of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, I suppose that could have made some people temporarily anti-war, but a year later it would have made them pro-war. (Insofar as there is a specifically socialist opposition to war, it falls under the heading of anti-imperialism, already in the template.) If we are going to add things like that, we'd have to add every political party that ever opposed a war: there are a lot of those, but if they weren't reasonably <i>consistently</i> anti-war, it seems off-topic to me.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm perfectly open to adding to the template other less "honorable" terms (e.g. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeasement.html" title="Appeasement">appeasement</a>), but they should be on-topic. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

With this done, the way seems clear to put the template on this title. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 16:04, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Template redesign</span></h2>
<p>Would anyone be averse to a redesign of the template to give it an appearance similar to that of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">Template:Anarchism</a>? I think it would make our template look quite sharp... <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 01:57, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
