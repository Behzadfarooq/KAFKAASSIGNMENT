<p>Since there are questions as to the scientific legitimacy of this subject, I have categorized the article with pseudoscience.

<dd>if that is general policy of handling this category, then there is something wrong with it. i am sure that to the casual reader it does not come across like that but rather that anthroposophy is classified as pseudoscience. i don't even have a problem with that assesment in general but nevertheless i found it just a cheap grafitti kind of way to popooh anthropop. i'd prefer if you could rather introduce a section that argues where anthroposophy is not in line with science and where it has antiscientific aspects. not being able to argue that through and just stick on the label pseudoscience is not good enough. if you don't have anything better to show i will remove the cat. but i would support a section as i described. but something more elegant than 'however many consider it...'<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrueblood_11de.html" title="User:Trueblood">trueblood</a> 13:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A "substantial" following? Anthroposophy has no substantial following. Psychoanalysis has a substantial following. Anthroposophy has 50,000 followers world-wide. And maybe half of those consider it to actually be "science". That's not a "substantial" following of the type the psychoanalysis example is and Anthroposophy certainly does not have the support among scientists that psychoanalysis has.

<p>I agree with Trueblood, but see it as part of a much larger problem; the category 'pseudoscience' is being widely applied for fields which anybody citable considers to be pseudoscientific.

<dd>"<b>This is an example of systemic bias</b>" in the generally valiantly NPOV Wikipedia "that needs to be addressed." yes, absolutely! The curiosity is that NPOV reaches towards an intensity of neutrality that Rudolf Steiner actually taught me even more about than I learned in Science or in Psychology - and I'm a good scientist and a trained counsellor - and studying "Philosophy of Freedom" was the key to this for me, taken in context of studying Steiner's work overall and seeing, yes, here is a genius who has not been properly recognized. I've lived 40 years (outside Steiner communities) since discovering Steiner, and have <i>almost</i> never found a genius to equal him. The problem with Wikipedia (and I don't want to change its setup because usually it works) is that it would not be NPOV as normally understood to gather together similar character references to Steiner from suitable people like Canon Shepherd. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy_Skywalker_ae57.html" title="User:Lucy Skywalker">Lucy Skywalker</a> 22:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>pseudoscience is something that pretends to be science but is in conflict with modern science and does not hold up to basic scientific standards. so when anthroposophy is pretending to be science that is in fact pseudoscience. but it is more, it is about education, agriculture, art etc; and as pete put it it is it's philosophy mixed with a little religion and occultism.</dd>

<dd>Unlike catholicism, tai chi, yoga, plato or jung, Anthroposophy was stated by Steiner to be a "Spiritual science". A way of investigating the world of the spirit using the methods of science. This is clearly reported in the opening line of the article. Its not actually a science so its a pseudoscience. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 13:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The question is whether anthroposophy applies scientific methodology (e.g. the systematic application of reason) to spiritual experience, as Steiner claimed. He did not claim it was a natural science. Geisteswissenschaft, Steiner's word in German, is normally applied to history and anthropology in their broadest sense, for example (not just as empirically-based sciences).</p>
<p>Not everything that is not a natural science is a pseudoscience. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 17:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>True. Some things are neither science nor psuedoscience. Some ideas are philosophy, others are just BS. Anthroposophy does not apply scientific methodology - and scientific methodology consists of much more than "systematic application of reason". In fact</dd>
</dl>
<p>the "systematic application of reason" is exactly philosophy. But Steiner's systematic application of reason left no room for peer review. In fact, he specifically excluded himself from peer review by stating that the only people who could evaluate his were were, essentially, Anthroposophists. This, from the outset, excluded scientists (not that any serious scientist would be interested in examining the set of ideas Steiner postulated. You are trying to change the definition of science so that Steiner fits into it.

<dd>You say that "<b>Anthroposophy does not apply scientific methodology</b>" but I would challenge the accuracy of your observations on which you make this claim. It is my careful and extensive and informed observation, over 40 years, that Anthroposophy is not at odds with scientific method, which relies on a) consistently careful observation; b) drawing reasonable hypotheses from the observations; and c) being open to further evidence that might challenge the hypotheses. Now Steiner himself asked people NOT to believe what he said but to test it for themselves. The fact that Anthroposophists sometimes choose belief over testing does not mean that this is what Steiner encouraged. He did not say, as you claim, "the only people who could evaluate his were, essentially, Anthroposophists"; what he said was that he spoke of what he had himself experienced and that if another did not experience the same thing, this was no proof in itself that what he had said was untrue. It is a delicate matter to grasp the different scientific validities of both positive proof and negative absence of disproof. One analogy is that I do not claim that Australia does not exist because I have not been there. I have examined the matter, and have found it reasonable to take the evidence of others as a working hypothesis. Which is what I have done with Steiner, and have sometimes arrived at different conclusions. But he taught me the method - to observe what was going on "within" with the same very great care as one would apply to conventional scientific observations, and, indeed, as the whole of modern psychology has taught us to begin to do with our inner realities. There is a growing number of scientists who see that certain factions in the scientific world claim objectivity where they, as equally respected and qualified scientists, disagree with such claims to "objectivity", see for example [<a href="http://www.alternativescience.com/csicop.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alternativescience.com/csicop.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] I hope this helps the discussion <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy_Skywalker_ae57.html" title="User:Lucy Skywalker">Lucy Skywalker</a> 23:41, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this is just a problem of translation, why do Anthroposophical societies continue to mistranslate the term into the English word <i>Science</i> <a href="http://www.goetheanum.org/hochschule.html?&amp;L=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goetheanum.org/hochschule.html?&amp;L=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://anthroposophy.org.uk/index.php?id=43" class="external autonumber" title="http://anthroposophy.org.uk/index.php?id=43" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>?

<p>Because the English word science is also not limited to natural science: the OED's definitions, for example, include 1) "Knowledge of cognizance of something", 2) "Knowledge acquired by study", 3) "A particular branch of knowledge or study", 4) "A branch of study which is concerned either with a connected body of demonstrated truths or with observed facts systematically classified...and which includes trustworthy methods for the discovery of new truth within its own domain", 5) "The kind of knowledge or of intellectual activity of which the various 'sciences' are examples". Definition 5b is the only one that is more particular; it states: "In modern use, often treated as synonymous with 'Natural and Physical Science', and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws..." What you (and many others) think of as science is only one of its many meanings - not even a particularly prominent one (5b in a list of 6) in the view of the OED editors! <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 19:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it is not a problem of translation, when talking about geisteswissenschaft, steiner did not mean the humanities, what the german term also stands for, but as hgilbert put it A way of investigating the world of the spirit using the methods of science. so spiritual science is an accurate translation. but i thought that is somewhat beside the point, investigating the world of spirit is outside science. i thought the pseudoscience label was more about conclusions or observations by steiner that are in contrast with science but concern wordly matters, like vitalism, biological transmutation,... the category is a detail, and i will stop to hassle about it, i found more important that those contraction of modern science are reflected in the article. "Some ideas are philosophy, others are just BS", pete you are wrong with that i think, a lot of philosophy would be considered pseudoscience if uttered today, using the standards that are used here. that is one reason why i don't like the category,, for instance lamarckism is in it. poor lamarck, lamarckism is just a superseded scientific theory. but at the time it was cutting edge science. but that is out of context here.<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrueblood_11de.html" title="User:Trueblood">trueblood</a> 19:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, then we have to get into the debate about whether ever word that Steiner uttered represents Anthroposophy. I don't think it does and there is a debate currently at waldorfcritics.org that suggests that Steiner's Philosophy of Freedom should not be included as part of his body of work that is regarded as Anthroposophy. Regardless of what you think of poor Lamarck's work, if it were presented today as fact would be considered psuedoscience. Anyway, are you no longer disputing that the psuedoscience tag is accurate? <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 20:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>I don’t know what edition of the OED you are using but mine clearly labels the other, more generalised meanings as archaic. The Anthroposophy sites make no effort to show they are using the word in an archaic way. This article itself states right at the start that Anthroposophy uses the methodology of science. There is no ambiguity here. Anthroposophy tries to lay claim to being a science in the modern sense and in so doing makes itself a pseudoscience. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 12:03, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>- i think there should not be any doubt whether the scientific community (i.e. the majority of scientists) considers anthroposophy a science or not. unfortunately not many scientist consider it necessary to point that out. on the other hand one can probably find scientist to quote that are open for certain aspects of anthroposophy. could we not as a compromise try to do it without the label pseudoscience and instead point out that anthroposophy does not comply with basic scientific standards (f.e. <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproducibility.html" title="Reproducibility">reproducibility</a> of results) and that many of steiner's findings are in conflict with modern science (geology, evolution). i know if noone has said this in a published text it's like original research. on the other hand for a strong statement as 'many scientists/ the scientific community regards it a pseudoscience', i would like to see more references. if it is true it should not be too hard to find them <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrueblood_11de.html" title="User:Trueblood">trueblood</a> 14:48, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trueblood, I think you've touched on the issue here - <i>"unfortunately not many scientist consider it necessary to point that out."</i> - there is, indeed, no reason for scientists to refute Anthroposophy as science. How many scientists make the effort to write a paper refuting the scientific merits of voodoo? And voodoo doesn't have a lobby of people who are willing to defame anyone who says anything against it (like Anthroposophy does). Why would any scientist find it necessary to point out that, no, the brain is not essentially like the intestines (as Steiner suggested - Elephants to Einstein p.146)? So yes, I suggest it WILL be hard to find scientists who have taken more than a glance at Steiner. Where would one start in refuting this? And then, would one be faced with the challenge of Anthroposophists claiming they haven't done "the work" and therefore cannot know what Steiner meant when he said the brain was excrement. What scientists would be interested in opening *that* can of worms? This is the kind of thing skeptics are good at, and are willing to endure. Scientists, generally speaking, don't have any reason to refute Steiner's work - it really refutes itself. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 15:19, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Whether anthroposophy is in consonance with a serious scientific strife or not is not possible to determine on the basis of Hansson's article. A closer look at it from the perspective of the <a href="http://www.thebee.se/SCIENCE/Science.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/SCIENCE/Science.htm" rel="nofollow">Philosophy of Science</a> points to that it is. The article by Hansson was published, when he (probably) still was PhD <a href="http://www.infra.kth.se/~soh/sohcv.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.infra.kth.se/~soh/sohcv.htm" rel="nofollow">student</a> in 1991, nine years after he had been one of the main founders of the ideological sceptical anti-New age organisation "Association Science and Education of the People", and its chair person (probably) since then. His bias is shown by the way he distorts the argumentation in the source he refers to, and the way he does not take into account the difference between theosophy, and anthroposophy as developed by Steiner, separate from theosophy. As such, his article constitutes a prime example of pseudoscience in the basic sense of trying to stand out as scientific, while seriously misrepresenting the published original sources is refers to as basis. Wikipedia should strive to be serious, and use serious sources for what it publishes. The article by Hansson is not a serious source. <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebee_38e5.html" title="User:Thebee">Thebee</a> 11:17, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>That anthroposophy is contested as a science is clear, since a professor of philosophy does so contest it. A professor of philosophy is a little different than many scientists. In any case, Hansson is cited later in the article.</p>

Obviously, an article about a 7-member group wouldn't fly here at Wikipedia and you YOURSELF decided to use a $15 contribution as "membership". With 44 "members", the article wouldn't qualify for swift deletion and you could continue your defamation campaign on Wikipedia. Now that this strategy has backfired, you want to come clean.</dd>

<p>I've got a couple of minutes to address TheBee's comment above - despite that it has been overhauled since the mediation dispute, there is adequate evidence of blatant lying. <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/Myths.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/Myths.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> page for example, produces nothing but strawman arguments and "dispels" the myths surrounding them. It creates the "myths" and then makes them look silly while not addressing the underlying issues that are related to each "myth". <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WAnthroposophyMyth.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WAnthroposophyMyth.htm" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is one of my favorites. First, note how it takes a jab at "small groups of secular humanists" which is what TheBee perceives PLANS to be. But more importantly, it is a blatant lie covering up the truth - which is that Anthroposophy IS taught to students, but not as a specific subject - it is taught in every subject. Notice how the strawman argument is set up by slipping in the words "as content". The complaint is that Waldorf schools teach Anthroposophy, - not "as content" (although there is some Anthroposophical content that slips in to the curriculum) but indirectly as they do with other subjects. Notice part two of the myth "and want to make the pupils into 'anthroposophists'". It sounds pretty ridiculous the way TheBee states it. But in reality, students are bombarded with Anthroposophy from kindergarten (with birthday stories about the rainbow bridge - representing reincarnation and karma) and by high school, the intention is for teachers to legitimize Rudolf Steiner (my own kid had assignments about comparing Steiner's ideas to those of "other prominent" philosophers). The fact that kids are exposed to and immersed in Anthroposophy is absolutely an attempt to open Anthroposophy (something most kids will NEVER hear about) up to them. To suggest that Waldorf schools don't do this is a blatant lie.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WaldorfFAQ.htm#22" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WaldorfFAQ.htm#22" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is another example of a blatant lie, one that is supported by almost all Waldorf teachers who describe Eurythmy in this way. I've written about Eurythmy in the past pointing to Steiner's own descriptions - Rudolf Steiner described it in this way:</p>
<p>"I speak in all humility when I say that within the Anthroposophical Movement there is a firm conviction that a spiritual impulse of this kind must now, at the present time, enter once more into human evolution. And this spiritual impulse must perforce, among its other means of expression, embody itself in a new form of art. It will increasingly be realised that this particular form of art has been given to the world in Eurythmy. It is the task of Anthroposophy to bring a greater depth, a wider vision and a more living spirit into the other forms of art. But the art of Eurythmy could only grow up out of the soul of Anthroposophy; could only receive its inspiration through a purely Anthroposophical conception." From Rudolf Steiner's "Lecture on Eurythmy" August 26, 1923 <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>So really, Eurythmy is a spiritual lesson in Anthroposophy. One could reasonably ask the question - why is a spiritual (according to Steiner), Anthroposophical activity so heavily entrenched in the Waldorf curriculum that claims not to teach Anthroposophy? TheBee is in the business of covering up the truth if that's what it takes to support Waldorf enterprises.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WaldorfFAQ.htm#8" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WaldorfFAQ.htm#8" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an interesting answer to the question "Who was Rudolf Steiner". I suppose when a parent asks this question, this response would be adequate to hide Steiner's influence in Waldorf.</p>
<p>There is very little on the site that is objective, or even remotely close to a truthful representation of Waldorf. That's why AWSNA ranks it highly - it's basically a brochure for Waldorf and a place where critics of Waldorf are attacked without AWSNA's fingerprints. It is ALL original research and the term "research" in this case is very loosly applied.

<p>When I contributed to the editing of the article on the group, I added this info on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PLANS&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=62740893" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PLANS&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=62740893" rel="nofollow">8 July</a> 2006, writing:</p>

<dd>I'm only trying to keep the views balanced. It may not seem that way for you, and maybe my approach isn't the same approach you would take - but I feel like I have to push my POV very strongly to get any compromise from them. IMO, HGilbert and TheBee are intent on maintaining their disinformation campaign - forever - and it really is disinformation and their behavior has been dishonest (disguising biased sources for example). It serves them to do this because they are heavily connected to Waldorf and they are doing Anthroposophical missionary work. I don't think it's a good thing because, as Waldorf teachers, their behavior here makes all Waldorf teachers look bad. The "mountain of evidence" I presented didn't create itself. It was the product of a long and determined effort by HGilbert to establish a dominant presence on Wikipedia for Waldorf and Anthroposophy and to fend off anyone who challenged his biased POV. And there have been many, many editors who have tried to make the articles read NPOV and who eventually gave up because of HGilbert's POV pushing. Whenever they would make an undisputable point, HGilbert would go silent. Even when some NPOV edits make it into the articles, HGilbert has been able to wait out the editors and re-insert the same POV edits after they have moved on. I wish I had unlimited room here to present another mountain or two of examples of HGilbert doing this. It may be more blahblah to you, but really, nobody is forcing you to read it. HGilbert and TheBee are quite capable of defending themselves, here. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 00:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>HGilbert, we seem to be having another issue with (big surprise) racism in Anthroposophy. This usually takes, and has again taken, the form of critics being allowed to have a reference while supporters are allowed to quote selectively and distort what Steiner had to say. Unless both sides of this issue are quoted, neither side may be quoted. The continuous attempts by Steiner supporters to paint critics as if they are less able to comprehend Steiner is obvious and ridiculous. Please discuss these types of verbose edits beforehand and we can avoid the edit wars. BTW, there are a lot more edits that need to be made to this article to bring it to a NPOV.

<dd>concerning the staudenmeyer quote. it is exactly this anthropop=nazism that i think is inappropiate and way over the top. why does it need to be here? quote: The affinities with Nazi discourse are unmistakable. Wolfgang Treher makes a convincing case that Steiner's racial theories, especially the repeated scheme of a small minority evolving further while a large mass declines, bear striking similarities even in detail to Hitler's own theories. He concludes: "Concentration camps, slave labor and the murder of Jews constitute a praxis whose key is perhaps to be found in the 'theories' of Rudolf Steiner."</dd>

<p>As PeteK knows well since long, Staudenmaier is a repeatedly unreliable author on anthroposophy. In the article used by PeteK as reference, published since 2000 at the site of the WC, Staudenmaier at the beginning makes untruthful assertions about among other things the first lecture in a series held by Steiner in Oslo in 1910. The lecture is a published historical source, found at among other places here: <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a> but also at other places on the net. It shows that Staudenmaier's description of it is untruthful, that Steiner says nothing of what Staudenmaier asserts in the second part of his introduction, and that Staudenmaier thereby is an unreliable author on the subject. <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Staudenmaier.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Staudenmaier.html" rel="nofollow">ON THE STORIES BY PETER STAUDENMAIER</a> describes and discusses the article by Staudenmaier more in detail, and also quotes Staudenmaier as well as other sources <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-Heinrich-von-Treitschke.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-Heinrich-von-Treitschke.htm" rel="nofollow">3</a>, <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-JuliusLangbehn.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-JuliusLangbehn.htm" rel="nofollow">3</a>, allegedly described by him for comparison of what he writes about them. They confirm that Staudenmaier is an unreliable author on anthroposophy.</p>
<p>All three cases (1, 2, and 3) only constitute simple source critique by in full documenting the published historical sources allegedly described by P.S., and none constitute "original research" in the sense prohibited by Wikipedia (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), in terms of</p>

<p>Nothing beats direct relevant evidence, regardless of what academic title someone might have formally or not. The direct evidence of the unreliability of P.S. are the published lectures by Steiner, that P.S. asserts that he describes, as historical sources, published on the net, as also in printed form. The published lecture that P.S. at the beginning of his article asserts that he describes is found at among other places <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>It immediately reveals that P.S. does not tell the truth, but some wholly other story about it that he has made up, only existing in his own mind. Only last year, after repeated criticism of it, five years after its first publication, and his repeated defence of the "truthfulness" of what he has written in his "story", did he, as a "serious historian" slightly edit it to remove the most obvious evidence of his unreliability, while keeping as much as possible of it as a mind game for the readers to sort out.

<p>To be able to call the direct evidence of the unreliability of P.S.' article in the form of the published historical source he asserts he describes, on the net, "original research" in the sense and spirit described by Wikipedia, you need to demonstrate that it falls in one of the seven categories that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> lists as criteria for "original research", quoted above, prohibited to use as basis for writing things, and using as citation, at Wikipedia.

<p>"Each person proceeds through race after race. Those that are young souls incarnate in the races that have remained behind on earlier racial levels. In this way, the races and souls that live around us take on a physical and spiritual structure. Everything makes sense, everything becomes clear and explicable. We are moving closer and closer to the solution of this puzzle and we can realize that in the future we will have other epochs to go through, we will have other paths to follow than the ones made by race. We must be clear about the difference between soul development and racial development. Our own souls once lived within the Atlantean race, and they then developed themselves upward to a higher race. That gives us an image of the evolution of humankind up until our time. In this way we can comprehend how to justify the principle, the core principle of universal brotherhood without regard to race, color, status, and so forth. I will explain this thought in particular later. Today I simply wanted to show how the same essence appears in different forms, and in fact in a much more correct sense than natural science would have us believe. Our souls march from one level to the next, which is to say from one race to the next, and we come to know the meaning of humanity when we examine these races." (Steiner, Die Welträtsel und die Anthroposophie pp. 153-4)</p>
<p>It's clear to see that Steiner is NOT saying all races are equal - but that souls progress from one race to the next. He talks explicitly about "higher races". This is incredible nonsense you are presenting here HGilbert. You should really try to stop putting up selectively harvested quotes to try to present an image of Steiner that wasn't there. I'm removing your claim. Please stop wasting everyone's time with this nonsense. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 20:17, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>If there is any question about whether the above is an isolated quote, here are a few from the SAME source that HGilbert attempts to cite as a source that Steiner "advocated" that the races are equal:</p>
<p>"We carry within us the consciousness of a unified nature and essence that lies within all people. But what is the relationship of this unified nature and essence to the myriad forms and physiognomies that we encounter in the various races? This question arises for us especially when we consider how different the natural abilities, how different the talents of the individual races are [wie verschieden veranlagt, wie verschieden begabt die einzelnen Menschenrassen sind]. The one race stands at the level of what we call the highest civilization, while the other stands at what appears to be the most primitive, subordinate level of civilization. This may make it seem odd to us that the human being, who after all has a unified nature, can appear in such a different and imperfect form. People often feel that it is an injustice of nature that some are doomed to an existence in a race that stands far below, while others are raised up to an apparently perfect race." (Rudolf Steiner, Die Welträtsel und die Anthroposophie p. 132)</p>
<p>"And when we examine the issue more closely, we see that human souls proceed through the different races. In this way the variety of races becomes sensible and reasonable. Thus we see that one is not condemned to live only in a primitive race while another stands at the highly developed stages of racial existence. Each of us passes through the different racial stages, and the passage signifies a progressive development for the individual soul. One who appears today as a member of the European race went through different races in earlier times, and will in later times proceed through races other than ours. The races appear to us as steps in a teaching process, and this variety takes on coherence and purpose." (Steiner, Die Welträtsel und die Anthroposophie p. 133)</p>
<p>"When we look at the people of today we can see that they have developed themselves forth out of those earlier stages of existence. That which is primitive does not always disappear immediately when the higher appears. The primitive preserves itself initially and modifies itself in various ways. Thus we can say: a portion of the earlier Atlantean population migrated from Atlantis to Europe and then on to Asia and founded colonies, while another portion remained behind, such that we now have the most diverse stages existing side by side." (Steiner, Die Welträtsel und die Anthroposophie p. 142)</p>
<p>"But if you contemplate the past from the perspective of spiritual science, you will gain a very different view. You will find that our white civilized humankind [unsere weiße Kulturmenschheit] originated because certain elements segregated themselves from the Atlanteans and developed themselves higher here, under different climatic conditions. Certain elements of the Atlantean population remained behind, at earlier levels; thus we can see that the peoples of Asia and America are remnants of the various Atlantean races." (Steiner, Die Welträtsel und die Anthroposophie p. 145)</p>
<p>I would suggest that HGilbert is grasping at straws when he attempts to cite this reference as evidence that Steiner advocated equality of the races. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 00:17, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Above, I have pointed out that what Staudenmaier writes in the introduction to his article is untruthful, and that this is revealed by a simple, direct comparison of what he writes with the historical source, published on the internet: <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/MissFolk1929/19100607p01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/MissFolk1929/19100607p01.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> that he asserts that he describes. What is written in articles at Wikipedia should be based on reliable sources, and only such sources should be cited in articles. The article (and thereby its author) you repeatedly insert a link to, while repeatedly removing all well referenced citation to other published sources, that contradict what you write, is not a reliable source. For you to show that a direct comparison of a text with the original, published in full on the internet, that it asserts that it describes, constitutes "original research", you need to show that such a comparison falls in one of the seven categories, described by Wikipedia as defining "original research". I asked you four days ago to do this (see above), and you still have not done this. I have therefore removed the citation you give for your statement. <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebee_38e5.html" title="User:Thebee">Thebee</a> 16:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>None of this is accurate from what I can discern. Why don't you actually discuss this, if you really need to, instead of producing these pre-packaged defamatory arguments that have already been refuted countless times. Maybe someone else here finds this tail-chasing interesting. If you actually have something that represents that Mr. Staudenmaier is not a reliable source, and that comes from someone other than an Anthroposophist, I'd love to see it. It is my understanding that Mr. Staudenmaier is a candidate for a PhD from Cornell and his dissertation is on Steiner. If he's lying about Steiner, it seems to be pretty bad luck for Anthroposophists. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 00:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>In the introduction to the paper by Mr. Staudenmaier, that you insist on citing as a "reliable source" on anthroposophy at the end of the Wikipedia article on it, he writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>In June 1910 Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, began a speaking tour of Norway with a lecture to a large and attentive audience in Oslo. The lecture was titled ‘The Mission of Individual European National Souls in Relation to Nordic-Germanic Mythology.</i>’ [...]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The ‘national souls’ of Northern and Central Europe were, Steiner explained, components of the ‘germanic-nordic sub-race,’ the world's most spiritually advanced ethnic group, which was in turn the vanguard of the highest of five historical ‘root races.’ This superior fifth root race, Steiner told his Oslo audience, was naturally the ‘Aryan race.</i>’“</dd>
</dl>
<p>The actual well documented lecture as a historical source that he asserts that he describes is found <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It says nothing of what Mr. Staudenmaier writes in the second part of the quote from his article, but describes the nature of and relation between the basic beings of the spiritual world and the human being as a spiritual being from the perspective of the Jewish esoteric tradition in the spirit of Thomas of Aquino and Steiner's view of how we as humans and the beings of the spiritual world, as described by the Judeo-Christian tradition, have interacted in some respects through history, in Steiner's view.</p>
<p>On 1 October 2001, more than one year after he wrote the article, Mr. Staudenmaier, after actually having bought the lecture series on a visit to Germany during the summer, and seemingly read it, he writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">published version of the lecture</a> doesn't contradict <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Staudenmaier.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Staudenmaier.html" rel="nofollow">my description</a> of it.

<p>Above, I document why I think Mr. Staudenmaier (P.S.) cannot be considered a reliable source with regard to anthroposophy. The basis for this view is - among other things - the way he for five years (2000-2005) has misrepresented the content of a lecture by Steiner in 1910 in the introduction to the article, that PeteK insists on repeatedly adding as citation at the end of the article on Anthroposophy. Last summer, Mr. Dugan, webmaster of the WC-site added a slightly revised version of the article to the WC-site. In the 'revised' version, M. Staudenmaier has reworded the introduction and removed the specific reference to the first lecture in the lecture series he asserts that he describes. But Mr. Dugan forgot to remove the original article from the WC-site, as shown by PeteK's link to it.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation is documented by the actual on the net published lecture by Steiner, that P.S. in the introduction to his article asserts that he describes. The lecture is published <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/MissFolk1929/19100607p01.html" class="external text" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/MissFolk1929/19100607p01.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It is also published in German somewhere on the net.</p>
<p>On 1 october 2001, P.S. in <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/waldorf-critics/read/message.html?mid=1708444269" class="external text" title="http://lists.topica.com/lists/waldorf-critics/read/message.html?mid=1708444269" rel="nofollow">a posting</a> on the WC-discussion list asserted, after having read the lecture, that he had not had access to when he wrote the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The published version of the lecture doesn't contradict my description of it. The sole discrepancy is the word 'sub-race'."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This statement can be compared to the actual published lecture, published on the internet (at two sites linked to above), that he refers to.</p>
<p>Do you think this is relevant and valid with regard to judging the reliability of P.S. as author on anthroposophy?</p>
<p>I'd be interested in hearing how you view this (except for PeteK, who has already told his view of this, and acted on it by repeatedly again adding a link to the article by P.S., after the citation has been removed by Hgilbert).</p>

<dd>Ask him. The article as such is not about the lecture. It's just mentioned in passing in the introduction. That was a mistake by P.S., that he has spent much time trying to cover up for, to save his credibility as "historical scholar". But he had not read the lecture series either, just read about it. For some of this history, see <a href="http://www.americans4waldorf.org/MrStaudenmaier2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.americans4waldorf.org/MrStaudenmaier2.html" rel="nofollow">here and onwards</a>. In his posting on 1 Oct. he tells that he just added the introduction as an "inventory device" "for the Norway hook" (where his article was first published):
<dl>
<dd>"<i>I used it merely for the Norway hook and to introduce Steiner's terminology.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(The theosophical terminology of "root races" and "sub races of root races", that Steiner explicitly critizised among other <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/RSOnInvalidityOfRace.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/RSOnInvalidityOfRace.htm" rel="nofollow">1909</a>, abandon and did not use when in 1909 writing <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/RSP1963/GA013_index.html" class="external text" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/RSP1963/GA013_index.html" rel="nofollow">"Occult Science"</a>, just meaning "esoteric" science about what is "hidden" in the sense not immediately obvious, not anything sinister, as immediately becomes clear, if one reads it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If he denies not having read the lecture when writing the article, I'll find the documentation, telling he had not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If he had, why would he simply not have told the truth of what Steiner actually said in the lecture in the first place? And why did he then 23 months later (1 Oct 2001), when he actually probably <i><b>had</b></i> read the lecture judging from what he then writes about it (he had bought it during a trip to Germany during the summer), again (this time) actually lie about what it said (not just tell the untruth he himself "believed" and was convinced was true)?

Neither the first lecture, nor the sixth lecture, nor any other lecture, nor the fantasy lecture (the "actual" "not published" "actual" sixth lecture of the series, that Staudenmaier in his mind has made up the existence of to save his credibility as "historical scholar" from dropping dead ...). Ask him. Also, ask him to quote from the "actual", in 1922 not published sixth lecture in the series he has in his mind. That would be from the transcript of the series, published in 1911, the year after it was held.) I very much doubt he can, as he (probably) has not read that either. If he had, he would have quoted it. He never has. Is he an insult to the concept of "historical scholar" in any serious sense?

<p>I've looked into this a bit. This is a VERY OLD discussion that was completely dispelled years ago. The issue at hand was that Peter Staudenmaier referenced an Anthroposophical source which contained mistakes. He later corrected his own mistake which was to reference the Anthroposopical source in the first place. The question about the 1st or 6th lecture is there because of different numbering schemes used by different people. It's like people have trouble agreeing on the correct order for the Chronicles of Narnia. The lectures have been shuffled by various people.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're wrong. No lecture has been shuffled from holding it to its publication. The were all held consecutively and then published in the same order as they were held, with the publication telling which date and where they were held. Lecture six was always lecture six, both in the series of lectures held in June 1910 in Oslo, and later in the publication of them through a number of editions up to this day (last year). <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebee_38e5.html" title="User:Thebee">Thebee</a> 18:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Yes, so what? As an historian, Mr. Staudenmaier works with lots of sources, some of them original texts, some published in German, some later published in English, sometimes multiple versions are translated by different translators, and so forth. Are you saying that he didn't read this lecture until he purchased it in the form he talks about? Frankly, this sounds like you blowing a lot of smoke. Again, this has all been discussed many times in the past and your claims have been proven to be false. Why bring them here?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"So what?" He's talking about a lecture, repeatedly republished at different times, that anyone interested can find and read on the internet in English, and anyone can check if he's telling the truth about the specific lecture he refers to (the <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">first lecture</a>, <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/MissFolk1929/19100607p01.html" class="external text" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/MissFolk1929/19100607p01.html" rel="nofollow">also here</a> in the published lecture series, nothing else.) It does not say a word of what he says it says in the second part of his introduction (see above) says. Only, the next day (2 Oct.), he asserts that he hasn't been talking about the first lecture in the series that he has been holding in his hand, asserting that that specific published lecture (the first in the published lecture series) does <i><b>not</b></i> contradict what he has written about that specific lecture. That's con artistry. He's a master at it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing indicates that he read any of the published lectures in any language before he wrote the introduction to his article, making up his stories about them. He only read them after he had written his article. None of my claims with regard to Staudenmaier's article have been proven false at any time. Your "mistake" here in actually linking to the original version of the article by Staudenmaier, instead of the five years later "corrected" version reveal his original untruthfulness. <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebee_38e5.html" title="User:Thebee">Thebee</a> 18:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>Why does he need to change his reference, if the published first lecture, as he writes on 1 Oct, does not contradict his description of it, except on the "small" point of - according to Staudenmaier - not mentioning "the word sub race"? He sees that what he writes about it on 1 Oct 2001 is not true, and realizes it is not a good idea to stick to it. So, the next step is to invent a "real" lecture, that in his fantasy corresponds to what he writes in the introduction to his article, and telling, not that his fantasy lecture is the "basis" for the published first lecture, but the "basis" for the published sixth lecture, without in any way documenting this, or quoting from it ...

<p>So your claim here is that he "invented" a lecture because the information he cited from the first lecture (which was renumbered as the 6th when it was published) was actually contained in the 6th lecture.

<dd>To my knowledge no lecture in the lecture series was ever renumbered at any time, from the time it was held to its publication. Nothing points to that the lecture P.S. has invented the existence of and made up a "description" of in the introduction to his article (that you repeatedly insist on giving as "citation" at the end of the article) ever existed anywhere outside his own fantasy. At no time has he told where it has been documented with the content he ascribes to it, given a proper citation for it, or quoted from it in a way that would support what he writes about it. The issue is not whether he should be locked up or not, but if he is to be considered a reliable "historical scholar" or not.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The issue is: is P.S. someone one can rely on as a reliable source on Steiner and anthroposophy. The introduction is just one of many examples showing he isn't.</dd>

<p>"My personal favorite of Tarjei's denials of history is his post from September 2001 where he claimed that I had made "three factual errors" in the first two sentences of my article on anthroposophy and ecofascism. All three of these "errors" turned out to be his; he didn't even bother to look up the easy ones before spouting off about them, and made a complete fool of himself. Even after we caught him red-handed he continued to deny the simplest historical realities. Indeed I can't think of a single substantive historical issue where Tarjei didn't shoot himself in the foot, whether the question at stake was Steiner's father's job or the specifics of the Nazi versions of the Aryan myth. In other words, Mike, if you're looking for reliable support for a pro-Waldorf stance, for goodness sake don't look to Tarjei."</p>

<dd>What you write is irrelevant to the issue discussed here. If Mr. Staudenmaier at any time from 2000 up to 2005 had found any citation for what he claims is the (first the first, then) the "actual" sixth lecture in the lecture series, as he purports to "describe" it in the introduction to his article, one can assume that he - after five years - would had added it, when he "revised" the article for the sites where it is published. He hasn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead he has just dropped the reference to the "first"/"sixth" lecture in the new version, after he has spent much time during a number of years, first defending the fantasy he has made up about it as true, up to 1 Oct., when he asserts that the <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">first</a> lecture in the published lecture series "doesn't contradict" what he writes about it in the introduction to his article (except with regard to one word.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then, the following day he tells he has not - actually - been talking about the first, but the sixth lecture in the series, but not the published lecture, but something else, not possible to document in any form as he describes it, except in the mind of Mr. Staudenmaier himself. And then, when he publishes a "revised" version of the article, he has just dropped the reference to any specific lecture in the series.</dd>

<dd>The "reasonable" explanation here is that you are completely mistaken about this, and you have no influence over whether Mr. Staudenmaier edits his article in accordance with your wishes or not.

<p>From the sentence "Our own souls once lived within the Atlantean race, and they then developed themselves upward to a higher race." it is clear that he is talking of what in theosophy are called "root races", not "the five manin races of humanity". They refer to the stages of humanity from the beginning to end of our present solar system. For a closer description of the issue, see <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/ThreeConcepts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/ThreeConcepts.htm" rel="nofollow">Three misleading concepts</a>. In ever more developing anthroposophy, separate from theosophy, he used the more proper term "Earth epochs". What is referred to as "the Atlantean root race" in theosophy, in the lecture above referred to as the "Atlantean race" in Steiner's view refers to mankind during Cenozoic time (ref: one of the conferences with teachers), that is Tertiary and Quaternary.</p>
<p>It probably appears clear to most, that the human forms developing during (Tertiary and) Quaternary developed from 'lower' to 'higher' forms, and that the human forms that started to develop during the end of the glacial ages and later developed into modern humans are more 'highly' developed than those human forms that preceded them. That is what the text bloc refers to, not what later - from the time of Blumenbacher at the end of the 18th century - has come to be referred to as the 'five main races of humankind'.</p>
<p>You must distinguish between the at least three different senses in which he used the broad term and concept 'race' at different times. When Steiner spoke of the "equality" of races, it clearly referred to the 'five main races of humankind', not the 'sub races of Atlantean time', being the successive human forms that developed during Tertiary and Quaternary, and also not the 'root races of humanity', starting with the in the main spiritual form we - in Steiner's view - had from the first beginning of our present solar system, when - in Steiners' view - the different planets had not yet forme as planteray bodies, separate from the developing (contracting) Sun.</p>
<p>While what in theosophy is referred to as 'root races' and 'sub races of Atlantis' in one sense can be described as having a 'hierarchival' relation to each other, in having develope sequentially from 'lower' to higher' forms, that is not the case with the 'five main races of humankind', and Steiner never, as far as I'm aware of, referred to one as 'higher' than the other. is Steiner 'difficult' and takes time to understand? Yes.</p>

<dd>Thanks for more original research - and, BTW, Wikipedia is not a soapbox - nor is it a place to advertise your websites and your original research. Do you really want to make the statement that Steiner never referred to one race as higher than another? I'll give you some quotes:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"The relation between soul-development and race-development is preserved to us in a wonderful myth. Let us imagine race following race, civilization following civilization. The soul going through its earth mission in the right way is incarnated in a certain race; it strives upward in this race, and acquires the capacities of this race in order next time to be incarnated in a <b>higher</b> one. Only the souls which sink in the race and do not work out of the physical materiality, are held back in the race by their own weight, as one might say. They appear a second time in the same race and eventually a third time in bodies in similarly formed races. Such souls hold back the bodies of the race. This has been wonderfully described in a legend. We know, indeed, that man progresses further in the fulfillment of the mission of the earth by following the great Leaders of humanity who point out the goals to be attained; if he rejects them, if he does not follow them, he must remain behind with his race, for he cannot then get beyond it. Let us think of a personality who has the good fortune to meet a great Leader of humanity, let us suppose such a personality confronting Christ Jesus himself, for example; he sees how all his deeds are evidence for leading humanity forward, but he will have nothing to do with this progress, he rejects the Leader of humanity. Such a personality, such a soul would be condemned to remain in the race. If we follow this thought to its conclusion such a soul would have to appear again and again in the same race, and we have the legend of Ahasuerus who had to appear in the same race again and again because he rejected Christ Jesus. Great truths concerning the evolution of humanity are placed before us in such a legend as this." (Rudolf Steiner, The Apocalypse of St. John, pp. 80-81)</p>
<p>"Each person proceeds through race after race. Those that are young souls incarnate in the races that have remained behind on earlier racial levels. In this way, the races and souls that live around us take on a physical and spiritual structure. Everything makes sense, everything becomes clear and explicable. We are moving closer and closer to the solution of this puzzle and we can realize that in the future we will have other epochs to go through, we will have other paths to follow than the ones made by race. We must be clear about the difference between soul development and racial development. Our own souls once lived within the Atlantean race, and they then developed themselves upward to a <b>higher</b> race. That gives us an image of the evolution of humankind up until our time. In this way we can comprehend how to justify the principle, the core principle of universal brotherhood without regard to race, color, status, and so forth. I will explain this thought in particular later. Today I simply wanted to show how the same essence appears in different forms, and in fact in a much more correct sense than natural science would have us believe. Our souls march from one level to the next, which is to say from one race to the next, and we come to know the meaning of humanity when we examine these races." (Steiner, Die Welträtsel und die Anthroposophie pp. 153-4)</p>
<p>"For peoples and races are but steps leading to pure humanity. A race or a nation stands so much the <b>higher</b>, the more perfectly its members express the pure, ideal human type, the further they have worked their way from the physical and perishable to the supersensible and imperishable. The evolution of man through the incarnations in ever <b>higher</b> national and racial forms is thus a process of liberation. Man must finally appear in harmonious perfection." (Steiner, Knowledge of Higher Worlds p. 207)</p>
<p>"People who listen to the great leaders of humankind, and preserve their soul with its eternal essence, reincarnate in an <b>advanced</b> race; in the same way he who ignores the great teacher, who rejects the great leader of humankind, will always reincarnate in the same race, because he was only able to develop the one form. This is the deeper meaning of Ahasver, who must always reappear in the same form because he rejected the hand of the greatest leader, Christ. Thus each person has the opportunity to become caught up in the essence of one incarnation, to push away the leader of humankind, or instead to undergo the transformation into <b>higher</b> races, toward ever <b>higher perfection</b>. Races would never become decadent, never decline, if there weren't souls that are unable to move up and unwilling to move up to a <b>higher racial form</b>. Look at the races that have survived from earlier eras: they only exist because some souls could not climb higher." (Steiner, Das Hereinwirken geistiger Wesenheiten in den Menschen p. 174)</p>

<dd>Have I not cracked a book by Steiner? Clearly I have, and I'm not trying to pull anyone's leg either. But you seem - pardon me for saying it - so obsessed with trying to show that Steiner a number of times described human groups as lower and higher, that you you don't seem to care what he actually was referring too with the word 'race' at different times, the theosophical 'root race' sense (the sequential human groups developing from beginning to end of our present solar system), the theosophical 'sub races of Atlantis sense' (being the from at first not very human to later ever more human forms developing from beginning of Tertiary to the end of Quaternary time), or the way it normally is understood today, being the 'five main races of humanity', as long as you can bolderize the word '<b>higher'</b>, <b>higher</b>, <b>higher</b>, <b>higher</b> in one or other quote from Steiner without trying to understand what he actually meant with the broad word "race" in the different contexts he was discusing and in what sense he used it at different times, in two of the three cases using 'higher' in a justified sense, and in the third clearly not (which I also never have seen him do in an explicit way), with your primary purpose to push for a simplified POV of the issue.</dd>

<dd>As always, these discussions with you seem to go nowhere and are a waste of time. What you present is nothing but an apology for Steiner. The man deserves much more. He truly believed in higher and lower races. That you seem embarassed by this is not my problem. That you try with your pretzel-twisted logic to make it seem like he's saying something else is no longer a surprise. The quotes are from all over the place including Knowledge of Higher Worlds and The Apocalypse of St. John. This same terminology and the same concepts are EVERYWHERE in Steiner's works. That man works from lower to higher races (the white race being the highest) is one of the foundations of Anthroposophy. I really don't care if you think my POV on this issue is "simplified". If you think the nuances of evolutions on different planets, and formless beings on Lemuria and Atlantis in Steiner's racism need to be expressed, <b>write a book</b>. This is an encyclopedia article and it requires simplification. Steiner said these things - and he meant them exactly in the way they read. He lectured to lots and lots of different people and it is unreasonable for you to presume or to ask anyone to believe that the members of his audience, not to mention everyone who purchased his books, garnered a particular level of understanding of his prior works. He spoke to a new audience every night - and he went from town to town. Therefore, a reasonable assumption would be that he actually meant what he said. Now if you are suggesting, as I believe you are, that Steiner never elevated, say, the white race above the black race - then I'll have to produce more quotes for you. Is this what you are claiming? <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 02:17, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Pete K writes above (16:08, 10 December 2006 (UTC)):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The fact remains, you recently altered your WaldorfAnswers website considerably when it became a point of criticism during these proceedings. This alteration of the evidence might not seem dishonest to you.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>He also writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>For a sample of what used to be on WaldorfAnswers, I believe the clone site <a href="http://www.americans4waldorf.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.americans4waldorf.org/" rel="nofollow">AWE</a> still has some of the material that was available on WaldorfAnswers.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>What he writes is false on all three points (considerable alteration of Waldorf Answers, alleged dishonesty in doing this, and that the AWE site still has some material, that - before the alleged recent considerable alteration - was found at the Waldorf Answers site, but that now only is found at the site of AWE).</p>
<p>The false accusation constitutes a serious, unfounded personal attack.</p>
<p>It seems to be rooted in the discovery by PeteK, that an earlier allegation by him that the sites Waldorf Answers and Americans for Waldorf Education are "clones" of each other, has not been true. He has stated (2 Sept.) that the site of Waldorf Answers is is a site "replete with defamation and non-verifyable (outright lies) information." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Waldorf_education&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73453477" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Waldorf_education&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73453477" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>He now has found out that he cannot show that what he has written has been true and makes the personal attack to be able to stick to his description of Waldorf answers from 2 Sept.</p>

<dd>Finally. One comment on the issue of Staudenmaier. Thanks. While the point you mention is relevant to the discussion, it is secondary to the actual issue - if what Staudenmaier writes in his article, as exemplified by its introduction, actually is truthful in relation to the source he asserts that he describes. Both his article and the published historical source he asserts that he describes in the introduction to his soup are published on the internet. This makes it possible and easy for anyone who can read (and has a computer with internet access) to check and come to a judgement on the issue, which is very simple.</dd>

Both a simple comparison of what Staudenmaier writes abut the lecture series, where he - without having read the lecture series - made the mistake on including a reference to <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">the first lecture</a> in the series in the introduction to his article, and his following insistence, using a number of unsubstantiated and untrue <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Staudenmaier.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Staudenmaier.html" rel="nofollow">transitional stories</a> to try to save his credibility as author on anthroposophy, and <a href="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/Steiner/Folkspirits/1-GeneralIntroduction.htm" rel="nofollow">the actual published historical source</a> in full reveal the completely unpredictable unreliability of what he writes, which makes what he writes in the article and himself into an unacceptible source in articles related to anthroposophy at Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(I have focussed on the first lecture in the series to keep the issue simple and is so revealing with regard to the reliability of Staudenmaier's writings on anthroposophy. I could have used many other examples, that however would have been more difficult to penetrate for the general internet user, as they refer to sources, not published on the internet. I have however mentioned two more examples <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-Heinrich-von-Treitschke.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-Heinrich-von-Treitschke.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-JuliusLangbehn.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thebee.se/comments/PS/Steiner-on-JuliusLangbehn.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a>, of Staudenmaier's "scholarship" at my personal page on his many stories, as they refer to a source that also is published on the internet - Steiner's autobiography.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In relation to this, it is quite uninteresting if he has published anything else in one or other peer reviewed journal. So have all the author of the major scientific frauds the last years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have tried to in full and in detail motivate a removal of Staudenmaier as unreliable source on anthroposophy for almost two weeks before now taking it up again, after repeatedly asking for comments by other editors, and noone has answered. Noone except PeteK has opposed to it, while evading the central issue, the simple point in the citation, that PeteK repeatedly insists on adding to the article, that reveals Staudenmaier's unpredictable unreliability as source on anthroposophy.</dd>

<dd>PeteK's new mentor suggests that he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lethaniol/Pete_K#First_Edit_War_Started" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lethaniol/Pete_K#First_Edit_War_Started" rel="nofollow">gives up</a> P.S. as citation, and that the section he has added and worked at building in the article be reduced to a reasonable size.</dd>

<dd>Thebee, I would take extreme care in paraphrasing any of my advice to my mentees, in the future. I have suggested that it may be a possibility to give up the Staudenmaier reference and seek other notable references, but I have given a range of other options including - keeping it, using Staudenmaier references with care, when using <i>some</i> Staudenmaier ref state that they are opinion, never using Staudenmaier ref, asking for a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> on inclusion Staudenmaier references etc etc...

<p>Was this article ever published any where or not? The latest link to the article is to a <b>self-published</b> blog article--not worthy at wikipedia, Pete K. If the article was published by a respectable publisher then it requires more then original research by you, thebee, or any other contributor to wikipedia to disqualify it. I also suggest that you two stop looking over each others shoulders and get straight how to better the article. That means using wikipedia's rules instead of making up your own.

<p>I shouldn't have to explain things to you throughout this process, but rather than risk more edit wars by you, here is the issue. The report was an independent report by independent, not-Anthroposophists. It was published in an Anthroposophical source. This is NOT what the arbitration committee is talking about - the committee is objecting to Anthroposophists whose work is published in Anthroposophical sources.

<dl>
<dd>That statement is correct. In PoF, Steiner talks about thinking and how to approach it. He does NOT talk about Anthroposophy and thinking is no more related to Anthroposophy than is eating or sleeping. PoF was not a pre-cursor to Anthroposophy. One does not follow the other. There is NO Anthroposophy contained in PoF... NONE. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 18:59, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>Doesn't matter AT ALL if Steiner made this claim AFTER he wrote Philosophy of Freedom... For Philosophy of Freedom to be a pre-cursor to Anthroposophy, Steiner would have had to have made this claim BEFORE Anthroposophy was conceived - in your case, before 1894. The claim was made afterward - long afterward - long after PoF and long after Anthroposophy. He connected the two later - not before. That's a big difference and one can look at his writings and discern a distinct difference. It isn't up to you, or other Anthroposophists or even Steiner to decide after the fact whether Anthroposophy is contained in PoF. It was written before Anthroposophy was invented and this is clearly visible in the historical record. I'm not interested in what Anthroposophists have to say about the subject. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 19:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>For it to be a "precursor to anthroposophy", Steiner would have to have made the claim before there was anthropsophy? That makes no sense at all. <i>Precursor</i> to anthroposophy <b>means</b> the PHilosophy of Freedom came before it, not that any official <i>pronnouncement</i> equating the two came before it. If the author of the philosophy and the people who <b>follow</b> the philosophy believe the two are related, how is that not relevant?

<p>Pete K, you've rewritten the sentence in the article to now say: "The epistemic basis for Steiner's <b>pre</b>-Anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, The Philosophy of Freedom". The source actually says, "In The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, Steiner lays out with philosophical rigor the tenets of his epistemology which serves as the foundation for his later anthroposophical texts." No "pre". The sentence as you've re-written it isn't accurate to the source. Madness. And you lectured me about the need for "EXACTLY" representing sources, and at the same time in a new POV sentence about "most medical practitioners" judging Steiner medicine as "quackery" or "fraud" by adding a source that doesn't say this. The author himself thinks it's quackery, but you change it to "most medical practioners". If anything, the reference is a complaint against the preety long list of officials, academicians, journalists, and others who don't associate alternative medicine with quackery.</p>
<p>Is the ink dry on the arbitration decision? I don't think the proposed remedies are going to help. Stronger medicine is needed around here. Venado 20:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, "Foundation" - means "pre" - it sets up the "thinking". The source you have provided doesn't say PoF was an Anthroposophical text - in fact it says the opposite - that it set up the "later" Anthroposophical texts. I don't see how two people can read the same sentence and find it saying two different things. Please re-read your OWN reference. Also, please don't lump Anthroposophical medicine with Alternative medicines in order to mainstream it... it is different than alternative medicines that have been accepted by mainstream physicians - a lot different. Most physicians DO NOT support Anthroposophical medicine - we shouldn't have to take a vote here, but are you suggesting that 51% or all physicians buy into AM's nonsense? I'll go back and re-write the "most practitioners" part but to suggest there's a long list of mainstream practitioners who accept AM is nonsense. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 20:58, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>You're interpretation is meaningless. The sentence in the wp article says Philosophy of Freedom is a "seminal" work to anthroposophy...that means "seed". The wp article describes it as the "basis", which is a synonym for "foundation", which is the word used in the source. And just conform to reference sources for claims you make in the article. It doesn't say anything at all about how many mainstream practioners view anthroposophical medicine as quackery. Read your sources before you put them in. (Just the same, read other references before you take them out.) Anthroposophical medicine is considered an alternative medicine by your own source. It's not my "confusion". Alternative medicine is what the article is about, it's even in the title, anthroposophicl medicine being just one among all the rest he's talking about. Anthroposophical medicine in this article is given just the barest passing mention! Venado 22:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I get that you're upset. Don't be. PoF is not Anthroposophy - it never was, and it never will be. Trying to redefine terms isn't going to get you anywhere. You are trying to alter the truth and that is always a losing proposition. PoF pre-dates Anthroposophy and contains no Anthroposophy. The only "seed" it sets is internalized thinking - not exactly breaking new ground for philosophy. I provided sourced for Anthroposophical medicine. One is supportive of it and is used to demonstrate that non-MD's can gain professional status in Anthroposophical medicine. In the other two - one calls AM quackery, the other calls the iscador treatment for cancer quackery. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 15:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>I'm not a paid-up anthroposophist. I'm in the strange position... that Steiner gave me the <b>scientific integrity of method</b>... to reach further than Steiner on occasions... to end up disagreeing with some of Steiner's conclusions! Thebee wanted help with the "geting" I think. I hope I can help. I put two replies in today, to points much earlier in the discussion. I felt what happened several times just before it happened. I think my paragraphs bear repeating here. The first is in response to Hgilbert:</p>
<p>"This is an example of systemic bias" in the generally valiantly NPOV Wikipedia "that needs to be addressed." yes, absolutely! The curiosity is that NPOV reaches towards an intensity of neutrality that Rudolf Steiner actually taught me even more about than I learned in Science or in Psychology - and I'm a good scientist and a trained counsellor - and studying "Philosophy of Freedom" was the key to this for me, taken in context of studying Steiner's work overall and seeing, yes, here is a genius who has not been properly recognized. I've lived 40 years (outside Steiner communities) since discovering Steiner, and have almost never found a genius to equal him. The problem with Wikipedia (and I don't want to change its setup because usually it works) is that it would not be NPOV as normally understood to gather together similar character references to Steiner from suitable people like Canon Shepherd. <b>Lucy Skywalker</b> 22:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The second is in response to Pete K:</p>
<p>You say that "<b>Anthroposophy does not apply scientific methodology</b>" On what scientific basis do you yourself say this? It is my careful and extensive and informed observation, over 40 years, that Anthroposophy is not at odds with scientific method, which relies on a) consistently careful observation; b) drawing reasonable hypotheses from the observations; and c) being open to further evidence that might challenge the hypotheses. Now Steiner himself asked people NOT to believe what he said but to test it for themselves. The fact that Anthroposophists sometimes choose belief over testing does not mean that this is what Steiner encouraged. He did not say, as you claim, "the only people who could evaluate his were, essentially, Anthroposophists"; what he said was that he spoke of what he had himself experienced and that if another did not experience the same thing, this was no proof in itself that what he had said was untrue. It is a delicate matter to grasp the different scientific validities of both positive proof and negative absence of disproof. One analogy is that I do not claim that Australia does not exist because I have not been there. I have examined the matter, and have found it reasonable to take the evidence of others as a working hypothesis. Which is what I have done with Steiner, and have sometimes arrived at different conclusions. But he taught me the method - to observe what was going on "within" with the same very great care as one would apply to conventional scientific observations, and, indeed, as the whole of modern psychology has taught us to begin to do with our inner realities. There is a growing number of scientists who see that certain factions in the scientific world claim objectivity where they, as equally respected and qualified scientists, disagree, see for example [<a href="http://www.alternativescience.com/csicop.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alternativescience.com/csicop.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]</p>

<dd>Thanks Lucy. You wrote "<i><b>You say that "</b>Anthroposophy does not apply scientific methodology<b>"" On what scientific basis do you yourself say this?</b></i> On the scientific basis that he made stuff up. One of my favorite examples is when he talks about dogs who are separated from humans for one or two generations lose the ability to bark. A scientist confronted with this idea would challenge it by conducting experiments to see if it were true. Steiner had no problem addressing large audiences and making ridiculous claims. Regarding your a), b) and c) above, a)"careful observation" is not something Steiner employed, or he would have noticed that dogs continue to bark even when withhelf from human contact. b)Drawing reasonable hypothesis is something he was also unable to do because of a number of reasons, not the least of which was a reliance on spiritual influences. c)Being open to further evidence that might challenge his hypothesis - I don't know how much Steiner you have read, but he was NOT open to further evidence on matters and even chided people like Einstein. You wrote "<b><i>He did not say, as you claim, "the only people who could evaluate his were, essentially, Anthroposophists"; what he said was that he spoke of what he had himself experienced and that if another did not experience the same thing, this was no proof in itself that what he had said was untrue.</i>"</b> Big deal! I could make the same claim. He talks extensively on this very subject in the preface to Occult Science. It is clear that evaluation of his work, must come from those who had undergone the process and reached the same conclusions he did. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 15:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>I have altered the presentation of your last post so that, in my browser at least, it is clear who is saying what - because as I first read your quotes of me, the meaning of my original wording had become inverted. Now it is at least clear. I'm not going to answer your actual points because it would only further overload this overheated thread, trying to respond to someone who it seems is already under arbitration for having been unreasonable. But I could answer you, if I were sure you listened with courtesy. It is interesting meeting you, you are quite a challenge. Thank you.</dd>

<p>I'm inclined to remove lots of stuff from this section that is redundant in Steiner's biography. This section is supposed to be the history of Anthroposophy - and it should talk about Theosophy, briefly, and the break-off of Anthroposophy, the off-shoot initiatives to some degree, and the people who (claim to have) moved Anthroposophy forward. Included in this should be, I'm sad to say, the Nazi-era treatment of Anthroposophy and prominent Anthroposophists who represented the movement at that time. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 16:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Currently the arbitration decision has given us the responsibility of finding non-anthroposophy published sources and removing original research. Instead of working to add new stuff, could you maybe give a hand finding <i><b>good</b></i> sources we know we need there now? The Sampson reference you added yesterday isn't good because it doesn't make the claim you added to the article. When I pointed this out to you, you "softened" your claim but it still isn't in the article. This kind of editing is in effect original research which is disguised as a published point of view. You've done the same thing with the "some" you added today. This is not doing research, this is putting in your own pov. You can't do that. Can't you see that? Use SOURCES! And accurately report the statements as given by the author. Don't replace them with your own. Venado 17:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Good" sources have always been needed. This is nothing new. I look at this as an opportunity to improve the articles that have been "owned" thus far by Anthroposophists. A good place to start is to look at the information in the articles themselves and treating several articles together - so the same information (Steiner's biography for example) isn't repeated in article after article. Regarding what you are talking about above, you are attempting to introduce a lie into Wikipedia - that PoF was the pre-cursor to Anthroposophy. It just isn't true but clearly it's a claim Anthroposophist cheer-leaders like to make. There has been extensive discussion on the Waldorf Critics list for weeks now about this very subject. Re: using SOURCES!, I'm using the source that you have provided. You haven't been able to read your own source accurately and this is frustrating for me - but I'm letting it go. It isn't my POV that Philosophy of Freedom does not contain anything about spiritual hierarchies, about the paranormal, about spiritual activities underlying the physical world. All that came later after Steiner accepted Theosophy and later yet produced Anthroposophy. Anyone can read PoF and discover this. Your own source says that. You don't seem to want to accurately represent this. Why not?</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, I'll continue trying to improve the articles the way I feel is necessary - and please forgive me if I don't accept homework assignments from you. Finding reliable sources for inaccurate claims does not sound like a very productive use of my time. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 18:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>Oh great... let the book title decide what's in the book. What kind of thinking is this? Anthroposophists change the titles of Steiner's books all the time anyway. They've changed "Occult Science" to "Esoteric Science" even though Steiner discusses the reason for the original title specifically in the preface to the book. If you think this sort of logic is going to change the CONTENT of the book, you're wrong. And I really don't need a source that says a book written 10 years before a new idea was created doesn't pertain to that idea. Is there any chance Anthroposophists will stop wasting everyone's time with this sort of nonsense. YOU quoted from your source - and it said exactly what I have said.

<dd>I went back and reverted the last two edits. Vendano, I don't like accusations of plaigerism. I provided three sources that all said the same words. The definition seems to be well accepted. You need to tone it down. TheBee, you don't get to throw out sources just because you believe them to be "polemical" - If there's something wrong with the sources cited, discuss the problem before yanking them out and attaching fact tags to everything. We have an arbitration committee and administrators just waiting around to answer questions about sources for you. The only sources we know for sure we are not to permit is Anthroposophical ones that tout Anthroposophy or it's various enterprises. I realize how frustrating it must be to have sources outside of Anthroposophy saying there's nothing to Anthroposophical medicine. I understand your frustration now that you can no longer control the content of the articles, but yanking out other people's edits is not going to get us anywhere. Since the Arbitration ruling, you guys have complained about every source I have presented. You really need to stand back and let these articles get set back on track. That's really what the ruling said - we need to remove all the unsourced stuff and the stuff sourced to Anthroposophical sources, and replace it with material from other sources. There has never been any intention to leave the articles the way they are and simply find neutral sources to support all these claims (good luck to you if you can do that). Some things in the articles are going to have to change. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 23:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

It will be deleted."</b> That one sentence you speak of (second time I've told you) is copyright by Houghton Mifflin and identified as "All rights reverved". The three websites where you read it have repeated that sentence because each one has <b>permission</b> to copy it and each has identified it as belonging to Houghton Mifflin. It's your responsibility as an editor to read the material, including who wrote it and who it belongs to, before you use it here. You can easily see it is the same text, not three different texts. <b>You don't have permission</b> to copy it, and you copied it without identifying it as a quote from somebody else. That's plagiarism and copyright infringement both. Don't do it! It's plagiarism to copy, it's copyright infringement lift somebodies written material without permission.

<dd>Thanks - but I don't need things "explained" to me by you - so that may be where you are frustrated. If you want to be didactic, find someone else. Regarding reverting valid edits, this goes both ways but I don't see any edits I have reverted as being invalid. You continue to accuse me of plagiarism and I think you are way off base here, but I humored you and reworded the sentence. Thanks for the big bold letters BTW, but the statement is meaningless in this case - its a sentence, not a document. You're wasting your breath. Plagiarism is representing someone else's work as one's own. Get a clue, please.

<dd>(<b>to everyone</b>) This is such a Janus-issue! so appropriate to New Year's Eve! <b>Is Anthroposophy a science or a belief???</b> Now I know it as a science that I've tested time without number, but I sympathize with those who see it as a belief. I feel that the best NPOV can do for now is to include both perspectives. However, the matter is of such crucial importance that I feel the little paragraph in the article simply does not begin to do it justice. So I've started a <s>daft</s> draft essay on the "Philosophy of Freedom"'s key concept, on my personal page here. Please have a look! I would welcome comments. You need to EXPERIENCE the key concept of "POF" to PROVE that Anthroposophy is a science (certainly an unusual science), and that this core experience of thinking is indeed the foundation of Anthroposophy. But this proof hurts the brain!!! it goes against all one's comfort zones!!! just as Jesus went against all Saul's comfort zones, until Saul was blinded on the Road to Damascus and found that Jesus was ok after all. I hope this helps. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy_Skywalker_ae57.html" title="User:Lucy Skywalker">Lucy Skywalker</a> 21:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have just said <b>"I don't see any value in trying to prove Anthroposophy is a science... but have fun with that...

The "proof" I've just outlined at my <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy_Skywalker_ae57.html" title="User:Lucy Skywalker">Lucy Skywalker</a> page is - to my perception - not so difficult to follow (though it may still need "fixing for bugs" and perhaps you can help me here, by continuing to give the kind of criticisms in which you excel, which gives me material to work on). Now I am not living in the world of Steiner as it was when he wrote "POF" and later developed Anthroposophy. My aim, arising out of my life now, is to show that, however many "truly proven" flaws (ie not just CSICOP-type, see <a href="http://www.alternativescience.com/csicop.htm|" class="external text" title="http://www.alternativescience.com/csicop.htm|" rel="nofollow">Alternative Science/CSICOP</a>) one may find in Steiner, or in Anthroposophy as it has become, this does not invalidate the principle of Scientific Method per se, nor the root principle of Spiritual Science in demonstrating the field of objectivity within the act of thinking. If you are unwilling to go back to the first principles and follow the proof, and if you express responses that come from the emotions and not the mind, then you have not earned the scientific right to dismiss the claims that a Spiritual Science <b>is</b> a legitimate possibility, and that methodology in line with Scientific Method <b>is</b> possible.</dd>

<p>Lucy, last I heard, these pages are automatically archived. We don't have to do it. Re your page, I haven't looked at it. I'll try to have a peek later. I don't think we have an argument really. Science includes thinking. Scientific method can certainly include thinking and drawing conclusions based on thinking. However, one cannot just sit and think and call it science - there is no field of objectivity there - no reproducability. Thinking is a wonderful frontier on its own - and Steiner did some great things - he got people thinking about thinking, and that's great. There's nothing wrong with thinking outside the box - and that can certainly lead to good science, but it doesn't constitute science in-and-of itself. And if what you are trying to demonstrate here is that the definition of "science" has to change so that it can accommodate Steiner, I suspect you are going to have a difficult time with me. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 17:06, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>OK, I've looked at your page - it's pretty much exactly what I expected. I don't find any substance there that is particularly noteworthy - no offense intended. It's more of the same I've heard for years. You can get some mileage regarding new ways of looking at thinking processes, but you run into potholes when you look at where that took Steiner. And that's what happens when thinking alone is let loose (as science) without the rigorous scientific methods we insist on. You can call the products of this activity philosophy, you can even call them psychology, but you can't call them science. And yes, we all know our thinking is based on our perception which is based on our thinking and yes, it hurts the brain - but we don't all have to take the red pill (or the blue pill) - we can be glorious in our diverse set of ideas and experiences. And while I appreciate the effort you are going to on your blog, know that this is nothing new for those of us who have been around the block on this stuff.

<dd>I haven't collected my "arguments" together in some original research vanity-press website like some here have. While I enjoy debate, I don't really do one-on-one debate privately. If I'm going to take my time to debate issues, it serves me best if the discussions are out in the open where others can see them. Your talk page would not be appropriate for this, of course, as it is yours to control as you like and out of sight of the mainstream who don't know to look there. Since this is the Spiritual Science (redirect) talk page, it might be fine to discuss this here if we don't get too far off the subject. I assume you believe the outcome of the discussion will impact the Anthroposophy article (it probably won't) so that's probably justification enough to discuss spiritual science here. Your slam of Peter Staudenmaier makes me wonder if there is any point in engaging you. If you don't find any value in what he has to say, there is little chance you will find any value in what I have to say either. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 21:11, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p><i>Racial bias has been identified in Steiner's work.[citation needed].</i> So you start by making a statement that I need to find a citation for. Nice compromise. Let's just change it to "Racism has been identified in Steiner's work" and I'll cite Staudenmaier. Personally, I think you were better off before. <i>Nevertheless, anthroposophy in general and Steiner's work in particular have been called "fundamentally anti-racist",[51][52] by both critics and supporters,</i> This part gets really goofy. Why remove the fundamentally racist part? Even your Dutch commission (remember them) called some of Steiner's works racist. The whole sentence can go - it makes no sense and doesn't tell the reader anything when it is fairly presented.</p>
<p><i>and the Anthroposophical Society in America has issued a statement saying: "We emphatically reject racism in all its forms, and embrace the principles of common humanity expressed by the founder of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner: [We] must cast aside the division into races. [We] must seek to unite people of all races and nations, and to bridge the divisions and differences between various groups of people."[53]</i></p>
<p>Frankly, I think you should remove this one. The division of people into races is not racism. It demonstrates that the Anthroposophical Society doesn't even understand what racism is.</p>
<p><i>We explicitly reject any racial theory that may be construed to be part of Rudolf Steiner's writings. The Anthroposophical Society in America is an open, public society and it rejects any purported spiritual or scientific theory on the basis of which the alleged superiority of one race is justified at the expense of another race.[54]</i> This one we should keep - it's a good statement (one I wasn't aware of) - and it shows some understanding of the issue.</p>

<p>Pete: in my view a distinction needs to be made between racial bias and being fundamentally racist. Steiner's statements against racism are in many prominent places, including his written works. Most people who read his works only encounter his clear position against racial judgments and his statements that race is unimportant compared to individual differences, simply because this is what his well-known works clearly state. In mostly fairly obscure places, often buried in lectures about completely different things or in off-the-cuff talks to workers at the Goetheanum, he talks about various races in a biased way, however.</p>
<p>In terms of verifiability; I know of no citable author that calls Steiner's works or anthroposophy fundamentally racist. McDermott certainly does not. We could lead in with something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Racial bias has been identified in Steiner's works.</i> (ref: McDermott) <i>At the same time, his stance has been called "fundamentally anti-racist" by both supporters and critics</i> (ref: Waage, Bauemler)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And follow this with two short subsections of roughly equal length and comparable style explicating both aspects. In the anthroposophy article, the A.S. position should also be quoted. In the Waldorf article, any positions taken by the Waldorf association should be quoted. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 13:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"Pete: in my view a distinction needs to be made between racial bias and being fundamentally racist. Steiner's statements against racism are in many prominent places, including his written works."</i> Racial bias (elevating one race above another) IS the definition of racism, Harlan. Steiner appears to talk "against" racism ONLY when he moves from the physical human form to the spiritual human form. The difference between individual and "individual" that we talked about (and I tried to identify as "spirit-individual". When he talked about the physical human, he was absolutely (fundamentally) racist. When he talked about "individuals" as other people talk about "souls" or "spirit-self" he didn't have the same things to say about them. There is nothing you could say about a spirit-self that has the physical connection - whether it be skin color, hair color, eye color or whatever. Spirits don't have these characteristics. When he talked about physical humans, he was fundamentally racist. I tried to help you make this exact distinction months ago but you kept removing it, preferring to blur the line and let people assume he wasn't a racist - or more oddly, both a racist and not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not really very attached to the "fundamentally racist" language (and I tried to leave the quotation marks off because I don't have a source that says this). Another editor added the quotation marks for balance. What I know is that Steiner was racist, his racist remarks are abundant and clear and frankly, anyone calling Steiner "anti-racist" has either misunderstood the difference I described above, or assumes the reader will. Why do you think the racist remarks came up when he talked with the workers at the Goetheanum? Do you think it was just a coincidence? It is very clear to me that Steiner, being Steiner, realized he was talking to a different group than normally attended his lectures. I have read enough of Steiner to know he quite naturally felt the need to "dumb-down" his lectures for the workers. So instead of concentrating on more lofty ideas about the spirit-individual, he talked more about the physical individual - and the physical individual's relation to the world. And when talking about physical individuals, he quickly encountered and spoke freely about race, as well as other stuff relating to the physical world - alcoholism, why people wear clothing, stuff like that. He never talked about these things in detail in his formal lectures because his audience was different. His regular lecture audiences were more prepared for information about the spirit-individual - the one that is above racial differences - while the workers were not as ready for such topics. Steiner was not both fundamentally racist and fundamentally anti-racist. He was consistent in his ideas on this. Why confuse the Wikipedia readers? <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 16:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Steiner actually says very clearly that even strictly physically, individual differences are more important than racial ones. Race for him is a minor influence physically, which can be described, but is less important than individual differences.</p>
<p>He made comments that accentuate supposed differences between the races, and more prominent comments that accentuated the humanity that encompasses all races, and often spoke out directly against racism. To say he was racist is to focus on the one half. To say he is anti-racist is to focus on the other. Both are justifiable reactions. To gain a comprehensive view requires understanding how the two fit together for him. He was consistent in the sense that he was consistently against judging any individual on the basis of race, as well as suggesting that racial influences were concrete, restricted to the physical body, and though less important than individual differences, clear in their effects.

<dd><i>"Steiner actually says very clearly that even strictly physically, individual differences are more important than racial ones. Race for him is a minor influence physically, which can be described, but is less important than individual differences."</i> I think we both know that's nonsense. <i>"He made comments that accentuate supposed differences between the races, and more prominent comments that accentuated the humanity that encompasses all races, and often spoke out directly against racism."</i> No, he really didn't. He didn't only talk about the "differences" in the races, he talked about which races were more advanced and which were in decline. He certainly didn't say, we're all on the same level but some of us are black and others are white. He specifically said white people are on a higher level than black people. <i>"To say he was racist is to focus on the one half. To say he is anti-racist is to focus on the other."</i> No, there really is no "other" half. <i>"Both are justifiable reactions."</i> Only if you're confused about what Steiner said. It isn't reasonable to suggest or expect that Steiner was wishy-washy about the subject, or himself confused. Are you sure this is the picture you want to paint of him - that he talked out of both sides of his mouth about the races? <i>"To gain a comprehensive view requires understanding how the two fit together for him."</i> I've explained it for you and you are, again, trying to muddy the waters. He talks differently about physical individuals than he does about spiritual individuals. That's how the two fit together. <i>"He was consistent in the sense that he was consistently against judging any individual on the basis of race, as well as suggesting that racial influences were concrete, restricted to the physical body, and though less important than individual differences, clear in their effects. That is a more complex picture, and a more accurate one."</i> It's nothing more than a smokescreen. You've again gone to the effort of blurring the distinction and thrown around the word "individual" as if it refers to a physical individual. <i>"Why confuse the Wikipedia readers by ignoring the more prominent half of his statements on the subject?"</i> I think you're the one who is either confused here (or pretending to be). And you're trying to confuse the readers here right now. Maybe this is another good place to step aside - your intention here is clearly to obfuscate the issue with double-speak (or should we just call it Waldorf-speak?). You KNOW I'm not going to buy this nonsense, but I think you are intentionally playing to the audience here. It's not going to fly - and I think even casual readers here will walk away shaking their heads at your apologetic presentation - that he was kinda racist, but not completely racist. It's hogwash. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 00:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Calling them "anti-Waldorf" is editorializing, but calling them a Church-State activist group is denying the obvious. PLANS is totally focused only on public schools if they're Waldorf, but they're just as much or more interested in non-public Waldorf and somewhat on other Steiner related activities, but mostly Waldorf. They call themselves "waldorf critics", that's the domain name of the website. They don't come out to be religious experts or constitution experts, they say on page one they are former Waldorf parents, teachers and students, including private. All their press releases say that PLANS was formed out of concern about both public <b>and</b> private Waldorf, not against general religion per se in public schools. They distribute poster and bumper sticker advertising against Waldorf education in general, not other educations and no mention at all about conflict to the constitution or public schools. Their articles are selected for "critical opinions" about Waldorf, it says on the top of the webpage. Only a msmall few of the whole bunch of articles are about public schools. Only one of that short subset of the whole isn't about Waldorf public directly, meaning religion in schools in general. Ninety-nine.point.nine-nine-nine percent of the organization is for activism against Steiner, primarily Steiner based schools, and not general activism against religion in school or the constitution. They criticize against Waldorf, private and public, and I can't find any sign of activist activities on the well-known mainstream church state disputes that church state school activists would ordinarily have an interest in, like Christmas celebration in school, or religious based campus groups, or creationism/evolution, "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance, religious speech at graduation. Nothing like that. They should should be called "critical" of Waldorf instead of "anti" Waldorf. Venado 21:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Your close associate from AWE (I won't reveal who she is) Professor Marginalia contributed more later.

<dd>Just as a reminder for the memory: This thread started as a question if a reduction by Pete K of the description of PLANS as an anti-Waldorf activist group in the Anthroposophy article to just an "activist group" did the group justice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pete first asserted that this was the case. When I questioned this, based on the well documented description of the group in an article at Wikipedia, Pete turns the discussion into a personal attack on me, and accuses me of having written most of the article, that he seems to think gives a defamatory description of the group. This would probably refer to the two well cited sections I have mentioned: the History and the Criticism section. In the two sections I only recognize one well cited paragraph in the first as originating from me:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>In a newspaper interview in May, Dan Dugan commented on the independent Waldorf school in Davis: "They believe that there are spirits behind everything. I know there are people who would call that evil. (They) would consider anthroposophy a satanic religion."[9]. When criticized by a supporter for the way PLANS was trying to get support from Christian fundamentalists by using an alleged connection between anthroposophy (the philosophical basis of Waldorf education) and satanism, he defended this on his mailing list: "What I say 'in defense of the Waldorfians' is that 'they don't eat babies.'", "Am I pandering to the prejudices of Christians? Personally, yes I am!"</i>.[10]"</dd>

<p>Chiming in briefly. "Critical" versus "anti." For the purposes of wikipedia if you want to call them "anti" you'd have to find some "anti" actions or statements from them, and no, summaries on your self-published web sites won't do it. Nobody at all disagrees that PLANS is "critical"; as venado points out, their web site is called "Waldorf critics." "Anti" is the controversial point. So who calls them "anti"? Thebee. How does thebee document it? His own web sites. And the "PLANS" article here - which is still very much under dispute, having barely been touched since the arbitration ended. (Don't assume it isn't going to change, in other words.)</p>
<p>There is nothing "anti" in what PLANS does or advocates unless you believe it is a negative thing to ask the Waldorf/anthroposophy movement to advertise and recruit honestly, state their mission forthrightly and aim to attract the customers to whom that mission is appealing rather than advertise under false premises and unwisely attract those to whom their mission (anthroposophy) is actually repellent. It is not "anti" to ask them to uphold the US constitution and not misuse public funds. I think those things would be good for Waldorf, not bad. I think the schools will benefit from public accountability, increased trust, and increased openness between teachers, students, and families. I know that students and families in them will benefit, and I consider those things positive -not "anti" anybody. The reforms PLANS advocates would help students, teachers, and administrators. I firmly believe enrollments would stabilize if not increase, and avoiding the bitter, poisoned atmosphere that comes with constant organizational crisis, families constantly leaving angry etc., is VERY good for Waldorf schools. I know it is good for children and their families - it would be hard to find anyone who would disagree that children benefit from a positive, open, and collegial atmosphere in a school, from their parents trusting their teachers and believing in the school, rather than constant mistrust, miscommunication, and hostility.<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianaW_7ed2.html" title="User:DianaW">DianaW</a> 02:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Diana comments: This is very positive - this is not "anti." Newsflash bee - they *do* believe there are spirits behind everything. (This is, btw, not an uncommon belief in most world religions, and there are lots of disputes as to which spirits, or even whole belief systems, are "evil.") The Waldorf school did not tell these Christian fundamentalist parents what anthroposophy is, didn't bother mentioning that their kids would hear about "spirits" right and left, and this disrespects these families' beliefs and these families' right to raise their children in their own religion. The public schools are for everybody in the United States. The individuals in question did believe there were satanic elements in what they were seeing in their children's schoolwork. These parents were fundamentalists. PLANS is not taking a position on satanism here, any more than anthroposophy or fundamentalist Christianity: PLANS takes a position on these parents' religious rights. This is the reason they oppose public funding of Waldorf schools. Parents of ALL religions have a right to use the public schools; EVEN Christian fundamentalists and EVEN satanists and what-have-you - and to have their children's instruction free of proselytizing - especially the sneaky, stealthy kind Waldorf has perfected. Dan Dugan was right to "pander to Christians" then and I admire him for continuing to "pander." The part you're leaving out is that he'll "pander" to anybody's religious preference, Buddhist, atheist, Hindu, you name it. The heart of the lawsuit is that in the US, we have freedom of religion, and we protect it by separating church and state. This is why Waldorf is ineligible for public funding. (This has been explained to thebee many times; thebee "gets" this fully IMO. He seems to feel that words like "satan" and "witchcraft" make PLANS look bad, and any little write-up on PLANS that he and his team produce puts these terms front and center for their shock value, hoping people won't notice it's a massive non sequitur - and refers to a specific incident several years ago at a particular school, where fundamentalists DID get upset about what they perceived as witchcraft in the school. Then, of course, he can quote his own self-produced material elsewhere, not mentioning that he and his friends wrote it, and claim it shows that it is widely known that PLANS is mean and nasty.)<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianaW_7ed2.html" title="User:DianaW">DianaW</a> 02:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Diana has presented this beautifully, and I just want to comment on TheBee's statements that I feel are a relentless harassment of PLANS. He says: <i>"Just as a reminder for the memory: This thread started as a question if a reduction by Pete K of the description of PLANS as an anti-Waldorf activist group in the Anthroposophy article to just an "activist group" did the group justice."</i> Anyone who has a scroll bar, a page-up button or a mouse wheel can simply scroll up to see how this thread started and to refresh their memory. Nobody needs a recap when the start of the thread is only three inches up on the page.</dd>

<dd><i>"Pete first asserted that this was the case."</i> I still do - but compromised on the language by Venado. <i>"When I questioned this, based on the well documented description of the group in an article at Wikipedia,"</i> That you have produced, <i>"Pete turns the discussion into a personal attack on me,"</i> Wait... so now it's a personal attack if I find it hilarious that your only source for this claim (or ANYTHING else for that matter) is YOU? <i>"and accuses me of having written most of the article,"</i> You DID write most of the article. <i>"that he seems to think gives a defamatory description of the group."</i> - NO, YOU pointed to the article that you produced as evidence that PLANS is "anti-Waldorf". That you have produced a defamatory article is beside the point. <i>"This would probably refer to the two well cited sections I have mentioned: the History and the Criticism section."</i> No, I'm referring to the entire article that YOU have suggested supports your claim.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Does the term "critical" do the group justice, as suggested by Venadoo?"</i> Absolutely. It's a fair description. "Anti-Waldorf" is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The first two critical parts of the comments on Waldorf education, supported and published at the site of the group are the two parts that would make it into just a group critical of Waldorf education.

If you will be HONEST about what Waldorf is, then I will agree to the term "anti-Waldorf". An HONEST look at Waldorf, of course, would reveal a fair amount of ugliness including, but not limited to dishonesty, threats, deception, hidden agendas, racism being disguised as physiology, Anthroposophy being disguised as science, physical and emotional abuse of children and parents, and a very healthy bilking of the public (there is no exageration in any of this). With an HONEST view of Waldorf, "anti-Waldorf" doesn't sound so bad. It's like being "anti-pedophilia" or "anti-corruption". So at some point when Waldorf is portrayed here with its flaws as well as it's achievements, we can reconsider applying the term "anti-Waldorf" to PLANS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Does the neutral term "critical" do the group justice? The third type of "argumentation" against Waldorf education, published by the group at its site tells it does not."</i> Thanks for your opinion. In MY opinion, we should start putting "anti" something in front of the term "Waldorf" too. Like "anti-honesty", "anti-learning", "anti-technology", "anti-science", "anti-Christian", "anti-Semitic" - all of those fit just fine by MY opinion. By MY opinion, YOUR website is far more "anti-Waldorf" than PLANS as it does more to harm Waldorf and limits its potential for improvement. So since the neutral term "critical" fits properly, let's just leave our opinions out of it and stick with the neutral language.

<p>A couple of other thoughts: Thebee says originally in this thread that calling PLANS an activist group sounds "nice and neutral." I disagree. "Activist" does not imply "nice and neutral." Activists often aren't nice, and they're certainly never neutral. Activism means taking a position on something, by definition. "Activist" thus describes PLANS perfectly.</p>
<p>The real problem with calling PLANS "anti" is that it is not precise. What are they "anti"? They are probably "anti" some things, but to say they are anti-Waldorf is not specific enough and thus not accurate. They are certainly anti <i>some things</i> that pertain to Waldorf or go on in Waldorf schools, but could as easily be described as "pro" on others. Almost everyone at PLANS is on record repeatedly and enthusiastically endorsing certain elements of Waldorf education or various Waldorf teaching practices or aspects of community life in Waldorf, such as stress on the arts, practical work, healthy food, media restrictions for young children, de-emphasizing standardized testing, etc. They are not opposed to Waldorf schools existing, or doing much of what they do. Many things Waldorf does, people at PLANS might well like to see other schools do more of, too. They are only opposed to certain features they see as unfortunately representative of Waldorf as it exists today - such as unethical means of advertising and recruiting.</p>
<p>It might, in fact, be closer to accurate if we were disputing whether PLANS is anti-anthroposophy. There too, of course, they do not dispute anthroposophy's right to exist, proselytize, recruit followers etc., and they don't dispute anybody's right to believe in or practice anthroposophy. They don't dispute anthroposophists' right to run schools. They do oppose unethical actions on the part of the anthroposophical movement, such as misuse of taxpayer funds for this purpose, as well as stealth recruiting. I don't think PLANS takes a philosophical or theological position regarding the doctrines of anthroposophy, but it's no secret many if not all of its members don't care much for the doctrines of anthroposophy. I personally find certain (though again not all) key anthroposophical doctrines repugnant, even deeply repellent. I'm not at all opposed, personally, to being labeled "anti"-anthroposophy in this sense, or to be seen as taking actions or making statements that oppose anthroposophy in this sense. (The sense described in this paragraph; as always we run the risk in making these statements that it will be later quoted without its context.) Just what parts I'm "anti" is off topic here, as it's not about my views, but even if we were to get into what PLANS is "anti" regarding anthroposophy, it wouldn't be on topic regarding whether they're "anti" Waldorf. I'm pointing out that anti-Waldorf and anti-anthroposophy are two different things, and that while anti-anthroposophy may be in some sense relevant, "anti-Waldorf" is simply untrue.</p>
<p>You could argue that to get rid of the anthroposophy would be "pro-Waldorf." It's possible to be "pro-Waldorf" and "anti-anthroposophy." (Not to an anthroposophist, of course; but the key problem we've faced in these articles is getting anthroposophists to understand that they don't "own" wikipedia articles and can't write everything from the POV of anthroposophy.)<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianaW_7ed2.html" title="User:DianaW">DianaW</a> 17:00, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Venado, you have re-archived this stuff. What gives? What you find inconvenient and fixed with your solution has made things inconvenient for me. I'm inclined to revert it again. Can we maybe just archive the discussions that aren't current? Some of the ones archived had discussions that were added to only a week or two ago. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 19:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dl>
<dd>The most recent I saw archived are a month old, and most of that just says the repeating the same arguments. Please don't revert. It's easier to look back to an archive if you need to than it is to wade through old messages to get to the current discussions. In the last few days some of my edits to the talk page have taken so much work during edit conflicts, I gave up. The page load in edit conflict is about 3 times bigger than even in the normal edits, which were way to big already. It cost me a big chunk of time with every visit to the talk page. The arbitration decision came the end of December, and the older discussions don't pertain closely now besides.Venado 20:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS I got sidelined by another edit conflict when I tried to make the above comment while you added this long old stuff back in the page. If those discussions were worthwhile you guys wouldn't still be edit warring over the issue. A lot of the text isn't even relevant to the article. It's very aggravating.

<dd>This is aggravating for everyone. It's aggravating when new people arrive to question (or make aggressive edits to) stuff that has already been discussed and worked through by the people most invested in the articles here. And, unfortunately, in the past, archiving has been used as a way to hide discussions that showed Steiner in a "difficult" light. If I'm incorrect that auto-archiving is active on this page, then maybe it would be best just to get a bot to archive these pages automatically - that way nobody can complain about who archived what and when.

<dd>There certainly are bots that auto-archive talk pages. There was one on the Steiner Views on Race and Ethnicity talk page. Editors are not supposed to selectively archive material they don't want to have visible to readers (that's what was going on here in the past). Auto-archiving would save everybody a lot of work. And a lot of discussions that are still relevant have been on hold during the arbitration. That period of inactivity doesn't mean they are dead subjects. Regarding "reverting way too much" - that's only because people are adding stuff they know will be reverted. At some point, they're going to point to all my reverts and make a case (big surprise). The directive here was to clean up these articles, not make them worse. I'm reverting material that makes them more biased toward Anthroposophy than they already are. I'm very much trying to do what the directive from the ArbCom said. Like it or not, the POV-pushing Anthroposophists got dealt a blow here and there's no reason to continue to accept POV edits by them. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 22:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>I also notice that these articles, despite the article probation, rely heavily on anthroposophy-published documents as sources, in spite of the arbitration ruling determining that they should be removed. Documents originating with anthroposophy, the Waldorf foundation, or Rudolph Stiener are not acceptable as sources <b>either</b> for claims that Waldorf is good, <b>or</b> for claims that Waldorf is bad. Things ranging from the complex (whether Steiner was racist) to the simple (whether Waldorf schools discourage parental communication) <b>can not</b> be sourced to primary documents. They are not considered reliable sources for several reasons. Generally if you are using Waldorf materials to describe the benefits etc., you run afoul of the self-serving limits of the reliable source policy, and if you are citing Waldorf documents to "prove" they have problems, you are violating the "interpreting primary sources to draw a conclusion is original research" limitation.</p>
<p>If you think that reopening the arbitration case will get the <b>other</b> editors banned but leave <b>you</b> safe, I can almost guarantee you are wrong. Clean up these articles.

<p>From the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Although Steiner urged his followers to think for themselves and to adjust his insights for new circumstances, a social study of anthroposophists in England found that many of them considered Steiner infallible (Ahern, 1984). If Steiner's theories do not provide an adequate safeguard from being accepted uncritically by Waldorf teachers, then his writings on race could be dangerous. It is difficult to imagine how his speculations on the evolution of consciousness among different peoples could be applied to individual children from different traditions without being racist. Few theories about how the universe works can be easily applied to the full complexity of individual lives. When any spiritual tradition accepts a multilived, karmic account of an individual child, there is always a considerable risk of misjudgment. When a key category in the interpretation of the child's karmic path through multiple lives is the individual child's skin color or ethnic background, it is more than a risk; it is racism, and it is intolerable. It is time to sound the alarm against the possibility that Waldorf teachers could be using such ideas to guide their thinking about children in their classes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whatever Steiner did say, whatever he might say if he were alive today, if only a few Waldorf teachers can nurture what might be a Steiner-derived anti-Semitic or anti-African American prejudice, then Waldorf educators will have to critique themselves before their pedagogy can be of systematic use across the country. The offending texts must be identfied, criticized, explained if possible and disowned if necessary. Appendix II offers an example from Steiner's The Mission of Folk-Souls. More than the passages from the Dutch newspaper quoted in Appendix I, this text is at the core of the Steiner canon. It can be read perhaps by scholars familiar with a wide range of Steiner's writings as having nothing to do with the current arrangements among groups of persons designated by various racial terms either around the world or, now far from the soils that nurtured their races of origin, within American cities. Without an extensive explanation of the text, however, it is much easier to read the passage as simple racism, with black people once again treated as the simple children of the earth, close to their senses and instincts, and no doubt in need of guidance from those less driven by the instincts of the body. A noncritical reading of such texts could have been a source for the Dutch Waldorf teacher investigated for teaching her class about the exceptional sense of rhythm shared by contemporary black persons.</dd>

<p>Hi there guys - have played around with this section - mostly formatting but have made the following changes:</p>
<p>Title change to Racism in Waldorf Schools - because this is a psuedo criticism section (maybe it should be renamed Reception and Criticism - as most of the sections are criticism) - is does need the Concern in the title. Also used Racism as that is what is discussed in the three research reports.</p>
<p>Title change from Racism to Racial Bias - the opening of this section is based on Anthroposophy where no evidence has been provided that there is racism - the sub section covers racism in the schools and is named as such. So this section is better called Racial Bias as the moment it is a war of quotations, but no research been presented to suggest that Anthroposophy as a whole is racist.

<dd>The articles are talking about racism. Anthroposophy believes, as Steiner did, that some races are advancing while others are declining, that some races have outlived their usefulness and that the white race is the race of the future. That's not a racial bias, it's racism. Now I don't believe in calling short people vertically challenged, and I dont' believe in calling racism racial bias. It is what it is and we shouldn't call it something else. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 17:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>I've added a paragraph to the racism section. Anthroposphists will kick and scream, but we have deleted the entire article "Steiner's Views on Race and Ethnicity" - so some mention of his racist views needs to go here and some in the Steiner article. Anthroposophists won't like that I referenced Staudenmaier's article, but the article indirectly references Steiner's own words, and that's why this was done. Steiner's own words confirm his ideas about race and this should be (and is) the focus of the paragraph. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 02:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>OK, I've gone through and deleted the Anthroposophical sources.

We need people OUTSIDE of Anthroposophy to describe what it is for us. In many cases, rather than load the article up with tags, I simply put a {fact} tag at the end of unsourced paragraphs, however within the paragraph, many controversial elements may exist requiring citation.

<p>The ASiA has published a position statement on diversity. That is an uncontroversial fact. The problem with a citation for this does not concern its content, but the simple fact that it has published the statement. For uncontroversial statements in the article, anthroposophical sources can be used. The issue is not whether they are correct or not in their expressed view, but whether they have published it, and how this can be documented in the most reliable way.</p>
<p>Anyone else has any comment on the issue of whether the site of the society can be used as citation for the fact dthat it has issued the position statement, and its content? It is found <a href="http://www.anthroposophy.org/Gov/StatementOnDiversity.php" class="external text" title="http://www.anthroposophy.org/Gov/StatementOnDiversity.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>Well, I don't think you can ignore the ArbCom ruling with a popular vote. Maybe you should take it to the ArbCom and let them vote on it. Rules are rules. What I'm pretty sure you need is a source acknowledging that ASiA made this statement. We're not even allowed to quote Steiner (or I would be doing so, believe me). The fact is, nobody really cares about "diversity" in the AS. They are a society that can think or believe anything they want to (and they do). That they have had to published a statement like this is revealing, however. If they believe in Steiner's teachings (which are racist), then that shows they embrace racism - despite what they claim. Gee, ya think Anthroposophists could say something they don't really mean to keep people off their backs? It's the same mentality Steiner demonstrated lots of times - he specifically told them they had to lie about their beliefs to keep the public out of their business. That is why we need a third-party souce. AND, the Anthroposophical Society in America doesn't speak for all Anthroposophical societies world-wide - so a statement by them - even if it were completely true - doesn't mean there is no racism in Anthroposophy outside of the ASiA. Indeed, we had a Dutch commission go into great detail to prove otherwise, yet they were forced to admit that racism exists in Steiner's writings. So, even if the statement is admitted, and I don't believe it will without support, it doesn't say anything substantive or meaningful for the article. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 14:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>It has been made pretty clear on the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Education_89ca.html" title="Waldorf Education">Waldorf Education</a> article that we cannot use <i>any</i> anthroposophical citations. While that may not make logical sense, it's been implemented to avoid any inherent bias in citations (just as citations that are overtly polemical against Waldorf have been excluded).

<dd>Both in the arbitration itself and in subsequent discussions, the limitation on anthro-citations has often been for controversial material, such as "this is well-done, or good". Matters of fact are clearly allowable; in fact, Pete keep putting back in citations to Steiner's work as published by anthroposophical publishers (see the Eurythmy section of Waldorf education) where this serves his purposes. So if this is simply a matter of fact, it is probably completely acceptable to use the source. We need to get a clearer statement from the arbitrators, however. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 20:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do you consider a "matter of fact"? There is very little that falls in this category. I leave in a quote from Steiner because it falls in this category. I've left other quotes from Steiner that don't "suit my purpose" for the same reason. I agree with you (WOW) that we need a clearer statement from the arbitrators. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 23:05, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>I would suggest that an attribution of intent (Steiner intended the following...) is quite obviously not a matter of objective fact. Let's keep to the guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, Pete, the bit about Manes references two interdependent sources: a quote by Pfeiffer about a remembered conversation with Steiner and a third-hand citation (Lievegoed quoting Pfeiffer quoting Steiner); the actual Pfeiffer source does not say that Steiner began Waldorf education in order to help Mane, but that Mane could only incarnate if both Waldorf education and the threefold social order existed. That is a very different kettle of fish.

<p>Pete, I agree with what HGilbert says here...that's what I meant on the WE talk page discussion about being careful about saying the <i>purpose</i> of Waldorf was to bring about the incarnation of Manes. I think the Lievegoed quote doesn't add much except that another prominent anthroposophist agreed with Steiner! It doesn't "confirm" Pfeiffer's quote, it just reiterates it. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenitsirk_b016.html" title="User:Henitsirk">Henitsirk</a> 00:29, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still researching exactly who Manes was intended to represent (see some discussion on my talk page). Steiner mentions Manes in GA015 and GA093 at least but seems to have him confused with several people including Menes, Minos, Mani, Manu and Moses (I acknowledge that to Steiner it could well have been the same spirit). I too would like to have a direct quote from Steiner saying this, but it very well may not be available as it seems these could have been private conversations - not unlike Steiner's conversation with the herb grower. For some reason, despite not knowing the content of that coversation, we can apparently draw conclusions about it (I personally think the herbs were the funny kind and that could have been what opened Steiner's eyes to the things he saw). In any case, we have a documented discussion here - the content of which has been related to us. It can certainly be included without overstating what it says or it's impact. There is, of course, tons of this sort of thing in Anthroposophy. It isn't just about looking at science from a spiritual perspective. This particular conversation is of particular interest to me because it mentioned Waldorf specifically. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 00:46, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Here we go again. You guys can't have it both ways. If you believe Steiner can be selectively quoted to support your assertions, then there is no reason that his views on race cannot be supported in the same way. These are his words and they accurately support his position on race - and the section title is RACISM. It describes racism in Anthroposophy BECAUSE IT EXISTS. It displays Steiner's own words BECAUSE THEY ARE HIS OWN WORDS. Continued efforts to hide this material without any denial of its validity are ridiculous. He said these things because he believed these things - and those beliefs are the foundation of Anthroposophy. Whether or not you personally believe them is irrelevant. Steiner's Anthroposophy professes that people with black skin are retarded in the evolution process - that they stopped evolving at some stage. It is an important FACT that belongs in this article without weasel-worded contradictions. Please face the facts and leave the material. It says what Steiner believed and is supported by dozens of similar statements and entire works in some cases. To continually remove this material amounts to vandalism. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 14:50, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>The point is that we are making a content decision here that cannot be made. ALL the material that is supported by Steiner's works is not allowed by the ArbCom. Editors have used Steiner's work to support their views claiming it isn't controversial. This is not the case and we decided early on that everything is controversial (you yourself said this). If the Racism section doesn't deserve direct quotes from Steiner describing racism, then why would any other section be allowed to do this? Either all Steiner-referenced material must come out and be sourced to third-party sources as we have agreed, or ANY Steiner-referenced material must be allowed. We can't decide racism is ugly so let's not talk about it... it is not OUR choice to make for the reader. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 15:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>For starters Steiner's quotes should be used but only in limited amount and only with respect to the <i>founding</i> values of Anthroposophy. For quotes on the up to date Anthroposophy values, more recent quotes from Anthroposophical organisations should be used where possible. These quotes should not be used to to state facts but to state broad opinions and only added when they are of <b>particular note and relevant to the flow of the article</b>. Therefore a quote at the start of every sub-section would be far too much, and make the article sound like an advert. Personally I would like to see only 3-5 quotes from Steiner in the whole article. Some ideas on when to use them include - why Steiner created Anthroposophy, what he saw as its founding purpose and Steiner's view on its past/future. Note these are in the most broadest of terms.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also such quotes should only be used where there is no controversy e.g. where everyone accepts as fact that Steiner set up Anthroposophy for X and Y reason. If there are criticisms of such a position then the quote should either not be used or a criticism sentence will need to be put in e.g. Steiner says (quotes about why he set up Anthroposophy). Some critics though have suggested that he set up Anthroposophy for reason X (+reference). Note such criticism needs to be notable and from appropriate source.</dd>

<dd>Okay so that is all about Steiner and quotes. Obviously the situation is different for references of fact/value judgements - then as the ArbCom case has made clear - no Anthroposophy sources should be used including Steiner.</dd>

<dd>Yes I believe you are right - and I may have jumped the gun slightly - hence why I did not revert all of the sources added. I suppose you can use Steiner sources for some statements but I am very uncomfortable with it. Some may see this as argument hopping but I hope you see it still very valid:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Steiner is the creator of Anthroposophy, and hence in any article on Anthroposophy use of his work is akin to using primary material. By using his work (or more generally Anthroposophical) to support factual statements we are basically sourcing primary research by an individual/movement that has a vested interest in what they say, which makes very uncomfortable. I do not see why the vast quantity of sourcing can not come from third party neutral sources that seek to explain what Steiner/Anthroposophy is all about. By even using one Steiner/Anthroposophy source we are setting ourselves up for trouble.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me give an example: George Bush. Let say he has published an autobiography of his term as US president, and that he has bred a new form of neo-conservatism. Now in that article on this new form of neo-conservatism, we may want to reference from Bush's autobiography. At first we use an odd quote, then we start to use the autobiography to support "facts" about neo-conservatism. But this autobiography is totally primary research, and in many respects COI opinions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now I think the same applies to Anthroposphy and use of Steiner and Anthroposophical sources. Of course they can be used for quotes where they are appropraite for the article. But taking "facts" out of them is a very slippery slop. In truth we should be searching very hard for other appropriate third party sources, and only when we do not find them do we think of using Steiner and Anthroposophical sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you had said at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Talk%7EWaldorf_Education_b1cb.html" title="Talk:Waldorf Education">Talk:Waldorf Education</a> the strictness of source criteria can make for a better article, and I think it is the same for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthroposophy.html" title="Anthroposophy">Anthroposophy</a>.

<dd>It seems to me that in the Anthroposophy and <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Steiner_8c51.html" title="Rudolf Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a> articles we have been and will be including material about Steiner's work that needs direct referencing, for example, the material in this article on specific exercises he gave. Such literal references are best given by referencing his works.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In other cases, third-party sources should be able to be found for factual material, but we should remember that these are not required here, even if we prefer them (as we should). Perhaps we could agree on an informal policy aiming to replace citations made in these areas with third-party sources, with the proviso that this is an informal aim arising from our general concensus here, not something directly arising from the arbitration, and is not something we are trying to "enforce", just to implement. <a href="../../../h/g/i/User%7EHgilbert_f948.html" title="User:Hgilbert">Hgilbert</a> 18:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is nothing that has been supported by a Steiner reference that is not controversial in one way or another. Third party references must be used here. I'll be happy to, when I find some time today or tomorrow, to demonstrate the controversy associated with each and every statement. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 19:07, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Personally I think a half way compromise between Hgilbert and Pete K here would be good. I do not agree with Pete that <i>everything</i> is controversial, but I do believe that a large amount may have some small bias (and so will add up) if sourced from Anthroposophy/Steiner sources. I agree with Hgilbert that this is not something coming directly from Arbitration (though it is in its spirit w.r.t for driving for neutrality) but that we as editors may wish to arrive at a consensus agreement on how strict to be with sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This would possibly need something stronger than just implementation, maybe enforcement with flexibility and common sense. For example is we want to say that Steiner said X and Y, and the best and most obvious source is a Steiner quote and nothing else to back up this statement is easy to hand then we are flexible and allow it. On the other hand if a user (maybe not a regular editor) keeps wanting to add a Steiner source where we feel a non-Anthroposophy/Steiner source is required we may need to stay firm. Either way borderline sources should be discussed on the talk page until consensus is reached.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Hgilbert - literal references where Steiner said X, suggested Y or recommended Z could be sourced from Steiner works if 3rd party sources are not easily available. Obviously if such literal references are controversial e.g. Steiner was anti-racist then a higher level discussion and not primary sources must be attained. On the other hand for factual statements about what Anthroposophy is we should strive to our utmost to find 3rd party sources. Only when we can't and there is agreement on the talk page do we add in Steiner/Anthro sources - and we should keep a record of these, so that if at later date a suitable 3rd party resource is found it can be used instead.</dd>

<p>I think it should be acceptable to use direct citations from Steiner in specific cases. As Lethaniol said, if we are writing "Steiner said X or Y" then we could cite him directly, though this should be relatively rare. As a professional editor I can say that an article overfull of quotations is not well-written. I think there would be less problem with the kinds of citations if the article were truly written in an NPOV way. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenitsirk_b016.html" title="User:Henitsirk">Henitsirk</a> 17:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to point out an example that I am very unhappy with:</p>
<p><i>The word anthroposophy is derived from the Greek roots anthropo meaning human, and sophia meaning wisdom. The term was first used by philosopher Robert von Zimmermann in his book Anthroposophy. Steiner borrowed this term when he founded his own process of spiritual study.</i></p>
<p>The reference for this is a Steiner reference. Now IMHO if you are going to use such a reference then as it is primary material we should say. <i>Steiner</i> says <i>he borrowed this term...</i>. Primary sources making comment on themselves should not be trusted - a secondary/tertiary non-Anthroposophy source is so much better. If it can not be found, then change wording so that it reflects that this statement is from a primary source.</p>

<dd>Pete_K put it there in the article originally, where it was wrongly written. Many people had used the term before Zimmermann, just Steiner said thats from who he took the word. I see this problem in many places in the articles, not just Steiner published claims. The editor uses sources but makes claims in the article that arent made in the sources.

<p>Steiner talks about Zimmermann "And thus Robert Zimmermann wrote his <i>Anthroposophy</i> to counter the theosophy of Hegel, Schelling, Solger and others, whom he also treats as theosophists in the <i>History of Aesthetics</i>. It is from the title of this book, <i>Anthroposophy</i>, that I later took the name. I found it exceedingly interesting then as a phenomenon of the time. The trouble is that it consists of the most horribly abstract concepts." The Anthroposophical Movement - Rudolf Steiner p33. Steiner got the name from the book by Zimmermann, and indeed expresses reasons - he liked the idea of a man-centered philosophy. The term may have been used before, but this is who Steiner credits with coining the word and where he says he got the word. But thankfully, we no longer have this information in the article - everyone can just assume Steiner invented it himself along with all the other stuff we're pretending he invented (like eurythmy) - because after all, he was a great man and should get the credit for other people's ideas. To do anything less than revere him as a god wouldn't be "appropriate". Truth without the burden of proof. That's what we have here. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 21:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Steiner did not credit Zimmermann with "coining the word", he said he (Steiner) took the word from Zimmermann's title. That's the first problem, that the "coining the word" idea isn't what the Steiner quote says. The next problem is the same one we have had since arbitration. That is when are Steiner sources allowed? I'm confused what the consensus is, and even you seem to be of two opinions when hours ago you say "everything about Steiner" is controversial and has to have an independent source. But at the least, there is no confusion that the statements have to be accurate to the sources, and even now it keeps happening that new things are going in articles that are inaccurate.

<dd>Do you have the reference above (The Anthroposophical Movement)? I don't want to type out the whole thing but it seems from the context this is what Steiner is saying. I really don't care one way or the other as it isn't worth arguing over compared to the other inaccuracies in the article. I don't think Steiner may be used as a source for anything - according to the ArbCom decision. I may have misunderstood something, but the last I heard, the ArbCom has said no Anthroposophical references including Steiner. An individual arbitrator may have added or subtracted something here or there, but again the ArbCom decision (not an individual arbitrator's comments) is what has been set down as the law. If the ArbCom has revised its decision, I would love to hear it. I agree with you, I haven't seen anything resembling a "consensus" about anything (with the exception of a few edits and even those have not had a full consensus). So, we aren't working out of consensus, and the edits today have been plentiful. What happened to the notion of discussing edits beforehand. It's back to the same editwarring and people trying to own the articles. So really, this has just deteriorated again into the pushiest editor gets his way. I want accuracy in these articles as much as you - especially because I believe a good portion of what is here is deceptive and unsupportable. I'd rather not reference Steiner directly, but if others are going to do so to push their POV, I don't see why I shouldn't be allowed to. It has to be a rule across the board or it's nonsense. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 00:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

Do you realize how much work was involved in this process? 90% involved fighting YOU over you continually trying to sneak in Anthroposophical sources. Amazing.

We already know what you want in there - how about letting someone else give it a shot without reverting their edits instantly? People are bothered by the untruthfulness of what is being claimed and that's why they want to edit it. Why don't you relax and give them a chance?

Then there are some details about anthroposophical movement which are probably not documented outside anthroposophical sources. I saw some paragraphs (for example history and practical work arising out of anthroposophy) which didn't have a source put didn't seem disputable either. For example Marie Steiner-von Sivers did work with speech exercises. Why not to use anthroposophical sources for that kind of things. I think at the moment the way this article is being worked on is not neutral. I will be back and I will make some changes unless someone else does.

<dd>We have worked out, with the help of a team of arbitrators, a standard for the use of sources here. I agree with you that it is in some senses unfair as it systematically excludes the primary source material for certain issues, but it is presently the agreed standard and we should hold to it until it is changed.

<dd>The standard, as far as I understand it, allows anthroposophic sources for factual information of a non-controversial nature. The instance you cite above of speech exercises would presumably qualify here. It disallows such sources - or any polemical or obviously biased sources - for evaluative or controversial material. For such material, objective and preferably academic sources are required. We need now to rewrite this article, providing citations according to the material's nature and modifying or deleting whatever cannot be supported by proper citations.

I strongly suggest Erdanion that before you go ahead and start adding Anthro sources you discuss in detail with the current editors, otherwise your time and effort may be wasted. Also if you have an issue on the ArbCom cases with respect to applying it to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthroposophy.html" title="Anthroposophy">Anthroposophy</a> I suggest you raise it with <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a>.

<dd>Whatever is happening here it can't go before Wikipedia neutrality policy. I'm not suggesting that anthroposophical sources should be used around Wikipedia in other kind of articles, but anthroposophy is a real movement with views and ways of thinking and those should be represented on pages about it. I keep being told to go to some other page to discuss about the matter. Does that mean I should copy some of this conversation somewhere else or aren't those other users watching this page? <a href="../../../e/r/d/User%7EErdanion_73a4.html" title="User:Erdanion">Erdanion</a> 17:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt there is any need to copy this info to another page - you can just wikilink to this discussion by writing [[Talk:Anthroposophy#About anthroposophical sources]]. On the point of using Anthro sources in this article, I understand your concerns, but you really need to raise this with the ArbCom - I suggest the arbitrator <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a>. The ArbCom have ruled on the use of Anthro sources here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Findings_of_Fact" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Findings_of_Fact" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> - i.e. they think they are inherently unreliable, and should be only be used to back up non-controversial statements only. Also note that the AbrCom is one of the highest groups in the dispute process - <i>The Arbitration Committee exists to impose binding solutions to Wikipedia disputes, which may be anything up to and including a ban from editing Wikipedia.</i> Furthermore it clearly works within Wikipedia policies - including <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - in fact it interprets these policies and implements them during disputes. Again please raise this issue with the ArbCom itself. No amount of discussion here is going to be able to change their ruling which all users need to abide by.

<p>Lethaniol, not meant as an offense, but I parts of what you write stands out as somewhat unclear and confusing to me. In an answer to Wikiwag at one time at my Talks page, I tried to sort out the issue and think the ArbCom decision viewed as a totality is unclear on only one point - what is to be considered "controversial".</p>
<p>The Final decision may stand out as unclear and partly maybe contradictory with regard to what is to be considered to be acceptible sources for different statements in the articles. A closer look shows - I think - that it is not. You only need to read it closely.</p>
<p>According to Final decision, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Waldorf_education.2C_Rudolf_Steiner.2C_Anthroposophy_and_related_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Waldorf_education.2C_Rudolf_Steiner.2C_Anthroposophy_and_related_articles" rel="nofollow">Findings of Fact (14.2.1.)</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and related articles contain large amounts of original research and information gathered from Anthroposophical related sources which are for verification purposes properly considered self-published by the Anthroposophy movement.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>This is an unclear statement and does not tell if it refers to every statement in the articles. It only states that such statements are found in the articles for which Anthroposophical related sources for verification purposes are to be considered not permitted sources, "self-published (by) the Anthroposophical movement".</b></p>
<p>The Final decision <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Verifiability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Verifiability" rel="nofollow">Principles - Verifiability (14.1.3)</a> is more detailed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Information may be included in articles if they can be verified by reference to reliable sources. As applied to this matter, except with respect to information which is not controversial, material published in Anthroposophy related publications, especially by persons deeply involved in the movement such as teachers or theoreticians, are considered self published and thus not reliable sources."</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>This is more specific than the Findings of facts point and tells that with regard to controversial information in the articles, material published in Anthroposophy related publications are considered self published and thus not reliable sources. But for information that is not controversial, Anthroposophy related publications are to be considered as reliable sources.</b></p>
<p>This comes to expression shortly and in an incomplete way in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Remedies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Remedies" rel="nofollow">Remedy - Waldorf education and related articles placed on probation</a> section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Editors of these articles are expected to remove all original research and other unverifiable information, including all controversial information sourced in Anthroposophy related publications. It is anticipated that this process may result in deletion or merger of some articles due to failure of verification by third party peer reviewed sources."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This needs to be seen and interpreted in relation to the first two sections, telling:</p>
<p>- All original research in the articles needs to be removed. To understand this, one needs to look more closely what Wikipedia means with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR" rel="nofollow">"Original research"</a>, defined by one of seven listed characteristics, and is much more limited that what superfifially may be understood with the word, that someone investigates something by him- or herself and tells about the results.</p>
<p>For Wikipedia purposes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"An edit counts as original research if it does any of the following:
<ul>
<li>It introduces a theory or method of solution;</li>
<li>It introduces original ideas;</li>
<li>It defines new terms;</li>
<li>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</li>
<li>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument,</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;
<ul>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis</dd>
<dd>or synthesis to a reputable source;
<ul>
<li>It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is a much more narrow use of the term, than normally probably is understood.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR" rel="nofollow">"No Original research"</a> policy also tells this:</p>
<p>"<b>... research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia</b>."</p>
<p><b>To summarize:</b></p>
<p><b>For all information in the articles that is uncontroversial, Anthroposophy related publications are to be considered reliable.</b></p>
<p><b>For any information in the articles, that (on an not clearly defined basis) can be considered controversial, Anthroposophy related publications are to be considered unreliable.</b></p>
<p><b>What is "controversial"? That is the big, not cleared out point, about which the Arbitration decision is not clear, and that creates the probably largest difficulty in the continued editing of the article.</b></p>
<p>But for simple statements of facts, of course for example Steiner, who's total works are published on the net in the original language, and to a large part also in English translation at <a href="http://www.rsarchive.org" class="external text" title="http://www.rsarchive.org" rel="nofollow">RSArchive</a> must be considered allowed as citation on normally non-emotional issues in the article describing his works and what he wrote or said on different issues. On this point, I think Venado has been over-ambitious in removing such citations, see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Steiner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113893387" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Steiner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113893387" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Steiner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113860964" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Steiner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113860964" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Steiner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113855064" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Steiner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113855064" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Though the last one refers to a controversial issue at the time, as such, the direct citation is very simple and uncontroversial for what it is used as citation for.</p>
<p>I think what Hgilbert writes very well summarizes the problem:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The standard, as far as I understand it, allows anthroposophic sources for factual information of a non-controversial nature." and "It disallows such sources - or any polemical or obviously biased sources - for evaluative or controversial material"</dd>

<dd>But as discussed on <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Education_89ca.html" title="Waldorf Education">Waldorf Education</a>, it is extremely difficult to decide what and what is not controversial - hence as I said above (and in numerous other places) that we should IMHO treat nearly everthing as controversial, and only use Anthro sources when no other notable neutral source can be found for an uncontroversial statement, but only after discussion on the talk page of the article concerned.

<p>With regard to what Waldorf education as practiced in different places around the world, also seemingly neutral sources can be unreliable, as there exist some 900? schools world wide, which makes the problem even greater. But with regard to anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner, what he himself stated is the primary source on what he said and wrote, and should be allowed as citation, except as citation on controversial issues like racism and anti-semitism, where his views are quite complex, and take quite some reading to penetrate, especially with regard to the at least three different senses in which he used and partly stopped using the concept "race" (in the theosophical sense) at different times <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/ThreeConcepts.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/ThreeConcepts.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, and only one refers to the common way it normally has been used.

<p>The problem is that according to Anthroposophy, Anthroposophy is the very best thing since sliced bread, it may be very good, even the path to redemption for humanity, but let a third party say that. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 01:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>To describe in a fair manner how anthroposophical thinking is like in some basic questions using anthroposophical sources is not going to sound ”brochure language”. I believe there to be quite many questions to write about without getting into a dispute. And when a dispute arises about some question of anthroposophical thinking, third party sources won't really be so very helpful for that. How did they get their information if not from anthroposophical sources? When a dispute is about anthroposophy's effects to larger society, third party sources should be looked for. I think one thing the arbitration committee has suggested should be changed. <b>It is not neutral that whenever a dispute arises anthroposophical sources should be the ones abandoned. It is as if to decide beforehand that someone else is right and they are wrong. There is often not going to be completely ”neutral” third party sources.</b> Views of the anthroposophists should be stated using anthroposophical sources. There is no need to decide here whether anthroposophy is ”good”, ”bad”, ”true” or ”false”. That is not Wikipedia's job. <a href="../../../e/r/d/User%7EErdanion_73a4.html" title="User:Erdanion">Erdanion</a> 14:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia discourages the use of primary sources, and allows them to be used as a reference only with "extreme care". And, <b>"Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge."</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondary sources are the best at wikipedia. <b>"Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible. This means that we only publish the opinions of reliable authors, and not the opinions of Wikipedians who have read and interpreted primary source material for themselves."</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No constancy of agreement about what primary source materials described would ever be found before arbitration decisions. For example one editor said Philosophy of Freedom, one primary source, was not even anthroposophy. Secondary sources are needed. Editors cant make those decisions about meanings in primary sources. Steiner work can be used only rarely.The opposite was done before. Some of the articles are much better now, but still need much work and only few are contributing so it is slow. It will go faster if editors dont waste time arguing with each other or administrators about the rules and go forward working better together. Independent published work is available and editors can find it. I found many. The arbitrations took months already. We should go forward and not get hung up over rules. and the articles and atmosphere for editing are very improved now due to arbitration. Since there are sometimes exceptions for primary or Steiner related published works, it should be discussed on a case by case basis first before trying to use any one as a reference someplace in the article.

<dd>My concern is not so much whether used anthroposophical sources are from Steiner or some secondary interpretations of Steiner. I think in some central cases Steiner could be used and sometimes other sources. My concern is that <b>neutrality policy is being broken by discriminating against anthroposophical sources on a page about anthroposophy</b>. It's not so simple with ”independent published work”. First there is not so much sources about anthroposophical thinking in general than about Waldorf schools, because the former has not interested people as much. <b>Secondly ”independent published work” is not always neutral. For example many university researchers are biased against spiritual movements. So it is just not going to be neutral writing this kind of page without using also anthroposophical sources.</b> And if you compare with pages about religious movements, it doesn't seem to be considerer wrong to use their own sources, like on pages about <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. <b>We should keep in mind that "<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>" is not the same thing as "scientific point of view".

<p>It's not the same thing to write a minority subject page than it is to write a majority subject page. Even though Wikipedia generally encourages usage of secondary sources, it is not wrong to use minority publications on a page about themselves. When writing a minority subject page there is a risk ending up to write it only as some majorities see them. That is not in accordance with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> -policy. It sais in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> that secondary sources should be used <i>wherever possible</i>, however, in many cases on a page like this it is not possible. I've been going through policy pages and arbitration decisions and I don't think there is any reason why anthroposophical publications couldn't be used to state views of anthroposophists here. If an anthroposophical book says something which majority people find controversial, it is still not (usually) controversial that the author thinks that way. It can be put in as the author's view, or sometimes as a view of anthroposophists, depending on a book. I hope a peaceful solution can be found to this. I don't insist that pages should be written with brochure language or that there couldn't be majority views on it. I hope there will be a way of writing some fair descriptions of anthroposophical views, using anthroposophical sources, to make sure that these pages go along with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> -policy. <a href="../../../e/r/d/User%7EErdanion_73a4.html" title="User:Erdanion">Erdanion</a> 14:04, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
