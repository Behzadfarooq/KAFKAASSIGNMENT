<dd>I will try. Many American television shows and movies during the existence of the Soviet Union made reference to Siberia. When Siberia was referenced, it was always as a punishment: for instance, if a Soviet agent failed in a mission against the United States, the end of the program might show the agent receiving news from his superiors that he was being sent to Siberia. This became so frequent that "Siberia" came to be used as metaphor for exile and punishment: "a bureaucratic Siberia" (<a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006359" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006359" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>,<a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s74502/fvanderson1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s74502/fvanderson1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), for example.

<p>Hi Antaeus. We met recently in another editor’s talk page. Since you seem to be an expert in the field I’d like to ask you a question about a cult that destroyed part of my life. <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology_%28cult%29.html" title="Eschatology (cult)">Eschatology (cult)</a> is a minority sect that became into existence at the beginning of the 20th century after a schism with Christian Science (though eschatologists are atheists). Besides the cult’s official web site I can find no information about it in the internet but I have some inside information (alas, that’s OR). The cult is flourishing in Mexico and other countries. It needs to be exposed. I have no idea how to write a NPOV article for Wikipedia. Is there a guide for such difficult articles? —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 18:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, calling something a "POV fork", especially as opposed to "content fork", makes a statement about the motives of whoever created it. It implies that someone made the new article for the purposes of getting around the process of editor consensus. In this case, though, if you compare the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology_as_a_business&amp;oldid=51591703" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology_as_a_business&amp;oldid=51591703" rel="nofollow">first version</a> of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_as_a_business.html" title="Scientology as a business">Scientology as a business</a> with how the section <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html#Scientology_as_a_commercial_venture" title="Scientology">Scientology#Scientology as a commercial venture</a> looked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology&amp;oldid=51564872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology&amp;oldid=51564872" rel="nofollow">at the time the new article was created</a> -- I haven't taken the two files and run a <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a> on them but I'd bet twenty cents to one that you'd find they were identical. It's hard to claim that someone's trying to dodge consensus when all they're doing is taking the results that consensus has already produced and moving it to a new location for the process of consensus editing to continue. (It <i>is</i> possible to produce a POV fork that way, but it involves shunting the full discussion to a new article and leaving an inadequate or non-NPOV summary behind, which wasn't the case here.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"rv vandal rmv of cat" and I did not step through every edit to see exactly what each side was advocating for. The mistake I <i>thought</i> someone was making was the mistake I see people make over and over and over and over, and which certainly sounded like what <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Localzuk_e8e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Localzuk">contribs</a>) was saying: that if an article is in a sub-category it should <i>never</i> be in <i>any</i> of the parent categories of that sub-cat. Exceptions to that rule are very clearly stated, but I have seen people quote the entire rule in full <i>including</i> the exceptions and still say "And therefore Article X-Y-Z shouldn't be in any other category except Category:X-Y-Z!"</dd>
<dd>You point out that "guidelines are not policy". I prefer a formulation which, I think, encourages good behavior more than it merely enables behavior which might be good: "rules have exceptions." The <i>reason</i> behind the exception for defining articles is that if a subject is important enough as to merit its own category, the article defining that subject is surely important enough that readers should be able to navigate to it in one step from the parent category, rather than having to go from parent-cat to the sub-cat and only then from the sub-cat to the article. And the same logic is what led me, the last time I addressed this issue, to add <a href="../../../l/i/n/Category%7ELinux_distributions_042a.html" title="Category:Linux distributions">Category:Linux distributions</a> to <a href="../../../u/b/u/Ubuntu_%28Linux_distribution%29_a1ee.html" title="Ubuntu (Linux distribution)">Ubuntu (Linux distribution)</a> and Category:Ubuntu, even though it was already in <a href="../../../d/e/b/Category%7EDebian-based_distributions_1b4f.html" title="Category:Debian-based distributions">Category:Debian-based distributions</a>. Articles which are important should be easy to navigate to and yet a reader starting at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Category%7ELinux_distributions_042a.html" title="Category:Linux distributions">Category:Linux distributions</a> has an easier time getting to <a href="../../../t/a/p/Taprobane_Linux_d6a8.html" title="Taprobane Linux">Taprobane Linux</a>, whose sole distinction seems to be its country of origin, than they do getting to <a href="../../../u/b/u/Ubuntu_%28Linux_distribution%29_a1ee.html" title="Ubuntu (Linux distribution)">Ubuntu (Linux distribution)</a> -- all because Ubuntu is based on Debian and Taprobane isn't?

<p>Regarding your comment: "Ste4k's excuse for removing it was preposterous"</p>
<p>Adding unsourced information to an article is distinctly different than removing unsourced information from an article.</p>
<p>Per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">policy</a>: Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</p>
<p>In the future, please provide reputable sources that justify the link that you provided. And please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Thank you. Ste4k</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ste4k, the reason I have <i>not</i> been able to assume good faith of you in this regard is because the only other explanation that is possible is stupidity. And even that is not a convincing explanation, because it stretches credulity that you could <i>just by chance</i> be misstating the facts and misrepresenting policy in a way so <i>precisely</i> suited to promoting your POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Example #1: Your entire diatribe here revolves around "adding unsourced information", "articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources", "please provide reputable sources". Anyone reading that, if they thought that you were operating with reasonable competence and in good faith, would assume you were actually talking about <i>information</i> or <i>material</i> that had been added to the article. And since you only quoted <b>half</b> my edit summary, the half that read "Ste4k's excuse for removing it was preposterous", anyone reading this and not knowing the truth might actually fall for your pretense that this is a dispute about information or material that was added to the article with sources that some might see as inadequate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>They would never guess that what you were referring to was a link to the article about <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a> in the "See also" section, a link that you removed under the pretext that it was "POV": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=62089876&amp;oldid=prev" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=62089876&amp;oldid=prev" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> And why would they never guess this?

<dl>
<dd>Would you care to explain just <i>what</i> you think is necessary in the way of sourcing in order to include the <i>main text</i> used by an organization in a "See also" entry? Gee, I wonder if <a href="http://www.endeavoracademy.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.endeavoracademy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.endeavoracademy.com/</a> could just <i>possibly</i> be a source we could use! I mean, they mention it in the second sentence on their index page: "The principal catalyst for this adventure into the enlightenment of humanity is the spiritual mind training of A Course In Miracles." Oh, but I'm sure you'll have some reason to object to that.

<dd>Take your straw man argument elsewhere. I <i>never</i> said "we should be including things people may want to visit" in "See also". I said that we should be including "A Course In Miracles" because it is what Anderson's organization identifies as its primary text.

<dd>Once again, Ste4k, you seem to think that anything directed at your editing that you don't <i>like</i> is a "personal attack". So sorry to tell you, it's not true; when you remove well-cited information that a particular party made a claim very relevant to the article because you have information from a <i>different</i> source (which you have <i>not</i> cited) and you choose to believe <i>your</i> source and choose to remove from the article the information that anyone <i>disagrees</i> with your source's view of the matter -- that is disruption, my friend. If you try to argue to an admin that you aren't disrupting when you remove verifiable information because you disagree with it, but that <b>I</b> am disruptive if I criticize you for that editing behavior -- let me know when you plan to make the report, because I would love to see the look on that admin's face. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:50, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Ste4k? Let's focus on the issues here. Those issues being: when you remove well-cited information about the subject of the article, that they claim a particular state of affairs, and your "explanation" on the talk page of <i>why</i> you would do such a thing is that <i>you</i> view their claim as already disproven and so wish to deny the <i>reader</i> the opportunity of deciding whether <i>they</i> believe the claim or not -- you are in flagrant, massive violation of Wikipedia policy and no amount of harassing other people via their user talk pages will cover that up.

<p>Sir, you have reverted three times already, not me. A record album that sold millions of copies is a valid form of reference. This has passed the point of rationality. This isn't a conspiracy theory, just a subtle bit of interesting trivia. Since you admit that it is at best "trivia," why can't it sit in the trivia section?</p>
<p>R. Kelly is an "appliance fetishist" with his gun, and he goes into the closet with the other two. What do you think R. Kelly is in the episode for??? to Play with Tom Cruise's alleged gayness, of course. Travolta is thrown in just to obscure things. But, he is in the closet. I am telling you that the 'cement' is the Zappa song. I will take it upon myself to get this published by Trey Parker himself if you so desire. If no one gets to read it on Wikipedia until then, at least you will know where you learned it first.</p>
<p>Give me a few examples of "verifiable sources" that would have cushioned my fall from us having crossed spears, mighty Ant.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to be writing fiction, but its easier just to observe the reputable sources on television and radio.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, there's two issues: one is reliable sourcing. Harsh as it may seem, Wikipedia is <i>not interested</i> if you or I think that there's some connection between Zappa's song and the South Park episode. If Trey Parker says it, that's a reliable source -- Trey knows what he's talking about. If Roger Ebert says it, that's a reliable source -- Ebert doesn't have the inside knowledge that Trey does, of course, but he's a published writer acclaimed for his perception and expertise in the field of entertainment. If Josh Gura says it... well, pardon my French, but who the hell is Josh Gura? Why does "Josh Gura thinks this is meaningful" carry any more weight than "My Aunt Flo thinks it's not meaningful"?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other is verifiability. It has to be possible, at least in theory, for anyone to verify that your source says what you say it says. Therefore, if you bump into Trey Parker at a party and ask him "Dude, what inspired you to make an episode about Scientology and the closet?" and he says "That Zappa song" -- you still can't use it on Wikipedia. <i>If</i>, however, someone from a newspaper or magazine is at the party and happens to catch Parker saying that, and puts that in print -- then anyone can look up that newspaper/magazine, read that article, and find out that yes, Parker <i>did</i> confirm that connection, and thus it's verifiable.</dd>

<dd>There it is, in a nutshell. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:41, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Great. At this juncture, I am no longer claiming that there is a connection between the Zappa song and South Park's episode OTHER than the content of those two pieces themselves, which are both reliable sources because they are themselves the original sources. We may as well the synopsis of the episode if we cannot rely on the episode as a source. Wikipedia nferring that Tom Cruise is being called gay from the show is a potential libellous mistake since Travolta and Kelly are also in the closet. As base as SP are, they are also clever (South Park, not Suppressive Persons.) Just as the very words we use are verifiable, so are the lyrics in the Zappa song, which L. Ron "Hoover"'s voice is depicted instructing a 'recruit' to go into the closet. Maybe you can assume good faith with me and help find a way to present this interesting bit of trivia to the community instead of lopping off my work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The South Park episode has only a remote connection to Star Wars. This is a movie cliche' that has been beaten to death. No other entertainment product has combined Scientology and 'being in the closet' but Zappa's song "token of my extreme." For some reason, original research like the ephemeral Star Wars reference is retained, and at the same time banning the Zappa stuff. I don't worship Zappa, but it is definitely a strong link. Is this article someone's pet, or are we in the information business? The facts are the facts. Star Wars parodies itself with using old cliches. Other SP episodes make references to Star Wars, but not this one. The Zappa reference is good. Not everyone has seen any of this, but to one who has seen them all, they would know.</dd>

<dd>The idea that someone apparently quite ordinary/humble turns out to be The Prophesied One -- <i>that</i> is a cliche. The idea that "extraordinary high &lt;Treknobabble&gt; levels in the blood" identify that special person is a definite reference to <i>The Phantom Empire</i>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have captured the essence of the argument exactly, there is NO secret meaning, all that must be done is to see the notable sources themselves. This is no more a co-incidence than your precious Star Wars brainchild. Zappa wrote about the exact circumstances of this episode, and since Zappa happened before Star Wars part ten (your generation,) it is antiquated, arcane information... the scary vinyl record jacket peels off the pile of cobweb and dust covered ancient tunes of yesteryear under the prying eyes of a sleuthing science fiction writer that's only desire is to ruin antonio felspar's day with adding UNREFERENCE-able, impossible to locate illegal "truth." It takes a preacher to bless this as truth, because there is no technology left to listen to a vinyl record that belonged to your grand daddy. no eyes of your own to watch the south park episode, and no brain of your own to see the uncanny similarity between the two original sources. Does your job feel thankless?</dd>

In time, your energy will wane. You are the perpetrator of attacks. I only dignify them by speaking with you on your talk page. You lack in more 'good Wikipedia qualities' than you make up for with your select knowledge of disciplinary proceedings. If you are going to enforce rules in this community, try to follow them yourself. You broke rule #1, but that doesnt give you the green light to break all the others. Quit while you are ahead, as you are just as succeptible to being banned as anyone else. Stop threatening other Wikipedians, please. Must you 'lord over' each detail discussed in this article?

<dd>"Good faith" refers only to the spirit in which a contributor makes their edits; thus, "assume good faith" would be the rule that you are violating when you presume to tell me the contents of my own mind and tell me that I view Wikipedia as a "forum of petty competition and sport". It does not refer to the quality of edits; thus, if you are insistently adding a dull, unimportant "coincidence" which is not in any way important or notable, it does not mean that I am to "assume good faith" and pretend that there is actually merit to it. As for your threat that you will try to get me banned, I will suggest again that before you do far more damage to yourself than to me, you quit while you're ahead and find some contribution to make to Wikipedia besides the dubious "contribution" of a very unimportant factoid to the episode article. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see how you came up empty with <i>Bare-Faced Messiah</i>, actually. Even if you didn't see the page numbers in the comment, the online version does have the index, where you can look up "Operation Snow White". Checking those occurences would have shown you the text at the end of page 317 and the beginning of 318: "Hubbard, who had never been fettered by convention or strict observance of the law, conceived a simple, but startlingly audacious, plan to improve his own image and that of his church for the benefit of future generations of Scientologists. All that needed to be done, he decided, was to infiltrate the agencies concerned, steal the relevant files and either destroy or launder any damaging information they contained. To a man who had founded both a church and a" -- page 317 ends, page 318 begins -- "private navy this was a perfectly feasible scheme. The operation was given the code name Snow White - two words that would figure ever more prominently over the next few months in the communications between the Guardian's Office in Los Angeles and the Commodore's hiding place in Queens, New York." There you go, a perfectly suitable secondary source, and of course secondary sources are actually preferable to primary sources. However, if you'd like a secondary source that quotes the primary source more directly, try this article from The Globe and Mail: <a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/scientology/canada/canada5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/scientology/canada/canada5.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am looking for one or more documents that were written by Hubbard. The <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Snow_White_8d0f.html" title="Operation Snow White">Operation Snow White</a> article indicates that Hubbard wrote the Snow White Program. The only way to understand what this means and verify it is to find the documents. If we cannot find the original docuents, then we might be able to say, "Mr. X claimed to have seen documents written by Hubbard....."<br />
What document written by Hubbard suggested a plan that was to, "steal the relevant files and either destroy or launder any damaging information they contained"? The one document I found so far ("Project Hunter") contains plans for law suits and says, "Any action taken against this area must also be very polite and not abusive". --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 05:08, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anateus, I was examining the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices.html#Salaries" title="Scientology beliefs and practices">Scientology_beliefs_and_practices#Salaries</a>.

The pope recieves no salary, and I am sure scientologists are as, if not more, lavish with their leader. For instance, his villa (seen in aerial photographs) is definitely not of the kind usually associated with that salary range.I feel that adding a few sentences to this chapter could help clear things up, what do you think? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 12:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I can't tell about <i>beliefs</i>, as in the religion/philosophy as opposed to secular corporation... but it sure is interesting material concerning their <i>practices</i>, and I'd like to know if what those who still believe after breaking away from the church do any differently...

<dd>Well, if you interpret "practices" in that sense, then there's <i>nothing</i> the Church of Scientology does which can't be called a "practice" of Scientology.

<dd>As a completely trivial-to-your-viewpoint comment, since Scientology (the philosophy) purports no belief by anyone, (no tenets of faith belief, no leap of conciousness belief) then of course "beliefs and practices" necessarily fall within religious practices. Why not drop back to the goal line that can be defended and present "education" in the template (as once was) because that is an arrangement of information which both Scientologists can not argue with and which (whatever you call that point of view, you know?) can contribute to, also. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 06:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could you please explain, more fully, why you moved <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28Guantanamo_detainee_87%29_494a.html" title="Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)">Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28detainee%29_4031.html" title="Asif Iqbal (detainee)">Asif Iqbal (detainee)</a>&#160;? Your edit summary said you moved it because it was "simpler".</p>
<p>Asif Iqbal is, apparently, a common name. <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28detainee%29_4031.html" title="Asif Iqbal (detainee)">Asif Iqbal (detainee)</a> is an insufficiently precise article title, because it could be about <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28Ayodhya_bombing_suspect%29_d82f.html" title="Asif Iqbal (Ayodhya bombing suspect)">Asif Iqbal (Ayodhya bombing suspect)</a>, arrested on suspicion of involvement in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Ram_Janmabhoomi_attack_in_Ayodhya_2984.html" title="2005 Ram Janmabhoomi attack in Ayodhya">2005 Ram Janmabhoomi attack in Ayodhya</a>, or <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:x_fftcGi4-QJ:www.thepersecution.org/hrcp/hrcp03.html+prison+%22Asif+Iqbal%22+-Guantanamo+-Tipton+-%22United+-Kingdom%22+-%22Abu+-Ghraib%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:x_fftcGi4-QJ:www.thepersecution.org/hrcp/hrcp03.html+prison+%22Asif+Iqbal%22+-Guantanamo+-Tipton+-%22United+-Kingdom%22+-%22Abu+-Ghraib%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">this Asif Iqbal</a>, detained on suspicion of religious extremism.</p>
<p>If you can't offer a better explanation than simplicity, I think the article title <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28Guantanamo_detainee_87%29_494a.html" title="Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)">Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)</a> should be restored. It is not only precise enough to distinguish between any other detainee named Asif Iqbal, but it has the advantage that it is consistent with the names of the articles of several dozen other Guantanamo detainees whose names required disambiguation.</p>
<p>FWIW, when you move an article to a new name you are supposed to click on the "what links here" button, and resolve double redirects. In this particular case you didn't seem to have taken the trouble to do so. In this particular case I think this will prove to be an advantage, if you ask an administrator to undo your move.</p>
<p>An administrator will have to undo your move, if <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28Guantanamo_detainee_87%29_494a.html" title="Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)">Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)</a> is going to retain its edit history. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 15:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You happen to be incorrect; when I moved <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28Guantanamo_detainee_87%29_494a.html" title="Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)">Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28detainee%29_4031.html" title="Asif Iqbal (detainee)">Asif Iqbal (detainee)</a>, I did check for double redirects. The only such redirect was <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28terror_suspect%29_182b.html" title="Asif Iqbal (terror suspect)">Asif Iqbal (terror suspect)</a>, which accordingly I updated to point to the actual article. Would you care to explain why you are falsely alleging that "In this particular case you didn't seem to have taken the trouble to [fix double redirects]" when <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Asif_Iqbal_%28detainee%29_96a9.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Asif Iqbal (detainee)">there are no double redirects</a>? Also, you seem to be a bit confused about how the move process works. When the history of article title <i>Foo</i> shows that it has always been a redirect to <i>Bar</i> (as is the case when an article is moved from <i>Foo</i> to <i>Bar</i> and a redirect is automatically left in its place), no administrator intervention is needed to move the article from <i>Bar</i> to <i>Foo</i>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for the issue of the correct title for the article about this particular Asif Iqbal -- I think that perhaps there as well you might be a bit confused about how <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> is done. Whenever possible, we use the name of the person, place or thing itself, with no parenthesized disambiguation term. Why? Simple: by so doing, we maximize the chances that someone editing a Wikipedia page and putting the name in double brackets will link to the right article. For the same reason, when we <i>do</i> need to add a parenthesized disambiguation term, we try to select the disambiguation term which would be easiest for someone to guess. Are you suggesting that anyone who wants to link to Asif Iqbal should know, not just that he was a detainee, not just that he was a detainee at Guantanamo, but that he was a detainee at Guantanamo with the detainee number 87?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, what you say about "consistent with the names of the articles of several dozen other Guantanamo detainees whose names required disambiguation" is a bit alarming to me. When a person's notability stems <i>solely</i> from their involvement with an event or situation that is itself encyclopedically notable, there is just simply no need to give that person an individual article. Yet you are referring to "several dozen" Guantanamo detainees; what are these detainees <i>individually</i> notable for, apart from being detained at Guantanamo? Why is it that there is an article for <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipton_Three_41dc.html" title="Tipton Three">Tipton Three</a> and then individual articles for <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28detainee%29_4031.html" title="Asif Iqbal (detainee)">Asif Iqbal (detainee)</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shafiq_Rasul_5399.html" title="Shafiq Rasul">Shafiq Rasul</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhal_Ahmed_2023.html" title="Ruhal Ahmed">Ruhal Ahmed</a> as well, when the individual articles primarily just duplicate the contents of <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipton_Three_41dc.html" title="Tipton Three">Tipton Three</a>? The only important content that is in any of the three individual articles that isn't in <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipton_Three_41dc.html" title="Tipton Three">Tipton Three</a> is information that <i>should</i> be in <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipton_Three_41dc.html" title="Tipton Three">Tipton Three</a> -- and isn't, because someone added it to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_%28detainee%29_4031.html" title="Asif Iqbal (detainee)">Asif Iqbal (detainee)</a> instead.

<p>I've noticed that the <a href="../../../r/a/%C3%AB/Ra%C3%ABlism.html" title="Raëlism">Raëlism</a> article has been more or less totally rewritten over the past 2 days by <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmarinas86_d325.html" title="User:Kmarinas86">User:Kmarinas86</a>, who it seems only edits on rael-related articles. The user has made at least a dozen edits in the space of two days, some of which are pointless, some of which are acceptable and some of which are not (deletion of the "criticism" section, for example). I am uncertain of what to do about it. Should I revert everything? Should I warn the user (even though he/she will no doubt argue that this is not vandalism)? Should I tag? As a wiki-veteran, what is your opinion? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 12:14, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's unlikely to be vandalism by the Wikipedian definition, since he probably <i>thinks</i> that he's acting in good faith. What I would do is look up the other people who have edited the article in the recent past and ask for their help in keeping the article NPOV; then I would look at the difference between Kmarinas86's "current" version and the last "good" version, and wherever the good version is clearly superior, restore what was in the good version with a clear explanation. For instance, deletion of a "Criticism" section is rarely if ever in line with Wikipedia practice. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 12:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In fact, I'm the one who put the "criticism" sections to begin with. However, SecretLondon deleted those on the <a href="../../../r/a/e/Raelian_Movement_de89.html" title="Raelian Movement">Raelian Movement</a> page, so I began to question whether or not I should have those yet since nobody was putting stuff in there yet. Despite that, I left the one I added on <a href="../../../r/a/e/Rael.html" title="Rael">Rael</a> - as of a few minutes ago, it's still blank.<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmarinas86_d325.html" title="User:Kmarinas86">Kmarinas86</a> 21:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmmm. I would <i>definitely</i> consult with others besides Kmarinas who have edited the article. I'm checking around, and it looks like perhaps the article isn't being rewritten, so much as split up into multiple articles, of which <a href="../../../r/a/%C3%AB/Ra%C3%ABlism.html" title="Raëlism">Raëlism</a> has become the equivalent of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices.html" title="Scientology beliefs and practices">Scientology beliefs and practices</a> -- a description of the belief system, independent of the organization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the one hand, such a split is not inherently bad (I see it seems to have the support of <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroidCat_90a6.html" title="User talk:AndroidCat">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AndroidCat_cf6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/AndroidCat">contribs</a>), who I've always seen as a fair-minded and level-headed contributor.) On the other hand, I've barely scratched the surface of Kmarinis's contributions and already I'm finding stuff that makes me want to keep a close eye on what he's doing (for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ra%C3%ABlism&amp;diff=68439634&amp;oldid=68287925" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ra%C3%ABlism&amp;diff=68439634&amp;oldid=68287925" rel="nofollow">here</a> creating empty "Criticism" headers scattered throughout the article and warning anyone who would put content under those headers "back up yourself with verifiable sources" when most of the existing content is not backed up by such sources. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 13:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kmarinis seems to think that NPOV means putting "is said to be" in front of every assertion he makes about his cult. This leads to rather strange articles. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 13:29, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>He then goes on to remove all of these "said to be" thingies. I am starting to wonder how many people actually use the Kmarinis account. Or is he just schizophrenic? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 13:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>KMarinas, I know I should do it instead of asking you, but I'm somewhat busy with other things right now. I would appreciate it if you could put something in the criticism sections. The articles on Rael definitely need a series template (see the one on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> ) as well as a more balanced PoV. As it stands, the article does not convey the fact that this is still a sect (and by sect I define any religious/semi-religious organisation that asks you to give them x% of your income...). I feel it is unfair that the faults of other sects such as scientology (although I know the two are not comparable, to my knowledge Raelians are allowed to believe in medicine...) are brought to light, and not Raelism. I suspect you are a Raelian yourself, so if you feel you cannot do this, let me know and I will try to see what I can do. The links to critical websites will no doubt help you. If you go to the website of the Ministère de l'Intérieur, you can probably find reasons for scientology being classed as a sect in France. For the moment, I think neutrality warnings on the pages might be necessary as a temporary measure until we get both sides of the argument into the article. This is by no means a criticism of your writing: you have done some very hard work on this page, and with a bit more effort it could really be up to par. I will also post this message to your user talk page. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 07:23, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sect" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sect</a> gives several definitions of what a sect is:</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) "sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split" <b>and</b> "sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society", in this case, the Raelian Movement is not a sect, because only one, not both, of the criteria is met.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) sectarianism "a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.", so the Raelian Movement is sectarian in the sense that it possesses a trait shared by revolutionary movements such as the Civil Rights Movements of 19th and 20th century America.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) "A religious or political cult, by contrast, also has a high degree of tension with the surrounding society, but its beliefs are, within the context of that society, new and innovative." The Raelian Movement fits this. "Whereas the cult is able to enforce its norms and ideas against members" The Raelian Movement does not fit this since it lacks a true dictatorial leadership. As you can see, this definition is able to contradict itself in the case the Raelian Movement - making it an invalid definition. "a sect normally doesn't strictly have "members" with definite obligations, only followers, sympathisers, supporters or believers." This fits the Raelian Movement, as well as a plethora of apparently normal organizations which do not push their members to do exact things.</dd>

<dd>4) "The English sociologist Roy Wallis[6] argues that a sect is characterized by “epistemological authoritarianism”: sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy." This applies for the Raelian Movement, however, the Raelian Movement has no problem with any heresy as long as it does not violate the fundamentals, such as peace, love, and non-violence. "According to Wallis, “sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation" The Raelian Movement fits this, but salvation only in the case that the world "fails", though such a failure is something Raelians actively want to prevent - hence their disapproval of nuclear weapons and of war in general. "and “their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'”." The Raelian Movement does not fit this as they acknolwedge the greater actions of those who do not adhere to them to be nevertheless deserving of eternal life, perhaps more than they are individually (those people are given the title of Honorary Guide of the Raelian Movement, even if they have no idea of Raelians at all). Again we see the problem with using only one criteria to establish whether the Raelian Movement is a sect when <i>more than one</i> must be met. "He contrasts this with a cult that he described as characterized by “epistemological individualism” by which he means that “the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member.”" In this case, Raelism fits, because the final authority is not Rael, but the individual, because Rael is not a dictator. Megachurches fit this as well, since Christian priests of this day and age are by no means dictators, and neither are guardians at Christian Retreats or teachers who "assign" activities to pupils. But the fact that one fits the criteria does not make one a cult. That is: If Z does A, and B does A, does that mean that Z is B? Not necessarily. It couldn't be objectively determined unless if it was assumed that only one (category of) thing did A. If this were the definition of cult, you would have the final say (only if you belonged to a cult); now isn't that preferrable than having someone else control you as in a sect per Roy Wallis definition? What a joke.&#160;;)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Definitions 3 and 4 are in direct contradiction with each other. By accepting both definitions, it is harder to distinguish a cult from a sect. Do members of a cult need authority for a final word? #3 says yes, #4 says no. Does a sect have individuals with their own choice? #3 says yes, #4 says no. Most people would think that #3 is a better definition than #4. In both definitions, cults and sects are exculsive from each other (i.e. a cult cannot be a sect and a sect cannot be cult (an analogue to this is: red cannot be orange and orange cannot be red, but both are colors). There be some who would disagree with this and say that a cult is a type of sect (analogue: turquiose is a type of blue). As you can see, provided that there be a definition, or a set of non-contradicting definitions, of sect which can be agreed upon (which may not be the case), one must define the Raelian Movement before calling it a sect. Why not call it a sect? Sure, as long as it is stated what that label indicates exactly.<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmarinas86_d325.html" title="User:Kmarinas86">Kmarinas86</a> 05:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(It's also sad to see that even when he's removing the name of the newsgroup, he <i>still</i> can't get the name right, and as for the writing "style" of his Scientology entry, ye gods...) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:30, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Antaeus, you state that I'm not abiding by Wikinfo's rules. May I invite you to understand them? In regard to the various newsgroups and like rumor sharing, I would say this. If you google a screen name who has been active in the Scientology series articles (or their discussion pages), you'll find an interesting proliferation of said screen name.

<dd>Wiki process will take care of the matter if there is a problem just as it does here. Terreo's edits can be modified there as well as here. The rules are very different, Terryeo is abiding by them. The Wikinfo article on Scientology should make it look like the best thing since sliced bread. That is the policy. A companion article making it look like the very work of the devil is welcome too.

<dd>Well, I'd like to clarify that I was expressing two separate opinions on two separate matters. The first is the matter of Wikinfo's "Scientology" article. Given that Wikinfo's policy is, if I understand it correctly, to have separate articles for differing POVs, it is indeed proper for that Wikinfo article to express an unrestrainedly positive view of Scientology. I simply reserve the right to roll my eyes at that unrestrainedly positive view, and to wince at the jumbled, muddy writing style.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The second matter is the fact that, by the logic that Wikinfo should have multiple articles in order to present multiple points of view for examination, there doesn't seem to be any justification for Terryeo to be interfering with the expression of other points of view. He could have created a new article called "List of newsgroups which are not too POV" if he wanted a list that excluded alt.religion.scientology. Instead, what he chose to do was to remove alt.religion.scientology from the <i>existing</i> list. I don't see how those two square with each other but I do see how it fits Terryeo's noted pattern of editing towards his own fixed POV both when the rules allow it and when they don't. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. Remember me? Probably not, but you set me right when I first started on how to move pages around (and when not to).</p>
<p>I'm having a little difficulty with <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_of_the_Nephilim_3fd3.html" title="Fields of the Nephilim">Fields of the Nephilim</a> and the user fieldsofthenephilim.com. If you take a look at the article history (and his user talk page) I have tried to explain that links to advertising sites are not suitable sites for external links, but he just disregards and keeps re-inserting. Now I realised that I carelessly violated the 3RR myself, which may draw some sanction, but am I being unreasonable in considering the link unsuitable? If not, would you be so kind as to helping to have appropriate action taken. Thanks.

<p>I noted your information on the dubiousness of Fritz Lang's Jewish ancestry.

<p>You stated: <i>I think it is perfectly clear, Terryeo, that you</i> were <i>questioning Raymond's motivation, or otherwise there was absolutely no reason at all to insert the gratuitous "thus increasing his personal website traffic, you see?" in your account of Raymond's actions.

<p>The reason I bring your statement here is because it contributes to the view, "Terryeo has made a personal attack", while I have continually, repeatedly, incessently stated that I refuse to comment on Hill's motivation. In addition to my personal statement which you seem unable to accept, other editors who could view my statement as a personal attack do not view my statement as personal attack. In particular, I state, "increase web traffic". Obviously that is a result. I state nothing about Hill's motivation. Your statement contributes nothing to the issues raised. I therefore bring it here if you wish to discuss the area, inviting rather than denying communication. What you do now is up to you. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 20:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You say you are "inviting communication". I disagree. You have already stated that your gratuitous referencing of Raymond's web traffic wasn't intended to imply that he was motivated by a desire to increase his web traffic. I have already stated that I do not believe you, since there is simply no other reason that you <i>would</i> gratuitously reference it. I do not see how us repeating these respective positions to each other over and over would constitute "communication" since each of us is well-aware of each other's position by now. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:16, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, that's what I said and you have replied to. You haven't asked me why I said that Mr. Hill's cite would increase his web traffic. You have stated what you think my reason was. ChrisO stated what he thought my reason was. Yet, neither you nor he disagree that my statement is true. I stated the situation as simply as possible. I could have left out part of the situation. I could have not stated anything about the web traffic Mr. Hill could expect to receive from his personal website being included as a source of secondary information. I agree, it would have been possible. Or, I could have left even more of it out. I could have simply looked at it, seen that Mr. Hill edited to cite his personal website, and moved right along, mentioning none of it. I've done that before and will probably do that again. Neither did I attempt to make an issue of "Wikipedia editors are citing their own personal websites as they edit". I didn't blame, I didn't try to shame, I didn't try to create a stoppage. Yet, you have not asked me why I included the sentences which I admit, was not absolutely necessary at the WP:RS discussion. Instead of asking me, you have told me what you are sure the reason was.

<dd>I see that you have posted even more on this issue, which of course has the result of developing unnecessary traffic. I can only suppose that no matter how little interest I show in endless rehashing of what you did say and didn't say and should've have and might've said, you will continue to post on this matter, which of course will have the effect of developing unnecessary traffic. I believe that if you had actually had had, and wanted to communicate, a reason for bringing up the subject of Raymond Hill's web traffic which was <i>not</i> an attempt to imply that it was a motivation for his actions, you would have already done so -- although this, of course, would actually bring about <i>productive communication</i>, which would not be optimal for the development of unnecessary traffic. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reading your note to <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMookiesDad_d66d.html" title="User:MookiesDad">MookiesDad</a> on his talk page not only ended up bringing me here, but also led me to consideration of this: How does a particular editor (eg, me) prove to others on Wiki that he is not (also) someone else? That is to say, suppose ol' MookiesDad starts taking the position "Aaaa, that crybaby vandal Dickerson--obviously Antaeus Feldspar, same attitude, praises himself, etc etc." How would you or I demonstrate the untruth of this? This is a different question from, How do I make a case that X is Y using puppetry to get around a ban?--the thought being that perhaps, in some way, the person himself has the capacity to do, with regard to himself, what no one can quite do, conclusively, with respect to others.

<dd>If he accuses you (or me, for that matter) of being a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">sock puppet</a>, it can be dealt with when it happens. The administrators who deal with it are aware that a lot of suspicions of sock-puppetry turn out not to be founded and are aware that a lot of accusations aren't even based on real suspicion, just a desire to cause trouble, so they're not going to leap to hasty action just because MookiesDad shoots off his mouth.

<p>You need to learn to discern. Reverting all edits from a person just because you don't agree with some, is quite ridiculous IMO.</p>
<p>1) Project Monarch is (mostly) declassified and verified. Therefore, words such as 'alleged' should be removed.</p>
<p>2) Mark Phillips is not a professional cult deprogrammer he is a former CIA operative. Claiming he is a cult programmer ignores the latter while the latter is a far more broad and important fact and was a professional job with matter to the person's history. Saying he is a cult programmer gives a totally screwed view to the reader.</p>
<p>3) Project Monarch is a subproject of MKULTRA. Referencing to MKULTRA is useful in the contect of Project Monarch.</p>
<p>4) O'Brien and Phillips are the main, public sources. They are not the _only_ sources.</p>

<dd>Yes, you have a point there. I humbly excuse for those edits related to 1 and 3 as they're doubtable. As for 2, I added alleged CIA operative in the article. It is more accurate than 'cult depogrammer' although no such title/profession at all would suffice too. What cults or cult members has he deprogrammed? The word 'cult' is out of context. My edits with regard to 4 are at least better than the previous state. Note, that point 4 is proven by Project Monarch entry and various of its sources on bottom. It is therefore completely bogus to say that CoB and MP are somehow 'the only source'. 2 and 4 in CoB entry were inconsistent with PM entry. The article is now more accurate according to Wikipedia's policies IMO. Have a look and a nice day or 2.</dd>

<p>Hi. How is unsupported speculation by Scn critics anything but heresay and gossip? The very article quoted says "Ex-Scientologists Speculate on Why Michael and Lisa Wed". Wiki policy is to be VERY careful about living persons <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons</a>.

<dd><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> only applies to <i>unsourced</i> negative material about living persons. The material you removed was sourced. I'm afraid that you're making a rather common mistake that I term "the transitivity of source prohibitions", which is to assume that even if information is verifiable and from a reliable source, if the process of that reliable source acquiring the information involved anything which would be unacceptable for a Wikipedia editor, then the information in question is therefore prohibited from Wikipedia. This isn't the case, however. A Wikipedia editor couldn't conduct interviews with eyewitnesses about an event such as a fire or a shooting, and yet a reporter covering a story about such an event for the <i>New York Times</i> would certainly interview any such eyewitnesses. Does this mean that Wikipedia could never include any of the eyewitness accounts published by the <i>Times</i>? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While that is certainly a nice term, it really has absolutely nothing to do with my objection to the material. I am certain that you are a person that can own up to an error and can see that your statement "<a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> only applies to <i>unsourced</i> negative material" is just plain incorrect. Here is what it says "Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced negative material about living persons should be removed immediately from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, and user pages." Speculation by a critic can in no way be considered a "high quality source" relative to Ms. Presley's marriage. It is only of this dubious quality: '"Scientology has been known to tell people to get divorced or married for public relations purposes," says Lawrence Wollersheim'. The critics never even say they are privy to anything relative to Ms. Presley, it is pure speculation. Does that work for you? Will you please revert your edit? Otherwise wikipedia is no more than a tabloid. Thanks--<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:45, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm sorry, but you still don't seem to quite understand. You seem to be arguing that even though it is <i>verifiable</i> that a <i>reliable source</i> published that former Scientologists believe this to be true, Wikipedia should not include the information that they believe it, because <i>you</i> believe that they are <i>incorrect</i> in believing it.</dd>
<dd>But it is precisely <i>because</i> people make such arguments, that their personal views on what is obviously true or obviously untrue should overrule even the most verifiable statement coming from the most reliable sources, that Wikipedia spells out that "verifiability, not truth", is the criteria we use. Therefore, even if you were saying that you believe it to be untrue that those former Scientologists had even <i>advanced that speculation</i>, that belief does not outweigh the fact that it is verifiably reported by a reliable source.</dd>
<dd>This is, I'm afraid, something you'll have to adjust to if you want to keep on contributing to Wikipedia. One thing that may help you to adjust to it is to remind yourself that you have two roles in relationship to Wikipedia, reader and editor. The reader in you is completely free to believe or disbelieve anything you read on Wikipedia. The editor, however, has to answer, not the question "Do I think this is or isn't believable?" "Do I think this is or isn't true?" but "Do I think that this should be presented for <i>other</i> readers to make up <i>their</i> minds, the way I did?"</dd>
<dd>Finally, I really do need to point out that you should be <i>glad</i> Wikipedia has the "verifiability, not truth" policy that it does. If it was ever repealed, how much of what L. Ron Hubbard said would be removed from Wikipedia because it was obviously untrue? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:21, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are getting closer but still miss my point. I imagine I can find any number of people that suppose any number of things and those suppositions might be verifibly reported. Suppose someone speculates that George Bush (or any other public figure for that matter) is an alien pod person and that speculation is reported a NY Times column. Should we put that in the George Bush bio page? Would it stand? What you would like to include are opinion columns that give voice to random speculation by critics; that is not a source of anything other than that some critics speculate and that has no place in biographical references to Ms. Presley. You can present those speculations in reference to the Church or LRH but not a living person. My point is bios of living people have special rules (e.g. 3RR does not apply if I decide to pull this). You don't present vague maunderings and speculation no matter how verifiable they are. I think you are letting your POV color your thinking here. Last time, please self-revert.

<dd>"orchestrated"? Well, I'd tell you to stop kidding yourself, but from what I've seen, you kid yourself nearly continuously and live in a world of self-delusion where nothing is ever your fault. You got blocked because you violated 3RR, despite several warnings from several editors who warned you <i>specifically</i> that WP:BLP would not be the loophole that you thought it was. And you were <i>reblocked</i> because, having been given a very lucky break that <i>most</i> people don't get, of being unblocked as long as you followed certain conditions, you tried to push your luck and say "No, I don't like <i>your</i> conditions; how about <i>my</i> conditions, which really only amount to 'I won't do things that I'm not allowed to do anyways'?"</dd>
<dd>Sorry, but no matter how much you believe that I "orchestrated" your block and re-block, the one who was responsible for your block was you, and the one who was responsible for your re-block was you. You chose to disregard warnings, you chose to violate 3RR, you chose to turn down a most generous offer of mercy and present a so-called "counter-offer" as if you <i>had</i> anything to counter-offer <i>with</i>. I made you do <i>none</i> of those things; in fact, I <i>warned you</i> that claiming "WP:BLP" wouldn't get you off the hook because it didn't cover what you were trying to remove, and if you had actually listened to my warning, or that of AndroidCat, <i>you wouldn't have gotten yourself blocked.</i></dd>
<dd>So really, you can go on all day leaving messages about "just wanted you to know that I know" but all you're <i>really</i> proving to me is that L. Ron Hubbard's vaunted "technology" just simply doesn't work. After all, Hubbard defines one of the characteristics of a suppreshttp://scarygoround.com/sive person as that they are always blaming their troubles on the wrong source. So theoretically his followers should all be <i>good</i> at correctly identifying the source of their troubles, right? And good at <i>not</i> blaming other people for troubles they caused themselves, right? But here you are, blaming the person who tried to <i>warn you</i> about violating 3RR for your own stubborn wrong-headed choice. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I ascribed no significance or blame to your actions except to say that I know that you directly orchestrated the block and reblock. That does not speak to whether you were right or wrong or whether I deserved either. In actual fact I have no beef with the block; I did revert over three times though I thought that was not a factor for the reasons I have already given ad nauseum but if another did not feel the same way and acted accordingly then so be it; I can assume it is a good-faith disagreement and go from there. The reblock is another story. I reject this concept you would advance that I am not allowed to negotiate with the blocking sysop over the terms under which she would unblock me; I find such a condescending proposal absurd; I am not a 4-year-old in time-out (though I have always taken the position with my children that everything is open to negotiation but I get to say when negotiations are over and if the child makes a good argument I am happy to let him sway me; I would rather have a bold negotiator than a wimp.). If I agree to something and it is not what the sysop wants then the simple solution is just say no. That's it for me, nothing more to say on the subject as far as you are concerned.--<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 23:37, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then I think perhaps you need to word-clear "orchestrated", since that word assigns a great deal of significance and/or blame for whatever was "orchestrated" to whomever "orchestrated" it. As regards whether you were "allowed" to negotiate with the blocking sysop, no one ever suggested you weren't "allowed" to negotiate. You're "allowed" to negotiate. You're also "allowed", in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackjack.html" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a>, to ask the dealer for another card when your hand is two tens. Note that being "allowed" doesn't in any way mean "not a horribly bad idea". However, if you still don't grasp that you were <i>already</i> getting a second chance that most violators <i>do not</i> receive, and that looking that generous gift horse in the mouth by trying to "negotiate" for even <i>more</i> than that was a really <i>bad idea</i>, then I don't know who possibly <i>could</i> get the idea across to you.</dd>
<dd>You say "I would rather have a bold negotiator than a wimp" as if those were the only two options. Does that mean you think it would be the action of a "wimp" to comply with a rather mercifully offered set of conditions for unblocking? See, Wikipedia <i>doesn't need</i> more people who think that they're always right. You <i>got</i> blocked because, rather than concede that two editors who both have easily ten times your experience with Wikipedia <i>might</i> be right about 3RR not working the way you wanted it to, you insisted "<i>I</i> am the one in the right here; <i>I</i> know what should be scrubbed from the articles even at the cost of violating 3RR." When Slim offered to unblock you, she was giving you the chance to show that, despite your misstep, you were the kind of person who could understand that you might not always be right. When you responded to her generous offer by effectively saying "<i>Your</i> conditions for unblocking me are <i>wrong</i>; why don't we go with <i>my</i> conditions, which are so much smarter than yours?" you demonstrated that you did not have the basic cooperation skills that in fact you were being given the chance to display. And frankly, the way that ever since then you have referred to SlimVirgin's "wrongly" reblocking you <b>when she never had to offer you an unblocking in the first place</b> just reinforces the same impression, that despite whatever skills and virtues you <i>are</i> bringing to the table, a mature spirit of cooperation isn't one of them. Wikipedia needs people who can come together and work out between them a way to do things. Wikipedia <i>doesn't</i> need people who are going to say "We'll do it my way; my way is the smartest way; what's that? you're not in favor of my way? I'm sorry to see you are proclaiming yourself so un-smart because if you were smart you would be doing it my way ..." and it <i>surely</i> doesn't need people who, when their own arrogance and stubbornness has gotten them into trouble, are going to shift the blame to someone else and insist that someone else "orchestrated" their trouble. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the score of personal attacks, <b>you</b> were the one who made the sweeping and insulting accusations that I was "letting [my] POV take precedence over [my] ability to reason properly" and telling me "I am beginning to doubt your reasoning abilities" and then when Wikipediatrix warned you about personal attacks you insisted that they weren't, calling it just "open discussion". Those were insults to my intelligence and to my integrity but I figured "hey, if that's the spirit he wants to interact in, I'll meet him on the level <b>he's chosen</b>."

<dd>No, no gambit. Fair warning. That last bit from you crossed a line for me. You are getting way too personal and you need to stop now. I have made a few cracks but you are starting to rant about me. You may not have noticed but I have admitted my errors in being too sarcastic and I have resolved to be "kinder and gentler" and I do not think you will find much that is objectionable in my recent communications to you. In fact, I have made a visible effort to offer an olive branch on several occasions. I will apologize now to you personally for anything I may have said to you that attacked you personally rather than your arguments or actions. I do not expect you to think that because I have changed that you now must, I only expect you to stop personal attacks. You know, Antaeus, you make good points quite often but my problem in discussing anything with you is that you never want to give any ground. Perhaps you are interested in debating but I am interesting in agreement and you have never, that I recall, agreed with anything that I have said.

<dl>
<dd>Good; you can have the last word after this on the subject. Here is my last word. 1) You act as if I started the uncivility but you evidenced it to at least some degree in your very first communication to me over my first edit on 24 Aug 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScientology&amp;diff=71492351&amp;oldid=71486861" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScientology&amp;diff=71492351&amp;oldid=71486861" rel="nofollow">"I'm afraid you don't understand a thing about</a> <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>." That is pretty mild and might not be the best example from our early exchanges but it is certainly phrased in a confrontational and personal manner and certainly set the stage for where we ended. I take full responsibility for rising to the occasion to the degree that I did but no way you can say it started when you say it did (and please don't make me look at more history to prove this point, I just looked for our first exchange). And 2) On second thought I am going to just leave the block/reblock thing alone as I doubt we will reach any agreement there. We can perhaps agree that any ill will between us escalated from our original interactions and we both played our parts.--<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please do not take only <i>part</i> of a sentence and present it out of context. The complete sentence that you refer to, with the part that you removed emphasized, is "<i>If you think it's "irrelevant" for someone to claim that they remembered a formula from a past life containing ingredients that would not have been known at that time and place,</i> I'm afraid you don't understand a thing about <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>."

I think perhaps it would be best if we ceased communication; while I was interested in some points that were raised, particularly your expressed belief in the existence of critics who would uncritically swallow any anti-Scientology claim and in Scientology technology making a positive difference in people's lives, I simply do not feel that our communication has been productive enough to justify the amounts of time and energy it is demanding. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:47, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As far as the points I raise I am glad that you have interest in them. Those two are at the top of my list of overarching "meta" points regarding the presentation of Scientology on wikipedia, others being that the Scientologists and anti-Scientologists are both unwilling to acknowledge anything valid in the other's arguments and that both seek to make wikipedia a mirror of either scientology.org or xenu.com as the case may be.

<p>You and I have encountered each other on a few of the talk pages for Scientology-related articles. I know next to nothing about Scientology and have never met a practising Scientologist, so you may think it strange that I take an interest in these pages; I generally feel that a good encyclopedist should always be expanding his intellectual horizons. Yet whenever I try to find out anything about Scientology or clear up anything I don't understand, I seem to get locked into your eternal debate with Terryeo. The two of you seem to be doomed to repeat exactly the same discussion, about the same thing, over and over <i>ad infinitum et ad nauseam</i>. (sort of a Wiki-Limbo perhaps - sorry only joking). The point I'm trying to make, without intending to be critical of either you or Terryeo, is that it's become very difficult to find out any neutral, factual knowledge that isn't disputed. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 12:15, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. As someone that knows an awful lot of Scientology both from almost 30 years as a practicing Scientologist and having been interested in critical materials almost from the beginning (I read Paulette Cooper's book in 1983 or so and have read most of the major critical books, have read and posted on alt.religion.scientology practically from its inception, and am familiar with the material on just about every critical website) I have strong opinions on both sides of the fence. I doubt that there are more than a handful of people here, if that, that can evaluate what is presented here in the Scientology articles, on both sides, as well as I can (I think there are other editors here with extensive experience on both sides). When I took an interest in the Scientology articles here recently, I found them overwhelming one-sided toward the skeptic or critical side, not at all NPOV. I thought that I might address that situation a bit. It has been an adventure but an enjoyable one as I can get a bit feisty on the subject. I have been discussing the situation here with Antaeus and a few others and I have made some observations:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that wikipedia is one-sided and contains a lot that about Scientology that is mis-stated, mis-interpreted, wrongly emphasised, or just plain wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This stems from the fact that most edits are made from "researchers" that only look to the internet for a source of data about Scientology. I will go further, I bet that many only look to critical websites and will not try to learn about Scientology from official websites. They take the viewpoint that official websites cannot be trusted but forget to extend that same skepticism to the critical websites. But in actual fact, the official sites are the best ones for researching what Scientology teaches and what the terms mean. They are the best place to research what is right or good about Scn; the critic sites are the best places to research what is wrong or bad. Both require a sharp sense of what is bullshit, if I may be blunt. Unfortunately, Scn is so outside the realm of the non-Scientologist's experience that it would be unusual for one to have such a sense of what is BS or what is not; to many it ALL sounds like BS, I imagine. I fear many "solve" that by trusting the critics and distrusting the Scientologists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The genus of this problem is the Church's (CoS) incredible foot-bullet as regards the internet. The Church has managed to bring criticism of Scientology to the status of an internet, and practically a cultural, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So you have a repository of one-sided knowledge created by editors that have only a one-sided exposure to the subject. They sometimes seem to act as if there is only one side and that presentation of that one side is NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From what I understand, pro-Scn editors have in the past tried to "handle" this using their own one-sided POV. They have been disruptive and have created more ill-will toward Scn. In their likely belief that any criticism of Scn is generated by the critics' own moral failings (that they subconciously or consciously fear Scn will expose), they are no better than critics that claims any acceptance of Scn is because of brainwashing and social control (there is social control in Scn but that is not a condemnation of the philosophy, only the organization). Both of those attitudes would prevent any real dialogue. What I think occurred is that editors have practically made wikipedia a mirror of xenu.com. The Scientologists thought they could make it a mirror of scientology.org but received a rude come-uppance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What needs to occur now is that rather than mirroring diametically opposed viewpoints, editors here must look at both sides and edit accordingly. The Scn sites are good sources for material about Scn and the successes that Scn has enjoyed, remembering, of course, that BS detector I mentioned. The critical websites can be good sources of what ex-Scientologists claim and what experts say, remembering again that disgruntled people say disgruntled things and that not everyone that claims to be an expert actually is; and those caveats in addition to the general BS detection.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Antaeus, I apologise for using your talk page; you can move this discussion if you want to. But (Antaeus), I am still curious (although you don't have to answer) what your interest is in Scientology, and why you spend so much time and effort debating with Terryeo. Terryeo's bias and motivation are obvious; your own is not clear, as your user page does not indicate any connection to Scientology. Don't you get slightly bored with repeating what is, effectively, the same debate? I realise this query is fairly superfluous and I will understand if you don't want to reply. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Walton, I had a lengthy reply typed out in which I outlined why I feel it's necessary to answer Terryeo's numerous attempts to spread misinformation, even when it's the same misinformation as before. So of course the browser ate it. Hopefully I can get the chance to write a replacement and answer your other question on what my interest in Scientology is, but my time has proven a tricky thing to juggle lately. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, sorry i'm not sure whether this is the right place but I figured you could always delete it if so.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say a huge thank you. I have been trying to get my head around the Monty-hall problem and having read you explanation:</p>
<p>"This is why I say it's so simple. When you understand the problem constraints correctly, you see that if the player picks the car initially, switching loses -- no exceptions. And if the player picks a goat initially, switching wins -- no exceptions. Since the player picks a goat initially 66.6% of the time, that's how much of the time switching wins."</p>
<p>That really cleared up my understanding and I felt you deserve some plaudits for putting it much more simplistically than maybe the article does (at least for me). <a href="../../../n/y/1/User%7ENy156uk_f375.html" title="User:Ny156uk">ny156uk</a> 20:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You said: "if it IS a forgery, then what would be anti-Scientology is to OMIT the declarations that it is one!".........my feeling at the time was that without the deeper context provided in articles like <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishman_Affidavit_6d84.html" title="Fishman Affidavit">Fishman Affidavit</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_Thetan_ca0f.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a>, it came off kinda like a loaded denial, like saying "There is absolutely no truth to the rumors that Bob beats his wife" out of the blue. Probably should be expanded and rewritten if kept, especially because the first part, "It was initially believed that the text of OT VIII was revealed to the outside world in the Fishman Affidavit. However..." has a spin on it to make it sound as if the Jesus bit renders the whole document suspect. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 21:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point, but I would submit that a crucial factor which must be considered is -- <i>are there indeed</i> rumors that Bob beats his wife?? If there are no such rumors, then it's the familiar "spread the FUD under the guise of being fair about it" that we all know scoundrels love. But if indeed the rumors are out there circulating then I don't think it's reasonable to maintain silence. In this case of course the "rumors" are not rumors, they are documents submitted to a court of law, which were in fact initially <i>confirmed</i> by Scientology to be one of its copyrighted OT levels. Because someone who has an interest in the subject is highly likely to run into <i>that</i> side of the story, it is rather more fair to Scientology to give them <i>Scientology's</i> side of the story as well, than to remove all mention of it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, the fact that we are discussing <i>at all</i> the Fishman version of OT VIII is by far <i>not</i> the biggest problem with the <a href="../../../o/t/_/OT_VIII_4320.html" title="OT VIII">OT VIII</a> article. A far bigger problem is that it currently implies that heavy doubt is thrown on the Fishman OT VIII by the testimony of ex-members who did OT VIII and didn't encounter anything about Jesus. As I pointed out on the talk page (and as no one has responded to), the level these ex-members are talking about, at least the one whose statements are being cited towards this point, <i>is not the same level</i>. Ariane Jackson specifies that she is talking about the level the Church itself calls "<i>New</i> OT VIII" <i>(emphasis added)</i>, <i>not</i> the original OT VIII which is what Fishman said he was submitting to the court. Instead, the OT VIII article doesn't even acknowledge that there's more than one document called "OT VIII". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not only do I see things differently, I have never seen anyone interpret talk page guidelines in the manner you suggest. If a post is <i>not</i> a direct reply to the post of another, then the appropriate place for it is at the bottom. But when it <i>is</i> a direct reply, it should go underneath <i>the statement it replies to</i>, properly indented to show it as a reply. I've never seen anyone interpret those guidelines to mean "if person D is replying to person A, but after person B and C have said things that they put in the same section, person D's comments must go after B's and C's". If that was the intent, wouldn't the guidelines express it much more clearly as "Comments go in chronological order, period"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:58, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Antaeus Feldspar,<br />
"Cult PR agent" eh? (hehe) Well, that's timely... your Wikipedia cult needs you.<br />
Right now there's a major change that's been edited into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a> rules, that if a slippery slope, could cause ripples across the encyclopedia and beyond. The five-some logical reasons against the change are bad enough, but #6, motivation, is the angle that could make the internet news. Seems to me one of the minor proofs of cult membership is being so seriously concerned that folks might believe it, that one risks a major LOGRTAC source (Salon.com) to hide the silly truth that The Guardian's Charles Arthur called WP a cult. It would be funny if it didn't make WP lose NPOV PR. And on days I don't care it will be funny anyway.<br />
If you are still interested in LOGRTAC please vote in the poll. Milo 15:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Be bold in contributions, but not in destructions.</i> Editing is a collaborative effort, so <b>editing boldly</b> should not be confused with <b>reverting boldly</b>. This only leads to <a href="../../../e/d/i/WP%7EEDIT_WAR_da1e.html" title="WP:EDIT WAR">edit wars</a>. Use the talk page instead. A simple guideline for simple reverting is that it works best for, and is really intended as, <i>a tool against CLEAR vandalism.</i> So save it for that! In cases other than vandalism, somebody is trying to be constructive. Even if they are doing it badly, and even if they are completely and foolishly wrong, there are usually more polite and constructive ways to deal with them than simply returning the article back to the pristine way (you think) it should remain. So, here's the time to think of better solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're tempted to revert for anything but clear vandalism, take a deep breath; it may be better to discuss it on the talk page or build on the previous edit with a new edit of your own. It may be even better to simply do nothing for twenty-four hours while you cool down. Reverting isn't always collaborative editing, but often a cheap shortcut. (And, it doesn't help that you're limited in space for your revert "edit summary" comment. Over-succinctness may lead to rude-sounding stuff.) Be careful if a revert touches off a revert war. If a revert war begins, then collaboration is not working, and editing the article boldly by reverting is not collaboration. Instead it attempts to force one editor's will on the other editors, which will never work. Such edits will not survive. The "correctness" or "truthfulness" of the edit is irrelevant at this point (<b>See:</b> <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBOLD%2C_revert%2C_discuss_cycle_e770.html" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a>).</p>

<p>Hi Antaeus,<br /></p>
<p>Yesterday a self-referential event occurred in the periodic minor debate over whether Wikipedia is a non-fancult in the abuse, exploitation, or excessive control senses. (My previous light analysis is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults#Wikipedia.2C_Mary_Kay.2C_as_cults" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults#Wikipedia.2C_Mary_Kay.2C_as_cults" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) In your page history, I wanted to preserve your thoughtful comment on Wikipedia as a referred cult, and describe the escalating reaction to it that subsequently caused Dementation to request that his account be deleted. Note that Dementation set the stage for this confrontation with his <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">12-04</a> user page comment: <i>"I started editing pages until I realised how stupid most wikipedia authors are."</i></p>
<blockquote>

<p><i>-&#160;:This is starting to sound abit like a standard knee-jerk reaction to something. Wikipedia does not attempt any control over people, no matter how much its other editors think so. Anyone calling wikipedia a cult when it is an unbiased attempt at information gathering. Obviously it isnt perfect and people will tend to influence an article one way or the other, but it does not constitute a cult. The only people who think it is a cult are people who are obviously against it and want to brand it as such. The definition of a cult is very specific.

<p>This proper debate was followed up with a series of obscenities by Dementation, which provoked warnings, then a cross-user page-blank-revert 3R+ tit-tat, and a vandalism block. IMHO, three editors stepped out of line (which included an admin probably in too much of a hurry) by either not allowing Dementation to control his own user page, or the purely dialog portions of Dementation's talk page. These control excesses were ultimately refereed by a non-admin. After being virtual roughed-up by vigilante editors, Dementation proved to me that he was wrong when he wrote: <i>"Wikipedia does not attempt any control over people..."</i> Milo 08:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, if one interprets his statement broadly enough, then it must be seen as wrong. A system which does not attempt <i>any</i> control over people is an anarchy; there are few true anarchies (and even fewer functioning anarchies).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, if one takes Dementation's statement in the sense relevant to the context (i.e., "Wikipedia does not attempt any control over people in the way that a cult does") I think he's correct. Wikipedia does not try to control your finances; Wikipedia does not instruct you to disconnect from your friends and family if they oppose Wikipedia; Wikipedia does not tell you where to live or what job to work at; Wikipedia does not make you proselytize for Wikipedia. Even if we stipulate excesses occurring in response to Dementation's behavior, I don't see how it shows anything except that Wikipedia expects certain social behaviors that have been outlined to be adhered to by those who use its resources -- such as not calling people "utterly childish" for advocating different opinions, or attributing ulterior motives such as "obviously against it and want to brand it" (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). I really don't think it's accurate, or fair for that matter, to set up a dichotomy of "<i>either</i> Wikipedia has no standards for behavior or does nothing at all to enforce those standards, <i>or</i> Wikipedia is like a cult because it attempts control over people." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The links really only should be kept if there is additional information at the link over and above what the article would contain if it was of featured quality. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 21:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at the issue again, and having checked some of my previous assumptions and found them to be incorrect, I'm inclined to agree with you. I was not aware that there was text in the article itself clarifying that the book was commercially available (which a reader might assume it was not, after reading that PublishAmerica withdrew their "acceptance") and with that information available in the article text, the article links become redundant. Also, it is clearly inappropriate to link to the Amazon page for a book, since Amazon has <i>no</i> relationship to a book other than retailing it; however, I don't think the same can be said automatically about linking to the book's publisher. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:26, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do we do about it? I'm not sure. I've only been doing this Wiki stuff for about two months now, so I'm certainly not an expert on procedure.

<blockquote>
<p>That men should keep their compacts is certainly a great and undeniable rule in morality. But yet, if a Christian, who has the view of happiness and misery in another life, be asked why a man must keep his word, he will give this as a reason:-- Because God, who has the power of eternal life and death, requires it of us. But if a Hobbist be asked why? he will answer:-- Because the public requires it, and the Leviathan will punish you if you do not. And if one of the old philosophers had been asked, he would have answered:-- Because it was dishonest, below the dignity of a man, and opposite to virtue, the highest perfection of human nature, to do otherwise.</p>

<dd>Gee, Justanother, if it was such an "obviously inappropriate inclusion", one would <b>think</b> that one of the admins who had to block you repeatedly for violating 3RR several times on the article would have <b>noticed</b> that.

Why would you need to "know exactly how to state your case" if the case is as blatantly obvious as you are claiming it is? No, you don't need my permission to "correct an obviously inappropriate inclusion" but you cannot simply say "<b>I</b> see it as an obviously inappropriate inclusion and that <b>makes it</b> an obviously inappropriate inclusion, because obviously anyone who disagrees with me is acting in bad faith out of their malicious desires." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:55, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just chatting to the admin who looked at the 3RR vio and explained your (and my as it happens) position. As Im sure you know, we (administrators) <i>must</i> ensure that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is adhered to, so as soon as that policy is mentioned caution is always taken. However, personally, I dont feel the material BabyDweezil keeps removing breaches it, as it is cited. So, assuming the page is unprotected (which I can arrange) can you ensure that any material readded <b>does not</b> breach the BLP policy. Namely, it can be positive, it can be negative, but it must have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sourcing</a>. IMO, xenu.net et al does not qualify, but, <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html</a> (as an example) does. Now I havent read that FOIA page on Barbara, but, if all the info that BabyDweezil keeps removing is there, then by all means readd with my blessing (once) - and if he/she removes again then I will take it up. Im going to msg him/her now anyway. Dont let me down!&#160;:) <b><a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlen_S_ecf5.html" title="User talk:Glen S">Glen</a></b> 08:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Antaeus, I was wondering if you could please help me regarding an issue with <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">User:Potters_house</a>. The said user has deleted the links including this from my home page, even thou I requested that the user give adequate reasons why it is a poor link. I have stated that the link I have provided to the <a href="http://www.firstplumbline.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.firstplumbline.net/" rel="nofollow">the firstplumbline</a> is within the giudelines of the wikipedia external links rules. Also I want to know how I can fairly adjust the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_House_Christian_Fellowship" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_House_Christian_Fellowship" rel="nofollow">the potters house christian fellowship</a> acticle in the section "criticism of the church" so that it can represent the current status of the situation for both the church AND those whom are objecting to the church. I know this has already been disputed but currently the information provided in the section does not fairly and accurately show the reader what the cristicism is about. Namely it is from ex-members of the church (which has been omitted) who have reported to the cult awareness groups and I also suggest to add a current cult awareness website <a href="http://www.firstplumbline.net" class="external text" title="http://www.firstplumbline.net" rel="nofollow">the firstplumbline</a> that is providing up-to-date information that can fairly inform the reader of the issues that are being raised.

Basically user Potters House will not allow editions and claims it is fair and unbias and I say it is not. Please can you adivse me, especially on the user Potters House editing my own homepage and removing the links he says are of poor quality.

<p>As was previously discussed in mediation between Timan, yourself and myself, the entire agreement is about the inclusion of poor quality links - whether about CFM or Rick Ross, should not be allowed either on the Ross artcile nor on the Potter's House article.

<dd>I frankly don't want to (and will not) get involved in this issue, save to say that the "finalised mediation outcome" that Potters house thinks was arrived at, where he has authority to unilaterally decide what links are "poor links" and unilaterally remove them from not only the article, and not only the article talk page, but from someone else's userpage, is primarily a figment of his wishful thinking. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for getting that the man's notability comes from his days as Cat Stevens. There has been an ongoing argument on the page about how it should be named, what name goes first in the lead, how the picture should be captioned, etc. It is clear to me that the article must remain named Cat Stevens with the redirect from Yusuf Islam of course, and I am still unhappy with the lead sentence but I thought I'd give it a rest for a while. There has been some pretty acrimonious argument about this, but I wanted you to know that you are not alone with this, and I'll step in too when I see the incorrect reversion, and I'd be glad to revisit the first sentence. I worked hard on the page to give it a fair representation of his Yusuf Islam years, but the move to de-emphasize his work as Cat Stevens is ridiculous, POV, and unacceptable. Read talk - the Muhammed Ali point has been argued too and you are completely correct - it has to be based on notability, and how people will search for him, and how he's most widely known - not how he calls himself today.

<p>Thanks for the info. I didn't know there was a policy about links in the article not being in the "see also" section.

<dl>
<dd>Well, the policy about not repeating links in the article in the "See also" is like the policy about <i>not</i> piping links on disambiguation pages -- it's there in the Manual of Style pages, but it gets frequently violated by people who haven't read that section of the MOS. As for it being in the imperative form, well, you might find it more helpful to think of it as the response to an implied question. If someone has read all the way to the end of the article, then it's reasonable to ask "Are you interested in reading about similar subjects and related subjects?" The "see also" section can be thought of as responding to an affirmative answer: "<i>If you are'</i> interested in reading about similar subjects and related subjects, then <i>see also</i> ..." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a quote by William James that I feel is appropriate to this section "There is something quite noble in attempting what is truly beyond our means". I can't back that up with a reference, except to say that I found it in a book published by a local philosophy professor. It is a good paraphrase, rather than a true quote. I think it is to be found in the James's letters (but don't quote me.)<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddeus_Slamp_32f8.html" title="User:Thaddeus Slamp">Thaddeus Slamp</a> 17:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC) Well known examples of the "I know I can't help my bias" pov are Ayne Rand and Larry Abraham (1 of 2 authors of None Dare Call it Conspiracy. Can't remember the name of the other); yet I am fairly sure that psychologists had developed fairly effective drills that are able to reduce bias dramatically, since the 1700s. See The Illumintatti Papers, by Robert Anton Wilson. I warn you however that the quality and style of the articles therin might be found to vary, nonetheless Wilsons assertions about how to reduce bias were not so much contravercial, as, rather, obscure.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddeus_Slamp_32f8.html" title="User:Thaddeus Slamp">Thaddeus Slamp</a> 17:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see the mistake your talking about over and over on wikipedia, and it leads to some ridiculouse results. Some people dread listening to the other side of an argument, and so they try to present the other side on an automaticity, becouse deep down they know that that aint what mam done taught them, or what ever, and it shows in an article. There is no solution without drudgery I suspect. I fully expect to see an article on Hitler saying: "critics of the idea that Hitler might have benefitted from relaxing a little say that..." I don't think there are many critics of the idea that Hitler could have benefitted from relaxing a little. I think that a person writing such hates being objective but is trying to make themselves be so on an automaticity/ so they go: "Critix of idea x say idea y" and be done w/it. Are we on the same page? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddeus_Slamp_32f8.html" title="User:Thaddeus Slamp">Thaddeus Slamp</a> 18:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
