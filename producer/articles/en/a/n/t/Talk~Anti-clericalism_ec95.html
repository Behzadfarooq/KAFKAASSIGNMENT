<p>I'm going to remove the link, since it has nothing to do with anti-clericalism as far as the actual article is concerned, and I have found no factual evidence to support the claim of the ties between Freemasonry and anti-clericalism, even in the Catholic Encyclopedia (where you would think it would be). It seem they are tied together mainly by being equally unpalatable to Catholic dogma, which does not make it fact. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 07:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I went to fix a typo in the Freemasonry section, and the refs are twice as long as the section, as the tags now bring the entirety of the reference into the section space. Does anybody know if there's a general discussion on this?

<p>The Roman Catholic Church declared the war a "Crusade" a holy war on Franco’s part.</p>
<p>In 1930 the Spanish society was still suffering from having lost its overseas empire and deep social and economic reforms were needed at many levels. Democracy had been reinstated after a 7 year dictatorship by General Primo de Rivera and King Alfonso XIII had voluntarily decided to go into exile after realising it had lost the support of the majority of the Spanish society. The church had played an instrumental part under the monarchy and military dictatorship, and its widespread economic involvement meant it was facing reform at the many levels. As you can by now imagine they were not happy about it and opposed such changes, making a lot of enemies in the process.</p>
<p>In Ken Loach's "Land and Freedom" you can see a priest shooting from a church tower at militias and he is eventually is shot down. Though I have no other historical evidence there probably were far more incidents like this and the question arises why 6000 where killed and not the rest? Especially in a war that left around 2million dead in a country of less than 30mill at the time. Hence, to put down these 6000 dead priests as victims of anti-clericalism is rather dubious and should not be included without further references.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am almost positive the Roman Catholic Church never declared the war a "Crusade", please provide a source for this.</dd>
<dd>The period of 1931-1936 is one of the most chaotic in the history of Spain, which constant turbulence from both the right (unhappy about an anti-clerical, leftist constitution) and the left (where the moderates were overwhelmed by the revolutionaries). The first important violent coups against the Republic came from the left in 1934 (incidently, I have yet to see a politician condemn this coups which are esentially as undemocratic as the one in 1936, with the only diference they failed). At least in one of those (Asturias,1934) priests were killed just for being priests (and teachers).</dd>
<dd>Your only "historical" evidence comes from a movie by Ken Loach (who is a member of the left-wing party Respect; I must say I think he is a good director). Even if the incident depicted is based on a real one (which I doubt) it would be something exceptional; The truth is that almost all of those 6000 were killed for being priests.</dd>
<dd>Finally I must make clear I don´t support the Alzamiento or Franco´s regime and they are guilty of atrocities; in some cases the Church might be considered an accomplice, however the killing of civilians (priests or not priests) is also a war crime.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>The tone of the article makes anticlericalism sound like it sprouts independently. In my historical view it is rather a "response to", an "effect to" the church’s actions, its right wing conservative attitudes, its opposition to change and democracy. The church has historically thrived giving legitimacy to absolute regimes and dictators, which in turn responds to its own internal structure with the Pope at its head, who by definition cannot be wrong.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the church has apostolism (<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iglesia_Cat%C3%B3lica" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iglesia_Cat%C3%B3lica" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iglesia_Cat%C3%B3lica</a>) as one of its 4 pillars. This means that they endeavour to convert everyone to their faith, and as fundamentalists they would also like to control and run as much of our lives. This can be seen in how the lives of its members are controlled. Opus Dei numeraries, for example, have their post opened and this is recognized publicly as a means to "protect them". They have to submit in advance what TV programmes they want to see, newpapers, books or even web pages to read, what activities they plan, even ask for permission to visit their family, which is often denied as their family is now Opus Dei. It is my view that anticlericalism is a response to these attitudes from the church, a means of defence.</p>
<p>I consider myself a laciest, but currently in Spain, the government gives part of my taxes to the church, and it finances the preaching of Catholicism in schools, whether I want my children to attend or not. Hence being a laciest now in Spain means I have to fight the catholic church and its power, which also makes me anticlerical.</p>
<p>Do we really need an article on anticlericalism as limited as the one we have now? I am new and don’t feel I should edit it.</p>

<dd>The problem is that this is an encyclopedia that has to be NPOV. Part of that involves having sources, and if there are no real sources, we can't extrapolate a cause, because Wikipedia has a policy against original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Now, if there was a source where someone examined the causes of anti-clericalism, we could then use that as part of the article. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 03:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anonymous editor added in <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinui.html" title="Shinui">Shinui</a> as anti-clericalist, but the description in the text makes it sound more like religion-state separatism and not necessarily anti-clerical.

<dd>I think you're right. They don't act against religion <i>per se</i>, and they don't seek to abolish religion; they just want a more secular environment in Israel.
