<p><b>Anti-Zionism</b> is a term used to describe opposition to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, the movement supporting the right of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a> to exist as a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_state.html" title="Jewish state">Jewish state</a>. Anti-Zionism takes many forms, from the refusal to recognize Israel's existence to religious opposition to the idea of a Jewish state.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of opinion, and the argument that anti-Zionism is either inherently <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html#The_left_and_anti-Zionism" title="New antisemitism">antisemitic</a> or may act as a proxy for antisemitism, the phrase is controversial and sometimes disputed by those to whom it is applied. Some embrace the term, arguing that Zionism is a form of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>. The result is a persistent ambiguity in the use, criticism and defense of the phrase. For the purposes of this article, anti-Zionism is surveyed broadly, to discuss all notable opposition to Zionism, while noting where the anti-Zionist label tends to be a matter of dispute.</p>

<p>Political Zionism has encountered opposition ever since it was first articulated in the 19th century. It is therefore possible to speak of a history of anti-Zionism reaching back for more than a century and in many forms.</p>
<p>Anti-Zionist publications date back to at least the turn of the last century,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> appearing increasingly through at least the mid-1940s in relation to events in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a>, when several <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> and Jewish organizations opposed the creation of a Jewish State in the area.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The term has regained wider currency in political debate since the 1970s, as part of the controversy over the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab-Israeli_conflict_ff03.html" title="Arab-Israeli conflict">Arab-Israeli conflict</a>. Before the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a> of 1967, opposition to the existence of Israel was largely confined to the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_world.html" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>, with notable exceptions including the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and its allies. Since the 1970s, however, opposition to Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has led to mounting criticism of Israel, which in turn has fueled the growth of anti-Zionism.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Types_of_anti-Zionism" id="Types_of_anti-Zionism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Edit section: Types of anti-Zionism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Types of anti-Zionism</span></h2>
<p>The majority of Palestinian and Arab peoples view Israel as unrightfully occupying the Arab land of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Such critics generally opposed Israel's creation in 1948, and continue to criticize the Zionist movement which underlies it. These critics view the changes in demographic balance which accompanied the creation of Israel, including the displacement of some 700,000 Arab <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_refugee.html" title="Palestinian refugee">refugees</a>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> and the accompanying violence, as negative but inevitable consequences of Zionism and the concept of a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_State_3748.html" title="Jewish State">Jewish State</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> While political positions still vary widely, it is generally stated that this type of anti-Zionism is based in opposition to Israel and its recognition as a legitimate state.</p>
<p>Aside from those voices generally considered "anti-Zionist," there are those who advocate a <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binational_state.html" title="Binational state">binational state</a> comprising the current State of Israel and the territories of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>, in which both Jews and Palestinians would be citizens with equal rights. Advocates of this may not necessarily consider themselves "anti-Zionist." They note that the bi-national concept was advanced by a vocal minority within the Zionist movement at the time of the founding of the state of Israel, notably by the writer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Buber_69dd.html" title="Martin Buber">Martin Buber</a>, and by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judah_Magnes_42ed.html" title="Judah Magnes">Judah Magnes</a>, the first president of <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_University_3eaa.html" title="Hebrew University">Hebrew University</a>. (This bi-national arrangement was never accepted by the Palestinian Arabs, however.) Bi-national state proponents maintain that such a settlement ought to be arrived at voluntarily and by peaceful means, and argue that it would be in the best interests of the Jews and Palestinians alike. Opponents of this option argue that, under those conditions, Israel would cease to be a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_state.html" title="Jewish state">Jewish state</a> or a haven for potential <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_refugees.html" title="Jewish refugees">Jewish refugees</a>. They also point out the security risks in such a multi-ethnic state. See <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binational_solution.html" title="Binational solution">Binational solution</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there are non-Zionists who hold that, while the creation of the State of Israel may have been an error because of the privileged status it accords to Jews in comparison to non-Jews, the danger posed by <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_antisemitism.html" title="Arab antisemitism">Arab antisemitism</a> is intractable, and thus there can be no return to the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo_ante.html" title="Status quo ante">status quo ante</a></i>. These critics advocate only a peaceful settlement of the current conflict. Examples of this ideology are Rabbi <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elazar_Menachem_Shach_48f0.html" title="Elazar Menachem Shach">Elazar Menachem Shach</a> and Rabbi <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avigdor_Miller_fbed.html" title="Avigdor Miller">Avigdor Miller</a>, who wrote numerous letters and books on this.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Zionist movement before the 1930s met with some ambivalence among the world's Jewish communities. While the religious connections with the Land of Israel were indisputable, many disassociated themselves with the socialist ideology that dominated early political Zionism. While the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist_Zionism_b013.html" title="Revisionist Zionism">revisionist Zionist</a> movement emerged as an alternative over time, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> solidified Zionism as a mainstream movement in world Jewry.</p>
<p>Many Jews, mainly in Europe, who supported <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> political ideas, took the view that the defeat of anti-Semitism and the winning of <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_rights.html" title="Equal rights">civic equality</a> for Jews required participation in the common struggle against <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and oppressive regimes. Yet, many in this group also felt that for Zionists to advocate emigration to Palestine would perpetuate the segregation of the "<a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a>" that they were fighting to overcome. Some Jewish <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialists</a> rejected this latter view and became <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Zionism_56f5.html" title="Labor Zionism">Socialist Zionists</a>. The largest Jewish socialist organisation in Europe, the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Jewish_Labor_Union_a2b0.html" title="General Jewish Labor Union">General Jewish Labor Union</a>, also known as the Bund, opposed Zionism right up until the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Poland_%281939%29_e800.html" title="Invasion of Poland (1939)">German invasion of Poland</a> in 1939.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Within the <a href="../../../s/h/27/Sh%27erit_ha-Pletah_9a11.html" title="Sh'erit ha-Pletah">Jewish displaced persons community</a> there eventually emerged a strong pro-Zionist movement. Zionism became part of the mainstream political consciousness of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands_7cd1.html" title="Jewish exodus from Arab lands">Arab Jewish communities</a> and the large communities in the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_diaspora.html" title="Jewish diaspora">Jewish diaspora</a>, especially following the formation of the State of Israel and the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Day_War_87dc.html" title="Six Day War">Six Day War</a>.</p>

<p>Many 19th century and early 20th century Orthodox Jews objected to Zionism because they opposed attempts to build a secular and socialist Jewish state in what was then known as Palestine.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Jews_cec6.html" title="Orthodox Jews">Orthodox Jews</a> in this group did not reject the right of Jews to move to Palestine and reconstitute a Jewish nation. Rather, they maintained that such a state should follow Jewish law and tradition, with religious leadership.

<p>A small minority of Jews, however, continue to oppose Zionism on either political or religious grounds. The most radical and vocal of these is the small <a href="../../../n/e/t/Neturei_Karta_f0d9.html" title="Neturei Karta">Neturei Karta</a> group, which continues to oppose the existence of the State of Israel. Among more mainstream Orthodox groups are the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar.html" title="Satmar">Satmar</a> <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidism.html" title="Hasidism">Hasidism</a>, probably one of the largest <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidim.html" title="Hasidim">Hasidic</a> group in the world, with over 100,000 followers, along with other Hasidic groups influenced by <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar.html" title="Satmar">Satmar</a> and the group's late leader, <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Teitelbaum_9a0d.html" title="Joel Teitelbaum">Joel Teitelbaum</a>. Teitelbaum's book, <i>VaYoel Moshe</i>, published in 1958, expounds one Orthodox position on Zionism, based on a literal form of <i><a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">midrash</a></i> (biblical interpretation). Citing to Tractate Kesubos 111a of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> Teitelbaum states that God and the Jewish people exchanged three oaths at the time of the Jews' exile from ancient Israel:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the Jewish people would not ascend to the Holy Land as a group using force;</li>
<li>That the Jewish people would not rebel against the governments of countries in which they lived;</li>
<li>That the Jewish people would not, by their sins, prolong the coming of the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Messiah_dd7d.html" title="Jewish Messiah">Jewish Messiah</a>.</li>

<p>In 1897, the first major Hasidic anti-Zionist initiative was launched by the Rebbes of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Ger_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_6c10.html" title="Ger (Hasidic dynasty)">Ger</a>, Kotsk, and Radzin. Zionists were excommunicated. Zionist leaders accused the Hasidim of using violence against Zionists. The Rebbe of Siedlice called destroying Zionism a religious obligation and accused the Zionists of violence against anti-Zionist Hasidim.</p>
<p>Later, a group of Hasidim and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnagdim.html" title="Misnagdim">Misnagdim</a> formed <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agudath_Israel_acb7.html" title="Agudath Israel">Agudath Israel</a>, which slowly moved from strong anti-Zionism to non-Zionism and passive support of the state once it was formed. However, the Hasidim in general remained opposed to the state and to Zionism. Especially the <a href="../../../e/d/a/Edah_HaChareidis_bd00.html" title="Edah HaChareidis">Edah HaChareidis</a>, led by Rabbi <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Teitelbaum_9a0d.html" title="Joel Teitelbaum">Joel Teitelbaum</a>, the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e587.html" title="Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)">Satmar</a> Rebbe, remained and still remains virulently opposed to all forms of Zionism.</p>
<p>Most Haredim consider themselves bound in principle to "historical anti-Zionist conceptions, including isolation".<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Occasionally, even followers of Haredi groups which are not generally known for strongly opposing Zionism, such as <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belz_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_c527.html" title="Belz (Hasidic dynasty)">Belz</a>, participate in demonstrations against the state, alongside groups which are more known for their anti-Zionism such as <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e587.html" title="Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)">Satmar</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/v/Skver_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_ecaa.html" title="Skver (Hasidic dynasty)">Skver</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosh_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e72a.html" title="Tosh (Hasidic dynasty)">Tosh</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e587.html" title="Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)">Satmar</a>, which is known for its anti-Zionism, has about 100,000 followers. Satmar Hasidim in Israel refuse to accept money from the state and avoid interaction with the state as much as possible. The same is true of the smaller group Sighet, which is allied and practically merged with Satmar.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Extreme hostility to Zionism is also a characteristic of the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munkacz_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_f059.html" title="Munkacz (Hasidic dynasty)">Munkatsher</a> Hasidim. The founding Rebbe of Munkacz, Grand Rabbi <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Elazar_Shapira_c178.html" title="Chaim Elazar Shapira">Chaim Elazar Shapira</a>, was known for cursing secular Zionists, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Zionism_76d1.html" title="Religious Zionism">religious Zionists</a>, and those who joined <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agudath_Israel_acb7.html" title="Agudath Israel">Agudath Israel</a>. His anti-Zionist tirades were especially virulent, more so than those of any other Hasidic leader. He called Zionism a "demonic force". He accused the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Ger_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_6c10.html" title="Ger (Hasidic dynasty)">Gerrer Rebbe</a>, Rabbi Avrohom Mordechai Alter, and all of <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agudath_Israel_acb7.html" title="Agudath Israel">Agudath Israel</a> of being "crypto-Zionist heretics".<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both Rabbi Teitelbaum of Satmar and Rabbi Shapira of Munkacz opposed religious Zionism even more strongly than secular Zionism. Rabbi Shapira called it a violation of one of the thirteen principles of the Jewish faith listed by the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambam.html" title="Rambam">Rambam</a>.</p>
<p>All Hasidic Jewish opponents to Zionism, including Rabbi Teitelbaum and Rabbi Shapira, do approve of Jews living in the Land of Israel. Their opposition is not to Jews living in the Land of Israel, but to the ideology of Zionism, which includes taking control of the land by force. Indeed, there are many Hasidim and <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshivos</a> of both Munkacz, Satmar and many other strongly anti-Zionist groups in Israel, particularly in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Yakov M. Rabin, a professor of history at the University of Montreal, argues in his book ‘’A Threat Within: A Century of Jewish Opposition to Zionism,’’ that <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi.html" title="Haredi">Haredi</a> Jews who publicly criticize Zionism do so for two religiously-based reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“The first of these is to prevent desecration of the name of God. And since the State of Israel often claims to be acting on behalf of all the world's Jews, and even in the name of Judaism, these Jews feel they must explain to the public, and primarily to non-Jews, the falsehood of this pretension. The second commandment is to preserve human life. By exposing the Judaic rejection of Zionism, they hope to protect Jews from the outrage they believe the State of Israel has generated among the nations of the world.”<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></dd>

<p>At the time when the Zionist settlement of Palestine began, most of the Arab world was under the control either of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> or of one or other of the European colonial powers.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of Zionist settlement in Palestine in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, some Arabs were willing to consider alliance with the Zionist movement. For instance, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisal_I_of_Iraq_4179.html" title="Faisal I of Iraq">Emir Faisal</a>, the son of <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussein_bin_Ali%2C_Sharif_of_Mecca_c417.html" title="Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca">Sharif Hussein</a> of <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, who helped lead the Arab nationalist revolt against the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottomans</a>, signed the following agreement with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Weizmann_e21e.html" title="Chaim Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a> at the 1919 <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Peace_Conference%2C_1919_f74c.html" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Mindful of the racial kinship and ancient bonds existing between the Arabs and the Jewish people, and realizing that the surest means of working out the consummation of their national aspirations through the closest possible collaboration in the development of the Arab states and Palestine.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This agreement also called for the fulfillment of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balfour_Declaration_73f0.html" title="Balfour Declaration">Balfour Declaration</a> and supported all necessary measures:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale, and as quickly as possible to settle Jewish immigrants upon the land through closer settlement and intensive cultivation of the soil.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>For a number of reasons, the agreement was never realized. For one, Faisal had conditioned his acceptance of the Balfour Declaration on the fulfillment of British promises of independence to the Arab nations, which were not kept. Moreover, he had little local support for his position. Arab Palestinian leaders, among them the mayor of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Mufti_of_Jerusalem_50f4.html" title="Grand Mufti of Jerusalem">Grand Mufti of Jerusalem</a>, rejected this agreement made in their name. The Arab inhabitants of Palestine also rejected any suggestion of Palestine being severed from the Arab-Islamic world. While a Jewish minority had lived in Palestine for centuries, the Arab Palestinians were strongly opposed to the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish immigrant state, and hence to any immigration that would threaten to change the majority status of the Arab population. Thus, while small-scale Jewish immigration (such as the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliyah.html#First_Aliyah_.281882-1903.29" title="Aliyah">First Aliyah</a> of the 1880s) was accepted and often welcomed for economic reasons, larger influxes of Jews were resisted strenuously.</p>
<p>Once the Balfour Declaration made it clear that the Zionist project intended to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine rather than merely to encourage settlement there, Arab opposition grew much firmer, and has grown steadily more so. The hostilities punctuated the 1920s (<a href="../../../1/9/2/1920_Palestine_riots_c064.html" title="1920 Palestine riots">Jerusalem pogrom of April, 1920</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929_Palestine_riots_18a2.html" title="1929 Palestine riots">1929 Palestine riots</a>) and 1930s (activities of <a href="../../../i/z/z/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_bda4.html" title="Izz ad-Din al-Qassam">Izz ad-Din al-Qassam</a> and the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Hand_%28Palestine%29_7776.html" title="Black Hand (Palestine)">Black Hand</a> group, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Uprising_46e2.html" title="Great Uprising">1936-1939 Great Uprising</a>).</p>

<p>Arab anti-Zionism is also partly a reflection of the internal politics of the Arab states. Most Arab governments since the end of colonial rule have been more or less oppressive, whether monarchies or dictatorships. Although oil wealth has given prosperity to the smaller <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_states.html" title="Gulf states">Gulf states</a>, most Arab regimes have retained social and economic problems. Diverting popular anger towards Israel and its western supporters has thus served as a useful safety-valve for some Arab regimes. Even in Egypt, which has formally recognised Israel, the regime encourages its frustrated intellectual and political class to indulge in anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic rhetoric, partly as a means of diverting attention from domestic political issues.</p>
<p>Modern anti-Zionism in the Arab world comes from a variety of ideological backgrounds:local <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arabism_9177.html" title="Pan-Arabism">pan-Arab</a> (or more rarely pan-Syrian) nationalism, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, and anti-<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a>, to name a few. Anti-Zionism in some form is nearly universal as a popular sentiment. The principal objections to Zionism found in all varieties of Arab anti-Zionism are the views that the Palestinians' land was unjustly taken from them by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> (through the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balfour_Declaration_73f0.html" title="Balfour Declaration">Balfour Declaration</a>) and subsequently by Israel, first in 1948 and then again starting in 1967; that this process continues today in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>; and that the Palestinians are still suffering from its consequences. Different ideologies, however, emphasize different aspects of this, and differ on the appropriate response.</p>
<p>Anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist narratives—particularly popular in Arab countries with violent experiences of colonial rule—focus especially on parallels with cases such as <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> or <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia.html" title="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>, seeing it in terms of a foreign power encouraging immigration into the country of a group which then sought to dominate the country. According to this view, the natural means of combating Zionism is considered to be Palestinian <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, and the expulsion or weakening of the Zionist "occupiers". Among Palestinians, examples of notable individuals or political parties that emphasize anti-imperial and anti-colonial narratives in their opposition to Zionism include: <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghassan_Kanafani_f527.html" title="Ghassan Kanafani">Ghassan Kanafani</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leila_Khaled_3139.html" title="Leila Khaled">Leila Khaled</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Habash_9efc.html" title="George Habash">George Habash</a>, the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine_f297.html" title="Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a>, the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine_4dc0.html" title="Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine">Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a>, and The Palestinian Revolutionary Communist Party. Examples of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Palestinian_solidarity_organizations_4363.html" title="List of Palestinian solidarity organizations">Palestinian solidarity groups</a> that root their activism against Zionism in anti-imperial and anti-colonial terms include: <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine_e2d4.html" title="Students for Justice in Palestine">Students for Justice in Palestine</a>, Al-Awda <a href="http://www.al-awda.org/pou.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.al-awda.org/pou.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and Sumoud <a href="http://sumoud.tao.ca/?q=taxonomy/page/or/34" class="external autonumber" title="http://sumoud.tao.ca/?q=taxonomy/page/or/34" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Critics of these movements argue that it is a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> to compare Zionism to imperialism or colonialism, as the Zionist ideology is focused on return to an ancestral homeland, rather than an attempt to exploit Arab Palestinians.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arabism_9177.html" title="Pan-Arabism">Pan-Arabist</a> narratives—which enjoyed their heyday in the 1960s in the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser_2db4.html" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Nasser</a> era, but have declined since—emphasize the idea of Palestine as a part of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_world.html" title="Arab world">Arab world</a> taken by others (partly overlapping with the previous.) As such, Israel is seen as both a symbol of Arab weakness and—insofar as it geographically cuts the Arab world into two noncontiguous halves—an obstacle to any union of the Arab world. In this narrative, the natural means of combating Zionism is Arab nations uniting and attacking Israel militarily. <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Syrianism_bc36.html" title="Pan-Syrianism">Pan-Syrian</a> narratives, promoted mainly by <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, are essentially parallel.</p>
<p>In response to the Pan-Arabist narrative, Israeli historian <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Morris_4202.html" title="Benny Morris">Benny Morris</a> commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember another thing: the Arab people gained a large slice of the planet. Not thanks to its skills or its great virtues, but because it conquered and murdered and forced those it conquered to convert during many generations. But in the end the Arabs have 22 states. The Jewish people did not have even one state. There was no reason in the world why it should not have one state. Therefore, from my point of view, the need to establish this state in this place overcame the injustice that was done to the Palestinians by uprooting them.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Local <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> narratives of non-Palestinian Arabs emphasize the idea of Israel as a threat to the nation (commonly citing extremist Israeli individuals' dreams of a nation stretching "from the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a> to the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphrates.html" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>"). Among Palestinians, these emphasize other issues, such as the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_refugee.html" title="Palestinian refugee">Palestinian refugee</a> problem, and that in their view, over 90% of the pre-1948 <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> is controlled by Israel.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Muslim</a> opinion generally emphasizes the idea of Palestine as <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> land, where <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> lived for more than 1300 years (though Jews have lived there about a 1000 years longer), taken by a non-Muslim political power. They also emphasize the suffering of the Palestinians, seeing it as Muslims' duty to aid them against what they consider to be their oppressors. For some of this view, the natural means of combating Zionism is considered to be <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a>, whether by Palestinians or others.</p>
<p>An example of this view is the work of <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismail_al-Faruqi_b168.html" title="Ismail al-Faruqi">Ismail al-Faruqi</a> (1926-1986).

He opposed the "Zionist occupation" of Palestine and called for the dismantling of Israel and the launch of a <i><a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a></i>. He said that the injustice caused by Zionism is such as to necessitate war. From the standpoint of Islam, Faruqi wrote, Zionism represents <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a> against Judaism.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslim</a> anti-Zionism generally opposes the state of Israel as an intrusion into what many Muslims consider to be <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dar_al-Islam_0ad8.html" title="Dar al-Islam">their domain</a>.

<p>Before the 1970s, serious criticism of Israel was relatively unheard in the western countries, except to some extent in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> parties. At that time there was a largely uncritical acceptance of Israel's projected image of itself as a nation of pioneers making the desert bloom. This was partly motivated by genuine admiration for the efforts of the Israelis, partly by a sense of guilt over the Holocaust, and partly by relief that the "Jewish question" had now finally been solved by the creation of a Jewish state. Pro-Zionist sentiment in the west peaked in the 1960s, epitomised by the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> epic <i>Exodus</i> (1960) and by support for "plucky little Israel" in the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>.</p>
<p>The tide of opinion turned after 1970, however, as the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_Liberation_Organization_12a1.html" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO), formed in 1964, began to conduct its campaign of "armed struggle" against Israel. These acts included the hijacking and destruction of passenger airliners and the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Massacre_e81d.html" title="Munich Massacre">Munich Massacre</a> at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_Summer_Olympics_d29a.html" title="1972 Summer Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a>, and coincided with a wave of radicalism which swept through the western intellectual world in the wake of the anti-<a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> protests of the 1960s (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sixties_38a4.html" title="The Sixties">The Sixties</a>). Many Westerners and Third World activists came to see the Palestinians as an oppressed people like the South Vietnamese or the black <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africans</a>, and the PLO as a national liberation movement of the type they supported in other places.</p>
<p>This wave of radicalism soon passed, but it left an intellectual climate much less sympathetic to Israel than had existed before 1967. This anti-Israeli sentiment might have faded had there been an Arab-Israeli settlement, as seemed possible, for example, after President <a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Sadat_df34.html" title="Anwar Sadat">Anwar Sadat</a>'s visit to Israel and the peace treaty between Israel and <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in 1979. But the repeated disappointments of Middle East diplomacy, and the spread of the opinion that the Palestinians were the victims of western neo-colonialism in the form of a Jewish settler state planted in the Arab world, created a permanent reservoir of anti-Zionist sentiment among western intellectuals, including some Jews. <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxime_Rodinson_0e81.html" title="Maxime Rodinson">Maxime Rodinson</a>'s 1973 book <i>Israel: A Colonial-Settler State?</i> was influential in promoting this view.</p>
<p>The active expression of western anti-Zionism has tended to ebb and flow in relation to events in the Middle East. When developments seem positive, such as during the period of the <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo_Accords_6e48.html" title="Oslo Accords">Oslo Accords</a> and the prime ministership of <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_b27b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a>, and again during the <a href="../../../e/h/u/Ehud_Barak_d32a.html" title="Ehud Barak">Barak</a>-<a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Arafat</a> negotiations, western opinion, even on the anti-Zionist left, welcomes the reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians. When events turn out badly, as they did after the assassination of <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_b27b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> or with the launching of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Intifada_892a.html" title="Second Intifada">Second Intifada</a> or the election of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Sharon</a>; during these times western anti-Zionism tends to increase.</p>
<p>Most Western anti-Zionism continues to advocate coexistence rather than expulsion: very few western intellectuals actively desire the physical destruction of Israel, and most would welcome any settlement if it was acceptable to the Palestinians.</p>

Newspaper Soviet Moldavia, August 27, 1971</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From 1919 onwards, Zionism was viewed in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> as a form of <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourgeois_nationalism.html" title="Bourgeois nationalism">bourgeois nationalism</a>, and its active promotion among Jews was banned. During the years of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s rule Soviet Jews were frequently attacked as "Zionists," although the majority of Soviet Jews at that time were not Zionists. After the creation of Israel, however, many Soviet Jews began to sympathise with the Jewish state, thus arousing further antagonism from the Soviet government, which saw Zionism as a potential source of disloyalty.</p>
<p>Due to his anti-British <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realpolitik.html" title="Realpolitik">realpolitik</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a> played a key role in the foundation of the state of Israel. During the last years of Stalin's rule, roughly <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, official Soviet anti-Zionism was intensified. This included a campaign against so-called "<a href="../../../r/o/o/Rootless_cosmopolitan.html" title="Rootless cosmopolitan">rootless cosmopolitans</a>" and the fabrication of the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctors%27_plot.html" title="Doctors' plot">Doctors' plot</a>. After Stalin's death, anti-Zionism continued through the rise of "<a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionology.html" title="Zionology">Zionology</a>" in the 1960s and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionist_committee_of_the_Soviet_public_1ebb.html" title="Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public">Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public</a>. While these were all officially carried out under the banner of anti-Zionism, critics argue that they had a strong antisemitic content, often borrowed directly from traditional <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> antisemitism.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's stance towards Zionism was strongly influenced by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geopolitics.html" title="Geopolitics">geopolitical</a> concerns. From the 1950s, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> began to emerge as a close Western ally (with pro-Western sympathies earlier on). Moreover, the spectre of Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition. Therefore, during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, the Soviet government liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, and placed <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogues</a> under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. At the same time, the persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> issue in the West. See <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson-Vanik_amendment_02ef.html" title="Jackson-Vanik amendment">Jackson-Vanik amendment</a>.</p>
<p>In 1975, the Soviet Union sponsored the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379_5cee.html" title="UN General Assembly Resolution 3379">UN General Assembly Resolution 3379</a>, discussed below.</p>
<p><a name="International_anti-Zionism" id="International_anti-Zionism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Edit section: International anti-Zionism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">International anti-Zionism</span></h2>
<p>Many of the most important authorities on ethics in the 20th century have contributed to the debate on Zionism, with some, such as <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> in the 1930s and '40s,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup> expressing opposition to the Zionist movement.</p>
<p>Paralleling the rise of anti-Zionist sentiment in the west was increased hostility towards Israel at the international level. During the 1950s and 1960s Israel made great efforts to cultivate good relations with the newly independent states of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and hostility to Israel was confined to the states of the Arab-Muslim world and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_bloc.html" title="Communist bloc">Communist bloc</a>. A combination of inter-related circumstances in the 1970s radically changed this situation.</p>
<p>The first was the increased hostility to Israel following the onset of the Israel-Palestinian conflict in the late 1960s. The second was the decline in the prestige of the United States following the end of the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> and the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a> scandal. The third was increased economic power of the Arab oil-producing states in the aftermath of the <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Kippur_War_eeba.html" title="Yom Kippur War">1973 Arab-Israeli War</a> and the resulting energy crisis. The fourth was the rise of radical anti-western regimes in a series of African countries. The fifth was the increased diplomatic and economic presence of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> in Africa.</p>
<p>This anti-Zionist trend was manifested in organisations such as the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_for_African_Unity_d5cb.html" title="Organization for African Unity">Organization for African Unity</a> and the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Aligned_Movement_59a4.html" title="Non-Aligned Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, which passed resolutions condemning Zionism and equating it with racism and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> during the early 1970s. It culminated in the passing by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_General_Assembly_e5b8.html" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> of <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379_5cee.html" title="UN General Assembly Resolution 3379">Resolution 3379</a> in November 1975, declaring that "Zionism is a form of racism." This resolution was passed by 72 votes to 35, with 32 abstentions. The 72 votes in favour consisted of all 20 Arab states, another 12 Muslim-majority states (including <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>), 12 Communist countries, 14 non-Muslim African states, and 14 other states (including <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>).</p>
<p>By 1991 this international situation had been reversed following the collapse of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, the American-led victory over <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> in the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a> and the return of the United States to global political and economic dominance. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, under pressure from the United States and Israel, the General Assembly passed <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_4686_e651.html" title="UN General Assembly Resolution 4686">Resolution 4686</a>, repealing resolution 3379, by a vote of 111 to 25, with 13 abstentions and 17 delegations absent. Thirteen out of the 19 Arab countries, including those engaged in negotiations with Israel, voted against the repeal, another six were absent. No Arab country voted for repeal. The <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLO_68c8.html" title="PLO">PLO</a> denounced the vote. All the ex-Communist countries and most of the African countries who had supported Resolution 3379 voted to repeal it. Only three non-Muslim countries voted against the resolution: <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Nevertheless, only one Muslim-majority country (<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>) voted for the resolution: the rest abstained (including Turkey) or absented themselves.</p>
<p>International anti-Zionism, like domestic anti-Zionism in many countries, rises and falls in parallel with events in the Middle East, and the American-led invasion of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> in 2003 saw some revival of anti-Zionism in some countries; however, it is also possible that it was not until this time that media attention focused on the phenomenon.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">April 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Commission_on_Civil_Rights_42f9.html" title="U.S. Commission on Civil Rights">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a> announced that anti-Israelism or anti-Zionism may often serve as camouflage for anti-Semitic bigotry on American college campuses.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some scholars believe that while Anti-Zionism may not be inherently antisemitic, it very often either becomes antisemitism or is used to hide antisemitism.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Friedman_9ada.html" title="Thomas Friedman">Thomas Friedman</a> writes that “[c]riticizing Israel is not anti-Semitic, and saying so is vile. But singling out Israel for opprobrium and international sanction—out of proportion to any other party in the Middle East—is anti-Semitic, and not saying so is dishonest.”<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_S._Wistrich_0d4a.html" title="Robert S. Wistrich">Robert S. Wistrich</a> argues that although several types of anti-Zionism are not intrinsically antisemitic,<sup id="_ref-Wist1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wist1" title="">[25]</a></sup> much of contemporary radical anti-Zionism has become a form of antisemitism.<sup id="_ref-Wist2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wist2" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other scholars posit that anti-Zionism should remain distinct from antisemitism. <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Klug_eea2.html" title="Brian Klug">Brian Klug</a>, for example, writes that even when anti-Zionism is expressed in unfair and foul terms, it is not necessarily antisemitism.<sup id="_ref-Klug_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Klug" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Monitoring_Centre_on_Racism_and_Xenophobia_fd08.html" title="European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia">European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia</a> (EUMC) in its working definition of antisemitism, identified several ways in which antisemitism can manifest itself, such as using double standards against Israel or drawing analogies between its behavior and that of the Nazis, while also stating that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic.”<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a criticism of this working definition, European Jews for a Just Peace, an organization of 18 European Jewish pro-Palestinian peace groups,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[29]</a></sup> contested several of its findings, and specifically targeted any inherent assumptions that anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_H._Kaplan_c6d9.html" title="Edward H. Kaplan">Edward H. Kaplan</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_A._Small_fde6.html" title="Charles A. Small">Charles A. Small</a>, both of <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, conducted a survey on the connection between radical anti-Israel sentiment and antisemitism in Europe. The study was published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in August of the same year. The authors’ overall conclusion is that evidence of anti-Israeli sentiment can consistently predict the probability that an individual is antisemitic with a direct correlation between the extent of the anti-Israeli sentiment with the probable measure of antisemitism.<sup id="_ref-K.26S1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K.26S1" title="">[31]</a></sup> They conclude that severe criticism of Israel does make it reasonable for the question to be raised of said criticism is actually masking an underlying anti-Semitism.<sup id="_ref-K.26S2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K.26S2" title="">[32]</a></sup> However, Kaplan and Small are careful to avoid concluding that the correlation they find (i.e., that extreme anti-Zionists are also likely to be antisemites) is proof to the theory that anti-Zionism is itself antisemitic.<sup id="_ref-K.26S3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K.26S3" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Historian Diana Muir reviewed the paper and concluded that the correlation shown between anti-Zionistic attitudes and antisemitism was almost perfect.<sup id="_ref-Muir_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Muir" title="">[34]</a></sup> Muir also supports the study's conclusion that only a small fraction of Europeans believe the anti-Zionistic and antisemitic rhetoric.<sup id="_ref-Muir_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Muir" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Steven Zipperstein, professor of Jewish Culture and History at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, argues that a belief in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a>'s responsibility for the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab-Israeli_conflict_ff03.html" title="Arab-Israeli conflict">Arab-Israeli conflict</a> should be considered part of what reasonably informed decent people thinks.<sup id="_ref-Zipp53_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zipp53" title="">[35]</a></sup> Zipperstein claims that disproportionate criticism of Israel is not the result of new anti-Semitism, or even classical anti-Semitism, but, although troubling, is a reflection of the extreme responses that mark a world society that has experienced <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11</a>, and which has focused on the United States, and its ally Israel, as their main targets.<sup id="_ref-Zipp60_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zipp60" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to a conventional definition of antisemitism ("hostility toward Jews as a religious or racial minority group, often accompanied by social, political or economic discrimination"), the unabridged edition of <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webster%27s_Third_New_International_Dictionary_28d2.html" title="Webster's Third New International Dictionary">Webster's Third New International Dictionary</a> (2002), gives a controversial second and third definition to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, defining the word as "opposition to Zionism" and "sympathy for the opponents of Israel".<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[37]</a></sup> (The modern college editions based on Webster's Third all omit the second definition of "antisemitism.") The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American-Arab_Anti-Discrimination_Committee_5935.html" title="American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> has mounted a campaign to get this definition removed. In a letter to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merriam-Webster_4fd8.html" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a>, Hussein Ibish wrote that the second and third definition "smears and impugns the motives of all those who support the human and political rights of Palestinians"<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>A Merriam-Webster company spokesman defended the definition as "a relic" based on a handful of citations from about 1950 in which antisemitism was "linked more or less strongly with opposition to Israel or to Zionism." The spokesman also stated that the sense wasn't supported by current usage, and added that it would probably be dropped when the company publishes a new unabridged version in a decade or so. However, the company said it was beyond its means to send out correction sheets to all libraries.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ken Jacobson, the associate national director of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Defamation_League_5083.html" title="Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a>, urged Merriam-Webster to retain the definition. "Zionism is the national expression of the Jewish people," he told the <i>New York Times</i>, "and to deny that, it seems to me, most often reflects anti-Semitic views."<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler. When in later years the policy of Israeli governments was attacked as racist or colonialist in various parts of the world, the basis of the criticism was quite often the belief that Israel had no right to exist in the first place, not opposition to specific policies of the Israeli government. Traditional anti-Semitism has gone out of fashion in the West except on the extreme right. But something we might call post-anti-Semitism has taken its place. It is less violent in its aims, but still very real. By and large it has not been too difficult to differentiate between genuine and bogus anti-Zionism. The test is twofold. It is almost always clear whether the attacks are directed against a specific policy carried out by an Israeli government (for instance, as an occupying power) or against the existence of Israel. Secondly, there is the test of selectivity. If from all the evils besetting the world, the misdeeds, real or imaginary, of Zionism are singled out and given constant and relentless publicity, it can be taken for granted that the true motive is not anti-Zionism but something different and more sweeping.</small>”</cite><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=Dying+for+Jerusalem%3A+the+past%2C+present+and+future+of+the+holiest+city&amp;rft.title=Dying+for+Jerusalem%3A+the+past%2C+present+and+future+of+the+holiest+city&amp;rft.atitle=Golda+Meir+and+the+Post-Zionists&amp;rft.aulast=Laqueur&amp;rft.aufirst=Walter&amp;rft.date=2006&amp;rft.pub=Sourcebooks%2C+Inc.&amp;rft.place=%5B%5BNaperville%2C+Illinois%5D%5D&amp;rft.pages=pg.+55&amp;rft.isbn=9781402206320&amp;rft_id=info:oclcnum/61704687">&#160;</span></li>

<small>My answer to such objections is that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are two distinct ideologies that over time (especially since 1948) have tended to converge, generally without undergoing a full merger. There have always been Bundists, Jewish communists, Reform Jews, and ultra-Orthodox Jews who strongly opposed Zionism without being Judeophobes. So, too, there are conservatives, liberals, and leftists in the West today who are pro-Palestinian, antagonistic toward Israel, and deeply distrustful of Zionism without crossing the line into anti-Semitism. There are also Israeli "post-Zionists" who object to the definition of Israel as an exclusively or even a predominantly "Jewish" state without feeling hostile toward Jews as such. There are others, too, who question whether Jews are really a nation; or who reject Zionism because they believe its accomplishment inevitably resulted in uprooting many Palestinians. None of these positions is intrinsically anti-Semitic in the sense of expressing opposition or hatred toward Jews as Jews.</small></li>

<small>Nevertheless, I believe that the more radical forms of anti-Zionism that have emerged with renewed force in recent years do display unmistakable analogies to European anti-Semitism immediately preceding the Holocaust.…For example, "anti-Zionists" who insist on comparing Zionism and the Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich appear unmistakably to be de facto anti-Semites, even if they vehemently deny the fact! This is largely because they knowingly exploit the reality that Nazism in the postwar world has become the defining metaphor of absolute evil. For if Zionists are "Nazis" and if Sharon really is Hitler, then it becomes a moral obligation to wage war against Israel. That is the bottom line of much contemporary anti-Zionism. In practice, this has become the most potent form of contemporary anti-Semitism.…Anti-Zionism is not only the historic heir of earlier forms of anti-Semitism. Today, it is also the lowest common denominator and the bridge between the Left, the Right, and the militant Muslims; between the elites (including the media) and the masses; between the churches and the mosques; between an increasingly anti-American Europe and an endemically anti-Western Arab-Muslim Middle East; a point of convergence between conservatives and radicals and a connecting link between fathers and sons.</small></li>

In his book, The Case for Israel, Alan Dershowitz argues that when criticism of Israel "crosses the line from fair to foul" it goes "from acceptable to anti-semitic". People who take this view say the line is crossed when critics single Israel out unfairly; when they apply a double standard and judge Israel by harsher criteria than they use for other states; when they misrepresent the facts so as to put Israel in a bad light; when they vilify the Jewish state; and so on. All of which undoubtedly is foul. But is it necessarily anti-semitic? No, it is not. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a bitter political struggle. The issues are complex, passions are inflamed, and the suffering is great. In such circumstances, people on both sides are liable to be partisan and to "cross the line from fair to foul". When people who side with Israel cross that line, they are not necessarily anti-Muslim. And when others cross the line on behalf of the Palestinian cause, this does not make them anti-Jewish. It cuts both ways.</small>”</li>

<ul>
<li>"Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination" assumes that all Jews equate self determination with Zionism. Not only is this not true today, it has never been true. There is a long and respected tradition in Jewish history and culture among all those who have wished or wish today for cultural, religious or other forms of autonomy falling short of a Jewish state; for a binational state in Palestine as did Martin Buber and others; or for a one-state solution today, whatever form it might take – a minority view in Israel today to be sure, but held by numbers of respected Jews. To make the assumption that all Jews hold the same views is in itself a form of antisemitism.</li>
<li>"Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation." This is a formulation that allows any criticism of Israel to be dismissed on the grounds that it is not simultaneously applied to every other defaulting state at the same time. As campaigners for a just peace in the Middle East we can affirm that it is thrown willy-nilly to stifle any and all but the narrowest criticism of acts of the Israeli government that are in prima facie breach of clause after clause of the 4th Geneva Convention. Or again, the democratic norm that all citizens in a state should be treated equally sometimes sits uneasily with some notions of Israel as a ‘Jewish state’ and it is not antisemitic to point this out or to suggest that Israel should, indeed, be a ‘state of all its citizens’.</li>
<li>"Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel." This is the flipside of a position, frequently expressed by Prime Minister Sharon and many Zionists, that refuses to make any distinction between the interests of Israel and those of Jews worldwide. Why it is permissible for them to make this elision but evidence of antisemitism when others do so is not clear. It might even be taken as evidence of double standards… In reality it is all too often Zionist rhetoric which fuses the notion of Israel’s interests with those of Jews worldwide and thus fuels what the EUMC identifies (other things being equal) as a potential indicator of antisemitism.</li>
</ul>
This is not to deny that there are circumstances in which criticisms of the state of Israel might indeed be antisemitic. But the presumption should not be that they are. This requires demonstration on a case by case basis.”</li>

The research in this article shines a different, statistical light on this question: based on a survey of 500 citizens in each of 10 European countries, the authors ask whether those individuals with extreme anti-Israel views are more likely to be anti-Semitic. Even after controlling for numerous potentially confounding factors, they find that anti-Israel sentiment consistently predicts the probability that an individual is anti-Semitic, with the likelihood of measured anti-Semitism increasing with the extent of anti-Israel sentiment observed.”</small></li>

From a large survey of 5,000 citizens of ten European countries, we showed that the prevalence of those harboring (selfreported) anti-Semitic views consistently increases with respondents’ degree of anti-Israel sentiment (see Figures 2 and 3 and Table 3), even after controlling for other factors. It is noteworthy that fewer than one-quarter of those with anti-Israel index scores of only 1 or 2 harbor anti-Semitic views (as defined by anti-Semitic index scores exceeding 5), which supports the contention that one certainly can be critical of Israeli policies without being anti-Semitic. However, among those with the most extreme anti-Israel sentiments in our survey (anti-Israel index scores of 4), 56 percent report anti-Semitic leanings. Based on this analysis, when an individual’s criticism of Israel becomes sufficiently severe, it does become reasonable to ask whether such criticism is a mask for underlying anti-Semitism.”</small></li>

Although motivated by strong anti-Israel sentiment such as that earlier described, our research question is not whether anti-Israel statements are anti-Semitic in either effect or intent. Rather, we ask whether individuals with strong anti-Israel views are more likely to harbor anti-Semitic attitudes than others.”</small></li>

And their protestations sound plausible. After all, this is not your grandfather’s anti-Semitism.…At least that is what I assumed until someone did the study. Two Connecticut professors got curious about the constant denials that extremely harsh critics of Israel were anti-Semitic. Edward H. Kaplan, the William N. and Marie A. Beach Professor of Management Sciences at Yale, and Charles A. Small, Director of Urban Studies, Southern Connecticut State University, decided to examine the issue in formal way.…Kaplan and Small ask whether individuals expressing strong anti-Israel sentiments, such as the statement by Ted Honderich, Emeritus Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London, that “those Palestinians who have resorted to necessary killing have been right to try to free their people, and those who have killed themselves in the cause of their people have indeed sanctified themselves,” are more likely than the general population to also support in such old-style anti-Semitic slurs as “Jews have too much power in our country today.” The correlation was almost perfect. In a survey of 5,000 Europeans in ten countries, people who believed that the Israeli soldiers “intentionally target Palestinian civilians,” and that “Palestinian suicide bombers who target Israeli civilians” are justified, also believed that “Jews don’t care what happens to anyone but their own kind,” “Jews have a lot of irritating faults,” and “Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want.” The study’s other interesting finding was that only a small fraction of Europeans believe any of these things. Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism flourish among the few, but those few are over-represented in Europe’s newspapers, its universities, and its left-wing political parties.</small> ”</li>

They are, above all, a by-product of the wildly disproportionate responses that mark the post-September 11 world. Disproportionate reaction seems increasingly the norm, especially in regards to antipathy for the United States, antipathy that has meshed, it seems to me, with an outsized antagonism for its smallest but singularly visible Middle East ally, Israel. Distinguishing such reaction from antisemitism without denying that the two coincide is not meant to dismiss the significance of such attitudes, which remain troubling, but in ways different from how they have been widely understood.…What Raab means by anti-Israelism is the increasing role that a concerted, vigorous, prejudice against Israel — and he does see such sentiments as born of prejudice — has played in much of the political left, visibly in the antiglobalist campaign, but where there is no discernible hatred of Jews. Often, in this context, belief in Israel’s mendacity is shaped, above all, by simple, crude, linear notions of the causal relationship between politics, oppression, and liberation, by transparent beliefs in a world with clear-cut oppressors and oppressed — in other words, by a much distorted, simplistic, but this-worldly political analysis devoid of anti-Jewish bias. Such prejudice against Israel is not antisemitism, although undoubtedly the two can and at times do coexist.</small> ”</cite><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=Contemporary+antisemitism%3A+Canada+and+the+world&amp;rft.title=Contemporary+antisemitism%3A+Canada+and+the+world&amp;rft.atitle=Historical+Reflections+on+Contemporary+Antisemitism&amp;rft.aulast=Zipperstein&amp;rft.aufirst=Steven+J.&amp;rft.date=2005&amp;rft.pub=%5B%5BUniversity+of+Toronto+Press%5D%5D&amp;rft.place=%5B%5BToronto%2C+Ontario%5D%5D&amp;rft.pages=60%E2%80%9361&amp;rft.isbn=978-0802039316&amp;rft_id=info:oclcnum/56531591">&#160;</span></li>
