<p>Anti-Protestantism originated in a reaction by the Catholic church against the Protestant <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>. Protestants were stigmatised as heretics and subject to persecution in those territories, such as Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, in which the Catholics were the dominant power. This movement was orchestrated by Popes and Princes as the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_Reformation_3b8f.html" title="Counter Reformation">Counter Reformation</a>. This resulted in religious wars and eruptions of sectarian hatred such as the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Bartholomew%27s_Day_Massacre_2174.html" title="St Bartholomew's Day Massacre">St Bartholomew's Day Massacre</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodoxy_14a3.html" title="Eastern Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> initially viewed Protestantism as less of a threat.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The two had comparatively little contact for geographic, linguistic and historical reasons. Protestant attempts to reconcile with Eastern Orthodoxy proved problematic. In general, many Orthodoxes had the initial impression that Protestants were an invalid heresy that arose from a previous heresy; the previous heresy being Catholicism itself. By the nineteenth century some Eastern Orthodox thinkers believed that <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Europe_9480.html" title="Northern Europe">Northern Europe</a> had become secular or virtually atheist due to its having been Protestant earlier. In recent eras Orthodox Anti-Protestantism has grown due to increasing Nationalism and Protestant proselytization in predominantly Orthodox countries.</p>

<p>In the U.S. hostility to mainline Protestantism comes from stereotypes of <a href="../../../w/a/s/WASP_ca86.html" title="WASP">WASPs</a>. This a mildly derogatory term describing people of "White Anglo-Saxon Protestant" background, but can be applied to all Protestants of Northern European descent. It can describe upper middle class Protestant people and their values in teasing or disparaging terms. WASPs tended to be portrayed as rigid and emotionally reserved. Pop-culture references to this occur in the discussions of the Mayor's background in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_City_5a78.html" title="Spin City">Spin City</a>, the Jim Dial character in <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murphy_Brown_994c.html" title="Murphy Brown">Murphy Brown</a>, and many characters in the film <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Lisa_Smile_44a2.html" title="Mona Lisa Smile">Mona Lisa Smile</a>.</p>

<p>Some evangelicals claim to be members of America's most persecuted religious groups. This is often because of laws prohibiting evangelical practices like allowing public figures, such as teachers, to proselytize while on duty, and religious displays on public property. Some people reject the claim by some Evangelicals that anyone who does not share their denomination's interpretation of the Bible must be made to understand the error of their ways. Their occasional message that non-Protestants do not know the Bible, or are not Christians, is not well-received by members of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Catholic</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodoxy_14a3.html" title="Eastern Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox</a> faiths. In part for such reasons, parts of Central America and the Andes have seen riots against Evangelicals.</p>
<p>In Central and Eastern Europe the fall of Communism led to evangelization projects that have incited some resentment. The reaction has been perhaps the most intense in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>. Programs in that nation imply that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostalism.html" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostalism</a> is a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destructive_cult.html" title="Destructive cult">Destructive cult</a> or cults that can be compared to <a href="../../../a/u/m/Aum_Shinrikyo_f612.html" title="Aum Shinrikyo">Aum Shinrikyo</a>. There are disputed claims that <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a> are also maligned in Belarussian textbooks. <a href="http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=824" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=824" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In the Muslim world hostility to Evangelical Christians is widespread. This hostility focuses on Evangelicals for a variety of reasons. In much of the Middle East and North Africa, Catholics and Orthodox Christians have lived in the region for centuries and have been successfully established trust and cooperation with Muslims in their societies. Evangelicals are seen as a destabilizing factor in these societies, in part owing to the close association of Evangelical agenda with the economic and political outlooks of the United States. Also, in nations governed by some form of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a>, efforts to convert Muslims to Christianity could be deemed as encouraging <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a> and can have legal repercussions. The punishment can vary from censorship to death. Hence in 2004 Eritrea began a crackdown that saw the arrests of several Evangelicals. Eritrea is one predominantly Muslim state that sees Catholics and Orthodoxes as essentially established, so the persecution tended to specify Evangelicals who attempted to convert Muslims to Protestant Christianity. Still it is more common in the Islamic world for anti-Christian feelings to be generalized. Hence Christianity in general is viewed unfavorably in Turkey and Pakistan according to a recent <a href="../../../p/e/w/Pew_Research_Center_484e.html" title="Pew Research Center">Pew Survey</a>.</p>
<p>Some Evangelist groups take the Bible as literal and exact truth, and so have been derided as "Bible thumpers". Some pundits have even suggested that Evangelicals are a kind of "fifth column" aimed at turning the US or other nations into a Christian <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theocracy.html" title="Theocracy">Theocracy</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A.

<p>In several countries with a majority of the population identifying themselves as Catholic, there is a hostility to Protestantism as a whole<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> . This distaste with Protestantism is often religious in nature, but in some areas, such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, it is the unfortunate result of a battle of the European <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Grand_Alliance_245f.html" title="War of the Grand Alliance">religious wars</a> having been fought there, which polarised the people on religious and political grounds.</p>
<p>In more modern times, with the growth in <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecumenism.html" title="Ecumenism">ecumenism</a> among Protestants in the mid-twentieth century and with the advent of <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_II_09ad.html" title="Vatican II">Vatican II</a>, Catholic-Protestant relations have grown calmer. Nevertheless, in general the further a Protestant sect is from Catholicism in its doctrine, the more discomfort may arise among Catholic people. Anglicans and Lutherans are only sporadically viewed in a negative light in modern Catholic countries. However, a <a href="../../../z/o/g/Zogby.html" title="Zogby">Zogby</a> poll of American Catholics showed Catholics having a more hostile attitude toward Fundamentalist Evangelical Protestants than to any non-Christian religion. It is also the official teaching of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> that Protestant faiths do not contain the fullness of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitatis_Redintegratio_22ad.html" title="Unitatis Redintegratio">truth</a>. Most modern Catholics would indicate this does not make them outright false or negative, but merely less true. There are, however, Catholics, especially <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholics_263f.html" title="Traditionalist Catholics">Traditionalist Catholics</a> who deem Protestantism to be a rejection of "the one true faith", and thus in a state of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_sin.html" title="Mortal sin">mortal sin</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Declaration_on_the_Doctrine_of_Justification_b3ca.html" title="Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification">Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</a> <a href="http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/ecumenicaldialogue/romancatholic/jddj/declaration.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/ecumenicaldialogue/romancatholic/jddj/declaration.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, a document created by and agreed to by clerical representatives of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheran_World_Federation_58e6.html" title="Lutheran World Federation">Lutheran World Federation</a> as a result of extensive <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheran%E2%80%94Roman_Catholic_Dialogue_1c44.html" title="Lutheran—Roman Catholic Dialogue">ecumenical dialogue</a>, substantially resolved the conflict over the nature of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justification_%28theology%29.html" title="Justification (theology)">justification</a> (dealing colloquially with the issue of faith and works) which was a major issue at the root of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>. The churches acknowledged that the excommunications relating to the doctrine of justification set forth by the Roman Catholic <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Trent_988c.html" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a> do not apply to the teachings of the Lutheran churches set forth in the text; likewise, the churches acknowledged that the condemnations set forth in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Concord_76db.html" title="Book of Concord">Lutheran Confessions</a> do not apply to the Catholic teachings on justification set forth in the document.</p>

<p>In other cases, especially <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> or pre-<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Emancipation_5e59.html" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a> <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the issue is more complex and has more to do with communal or <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> sentiments than theological issues. Ireland was <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_re-conquest_of_Ireland_f2a6.html" title="Tudor re-conquest of Ireland">conquered</a> by the Protestant state of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in the course of the 16th century. However the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> state failed to convert the Catholic natives to Protestantism and there was also a vigorous campaign of proselytizing by <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_Reformation_3b8f.html" title="Counter Reformation">Counter Reformation</a> Catholic clergy. The result was that Catholicism came to be identified with sense of nativism and Protestantism came to be identified with the State.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_Laws_82c5.html" title="Penal Laws">Penal Laws</a>, first introduced in the early 17th century, were initially designed to force the native elite to conform to the state church by excluding <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-conformist.html" title="Non-conformist">non-Conformists</a> and Roman Catholics from public office, but were later, under <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Anne_653a.html" title="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</a>, also used to confiscate virtually all Catholic owned land. The Penal Laws had a lasting effect on the population, due to their severity (celebrating Catholicism in any form was punishable by death or enslavement under the laws), and the favouritism granted Irish Anglicans served to polarise the community in terms of religion. Anti-Protestantism in <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Modern_Ireland_1536-1691_a0b1.html" title="Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691">Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691</a> thus was also largely a form of hostility to the colonisation of Ireland. <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_poetry.html" title="Irish poetry">Irish poetry</a> of this era shows a marked antipathy to Protestantism, one such poem reading, "The faith of Christ [Catholicism] with the faith of Luther is like ashes in the snow". The mixture of resistance to colonization and religious disagreements led to widespread massacres of Protestant settlers in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Rebellion_of_1641_8451.html" title="Irish Rebellion of 1641">Irish Rebellion of 1641</a>. Subsequent religious or <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarian.html" title="Sectarian">sectarian</a> antipathy was fueled by the atrocities committed by both sides in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Confederate_Wars_709c.html" title="Irish Confederate Wars">Irish Confederate Wars</a>, especially the repression of Catholicism during and after the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland_f36e.html" title="Cromwellian conquest of Ireland">Cromwellian conquest of Ireland</a>, when Irish Catholic land was confiscated en masse, clergy were executed and discriminatory legislation was passed against Catholics.</p>
<p>The Penal Laws against Catholics (and also <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterians.html" title="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a>) were renewed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries due to fear of Catholic support for <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobitism.html" title="Jacobitism">Jacobitism</a> after the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williamite_war_in_Ireland_c87b.html" title="Williamite war in Ireland">Williamite war in Ireland</a> and were slowly repealed in 1771-1829. Penal Laws against Presbyterians were relaxed by the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toleration_Act_fd8f.html" title="Toleration Act">Toleration Act</a> of 1719, due to their siding with the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobite.html" title="Jacobite">Jacobites</a> in a 1715 rebellion. At the time the Penal Laws were in effect, Presbyterians and other non-Conformist Protestants left Ireland and settled in other countries. Some 250,000 left for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">New World</a> alone between the years 1717 and 1774, most of them arriving there from <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>.</p>
<p>Sectarian conflict was continued in the late 18th century in the form of communal violence between rival Catholic and Protestant factions over land and trading rights (see <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defenders_%28Ireland%29_2475.html" title="Defenders (Ireland)">Defenders (Ireland)</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peep_O%27Day_Boys_7507.html" title="Peep O'Day Boys">Peep O'Day Boys</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Institution_07af.html" title="Orange Institution">Orange Institution</a>. The 1820s and 1830s in Ireland saw a major attempt by Protestant <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelists.html" title="Evangelists">evangelists</a> to convert Catholics, a campaign which caused great resentment among Catholics.</p>
<p>In modern <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalism.html" title="Irish nationalism">Irish nationalism</a>, anti-Protestantism is usually more nationalist than religious in tone. The main reason for this is the identification of Protestants with <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionism_%28Ireland%29_2456.html" title="Unionism (Ireland)">unionism</a> - i.e. the support for the maintenance of the union with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and opposition to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Rule_0742.html" title="Home Rule">Home Rule</a> or Irish independence. In <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, since the foundation of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_State_4fe7.html" title="Free State">Free State</a> in 1921, Catholics, who are mainly nationalists, allege systematic discrimination against them by the Protestant <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist_%28Ireland%29_9310.html" title="Unionist (Ireland)">unionist</a> community. The mixture of religious and national identities on both sides reinforces both anti-Catholic and anti-Protestant <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarian.html" title="Sectarian">sectarian</a> prejudice in the province.</p>
<p>More specifically religious anti-Protestantism in Ireland was evidenced by the acceptance of the <a href="../../../n/e/_/Ne_Temere_d04e.html" title="Ne Temere">Ne Temere</a> decrees in the early 20th century, whereby the Catholic Church decreed that all children born into mixed Catholic-Protestant marriages had to be brought up as Catholics. Protestants in Northern Ireland had long held that their religious liberty would be threatened under a 32-county Irish Republic, due to that country's Constitutional support of a "special place" in government for the Roman Catholic Church. This was amended in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> in 1970 however.</p>

<p>Hostility between Catholics and Protestants in the United States emerged in the 1800s following the influx of immigrants from predominantly Catholic-European countries (i.e. Ireland, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Germany_3d30.html" title="Southern Germany">Southern Germany</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>) to the United States. Immigrants were subjected to widespread <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a> and attacks by groups like the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>.

However, the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> has become the largest single-body congregation of Christianity in the United States (approx. 26% of Americans are Catholics) followed by Baptist Christians (approx 18% of Americans). However, Protestant Christianity (although not a religion in itself) as a whole remain the largest religious group in the United States.
