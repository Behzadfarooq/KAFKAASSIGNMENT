<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntoshi_040b.html" title="Edit section: Antoshi, the username">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Antoshi, the username</span></h2>
<p>As a user, Antoshi has been involved in many different groups, such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forum.html" title="Forum">Forums</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild.html" title="Guild">Guilds</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">Clans</a>, social groups, as well as private ones. The beginning of Antoshi as a user began <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. The name 'Antoshi' has been an enigma to many users, wondering how the name was created (some making jokes about it). The name 'Antoshi' was bestowed upon him by a friend who was making a small social group, blending the beginning of real person's first names with the end of (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>) Pokémon character's first names. In this instance, the name "Anthony", was taken as "Ant", and the character "<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash_Ketchum_64c1.html" title="Ash Ketchum">Satoshi</a>", was taken as "oshi", therby making "Antoshi."</p>
<p>For a very long while, the name was not used as a main nickname, just a simple aside, and rarely ever used. At the time, the creator was <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing.html" title="Role-playing">Role-playing</a> on <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatrooms.html" title="Chatrooms">chatrooms</a> as the character Satoshi (which was why Satoshi was also taken as the name mix). However, it wasn't until the creator joined a Pokémon Guild known as NPC that Antoshi became an actual character. NPC, or Nonpariel Pokémon Confederation was the longest-standing and most respected Pokémon Guild of all on AOL. And, until its unfortunate demise on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> he was a recurring member (although kicked out once between for disorderly behavior).</p>
<p>After which time, the creator stayed AOL before focusing his attention to <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a>, to chat with friends (such as Bardock and Decky) and create <a href="../../../m/i/r/MIRC_script_720d.html" title="MIRC script">scripts</a> in his spare time. He also occasionally writes <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.html" title="Fanfiction">Fanfiction</a> (mainly about character Antoshi), and plays the online games <a href="../../../m/a/p/MapleStory_f8e7.html" title="MapleStory">MapleStory</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbo_Sliders_1202.html" title="Turbo Sliders">Turbo Sliders</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunz.html" title="Gunz">Gunz</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Antoshi.2C_the_character" id="Antoshi.2C_the_character"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntoshi_040b.html" title="Edit section: Antoshi, the character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Antoshi, the character</span></h2>
<p>At the <i>very</i> early beginning, Antoshi was the embodiment of the character owner's persona (at the time). A rather <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libido.html" title="Libido">hormone-driven</a> fifteen year-old, a wannabe <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_%28dating%29.html" title="Player (dating)">player</a>, and <a href="../../../w/o/m/Womanizer.html" title="Womanizer">womanizer</a>. After only one Role-Playing session of the character in this form, it was quickly dropped for being distasteful, and the character was re-created upon entering NPC on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>In-between those two points, however, Antoshi was portrayed as a young, carefree trainer whose main interest was catching Pokémon. His original team consisted of Pokémon caught in the owner's actual Pokémon game. Later, he would catch an Umbreon (role-played by another person). His trademark look, aside from his clothes, were constantly having a backpack (similar to Ash) and wearing a <a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_player_927b.html" title="CD player">CD player</a>. The idea was spurred after the owner got a <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixtape.html" title="Mixtape">mixed CD</a> and would listen to it often. Antoshi's music was identical to that on the CD.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his run in NPC, Antoshi would take the form of its present-day personality (to an extent). A happy-go-lucky, charming (and in some ways, dopey), young <b>thirteen</b> year-old boy with reckless disregard for his own safety, and merely trying to find as many ways as possible to have fun and enjoy life. The NPC battles, which were <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dice.html" title="Dice">dice</a>-oriented, showed off Antoshi was a brave young man who went to all ends to perform tricky, acrobatic feats in his attacks (one time climbing to the top of a tall tree, and jumping down onto a target enemy).</p>
<p>He also had an interesting handful of weapons that would change when the number of dice rolled for a single attack was upgraded (starting from two, then three, then four). The original weapon was called the "Spork of Doom!!", (double-exclamation points included) that was his favorite, and decided to use it as a menial weapon on the battlefield. When the dice were eventually raied, the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spork.html" title="Spork">spork</a> "broke", leaving Antoshi to find a new weapon. This time it was a frying pan, in which he named the "Frying Pan of Doom!!". And, once the dice were raised for the last time, the pan was "rusted", however Antoshi never got around to using his final weapon (which was planned to be the "<a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallet.html" title="Mallet">Mallet</a> of Doom!!"), since he obtained another item called the "Shard <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance.html" title="Lance">Lance</a>", an <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_Pok%C3%A9mon_f596.html" title="Ice Pokémon">Ice</a>-grade weapon, that was 6'4'' from the butt of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaft.html" title="Shaft">shaft</a> to the tip off the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade.html" title="Blade">blade</a>. It caused the victim an internal icy chill upon striking. This weapon would be a semi-recurring item in later <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storyline.html" title="Storyline">storylines</a> (see below) before its own destruction.</p>
<p>In-between getting kicked out of NPC and re-entering it, Antoshi was placed into a new Guild created by the owner's friend. PFW, or Pokémon Faith Within, was a small group of dedicated Role-Players, but their numbers were a far-cry from NPC's member count. Here, Antoshi held several jobs. Mass-Spar Log Grader, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsletter.html" title="Newsletter">Newsletter</a> Publisher, <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">Website</a> Owner, and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-in-Command_fbdd.html" title="Second-in-Command">Second-in-Command</a>, under the two co-owners (of course all of these tasks were really carried out by the owner). The members enjoyed the new Guild for a while, but its luster started to slowly fade. It eventually fell apart a few months before NPC closed its own doors. Just before, though, Antoshi was re-accepted into NPC, sticking with the Guild this time until the end.</p>
<p>Aside from being in Guilds, Antoshi was the star character in his own fanfictions, where he shared a small home with his two siblings. Their backgrounds were slowly revealed through flashbacks or other little tidbits of information that enriched their personalities and let readers understand just who Antoshi was.</p>

<p>The oldest, but not the wisest of the three siblings. As a baby, he was given up into <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster_care.html" title="Foster care">foster care</a> by his <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother.html" title="Mother">mother</a>'s request, and, soon after, was <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adopt.html" title="Adopt">adopted</a> by a family that loved and nurtured the young Antoshi. He was given a <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cyndaquil.html" title="Cyndaquil">Cyndaquil</a> as a pet whom he named Bakufun, and the two have developed an unbreakable friendship wih each other. Once he was old enough, Antoshi set out to become a <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trainer_e857.html" title="Pokémon Trainer">Pokémon Trainer</a> with Bakufun (who was now a Typhlosion) in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johto.html" title="Johto">Johto</a> League. His life was flipped upside-down when he met his younger brother, Latoshi, along the way.</p>
<p>Antoshi was born with <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a>. He's a Psychic with real mind power, although most of the time he acts like he doesn't <i>have</i> a brain. However, whenever someone or something he cares about is threatened, his persona changes completely into a brave warrior who won't hesitate to use his powers to make sure the ones he care about are safe. That being said, Latoshi poses a constant threat to his and everyone else's safety.</p>
<p>Antoshi's powers can be used to both attack and heal individuals. After his first battle with his younger brother, Antoshi healed his wounds, and the younger sibling quickly escaped, promising revenge on Antoshi. He is constantly the target of many different attacks by Latoshi. Some of them are carefully calculated, and others are just brash, surprise attacks. Either way, Antoshi has the strength to beat, let-alone keep at bay, his younger brother. But that doesn't stop Latoshi's endless quest of violence. Despite this, Antoshi remains the most cheerful and light-hearted member of the group, usually doing something innocent or silly whenever he can.</p>
<p>He is also somewhat romantically involved with a girl named <b>Serenity McGrith</b>, who is also a psychic, although her powers are aimed mainly toward healing. Serenity's purpose in life is a difficult one. Not unlike Antoshi, she also has an evil brother, <b>Collin</b>, who stops at nothing to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_domination.html" title="World domination">take over the world</a>. Serenity and Collin are frequently engaged in a battle to protect the planet, and for the majority, Serenity is always victorious. Even though, Collin has managed to beat her, and has even killed her once, but she was quickly revived due in part to a mysterious guardian spirit.</p>
<p>Serenity and Antoshi came together one day, when Collin hunted him down, mistaking his psychic powers for his sisters. Regardless, he attacked the younger boy and nearly killed him before Serenity intervened and saved his life. After which time, the two developed a friendship, and enjoy spending time with one another on Serenity's time off, while Collin calculates his next maneuver. Serenity was not much of a cheerful person with the thought of her insatiable brother's evil lurking just over her shoulder, but the time spent with younger Antoshi helps her to feel more relaxed, and the happy-go-lucky personality of her (boy)friend is welcomed, and even mirrored by her at times.</p>
<p>With each passing "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtship.html" title="Courtship">date</a>" they share, their feelings for each other slowly deepen, and the relationship took a more romantic turn when Serenity's own life was saved by Antoshi (with help from Mitoshi), and is certainly convinced his feelings for her are solid. Although every time she attempts to make an <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affection.html" title="Affection">affectionate</a> gesture towards him, he usually panicks, and ruins the moment, thus throwing the evolution of their relationship into an endless <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limbo.html" title="Limbo">limbo</a>. Still, Serenity practices infinite patience with the younger boy and is confident that he will one day accept her affections.</p>

<p>The middle child, and the darkest and brashest of the three. Latoshi was the only child their <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological.html" title="Biological">biological</a> parents chose to keep. Because of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial.html" title="Financial">financial</a> issues, they could not take care of three children, and fate seemed to pull them towards the younger brother, however it would turn out to be a dark fate, indeed. As he grew older, and became more aware of the world around him, he found his parents regretting the fact they gave their other child away (Latoshi only understood he had a brother, and never knew he had a sister). This led him to believe they didn't love him anymore, and left him to feel rejected. Slowly, his emotions became colder, and became violent little by little, which worried his parents.</p>
<p>Latoshi's parents then decided he may need discipline, and planned to send him away to a boy's camp one summer. The night before they could set this plan in motion, a mysterious presence visited Latoshi by his bedside (otherwise known as "The Dark One" or "Master" to Latoshi, later on). He'd been watching the boy for some time, realizing the dark forces that lie within the young boy, and how he could harness that power for his own plans. He wouldn't let the boy's anger regress, so he placed a mysterious scroll before the boy. He explained that reading it would take away the anger and torment he felt in his heart. Upon doing such, the man's deal held up, Latoshi's pain vanished, leaving him with the feeling of pure, undeniable happiness... But it was short lived, his emotions of anger and sadness suddenly amplified and thus a demonic aura was unleashed from the boy. He confronted the source of his anger, his parents, about the boy they missed so much. All of Latoshi's pain swelled. He expelled a large amount of dark energy that resulted in destroyed his entire hometown. Only he was the only one that survived, falling unconscious shortly after the ordeal.</p>
<p>Scientists came to explore the cause of the town's mysterious destruction, finding Latoshi, unscathed and unconcious in the mess, and took him away to their lab on <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnabar_Island_efdc.html" title="Cinnabar Island">Cinnabar Island</a>. Upon further study, they made a false conclusion, and explained to their peers that the boy had what was called the Dark Syndrome, the host of the "disease" has the potential of using the powers of darkness at his or her will. This wasn't the truth, as Latoshi was merely born with powers of darkness and had no such "syndrome." Latoshi eventually escaped from the scientists' clutches, killing them all before leaving to explore his powers.</p>
<p>For a while, Latoshi delighted in causing rampant destruction across cities, towns, forests, anything with a living population. The thought of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> was one that intrigued him, and killing made him curious. Between the time of this uncontrollable behavior and meeting his brother, he met a young <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">neko</a> by the name of Blueberry. The two shared a brief, curious relationship before an accidental blast of his own dark energy struck and killed Blueberry. It was then that he took time to reflect upon death, and what it meant to him. He also reflected upon her love, and soon Latoshi became a docile <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermit.html" title="Hermit">hermit</a> living on his own in the wilderness before meeting his brother Antoshi for the first time.</p>
<p>At first, the two were glad to meet each other, but Latoshi was quickly reminded of how much he had despised his brother for the pain hs caused through his family. After Latoshi labeled his brother as a "zealous braggart", his old feelings of hatred soon re-emerged, and the two engaged in a massive fight which left much of <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldenrod_City_ecf5.html" title="Goldenrod City">Goldenrod City</a> destroyed. Latoshi was defeated by his brother for the first time, and has sworn revenge on him ever since. He will stop at nothing to someday become stronger and (eventually) kill his brother, so he constantly embarks in daily, rigorous training to heighten his strength.</p>
<p>Later on, as the siblings came together to form their own family, Latoshi's personality has become more menial. He trains, but merely for his own purposes, and realizes that, even though he may try for the rest of his life, he could probably never become strong enough to beat his brother, and, in fact, the two even formed a team to stop greater evil. Another reason why he lost focus on his brother is because he has been struggling to fight his own inner demons, as well as The Dark One. But, it seems that Latoshi's struggle of pain could be eternal...</p>

<p>The younger sister of both brothers. She is the constant <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediator.html" title="Mediator">mediator</a> between the two rivaling brothers, and wants nothing but peace between them, although that seems like a difficult cause since Latoshi will stop at nothing to someday beat his brother. She cares deeply for them, and worries for their safety whenever they ensue a battle, whether it be with each other or someone else. She also serves as their cook, and strives to make things a little easier at home.</p>
<p>Just as Antoshi, Mitoshi was given away to be adopted, and taken in by a family different than Antoshi was, which meant all three children grew up as <a href="../../../o/n/l/Only_child.html" title="Only child">only childs</a>. As a young girl, she discovered her ability to manipulate the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> element as she commanded. When she turned eleven, her parents decided to explain to her how she was adopted and how she had two other siblings whom she never knew. This turned out to be a bad decision on their part, as Mitoshi became obsessed with wondering who her siblings were, where they lived, what they were doing. She ran away from home one night, quickly taking off on her own to set out to find her siblings and reunite herself with them.</p>
<p>Mitoshi's mode of travel was water, using her powers to dart through the water and thereby cover more areas quicker. She would swim from place to place, trusting in her own instincts to guide her toward them. Eventually, she detected the presence of her sibling's power during their second fight. Mitoshi made her appearance before them, and quickly brought their fight to an end, temporarily. After which, Latoshi escaped and Antoshi stayed with his sister to build a home for her.</p>
<p>For a short time, Latoshi was interested in his sister's ability to command water, and promised that he would use her in his quest to defeat his brother. He succeeded in doing this, and a handicapped fight ensued, Latoshi and his brainwashed sister fought Antoshi in a battle that was cut short when their powers were simultaneously stripped by an energy-stealing creature who used the powers of many special individuals (including the siblings) to grow to a massive size and caused rampant destruction to Goldenrod City. The trio eventually banded together to defeat the monster, and after which time, decided they would live together in the house after Bakufun confronted Antoshi and explained he wished to travel on his own, thus ending Antoshi's quest for <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badge.html" title="Badge">badges</a> and solidifying his new life with his two siblings.</p>

</ul>
<p>Bakufun is a Typhlosion and Antoshi's only Pokémon and best friend. Its name comes from the japanese name for Typhlosion. After being given to Antoshi as a Cyndaquil, the two quickly became best friends and would constantly be by each other's side. When Bakufun evolved into a Quilava, and Antoshi's dream of becoming a Pokémon Trainer finally came into view, they would constantly go out at all hours of the day (and night) to train, both wanting to acheive their full potential.</p>
<p>He was the first one to find out about Antoshi's powers. After training one day, they were both ambushed by the crime organization known as <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Rocket_187c.html" title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a>. Bakufun (as Quilava) was kidnapped, and Team Rocket figured there was nothing the young trainer could do to stop them, but he did. He unconciously tapped into his powers to save his best friend in danger, lifting Team Rocket into the air, and pulling Bakufun away, then discarding them into air in true "blast off" fashion.</p>
<p>After Bakufun finally evolved into a Typhlosion, and Antoshi was finally old enough to start his quest, they set off, leaving their original home behind, and heading off towards Antoshi becoming a Trainer. With Bakufun's help, he managed to obtain two Johto League badges before unexpectedly meeting his brother outside of Goldenrod City.</p>
<p>The time Antoshi spent fighting his brother gave Bakufun time to think. He knew the Badge quest wasn't going to continue, and so, after the three siblings banded together to defeat a monstrous being that stole their powers known as Aminal, Bakufun let himself out of his <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokeball.html" title="Pokeball">Pokeball</a> and told Antoshi he wished to go out on his own, to which his Trainer and friend brokenheatedly agreed.</p>
<p>Bakufun spent some time thinking of what he wanted to do. It came to him that he aspired to be a leader, like Antoshi was, but he wasn't sure how. He traveled for some time, all the way from Antoshi's new home near Goldenrod City to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celadon_City_a80b.html" title="Celadon City">Celadon City</a> in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanto.html" title="Kanto">Kanto</a>. He had no money and was sadly forced to live on the streets. But it was his time on the streets that would change his life.</p>
<p>While walking across a TV store one day, he caught the local newscast, a report on which involved the rising number of gangs, brutality and murder within Celadon, sparked by the original crime involvement from Team Rocket's leader, <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_5c0d.html" title="Giovanni (Pokémon)">Giovanni</a>. This gave Bakufun even more time to think, and, after witnessing a horrible crime play out right in front of him, he decided he wanted to be like Antoshi and help people. Therefore, he was going to fight crime, from the inside, as a <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangster.html" title="Gangster">gangster</a>.</p>
<p>Bakufun cleaned up his appearance, and decided to make a name for himself, wrapping a black and red bandana around his head, he worked his way inside the crime world by becoming a lackey for Kamekkusu and his gang of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feraligatr.html" title="Feraligatr">Feraligatr</a>. His tasks were menial, usually stealing items or harassing the people that owed money to Kamekkusu. However, under this guise, Bakufun silently vowed to take down Kamekkusu and his gang.</p>
<p>Later, a heated arguement between Kamekkusu and Bakufun unexpectedly erupted when Bakufun refused to carry out an order. The shuffle ended when Bakufun brandished a gun and shot him twice, once in the leg, and another that grazed his cheek, giving him a permanent scar. Bakufun immediately fled but was chased by the Feraligatr who shot mericilessly at him. He was shot once in the back, before setting fire to their hideout and managing to escape.</p>
<p>Though injured, Bakufun managed to carry himself away, although he had nowhere to go. He somehow found a group of Typhlosions like himself, and fell unconcious before them. When he awoke, he found himself healed, and amongst the Typhlosions from earlier. News had traveled fast, and they told Bakufun that everyone on the street knew he shot Kamekkusu. They explained they were a weak gang, and needed a leader, to which Bakufun agreed. Now that he had extra help, Bakufun knew he would be able to clean up crime in the areas the police couldn't touch. He was now a renegade hero.</p>
<p>The group called themselves the "Typhlosionz", and quickly became a powerful gang due to Bakufun's street crediblity. After which time, Bakufun began to think again, about Antoshi and how he hadn't seen him in some time. He obtained a <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowrider.html" title="Lowrider">lowrider</a> for transportation and used it to bring him and his fellow gang members to Antoshi's home, which quickly became a recurring activity once the other Typhlosions saw how nice Mitoshi's house was, and the fact that Bakufun enjoyed visiting his old friend.</p>
<p>The Typhlosionz have their own <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> in which they attempt to take food from Mitoshi's refridgerator and Mitoshi would have to chase them away in one form or another. While she despises his friends, she is mostly nice towards Bakufun since she knows he has a good heart and is Antoshi's best friend. Bakufun does not know what the future holds, or if he'll ever return to Antoshi, but he is always thinking.</p>
<p>Also to be noted is Bakufun's relationship to Latoshi. Although Latoshi despises his trainer, he and Bakufun are on good terms, and Bakufun considers himself "cool" with Latoshi despite being directly in battle with him once before.</p>

<li>Age: Unknown (Possibly around 300-400 years old, as he was implored by The Dark One and given <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html" title="Immortality">long-lasting life</a>)</li>
<li>Resides in: Hell (And sometimes with Latoshi in Goldenrod City)</li>

<li>Appearance: Exactly similar to a <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houndoom.html" title="Houndoom">Houndoom</a>; His eyes are an eerie red on black</li>
<li>Abilities: Attacks naturally learned by a Houndoom (i.e., Flamethrower); Great physical strength, mostly around the neck; Aura (although it can't be used as a shield)</li>
<li>Family: Latoshi(owner), The Dark One(previous owner)</li>
<li>Friends/Allies: None</li>
<li>Enemies: Bakufun(arch-<a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy.html" title="Enemy">enemy</a>), Antoshi, Mitoshi(though she sometimes tries to be nice to him), Serenity McGrith, Poka &amp; Chika, Typhlosionz Gang, Collin McGrith, Aminal, Rapras</li>
</ul>
<p>Heruga is an <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead.html" title="Undead">undead</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demonic</a> Houndoom from <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>. He was a faithful companion to his original owner when he was alive many centuries ago. When he witnessed his owner killed by another human over a petty argument, he began to <a href="../../../p/a/s/Past_life_regression.html" title="Past life regression">regress</a> into a state of hatefulness. As an act of anger and revenge, he seeked out the human that took his master, and killed him.</p>
<p>This act gave Heruga a taste for human blood, and quickly became a legend in many towns. It also led to humans being afraid of Houndoom's, when many of them were not vicious. However, the mass panic Heruga created caused humans to make it a hobby to kill as many Houndoom as they could find. Heruga then made a vow that for every Houndoom he found dead, he would kill 100 humans. This extreme war between humans and Pokémon severed the bond between many trainers and their companions for some time.</p>
<p>However, Heruga soon stalked the man that would eventually be his downfall. This one human heard the story of the Evil Houndoom, only to meet the fabled beast himself. Heruga made an attack on the man, but he fought back with incredible strength. Heruga's sharp teeth cut his neck, but in the process, he grabbed the dog's own neck, and strangled him until death, only to meet his own demise shortly after.</p>
<p>After which time, Heruga's <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>, corrupted by darkness, left his mortal body, and was banished by <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> to Hell. There, he met a being of great power and darkness, known simply as "The Dark One." He kept Heruga as his pet and occasionally ordered him to reap dead souls of hateful individuals so that his dark powers could grow. This was temporarily put a stop to when <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mew.html" title="Mew">Mew</a>, the God of Life, found Heruga's wandering soul and purified him, then kept him in a pink bubble for a century.</p>
<p>The Dark One was angered that Mew took his companion, and attempted a failed counterattack, which left him severely beaten by Mew's power of good, however, he managed to destroy the bubble and reclaim Heruga once again. Mew was unable to intercept Heruga's soul before was brought back to Hell, the one place where she had no power, and eventually forgot about him many years later.</p>
<p>Once the heat died down, the badly weakened Dark One sent Heruga's re-corrupted soul to reap others for him, but he was unable to find any dark souls, because Mew had graced many humans with her presence, and changed their hateful ways after seeing her. The Dark One was livid, but he was powerless to do anything. If he were to face Mew in battle again, he would surely be defeated and Mew would most likely purify his soul as well.</p>
<p>The Dark One could not allow that to happen, so he waited for another 100 years before he sensed one human with darkness in their heart. He needed this human to carry out his bidding for him, and his plan was to use this human to not only kill Mew, and take her soul for darkness, then defeat the guardians of the world (one of whom was <a href="../../../r/a/y/Rayquaza.html" title="Rayquaza">Rayquaza</a>), and then destroy it. This human was named Latoshi, and The Dark One visited him one night when Mew was asleep on the other side of the world, giving him a chant of darkness locked in a scroll to unleash his dark powers which had been repressed inside him for so long.</p>
<p>Heruga was then appointed as Latoshi's bodyguard and fought for and alongside Latoshi through several battles. However, once Latoshi began to increase his powers to match his brother, he called upon Heruga less and less and he became more independent. Heruga then became more of a motivator for Latoshi, to help drive him toward his potential. Although he is never always around, Heruga still belongs to Latoshi and can therefore never leave him.</p>

<p>The "Pichu Twins" (not to be mistaken with the <b>Pichu Brothers</b>) are a duo of an inseperable brother and sister Pichu who are mostly wanderers. They first appear during Latoshi's Game with a niche for having impeccable timing when one or more of the main characters is in trouble. Their characteristics are mostly comical, and involve childish behavior most of the time.</p>
<p>Poka is the half-witted brother, who loves nothing more than to play and enjoy life and learn of its mysteries. He has taken a liking to Antoshi because of his similar nature and acceptance of the little Pichu's. His spontaneous nature often drives them to a new and wonderous place, the likes of which they haven't seen before.</p>
<p>Chika is the more serious-driven sister, who is usually embarassed to be seen with her brother, but cannot imagine living without him. She will sometimes strike her brother if he does something that gets on her nerves. She also enjoys Antoshi's company because of the attention he gives them, but she also has a bond with Latoshi through their somewhat similar serious natures.</p>
<p>Together, the Pichu Twins do everything. Eat, sleep, play, adventure, etc. They can also be a very dynamic duo in battle, and usually aid where the other needs help. Their electric power doesn't pack much power but they can do substantial damage to their enemy through their own quirkly antics, such as hiding under their opponents feet and tripping them. However, their most notable ability still lies within the power to drop in at the most opportune times.</p>
