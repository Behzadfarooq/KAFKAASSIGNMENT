<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of the ADL</span></h2>
<p><i>The ADL originally formed in response to the lynching of Leo Frank in Georgia on a trumped up murder charge of killing Mary Phagan. Ironically, the Frank case, which eventually led to the establishment of the Anti-Defamation League, also resulted in the revival of the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, then known as "the Knights of Mary Phagan".</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>This contradicts the official history of the ADL (link on article), which has the lynching happening in 1915 and the ADL forming in 1913. Does anyone have a source that contradicts the official history? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></dd>

<dd>Well, it <b>is</b> biased. The unconscious assumption of those that have contributed to it is that it is desirable and good to fight against anti-Semitism, against racism, against Jew-hatred, against Muslim-hatred, etc. What is the <i>specific</i> problem? The discussion of the ADL files, journalism and the court case? The overly brief discussion regarding the African National Congress? (I remember watching Nelson Madela on television state that he fully supported the PLO because they supported him.)

<dd>No, I am not a member of the ADL. I am wondering, however how you could have heard such an odd version of ADL membership rules! It is not the ADL, but rather Louis Farrakhan's anti-white, anti-Semitic, anti-woman <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a> that only allows male black Muslims to join as full members, and attend all meetings. Black Muslim females only have partial rights in this group; non-blacks are forbidden from joining at all. How can this fact about the Nation of Islam (which has been widely reported in the press and acknowledge by NOI members themselves) have been misinterpreted as the requirements of ADL membership? BTW, The ADL has Christian and Jewish, male and female, members. The fight against hatespeech is something that the ADL wants all people to join. They are the exact opposite of extremist hatespeech groups like the Naziz, the NOI, the Christian Identity Movement, etc. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADL is not a pro-Israel political activist group</span></h2>
<p>The article claims "With the decline of <i>overt</i> anti-Semitism in the U.S., the ADL has increasingly focused on pro-Israel activism." Really? Could someone provide a source? Because the great majority of what the ADL deals with has little or nothing to do with political support of the State of Israel. This claim seems like the paranoid claims seen on many Islamist and anti-Semitic websites, which promote the idea that Jews use the ADL to unduly influence the US government. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>Did the person who added this section ever actually read ADL bulletins and press releases, and go to meeting with ADL representatives? In actuality, they deal with <i>all</i> of the following subjects: Anti-Semitism, Black-Jewish Relations, Christian-Jewish Relations, Civil Rights Discrimination, Racism, Bigotry, Extremism, Hate Crimes, Nazis, Holocaust Denial ,Internet, Islamic Extremist groups, Israel and the Middle-East, Militias, Nation of Islam, Neo-Nazi and Skinhead groups, Religious Freedom, Church-State issues, Supreme Court issues, Terrorism, the United Nations and Vatican-Jewish Relations. In point of fact, support of the State of Israel is just one small part of what they deal with. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 22:38, Oct 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With the decline of <i>overt</i> anti-Semitism in the U.S., the ADL has increasingly focused on pro-Israel activism. In the view of many people this strategy means that the ADL has moved away from its original purpose as a defender of human dignity to become an overtly partisan political lobbying organisation.'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This content states dubious premises as though they were facts, then draws a very controversial conclusion based on those dubious premises. Even if this content were attributed to a noteworthy individual or organization, it would have no place in the introductory paragraph of an article about the ADL. The only exception would be if this questionable content could be attributed to the ADL itself. Even then, it would have to be qualified as the ADL's self-reflective POV. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 16:47, 22 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>... ok, both of those comments are good, NetEsq. I added a simple statement that the ADL also offers political support to Israel, which should be uncontroversial? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 21:15, 22 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Uncontroversial, perhaps, but also redundant. The previous sentence sets forth the ADL's opposition to "anti-Zionism," which I would presume to mean that the ADL supports Zionism, a political stance which I would presume to be identical with providing political support to Israel. Can you think of any other way that someone might interpret the ADL's pro-Zionist political stance? -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 21:47, 22 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, see <a href="http://www.adl.org/israel/advocacy/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/israel/advocacy/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The third point is Zionist: "Israel has a right to exist". But the other points: "Israel has demonstrated its sincere desire for peace" and "There is no excuse for Palestinian terrorism" - One can believe (or not) in those statements independantly of one's belief in the "right to exist". The ADL's support for Israel goes beyond its opposition to anti-Zionism.</p>
<p>Do you jackasses ever even read an ADL press release? Almost a full 1/3 of their press releases deal with Israel. They have an entire portion of their website dedicated to showing "pictures of Palestinian terrorism". Go to the website right now, www.adl.org, and tell me that ISRAEL isn't the first word that you see. I just took a brief look, and what do you know, ADL is discussing Israel in 4 of its 18 topics. "Americans continue to strongly support Israel" "Academics protest against Anti-Israel boycott" "The Anti-Israel Divestment Campaign" and "Financial Times' one-sided Approach" (For criticizing Israel). Not pro-israeli my ass.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zionism and anti-Zionism</span></h2>
<p>Additionally, supporting Zionism is a rather stronger thing than merely opposing anti-Zionism. Similarly, one can oppose anti-communism without supporting communism. Finally, "Zionism" and "anti-Zionism" are frequently misunderstood terms, and jargony. All in all, I don't think many people would make the leap from opposing anti-Zionism to, say, <a href="http://www.adl.org/israel/letter_stamford_advocate.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.adl.org/israel/letter_stamford_advocate.asp" rel="nofollow">this letter</a>. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 19:47, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>&lt;&lt; The ADL's support for Israel goes beyond its opposition to anti-Zionism. &gt;&gt;</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is a matter of opinion. As far as I can tell, taking a stand in opposition to anti-Zionism is -- for all practical purposes -- synonymous with providing political support for the state of Israel. In other words, can you name any organization that has as its stated purpose opposition to anti-Zionism that does not provide political support for Israel? Ultimately, what you are expressing is disagreement with the way that the ADL carries out its advocacy for the state of Israel, which is all well and good, but such criticism must be labeled as criticism and attributed to a noteworthy spokesperson or organization. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 22:16, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is a matter of opinion. Therefore, some readers will feel that "opposes anti-Zionism" is an accurate description of the ADL's activities in this arena. Others will feel that it is not, and for them the additional sentence is worthwhile. I'm mostly in it for the clarity - there <i>is</i> a string of logic from opposing anti-Zionism to supporting Israel, but it passes through a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_negative.html" title="Double negative">double negative</a>, and I think it's a bit of a mental stretch. --mrd</dd>

<dd>Leaving in the sentence is not problematic for me, and if it makes the article clearer, so much the better. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 22:16, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>&lt;&lt; Finally, "Zionism" and "anti-Zionism" are frequently misunderstood terms, and jargony. &gt;&gt;</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wholeheartedly disagree. Zionism is what Zionists do, and anti-Zionism is what anti-Zionists do. Moreover, if people wish to know what Zionism and/or anti-Zionism is, they can follow the hypertext links to the Wikipedia articles on those topics. To wit, the article on anti-Zionism clearly states: "Anti-Zionism is the opposition to the existence of the state of Israel as a Jewish 'state,' and the conceptual denial of the right for Jews to have their own state. It is the opposite of Zionism, which is the belief that Jewish people have a right to a nation state in the historical Land of Palestine."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not that clearly, because there's a neutrality dispute over the thing. Then you get folks like Chomsky - from his article - "He has further defined himself as a Zionist; although, he notes that his definition of Zionism is considered by most to be anti-Zionism these days; the result of what he perceives to have been a shift (since the 1940s) in the meaning of Zionism". Note that the ADL were around prior to that alleged shift. So again, a slight loss of clarity, compared to just saying what they do. --mrd</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No doubt there has been a semantic shift in re the use of the terms Zionism and anti-Zionism, just as there has been a shift in re the use of the terms conservative and liberal. These issues can be, should be, and are discussed in the articles on those topics. In the context of the introduction to this article, we need only say that the ADL fights anti-Zionism. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 22:16, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Apples and oranges. As a historical comparison, I know of no organization which had as its stated purpose opposition to anti-Maoism that did not provide political support for Chairman Mao's communist regime. If by opposing anti-communism you mean opposing McCarthyism, then your analogy falls apart completely. Virtually all opposition to McCarthyism was based on the premise that people were wrongly accused of being communists. Indeed, to this day, people who seek to become American citizens must disavow any loyalty to the communist party in their citizenship applications. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 21:00, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll chalk that up as a failed analogy then. --mrd</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, I've removed the link to anti-Zionism. That fixes the redundancy. In any case, I suspect that it's slightly suspect to state that the ADL was <i>set up</i> to fight anti-Zionism: cf the original charter, the political scene at the time, and the ADL's early actions. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 21:56, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The link to anti-Zionism was an informative and useful link, whereas the assertion that the ADL provides political support to the state of Israel results in a loss of information, something that the linguist Noam Chomsky would describe as a semantic shift unintentionally created by the elimination of a more broad term in favor of a redundant definition. As for why the ADL was set up, I changed the intro to read "that fights anti-Zionism," leaving the redundant definition regarding political support for Israel in place. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 22:16, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In a comment line while editing the article, Cadr writes "Removing weasel words (Chomsky is not acccused by "many" of anti-Semitism))" Cadr, this is just plain false. Among religious Jews, Chomsky is well known as an anti-Semite. A very large percent of Jews consider him a Jew-hater. You can claim that they are wrong, but you cannot claim that they do not exist!

<dd>Um, all Jews would not fully embrave the agenda of any one particular Jewish group! Similarly, all Christians would not fully embrace the agenda of <i>any</i> Christian group! In the real world, such unanimous agreement among millions of people is literally impossible. Many Jews don't even agree on what constitutes the Jewish religion; for example, most Orthodox Jews deny that Conservative Judaism is an authentic form of Judaism! But that is not for a Wikipedia article to decide. We can say this: Most American Jews view the ASL, in general, as mainstream; that is not the same as saying that most American Jews would agree with all the details of every one of its positions.

There was a shootout in front of the Meridian, Mississippi home of ADL official Meyer Davidson. This resulted in the death of Ainsworth and the serious wounding of her associate Thomas A. Tarrants III. Alton Wayne Roberts and six other Klansmen had already been convicted for federal civil rights violations in connection with their infamous murder of civil rights workers Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964. A police file report dated June 10, 1968 by Detective Luke Scarborough, confirms the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> report of the Ainsworth setup, namely that there was a three-way deal between the ADL, FBI, and local police in the matter, for which the ADL had provided the money.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, I have removed the above paragraph because it is really vague.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADL reports</span></h2>
<p>I note that the text I wrote on ADL's reports has been removed. ADL's reports are frequently quoted in the some of the press in sentences such as "25% antisemitic attitudes in country XXX". Therefore, press readership may have an interest in understanding what those studies really measure, and whether the results are actually representative of the phenomenon that the ADL claims to measure (that is, antisemitism).</p>
<p>One issue I raised, even akwardly, is that those questions may not actually measure what the ADL claims to be measuring (that is, antisemitism):</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, one justification for <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positive_discrimination.html" title="Positive discrimination">positive discrimination</a> is that ethnic or religious groups should be represented in the media, business etc... in roughly equal proportion to their representation in the general population. By the very same reasoning, some people may find the number of Jews (or whatever other religion) working in certain socially favored fields "excessive" if it greatly exceeded their proportion in the population, without being antisemitic per se.</li>
<li>Prime Minister <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a>, in effect, is calling for Jews in Europe to renounce their citizenship, and claims that this is their duty as Jews. Any person who believes what Prime Minister Sharon says therefore should deduce logically that Jews are less loyal to their country than to Israel. The only other logical deducation is that Prime Minister Sharon is mistaken or not sincere when he discusses the duties of Jews (a strong possibility, surely).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whoever told you this was lying to you. Prime Minister Sharon did not make this statement. It sounds like someone exagerrated a real quote, and then presented their exagerration totally out-of-context. He did make a statement to the Jews of France, who are suffering from a tremendous wave of anti-Semitism; he said that since they are in danger there (and they really do appear to be in some danger) that they should emigrate to the State of Israel. He has the right to ask, and the people he asks have the right to make up their own minds. In any case, Ariel Sharon doesn't speak for all Jews, let alone all Israelis! He is just one man. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:03, Oct 3, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I won't enter a long discussion on this. Suffices to say that the ADL publishes study that get media attention, but that, objectively speaking, these studies may not actually measure what they claim to measure, because they count as antisemitic answers that can be given in good faith and without any antisemitism. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 07:55, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Anti-semitic" is a POV term</span></h2>
<p>Like "anti-American", "anti-Semitic" is an inherently POV term which means very different things to different people (depending on background, political persuasian, etc.) It's a fact that there are a number of groups which the ADL considers anti-Semitic, and it is a fact that the ADL has campaigned against them. The wording in my edit does not in any way imply that the ADL are wrong to consider these groups anti-Semitic, and the reader is free to go to the Wikipedia pages on these groups for more information. This page is clearly not the place for a detailed discussion of Nazi/KKK/whoever attitudes towards Jews, still less the place for bald assertions that these groups were anti-Semitic without supporting evidence and without any proper discussion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Saying that "anti-Semitic" is an inherently POV term is only used by anti-Semites. Watch your attacks carefully. You are clearly pushing anti-Semitic views with your defense of the Nazis and KKK might not be anti-Semitic. That is only pushed by Holocaust-deniers, Christian Idenitity adherents and others who hate Jews. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:45, Sep 3, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am (honestly) quite outraged by your accusations. It seems to be impossible to make any kind of argument against one of your edits without suffering such ridiculous ad-homenim attacks. I am clearly not defending that Nazis or anyone else here, I'm just following the NPOV policy of Wikipedia. All of the people/groups on the list are uncontroversially anti-Semitic, but it is a principle of NPOV that opinions (however widely held) should be attributed and not promulgated by Wikipedia itself. It is sufficient for the purpose of this article to say that the ADL considers these groups to be anti-Semitic; it's completely unecessary for Wikipedia to take a stance on whether or not they actually are.</dd>

<dd>I'd like to emphasise again that you are making very serious charges against me by saying that I am anti-Semitic, and it is a mark of your immaturity, rudeness and arrogance that you feel able to make these charges without evidence extending beyond your paranoia of persecution and discrimination, and solely as a means to avoid engaging with my argument. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 23:46, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear SlimVirgin,</p>

<p>These links also have critical articles and quotes about the ADL by Jews, not just white nationalists. Your personal biases and emotional attachment to judaism is not allowing for fair and balanced spectrum of view points on the ADL</p>
<p>This is what defines Jewish Supremacism and Jewish Ethnocentrism, whether or not you are a Jew or a "lackey" (for a lack of a better word) and is unfair and biased to allow alternative view points. Allow all view points.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">On the purpose of external links</span></h3>
<p>This controversy seems to be possible because Wikipedia doesn't really have a strong policy on the meaning or use of external links -- when they are appropriate, what their role is in the article, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> states that they <i>should be high content, with information that is not found in the Wikipedia article. This restriction does not apply to sites used as references.</i> Meta, however, answers the question <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/When_should_I_link_externally" class="extiw" title="meta:When_should_I_link_externally">Meta:When should I link externally</a>? with <i>Not very often</i> and goes on to distinguish Wikipedia from link-farms, Web directories, and so forth.</p>
<p>The issue of usefulness of an external link is <i>orthogonal</i> to the issue of NPOV. An external link needs to be a reference to something broadly useful and informative on the subject. So if the purpose of referring to the opinions of anti-semites and neo-Nazis here is simply to document their views, then this should be done as an inline citation rather than an external link. Take, for instance, this entirely fictional example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The gay neo-Nazi organization Aryan <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_community.html" title="Bear community">Bears</a> of California coined the phrase "green Zionist moose-squirrels" to refer to the ADL, which has since caught on among other gay white-supremacist groups. <a href="http://aryanbears.example.org/adl.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://aryanbears.example.org/adl.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>One frequently-observed pattern not described in <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> is to link to an organization's Web site from the article describing that organization. This is, I suspect, chiefly done because the organization's Web site does a better job than anyone else can do in documenting the organization's own point of view. Thus, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> links to that group's Web site, just as this article links to the ADL.</p>
<p>We need to judge external links based on their <i>informativeness</i> as well as on NPOV. We would not want to link to badly-researched material simply out of a desire to present "all sides of the story". External links are there for the benefit of the reader, not the benefit of the sites or views linked to. It should be noted that an external link is <i>never</i> a replacement for adequate discussion of a relevant subject in Wikipedia. Presently, this article does not do a good enough job of describing the history of the ADL and its actions. Linking to other sites on <i>any</i> side of a controversy is no substitute for doing good research and writing factual material here in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 23:52, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The ADL is an american-jewish organization, as quoted by the California Courier, and other major newspapers worldwide <a href="http://lalettre.hayway.org/protected/en/communique00010103.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lalettre.hayway.org/protected/en/communique00010103.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<p>Molloy, the ADL has also acted or carried out research with regard to gay marriages, immigration issues, and Guantanamo, as examples. I've just read some material you've posted on various websites, some of it none too pleasant, and if you're telling the truth about your age, you're still in your teens, which has softened my feelings toward you a little. I'd urge you to start reading, because the people you're dealing with are misleading you, and you in turn are unwittingly misleading others. A good place to start is Primo Levi's <i>If This is a Man</i>, and then <i>The War Against the Jews: 1933-1945</i> by Lucy S. Dawidowicz.

<p>I don't see what the problem is with calling the ADL a Jewish organization. That calling it a Jewish organization is being advocated by an anti-semite is neither here nor there. It is a Jewish organization, and there's no reason not to have that in the first paragraph.

<p>Just to make an argument, I'll note that the ADL is connected to B'nai B'rith, a major Jewish organization, and that its principle purpose as defined by itself is to fight anti-semitism.

<dd>The ADL was set up by B'nai B'rith, but it has since moved away from it, and it's purpose is to fight anti-Semitism, racism, bigotry and various forms of political extremism. What, in your view, makes something a "Jewish" organization? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:51, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its slogan on their website is "to stop the defamation of the Jewish people...to secure justice and fair treatment for all." The mission statement on their website is "The immediate object of the League is to stop, by appeals to reason and conscience and, if necessary, by appeals to law, the defamation of the Jewish people." Every single description of it mentions anti-semitism first, and then very vague general "bigotry" as a problem second. It was clearly founded in the first place to oppose anti-semitism - its other activities are a corollary to this. It is an organization founded by Jews, still largely composed of Jews, whose primary purpose is to oppose anti-semitism, specifically. More broadly, it conceives itself as an opponent of racism and bigotry generally. But this is very, very clearly secondary. Now, I'm not necessarily sure that it should be described as a "Jewish organization", but I don't think that, as short-hand, this description is at all misleading or wrong. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:23, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John, the ADL is active in a number of areas other than fighting anti-Semitism, as can be seen from the <i>amicus curiae</i> briefs it has filed; I've posted a few of these below. Also, bear in mind that Molloy is not editing in good faith. He is a youth organizer of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_National_Front_8f45.html" title="New Zealand National Front">New Zealand National Front</a> and has posted anti-Semitic material on the Web. While I accept your argument above that authorial intention does not always matter, I argue that sometimes it does, and that this is one of those cases. Because it isn't clear what is meant by a Jewish organization or what adding that contributes to the article, an examination of the author's intention is helpful; and to judge by his editing pattern here and his online posts, his intentions are invariably anti-Semitic.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>Alexander v. Sandoval</i> (121 S. Ct. 1511 (2001)): The question at issue in this case was whether or not the Civil Rights Act of 1964 gives private citizens the right to challenge policies that have the effect of discriminating against minorities but not necessarily the intent to do so. As <i>amicus curiae</i>, ADL maintained that Title VII was intended to prevent discrimination without creating the burden of proving discriminatory intent. Unfortunately, the Court held that private citizens have a legal recourse only in instances of intentional discrimination.</li>
<li><i>Virginia v. Black</i> (2002): The question at issue in this case is Virginia's cross burning law. The statute outlaws the use of a burning cross as a means of threatening another person, but not for other purposes. ADL argues that a cross burning statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment if it punishes only criminal behavior such as intimidation and that the government has the clear power to outlaw serious threats of violence as criminal conduct is not immune from punishment merely because it is disguised as expressive activity.</li>
<li><i>Grutter v. Bolinger</i> (2003): Grutter v. Bollinger concerns the constitutionality of racial preferences in undergraduate and law school admissions system of the University of Michigan. While recognizing the fundamental value of diversity in higher education, ADL stated its opposition to the University of Michigan's admissions programs to achieve that goal.</li>
<li><i>Lawrence v. Texas</i> (2003): This case raises the twin questions whether Texas' Homosexual Conduct Law violates the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ADL joined with a number of other organizations to argue that the Texas law violates is unconstitutionally because it seeks . . . to punish and brand as criminals a class of citizens because of their sexual orientation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 19:06, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, I'm well aware that Molloy is a Nazi. I suppose I'll withdraw my objection, since I suppose you're right that a "Jewish American organization" is unclear in meaning. although I'll note that I certainly have not denied that the ADL is involved in things besides opposing anti-semitism. But it is certainly very clear that opposing anti-semitism is the principal declared purpose of the organization. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 21:36, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the anon editor's edit about Andrew Young: "In 1979 after receiving pressure created by harsh public criticism from the ADL, the first Black UN Ambassador, Andrew Young was forced to resign." He resigned because U.S. officials were not supposed to speak to the PLO (or at least that was the official position), and he did, though he said he did it with State Dept knowledge. If the ADL was particularly instrumental in forcing his resignation, that would probably need a reference. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:19, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the references, but they should go into the article, not here. Also, the references need to be reputable and must say what you're claiming they say; I think two of your sources indicate that the ADL expressed views on those issues but you're implying that Hilliard and McKinney lost <i>because of</i> the ADL. You would need a source that also says or implies that, or else you should reword the claim. I still couldn't see where the ADL is blamed for Andrew Young's resignation; sorry if I missed it. It's also best to link to the NYT for an NYT article rather than to a third-party website, if possible.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure about this sentence: "The ADL has engaged the Black supremacist group, the Nation of Islam in public discord since the 1984 U.S. Presidential campaign."

<p>According to Jayjg's edit summary, the African National Congress, the most well-recognized anti-apartheid organization in the world, is not really an anti-apartheid organization. Further, it's unclear to Jayjg how the fact that the ADL spied on the ANC and turned that information over to the apartheid South African government had a negative impact on black-jewish relations.

<p>Jayig and jpgordon for some odd reason would like to hide or CENSOR the facts that the ADL not only spied on but actively opposed the African National Congress and several other anti-apartheid organizations to the delight of the South African apartheid dictators. In response to the rediculous question of what this has to do with Black-Jewish relations (as if Jewish-Black relations are limited to U.S. borders), the ANC is a Black organization and this demonstrates the ADL's relationship with them.. the same way they related to the other Black organizations and leaders they labled anti-Semitic. --<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.195.html" title="User:64.12.116.195">64.12.116.195</a> 02:15, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The ADL labeled the predominantly Black organizations, ANC and NOI as anti-Semitic (not to mention illegally spying on and working against them). They labeled Rev.

Cynthia McKinney, they labeled the most popular Hip Hop mogul Russell Simmons a hypocrite, etc. These in and of themselves are clear and concise examples of a relationship with leaders and organizations that represent millions of Black people.--<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.200.html" title="User:205.188.116.200">205.188.116.200</a> 16:06, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Folks, this never happened. The ADL has never criticised <i>anyone</i> for supporting the rights of Palestinian Arabs.

<p>Check the record. Either RK is lying or he is grossly misinformed himself! ADL director Abraham Foxman in fact wrote an August 25, 2002 letter to the New York Times making the false accusation that "McKinney went out of her way to attack Israel, causing much pain to supporters of a beleaguered democracy." The fact is that McKinney merely advoacted a more even-handed approach in U.S. foreign policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. --JohnBlaz 21:07, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Jayig and jpgordon, this reference is "nonsensical" from your personal POV because you two are obviously very fond of the ADL and desire to present the best face for the organization. Be that as it may, Cynthia McKinney is considered a leader of and held in high esteem by a large amout of Blacks. Now you may choose to modify the paragragh to make it clear but there is no reason at all to delete it simply based your warm and fuzzy sentiments for the ADL. On another note, I believe Ms. McKinney directly referenced the ADL in response to their attacks on her and I can try to locate her quotes and post them to the article if you (or others reading this) think that is neccessary. --JohnBlaz 17:22, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Advocating for Israel is a major mission of the ADL. The League is stronly committed to defending Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state as a basic civil right of the Jewish people, and feels much criticism of Israel is motivated by anti-Semitism. Some anti-Zionists have charged that the ADL uses charges of anti-Semitism to chill critism of Isreal. The ADL feels that such allegations are often themselves anti-Semitic, and maintains that it only condmemns anti-Semitic attacks against Isreal and never tries to stifle reasonable criticism."</dd>

There are numerous people on the other side of this issue who have said that the ADL's collaboration with an overtly racist state calls into question its status as a civil rights organization. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 03:03, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Again - a fairly decent recounting of the facts, but only one side of the argument is presented. We hear Mr. Foxman's defence of the ADL's actions, but nobody's crticism is cited. As with the section above, many notable people have harshly criticized the ADL over this, and in particular pointed to their keeping files on the NAACP and other such groups as calling into question the ADL's status as a civil rights organization. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 03:03, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - I did read the whole section. And I did not see much of any crticism of the ADL. Rather I saw a fairly neutral recounting of the facts followed by Foxman's defence. I do feel that the facts speak for themselves in terms of making the ADL look bad, but that is not the same as criticism, which is needed in order to balance the defence argument. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 04:07, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst that is true, it is not helpful to just say it like that; you need to make constructive edits. You recently edited SlimVirgin's user page and mine, both times with accusations of pro-Jewish bias. This is true in her case, and false in mine. However, whether it is true or not, you need to make more constructive comments. Additionally, editing people's user pages is usually considered vandalism; you should make comments on talk pages. Someone is likely to block your IP address if you carry on like this. That would be a pity.

<dd>I agree - it's true that a number of the editors here have a very strong pro-Israel and Zionist bias. But slinging around phrases like "Jewish supremacist" is counter productive and just makes you look extreme. More over, such a claim is typically hard to verify. With jayjg for example, a quick look at his comments on various talk pages makes it clear that he does have a very strong pro-Israel bias. But extrapolating from that the he must be a "Jewish supremacist" is pure speculation. Many Zionist settlers (as with other settler-colonists) have felt a strong superiority over the Palestinians. But did they feel superior to all other peoples? Most Zionist Jews who I've known here in the U.S. didn't have any strong sense of supremacy over Christian or atheist Americans. Often they do have strong feelings of cultural pride and identity, but usually not anywhere near the level that it would be considered "supremacy." At any rate, it's most constructive to criticize the behavior in question, rather than making ungrounded speculation as to why. And like H.D. said, you should go ahead and sign up for a user account here so that you can participate in votes and such. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 16:45, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Jewish "tag-team" slings around overused and inaccurate terms like "white supremacist", "nazi" like it's a reflex, so on that basis alone it might be excused for them. Not one person who has slurred anon can back it up. The conduct of Jpgordon, jayjg, SlimVirgin can be observed and tracked on Wikipedia, and it exhibits classic [Supremacism], in this case: Jewish supremacism. Reread the definition before claiming it's not accurate. If anyone isn't helpful, it's posters like Jpgordon, SlimVirgin and jayjg that use slurs, bias and attempt censorship. 69.209.198.24 18:23 30 Apr 2003 (UTC) <b>(anon's unsigned sig added)</b></li>

<li>SlimVirgin is abusive to many Wikipedians and has been criticized for it by many others. It can be verified. I am not the first person SlimVirgin has abused. The anon IP person is new to Wikipedia and learning, and learning fast how it works. One criticism that the anon has observed is that a group can circumvent the 3R rule and do multiple reverts by acting as a gang of activists. That much I learned the first day. Too bad for Wikipedia. SlimVirgin, you are wrong. Nobody has bragged about an IP provider that assigns new IP addresses each time. That's just the way it occurs. SlimVirgin, if anyone is bragging, it is those who are so very intent on "banning" someone from contributing. Wikipedia is open to editing from all people. An ADL article is not the private domain of a handful of Jewish activists and polemicists. There exists criticism of the ADL from multiple groups in the USA and overseas. 69.209.198.24 18:23 30 Apr 2003 (UTC) <b>(anon's unsigned sig added)</b></li>

<dd>Also, I'd like to point out that having a strong POV and making sure it's accurately represented in articles in a NPOV way is not mutually exclusive from good faith editing, and in fact, the best articles are a collaboration of reasonable articulate editors who represent various and opposing POVs while adhering to policy.

We are working together on statements of what is known (what constitutes free human knowledge) about various subjects. Each of us individually benefits from this arrangement. It is difficult to single-handedly write the perfect article, but it becomes easier when working together. That in fact has been our repeated experience on Wikipedia."</li>

<p>"Wikipedia coverage is <b>heavily biased</b> by the sorts of people who want to contribute to it. This seems to be a perfectly legitimate concern. Certainly, Wikipedia coverage is patchy. It's easy to find examples of a really long article on one subject, whereas another, equally important subject, has a very short article.

We prefer (in most cases) that people just go in and make changes they deem necessary. This is very efficient; our efforts seem more constructive than those on similar projects (not to mention any names). Wikipedia is open content, released under the GNU Free Documentation License. Knowing this encourages people to contribute; they know it's a public project that everyone can use."</p>

<dd>Well if the list was used that way to defend a particular <b>edit</b> that violated NPOV policy, I would certainly agree it would be reverse ad hominem, since each edit must stand on its own merits and not on the merits of the editor who is saying it. I haven't seen Jayjg's list misused that way to defend a particular edit, have you? But it is certainly valid to point to the list when editors with opposing POVs (or anon vandals) try to paint him as a POV <b>editor</b>. The list stands as a defense of his record as an editor, not as an excuse to make edits that violate policy, and like I said, it's a great tool to help keep one's focus on being fair and balanced, no? As for "biased editors", no editor is free of bias, and anyone who claims to be an unbiased editor is fooling themselves. We all devote much of our efforts to making sure our POVs are represented fairly and accurately (hopefully in a NPOV way). Very few actually spend any time making sure their opponent's view is fairly and accurately represented, so I'm impressed with anyone who makes such noble efforts on behalf of their opponent, and for the sake of the readers. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 21:25, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)

Suffice it to say that while editors are certainly allowed to have bias (and indeed, all do), they should stick scrupulously to Wikipedia policy in their article edits. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:52, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to add to that: please note that <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> is Wikipedia policy. And for the love of all that is feline, please rely on evidence and diffs, rather than make broad accusations. I realize it's easier, but what is easier, more often than not, is not worthwhile. Try to be constructive and <i>concrete</i>: where, when, what, how, meaning that, etc. I find the Anons SHOUTS of Jewish Supremacy to be out of line and out of order for a Wikipedia talk page, and civil discourse in general. The only purpose they serve is an antagonistic one. More thoughtfulness, and a greater balance between the particular and the universal is called for. Note that I have not read this article, but I am nonetheless making this comment in the interest of goodfaith and collegial discourse. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:31, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>David Irving is a successful &amp; highly regarded historian, his works receiving five star reviews and critical acclaim time and time again. Your claim that David Irving is a non- credible source is totaly unfounded, and is no more than slander and lies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here are some neutral opinions on David Irvings works:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>One books...stand out from the vast literature of the Second World War, David Irving's Hitler's War - John Keegan, Editor of The Daily Telegraph</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A vivid portrait accompanied by much striking and original analysis... again Irving shows himself to be a master of documentation. - Professor John Erickson, Edinburgh</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>...his knowledge of World War Two is unparalleled....Moreover he writes in a clear and vivid style. - Sir Charles Gray, QC ( a judge )</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ignore the hate merchants of the Jewish lobby whose hatred for Irving blinds them. This is, like all of Irving's books, a thoroughly well researched and factual work of the highest order...David Irving has shown himself once again to be a historian of the highest quality...nobody can genuinely dispute his skills as a writer of history and historical biographies. - Amazon.com Review</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>No praise can be too high for his (Irving's) indefatigable scholarly industry...An exact and scrupulous historian... - Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A professional historian of noted distinction. - Amazon.com Review</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With acclaim like that, I see no reason to dismiss him as a non-credible source, your argument is flawed. All critisim of David Irving seems to come from Jewish origins, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the ADL, various Jewish lobby groups, so they obviously contain bias. - <a href="../../../a/t/s/User%7EATS_7d04.html" title="User:ATS">ATS</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>So he writes well. The quote about him in the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> article is sufficient:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian.</i></p>
</blockquote>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and from the same Judge Gray who praised his knowledge and his writing skills:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Irving has for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence; that for the same reasons he has portrayed Hitler in an unwarrantedly favourable light, principally in relation to his attitude towards and responsibility for the treatment of the Jews; that he is an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-semitic and racist and that he associates with right wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>So I can't imagine it's hard to comprehend why his opinions regarding any matters concerning Jews are not considered encyclopedic sources -- other than in articles about David Irving. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 18:14, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see the David Irving article has several links to his "Adl Profile", now is the ADL a reputable source? Let's review some neutral criticism:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The ADL is a pathetic fraud" - Frontpage Magazine <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18055" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frontpagemag.com/articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18055" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"You (The ADL) are not above twisting words of those you take to task in order to be able to deploy the usual semantic vituperatives" - Ralph Nader</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith (ADL) is some sort of branch of evil. They don't seem to be at the root of the corrupt tree, but they certainly produce corrupt fruit." - Jim Davidson</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The ADL, A History of Jewish Disinformation and Intimidation. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which describes itself as a civil rights organization, has been in the forefront of an ongoing attempt to label legitimate American-Arab and American-Muslim charitable, political, and informational organizations as fronts for terrorism. This attempt is part of a long-standing ADL policy of discrediting any individual or organization opposed to Israel or supportive of Palestinian rights. The ADL's strong political loyalty to Israel as well as its acknowledged ties to Israel's external intelligence agency in addition to its past practices of spreading disinformation and intimidating those who have spoken out against Israeli policies should however serve as a warning about the ADL and the nature of its claims. <a href="http://theunjustmedia.com/Jewish%20Zionists/ADL%20A%20History%20of%20Jewish%20Disinformation%20and%C2%A0%20Intimidation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://theunjustmedia.com/Jewish%20Zionists/ADL%20A%20History%20of%20Jewish%20Disinformation%20and%C2%A0%20Intimidation.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I found all that within 2 minutes with google, and there are many more accusations of biased character assasination out there. If you refuse to allow the David Irving link, a noted historian who has been targed by the adl, and who is a leading critic of their activities, I will remove all the links to the ADL from other articles, david duke, don black, etc, as we all know how biased and uncredible the ADL is. - <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolloy_0125.html" title="User:Molloy">Molloy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Let's see. An opinion column in Frontpage, primarily complaining that though the ADL is fast to act against right-wing anti-Semites, it doesn't speak out loudly against left-wing anti-Semites. Jim Davidson -- who's that? Oh, a columnist at David Irving's website; his opinion demonstrates precisely what? <a href="http://theunjustmedia.com" class="external free" title="http://theunjustmedia.com" rel="nofollow">http://theunjustmedia.com</a> -- man, have you actually READ that site? Oh, maybe you have; besides being viciously anti-Jewish, anti-American, and anti-Christian, it's also a purveyor of holocaust denial. One gets to consider the source. The strong consensus on Wikipedia is that David Irving is not an acceptable source (to put it mildly). If you wish to test the consensus, feel free. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 5 July 2005 05:53 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, no I just found all that via google. However, from reading this page, I can tell you that the general consensus here on Wikipedia is that the ADL is not a reputable source. If you read ADL's policy, you will see how hopelessly biased it is. <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolloy_0125.html" title="User:Molloy">Molloy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, the above quote from the Irving trial was from a witness called (and paid by) the opposition. <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolloy_0125.html" title="User:Molloy">Molloy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's no evidence that the consensus on Wikipedia is that the ADL is an unreliable source; quite the opposite. And the witness called was (unlike Irving) a respected academic. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 5 July 2005 15:07 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And he was paid an obscene ammount of money to say what he did. Jayjg, there is a large majority of editors that openly acknowledge that the ADL is a biased and un-encyclopedic source. Is there a way we can vote on this? <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolloy_0125.html" title="User:Molloy">Molloy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Y'know, it's really as simple as this.
