<p>"Anti-Semitism is hostility or violence toward people of Jewish ancestry. Although sometimes confused for hatred of all Semites?, The word "anti-Semitism" means specifically the hatred of Jews, and has never been used otherwise. "</p>
<p>I'm changing this for two reasons,</p>
<p>1) It is logically unneccassary, if it "has never been used otherwise" then there is no need for that statement as no one would think otherwise. However if it is used differently (even in peoples' heads) the statement is wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are confused. Jewish people and most Christians never use the term "anti-semite" to mean anything other than hatred of Jews. The Germans who invented and popularized this word also never used this word to mean anything different. However - and this is the point you have missed - anti-semitic people themselves deliberately mis-use this word, to try and confuse the issue. That deliberate misuse is what the entry is trying to clarify. The attempt at change confuses the issue further. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It has been used, I agree that 95% percent of the time that it is used to indicate anti-jewish activity, but there are a minority of users who do legitimately use it to represent opposition to semetic culture as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The changes you have made are signifcantly not NPOV</dd>

<p>2) It is used to mean people who are against speakers of semitic languages (including arabic), for instance in Gary Geddes book <i>Flying Blind</i> (1998). <a href="../../../i/m/r/User%7EImran_5e2c.html" title="User:Imran">Imran</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the term anti-semite does not, and has never meant, hatred of those people who speak semitic-derived languages. That's just silly. People just don't use the word to mean this! Just because one lone author mistakenly uses this word does not constitute rewriting an encyclopaedia entry. If that were any measure of anything, we'd have to say that no words have any set meaning, because just about every word is used by a tiny number of people in a sense that it was never meant to be used. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>The entry at one time stated: <i>In recent years some anti-Semites within the Arab world have tried to confuse the issue by rewriting the dictionary; they claim that since they themselves speak a Semitic language, they by definition cannot be anti-Semitic. Jewish, Christian and moderate Muslim groups (as well as English usage dictionaries) respond by saying that this is a just a word game. Anti-Semitism means solely hatred of Jews.</i></p>
<p>Can some provide evidence for this primarily,</p>
<p>1) Early sources for the use of "anti-semitism" as being inclusive of "anti-arab" by known anti-semitic arabs.</p>
<p>2) Evidence that it was for the purpose of confusion, and not for any of the reasons suggested in Joseph Telushkin "Why the Jews?: The Reasons for AntisemitismTalk:Anti-Semitism/archive", Moshe David's "World Jewry and the State of Israel" or the article "Antisemitism is Anti-Jewish" by Lorne Shipman and Dr. Karen Mock.</p>
<p>Also note that in Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) the definition is inclusive of anti-arab behaviour. Note that it is the _1913_ edition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the modern Webster (<a href="http://www.webster.com" class="external text" title="http://www.webster.com" rel="nofollow">Online Edition</a>), however, there's absolutely no ambiguity. This is particularly suspicious, considering the fact that the examples you bring are all very new. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Given that the version online is the Collegiate edition it is likely to give only the most common definition. The examples I chose are just the ones I could find from the internet, which by the nature of the internet are recent (last ten years) and are in electronic databases or are old enough to be out of copyright (i.e Webster 1913).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The last sentence is obviously inaccurate, see the cites I have given above.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You bring usage in 4 (related!) letters during the last couple of years, as opposed to world-wide usage for decades? Of course, language change, but that particular change is nothing more than a jargon pecularity that's most likely to disappear (if it hasn't already). Mentioning it as something significant is misleading, hence it's against NPOV. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what you mean "letters" only one was a cite of a letter, the others are all newspaper articles. More over as I said they are all in the last two months(chosen to indicate the word is in current use). The fact that this arguement exists makes it significant, I'm not opposed to saying that it isn't normally used in that sense, but to deny its existance in legitimate usage ins't NPOV.</dd>

<dd>The question is <b>which</b> usage. Claiming that some people have at one period used this term to signify something else than what dictionaries mention, does not mean that their usage is acceptable. They could just as well be not educated enough in the subject and inventing their own words for different concepts. For example, a lot of people use *<i>virii</i> as plural of <i>virus</i>. Now there isn't such a word *<i>virii</i>, the correct English plural being <i>viruses</i> (see <a href="http://www.perl.com/language/misc/virus.html" class="external text" title="http://www.perl.com/language/misc/virus.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a discussion). The fact that some people use *<i>virii</i> does nothing to even make it a word in general usage (as opposed to their own dialect of English); similarily, the fact that some people use anti-Semitism in a certain way does not mean that this way is acceptible for general usage. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>

<dd>Also, one more thing: it's curious that many of the sources you said originate in non-English speakers, and in particular Arabs. The fact that they've been prefering this usage or other may be interpreted not just as casual misuse, but intentional propaganda (see <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>). So I wouldn't treat their statements as any example of normative English usage. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>

<p>How about a compromise here. Something along the lines of: "Anti-Semitism is a term coined in 18?? to describe hatred of the Jewish people. While this is the meaning most associated with the term, it is also used occasionally/with increasing frequency to refer to other Semitic peoples, notably Arabs." Just a suggestion. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that would be simply untrue. In the vast majority of English contexts, anti-Semitism refers <i>solely</i> to the hatred of Jews, all other usages so far being either unsuccessful (unadopted) propaganda or inadquate understanding of the real meaning of the word (folk etymology). --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't make it untrue. The fact is that no matter what you, I, or anyone else thinks about it, the term seems to be undergoing some kind of evolution. That happens in language and in this case is worth noting. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></dd>

<dd>When studying language, one should distinguish between (1) random/deliberate changes for whatever reasons that were introduced by an individual or individuals and (2) changes, such as above, that persist, and propagate into common usage. I do not deny that (1) takes case (in this case, as a propaganda effort on behalf of the Arabs); I merely point out that it hasn't (and chances are that it won't) become (2). Until it does, I don't think it deserves to be incorporated, as it represent a piece of information of too little importance (exactly as I wooudln't be writing, for example, what sorts of associations people have when they hear the word "anti-Semitism"). --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Among the majority of English speakers, the the use of the word "Anti-Semitism" is not undergoing any significant form of evolution. Rather, the changes we see usually come from anti-Semitic people who <b>deliberately</b> mis-use this word in order to confuse the issue. That is certainly not NPOV (neutral point of view). The secondary fact that some non-anti-Semites on occasion mis-use this word, but this is meaningless. After all, <b>all</b> English words are occasionally mis-used like this. But do we rewrite encyclopaedia entries on hundreds of other topics because of such varying useage? No - it is only in the entry on anti-Semitism that some people do so, and that is precisely what some anti-Semites are trying to accomplish. Their entire goal is <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>, a deliberate project to rewrite parts of the dictionary in order to further their political goals. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't seen any quotable sources saying the word was being used purposefully to confuse, I list some source earlier which give several possible reasons, the most common being that the term anti-semitism is already popular and has strong negative conatation associated with it so it can be more easily adopted by other persecuted semites rather then them trying to coin a new word. Another source I've seen also attributes the use due to the majority of usage outside of Israel/USA being related to far right groups who do oppose semitic people as a group. --<a href="../../../i/m/r/User%7EImran_5e2c.html" title="User:Imran">Imran</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm very much a non-expert on this, but I don't see any need to "rewrite" the entry - all you need is a short note somewhere as Danny suggests saying that some people use the term to mean something other than the generally accepted definition. Of course you don't have to add such a comment to entries on other "misused" words, but some of the misuse here has been from quite prominent figures (the reason for their usage is irrelevant). Apart from anything else, I should think that somebody going to a dictionary and finding "Semite" to mean "a descendant of Shem or speaking a Semitic language such as Hebrew or Arabic" might logically conclude that an anti-semite is one against people speaking Hebrew or Arabic. Even if such a misuse is "wrong" and "deliberate" I don't see how ignoring it does anybody any favours. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">camembert</a></dd>

<dd>It is simply false - in general English usage, "anti-Semitism" means only the hatred of Jews. The possible misinterpretations are already well-represented in the article. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>

<dd>I don't know what you're saying is false, but I admit my last entry was somewhat incoherent, and having reread the article, I largely agree with you - I think there's little chance of people being left unclear as to the meaning of the phrase. But if it is demonstrably true that certain people are <i>trying</i> to change the meaning of the phrase (as RK suggests), shouldn't this be mentioned? Not as an evolution in the meaning of the phrase, but as an <i>attempt</i> by certain parties to change it. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">camembert</a></dd>

<dd>I have a house full of dictionaries and not a one contains a hint that anti-Semitism is anything but anti-Jewish. In fact, the unabridged <i>Webster's III</i>, which is strongly oriented towards definitions based on actual usage, gives not only "anti-Jewish", but "anti-Zionist" and "opposed to the state of Israel" as definitions. In the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, perhaps lagging a little, virtually all the citations refer to German anti-Semitism.</dd>

<dd>A quick Google search on "anti-Semitic anti-Arab" reveals a few instances of the "we're/they're Semites too" argument, usually stated pretty naively. It strikes me that this is not only sophistry, but actually harmful to the Arabs. Most of the Google hits refer to "anti-Semitic" and "anti-Arab" as two different kinds of prejudice against two kinds of people. It is unquestionably true that there is anti-Arab feeling, stereotypes in the media, hatred directed at "towelheads" and "camel jockeys", and worse. It greatly diminishes public discourse if these manifestations are not called what they are, anti-Arab, without any confusing talk about ancient languages. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> 08:25 Jul 29, 2002 (PDT)</dd>

I'm not saying such an incorrect use of the phrase should be presented as an acceptable or widely used alternative, any more than I'd suggest an article on xenophobia should say it's a jolly good idea, but it is something worth noting, I feel. But as I said, I'm far from an expert on this, and I'll let others argue about it from now on. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>Another attempt at compromise here: ""Anti-Semitism is a term coined in 18?? to describe hatred of the Jewish people. While this is the meaning most associated with the term, it has occasionally <i>been coopted by some</i> to refer to other Semitic peoples, notably Arabs." At some point, this can be explained in no more than a sentence (which is really no more than it is worth). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Here's how I think we should rephrase in order to remove opinion and just leave factually provable statements (things in brackets are just comments anf not intended to be part of the article),</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism is hostility or violence toward people of Jewish ancestry. Although sometimes used for hatred of all Semites?, The word "anti-Semitism" was coined specifically to refer to hatred of Jews. There are numerous forms of anti-Semitism, originating in different trends in human society, but usually having the common ground of xenophobia.</p>
<p>(It is obvious that in a lot of these cases people aren't confused and are using it deliberatly so I've dropped the word confuse)</p>
<p>(Next replacements for the last two paragraphs of etymology)</p>
<p>In recent decades some people have argued that the the term Anti-Semetism should be extended to cover all Semetic people and not just Jews, this arguement has failed to make any significant impact on popular usage, although proponents of the idea (including politician <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> and famous chess player <a href="../../../q/a/d/Qadhafi.html" title="Qadhafi">Qadhafi</a>) continue to use the word in this sense. Because of this debate many scholars now favour the unhyphenated term antisemetism to represent anti-jewish behaviour.</p>
<p>(I've removed any statement indicating the reasons why they want widen the definition of the term, after all you and I are not mind readers and can't tell their motivation, however I doubt that all the users are anti-semetic after all two of those quotes I gave came from journalists of Rupert Murdoch papers.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Clearly we must explain the usage of the <b>term</b>, as well as describing instances of the <b>practice</b>. The current etymology section looks pretty good. How about adding a usage section, pointing out that some people use <i>anti-semitism</i> one way and some people use it another? I think if we go pointing the finger of "co-opted", et al., we wind up adding more fuel to the POV fire. I think Uri is on the right track. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still opposed to seriously treating a "usage" with a political base, several dozen big (I saw Fischer's opinions described as "anti-Semitic" somewhere, and I don't think he meant the Arabs), as something deserving this sort of a review. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Fischer is very much anti-Jew, but I've seen nothing by him to suggest he is anti-Arab as well (although I certainly wouldn't put it past him) - I doubt in any case that that's the meaning he'd give to "anti-semetic". Since the paragraph at the end of the etymology section was added, I don't really have any objections to the article. (I didn't have many before, really; I think I misunderstood the argument, because it seemed to me that some were arguing for the removal of any reference to these "alternative" uses.) It could still do with a bit of tidying, I suppose (the last two paras of the etymology section seem to duplicate one another - I prefer the second to the first myself) and I think naming one or two people who have used "anti-semite" to include arabs would not go amiss. I'm for dropping "confused" in the opening para as well. And that really is the last I'm saying about it (probably)&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>If the term <i>anti-Semitism</i> was originally a euphemism, why not say,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some advocates insist that the term <i>anti-Semitism</i> should be taken literally, thus interpreting anti-Semitism as hostility toward everyone who is "Semitic" or speaks a Semitic language. Given this interpretation, they reason that to call Arab hatred of Jews and Israel "anti-Semitism" is a misnomer and conclude that there is no such thing as "Arab anti-Semitism". This usage is genarally considered non-standard.</dd>
