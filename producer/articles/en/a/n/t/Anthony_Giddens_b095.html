<p><b>Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens</b> (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>) is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociologist</a> who is renowned for his <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_structuration.html" title="Theory of structuration">theory of structuration</a> and his <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holism.html" title="Holism">holistic</a> view of modern <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">societies</a>. He is considered to be one of the most prominent modern contributors in the field of sociology, the author of at least 34 books, published in at least 29 languages, issuing on average more than one book every year. He has been described as Britain's best known social scientist since <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Maynard_Keynes_664d.html" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>.<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Three notable stages can be identified in his <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic.html" title="Academic">academic</a> life. The first one involved outlining a new vision of what sociology is, presenting a theoretical and methodological understanding of that field, based on a critical reinterpretation of the classics. His major publications of that era include <i>Capitalism and Modern Social Theory</i> (1971) and <i>New Rules of Sociological Method</i> (1976). In the second stage Giddens developed the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_structuration.html" title="Theory of structuration">theory of structuration</a>, an analysis of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_agency.html" title="Human agency">agency</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_structure.html" title="Social structure">structure</a>, in which primacy is granted to neither. His works of that period, like <i>Central Problems in Social Theory</i> (1979) and <i>The Constitution of Society</i> (1984) brought him international fame on the sociological arena. The most recent stage concerns <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">modernity</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a> and politics, especially the impact of modernity on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_life.html" title="Social life">social</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_life.html" title="Personal life">personal life</a>. This stage is reflected by his critique of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodernity.html" title="Postmodernity">postmodernity</a>, and discussions of a new "<a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">utopian</a>-realist"<sup id="_ref-Halpin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Halpin" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_way_%28centrism%29.html" title="Third way (centrism)">third way</a> in politics, visible in the <i>Consequence of Modernity</i> (1990), <i>Modernity and Self-Identity</i> (1991), <i>The Transformation of Intimacy</i> (1992), <i>Beyond Left and Right</i> (1994) and <i>The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy</i> (1998). Giddens' ambition is both to recast <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_theory.html" title="Social theory">social theory</a> and to re-examine our understanding of the development and trajectory of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">modernity</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Giddens_b095.html" title="Edit section: The nature of sociology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The nature of sociology</span></h3>
<p>Many <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociologist.html" title="Sociologist">sociologists</a> have wrestled with the question of what is the nature of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a>: <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>, <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89mile_Durkheim_ed0d.html" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Simmel_0b94.html" title="Georg Simmel">Georg Simmel</a> just to name a few. Before 1976, most of Giddens's writings offered critical commentary on a wide range of writers, schools and traditions. Giddens took a stance against the then-dominant <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functionalism.html" title="Functionalism">functionalism</a> (represented by <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talcott_Parsons_9206.html" title="Talcott Parsons">Talcott Parsons</a>, exponent of <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weber.html" title="Weber">Weber</a>), as well as criticizing <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionism.html" title="Evolutionism">evolutionism</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>. In <i>Capitalism and Modern Social Theory</i> (1971), he examined the work of Weber, Durkheim and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>, arguing that despite their different approaches each was concerned with the link between <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_life.html" title="Social life">social life</a>. Giddens emphasised the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_constructs.html" title="Social constructs">social constructs</a> of <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_%28sociology%29.html" title="Power (sociology)">power</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">modernity</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution.html" title="Institution">institutions</a>, defining sociology as "the study of social institutions brought into being by the industrial transformation of the past two or three centuries."</p>
<p>In <i>New Rules of Sociological Method</i> (1976) (the title of which alludes to Durkheim's <i>Rules of the Sociological Method</i> of 1895) Giddens attempted to explain 'how sociology should be done' and addressed a long-standing divide between those theorists who prioritise '<a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrosociology.html" title="Macrosociology">macro level</a>' studies of social life - looking at the 'big picture' of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">society</a> - and those who emphasise the '<a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsociology.html" title="Microsociology">micro level</a>' - what everyday life means to individuals. In <i>New Rules...</i> he noted that the functionalist approach, invented by Durkheim, treated society as a reality unto itself, not reducible to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individual.html" title="Individual">individuals</a>. He rejected Durkheim's <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociological_positivism.html" title="Sociological positivism">sociological positivism</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradigm.html" title="Paradigm">paradigm</a>, which attempted to identify laws which will predict how societies will operate, without looking at the meanings understood by individual actors in society. He contrasted Durkheim with Weber's approach - <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretative_sociology.html" title="Interpretative sociology">interpretative sociology</a> - focused on understanding <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_agency.html" title="Human agency">agency</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motivation.html" title="Motivation">motives</a> of individuals. Giddens is closer to Weber then Durkheim, but in his analysis he rejects both of those approaches, stating that while society is not a collective reality, nor should the individual be treated as the central <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_of_analysis.html" title="Unit of analysis">unit of analysis</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gauntlett_online_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gauntlett_online" title="">[3]</a></sup> "Society only has form, and that form only has effects on people, in so far as structure is produced and reproduced in what people do".<sup id="_ref-Gauntlett_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gauntlett" title="">[4]</a></sup> Rather he uses the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeneutic.html" title="Hermeneutic">hermeneutic</a> tradition (from interpretative sociology) to argue for the importance of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_agency.html" title="Human agency">agency</a> in sociological theory, claiming that human <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_actor.html" title="Social actor">social actors</a> are always to some degree knowledgeable about what they are doing. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_order.html" title="Social order">Social order</a> is therefore a result of some pre-planned <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_action.html" title="Social action">social actions</a>, not automatic evolutionary response. Sociologists, unlike <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_science.html" title="Natural science">natural scientists</a>, have to interpret a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_world.html" title="Social world">social world</a> which is already interpreted by the actors that inhabit it. Thus, there is a "<a href="../../../d/u/a/Duality_of_structure.html" title="Duality of structure">Duality of structure</a>", according to Giddens. With that he means that social practice, which is the principal unit of investigation, has both a structural and an agency-component: The structural environment constrains individual behaviour, but also makes it possible. He also notes the existence of a specific form of a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_cycle.html" title="Social cycle">social cycle</a>: once sociological concepts are formed, they filter back into everyday world and change the way people think. Because social actors are reflexive and monitor the ongoing flow of activities and structural conditions, they adapt their actions to their evolving understandings. As a result, social scientific knowledge of society will actually change human activities. Giddens calls this two-tiered, interpretive and dialectical relationship between social scientific knowledge and human practices the "<a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_hermeneutic.html" title="Double hermeneutic">double hermeneutic</a>".</p>
<p>Giddens also stressed the importance of power, which is means to ends, and hence is directly involved in the actions of every person. Power, the transformative capacity of people to change the social and material world, is closely shaped by <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time.html" title="Space-time">space-time</a>.<sup id="_ref-The_Nation-State_and_Violence_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Nation-State_and_Violence" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>New Rules...</i> Giddens specifically wrote<sup id="_ref-Mestrovic_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mestrovic" title="">[6]</a></sup> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sociology is not about a 'pre-given' universe of objects, the universe being constituted or produced by the active doings of subjects.</li>
<li>The production and reproduction of society thus has to be treated as a skilled performance on the part of its members.</li>
<li>The realm of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_agency.html" title="Human agency">human agency</a> is bounded. Men produce society, but they do so as historically located actors, and not under conditions of their own choosing.</li>
<li>Structures must be conceptualized not only as constraints upon human agency, but also as enablers.</li>
<li>Processes of structuration involve an interplay of meanings, norms and power.</li>
<li>The sociological observer cannot make social life available as 'phenomenon' for observation independently of drawing upon his knowledge of it as a resource whereby he constitutes it as a 'topic for investigation'.</li>
<li>Immersion in a form of life is the necessary and only means whereby an observer is able to generate such characterizations.</li>
<li>Sociological concepts thus obey a double hermeneutic.</li>
<li>In sum, the primary tasks of sociological analysis are the following: (1) The hermeneutic explication and mediation of divergent forms of life within descriptive <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalanguage.html" title="Metalanguage">metalanguages</a> of social science; (2) Explication of the production and reproduction of society as the accomplished outcome of human agency.</li>

<p>Social scientists generally agree that none of the early sociologists (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Simmel) provided satisfactory ways of connecting <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsociology.html" title="Microsociology">micro</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrosociology.html" title="Macrosociology">macro</a> analysis or <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_agency.html" title="Human agency">agency</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_structure.html" title="Social structure">structure</a>. It was in 1976 when Giddens published his <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontological</a> analysis in <i>New rules...</i> that this view shifted, elevating Giddens to the role of one of the most important figures in that debate.

He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions, and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_change.html" title="Social change">social change</a>. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_Stevens_4848.html" title="Wallace Stevens">Wallace Stevens</a> who suggests that we live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us, and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_theory.html" title="Social theory">social theory</a>, structure and agency are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression "<a href="../../../d/u/a/Duality_of_structure.html" title="Duality of structure">duality of structure</a>". At a basic level, this means that people make society, but are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately, as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions, while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure: the line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what. In Giddens own words (from <i>New rules...</i>)&#160;: "social structures are both constituted by human agency, and yet at the same time are the very medium of this constitution."<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> In this regard he defines structures as consisting of rules and resources involving human action: the rules constrain the actions, the resources make it possible. He also differentiates between systems and structures. Systems display structural properties but are not structures themselves. He notes in his article <i>Functionalism: apres la lutte</i> (1976) that "To examine the structuration of a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_system.html" title="Social system">social system</a> is to examine the modes whereby that system, through the application of generative rules and resources is produced and reproduced in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_interaction.html" title="Social interaction">social interaction</a>."<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> This process of structures (re)producing systems is called structuration. Systems here mean to Giddens "the situated activities of human agents"<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> (<i>The Constitution of Society.</i>) and "the patterning of social relations across <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time.html" title="Space-time">space-time</a>"<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup>(<a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibid.html" title="Ibid">ibid</a>.). Structures are then "...sets of rules and resources that individual actors draw upon in the practices that reproduce social systems’"<sup id="_ref-_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[7]</a></sup> (<i>Politics, Sociology and Social Theory</i>) and "systems of generative rules and sets, implicated in the articulation of social systems"<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> (<i>The Constitution of Society.</i>), existing virtually "out of time and out of space"<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> (<i>New rules....</i>). Structuration therefore means that relations that took shape in the structure, can exist "out of time and place": in other words, independent of the context in which they are created. An example is the relationship between a teacher and his student. When they come across each other in another context, say on the street, the hierarchy between them is still preserved. Time-space is thus one of the most distinctive features of the theory, vindicating Einstein's postulate that <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc%C2%B2.html" title="E=mc²">E=mc²</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Giddens writes that it refers to the ways duration extend into the constitution of social practices.</p>
<p>Structure can act as a constraint on action, but it also enables action by providing common frames of meaning. Consider the example of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>: structure of language is represented by the rules of <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syntax.html" title="Syntax">syntax</a> that rule out certain combinations of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">words</a>. But the structure also provides rules that allow new actions to occur, enabling us to create new, meaningful <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentence_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Sentence (linguistics)">sentences</a>. Structures should not be conceived as "simply placing constrains upon human agency, but as enabling."<sup id="_ref-Mestrovic_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mestrovic" title="">[6]</a></sup> (<i>New rules....</i>) Giddens suggests that structures (traditions, institutions, moral codes, and other sets of expectations - established ways of doing things) are generally quite stable, but can be changed, especially through the unintended consequences of action, when people start to ignore them, replace them, or reproduce them differently.</p>
<p>Thus, actors (agents) employ the social rules appropriate to their culture, ones that they have learned through <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialisation.html" title="Socialisation">socialisation</a> and experience. These rules together with the resources at their disposal are used in social interactions. Rules and resources employed in this manner are not <a href="../../../d/e/t/Deterministic.html" title="Deterministic">deterministic</a>, but are applied reflexively by knowledgeable actors, albeit that actors’ awareness may be limited to the specifics of their activities at any given time. Thus, the outcome of action is not totally predictable.</p>

<p>Structuration is very useful in synthesising <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsociology.html" title="Microsociology">micro</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrosociology.html" title="Macrosociology">macro</a> issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' internal sense of self and identity, consider the example of a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a>: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking only at the individual level as people did not spontaneously changed their minds about how to live; neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state. On a macro scale, one of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_organization.html" title="Social organization">social organizations</a> like a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multinational.html" title="Multinational">multinational</a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalist.html" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation.html" title="Corporation">corporations</a>, consider the example of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a>, which offers vast new opportunities for investment and development, but crises - like the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_financial_crisis.html" title="Asian financial crisis">Asian financial crisis</a> - can impact the entire world, spreading far outside the local setting in which they first developed, and last but not least directly influences individuals. A serious explanation of such issues must lie somewhere within the network of macro and micro forces. Thus these different levels, which have traditionally been treated quite separately by sociologists, are in fact revealed as having significant influence upon each other, and cannot really be understood if studied in isolation.</p>
<p>Giddens develops the example of a changes in our views regarding the marriage, noting that claiming that this change stems from micro or macro levels is nothing more than a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_cause_and_consequence.html" title="Circular cause and consequence">circular cause and consequence</a> <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_relationships.html" title="Social relationships">Social relationships</a> and visible <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">sexuality</a> (micro-level change) are associated with the decline of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> and the rise of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">rationality</a> (macro-level change), but also with changes in the laws relating to marriage and sexuality (macro), demand for which came from the level of everyday lives (micro). These, in turn, had been affected by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_movement.html" title="Social movement">social movements</a> of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_liberation.html" title="Women's liberation">women's liberation</a> and <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a> (macro); which themselves had grown out of dis-satisfactions within everyday life (micro).<sup id="_ref-Gaunlett_online_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gaunlett_online" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>All of this is increasingly tied in with <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a>, one of our main providers of information. Yet information and ideas from the media do not merely reflect the social world, then, but contribute to its shape, and are central to modern reflexivity.<sup id="_ref-Gaunlett_online_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gaunlett_online" title="">[8]</a></sup> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gauntlett_6c64.html" title="David Gauntlett">David Gauntlett</a> writes in <i>Modernity and Self-Identity</i> that: "The importance of the media in propagating many modern lifestyles should be obvious. [...] The range of lifestyles - or lifestyle ideals - offered by the media may be limited, but at the same time it is usually broader than those we would expect to just 'bump into' in everyday life. So the media in modernity offers possibilities and celebrates diversity, but also offers narrow interpretations of certain roles or lifestyles - depending where you look.".<sup id="_ref-Gauntlett_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gauntlett" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another example explored by Giddens is the emergence of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_love.html" title="Romantic love">romantic love</a>, which Giddens (<i>The Transformation of Intimacy</i>) links with the rise of the 'narrative of the self' type of self-identity: "Romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life."<sup id="_ref-Shumway_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shumway" title="">[9]</a></sup> Although <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_sex.html" title="History of sex">history of sex</a> clearly demonstrates that passion and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a> are not modern phenomena, the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discourse.html" title="Discourse">discourse</a> of romantic love is said to have developed from the late eighteenth century (something that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Foucault_f02b.html" title="Michael Foucault">Michael Foucault</a> also noted in his <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_of_Sexuality_4865.html" title="The History of Sexuality">History of Sexuality</a></i>). <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, the 18th and 19th century European macro-level <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_movement.html" title="Cultural movement">cultural movement</a> is responsible for the emergence of the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> - a relatively early form of mass media. The growing <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy.html" title="Literacy">literacy</a> and popularity of novels fed back into the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream.html" title="Mainstream">mainstream</a> lifestyle and the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_novel.html" title="Romance novel">romance novel</a> proliferated the stories of ideal romantic life narratives on a micro-level, giving the romantic love an important and recognised role in the marriage-type relationship.</p>
<p>Consider also the transformation of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intimacy.html" title="Intimacy">intimacy</a>. Giddens asserts that intimate <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_relationship.html" title="Social relationship">social relationships</a> have become '<a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratization.html" title="Democratization">democratised</a>', so that the bond between partners – even within a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> – has little to do with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but is based on the internal understanding between two people – a <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trust_%28sociology%29.html" title="Trust (sociology)">trusting</a> bond based on <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotional</a> communication. Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved. Thus we have 'a democracy of the emotions in everyday life' (Runaway World, 1999).<sup id="_ref-Gauntlett_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gauntlett" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Inevitably, Giddens concludes that all <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_change.html" title="Social change">social change</a> stems from a mixture of micro- and macro-level forces.</p>

<p>Giddens says that in the post-traditional order, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-identity.html" title="Self-identity">self-identity</a> is not inherited or static; rather, it becomes a reflexive project – an endeavour that we continuously work and reflect on. It is not a set of observable characteristics of a moment, but becomes an account of a person's life. Giddens writes (Modernity and Self-Identity: 54) that "A person's identity is not to be found in behaviour, nor - important though this is - in the reactions of others, but in the capacity to keep a particular narrative going. The individual's biography, if she is to maintain regular interaction with others in the day-to-day world, cannot be wholly fictive. It must continually integrate events which occur in the external world, and sort them into the ongoing 'story' about the self.".<sup id="_ref-Gaunlett_online_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gaunlett_online" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Gauntlett_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gauntlett" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>More than ever before we have access to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a> that allows us to reflect on the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cause.html" title="Cause">causes</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consequence.html" title="Consequence">consequences</a> of our actions. At the same time we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts. We create, maintain and revise a set of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biographical</a> <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrative.html" title="Narrative">narratives</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_role.html" title="Social role">social roles</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifestyle.html" title="Lifestyle">lifestyles</a> – the story of who we are, and how we came to be where we are now. We are increasingly free to choose what we want to do and who we want to be (although Giddens contends that <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">wealth</a> gives access to more options). But increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one's self-fulfilment, and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a> of which we are increasingly aware (what Giddens sums up as "manufacturing uncertainty"). While in earlier, traditional societies we would be provided with that narrative and social role, in the post-traditional society we are usually forced to create one ourselves. As Giddens (Modernity and Self-Identity: 70) puts it: "What to do? How to act? Who to be? These are focal questions for everyone living in circumstances of late modernity - and ones which, on some level or another, all of us answer, either discursively or through day-to-day social behaviour."<sup id="_ref-Gauntlett_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gauntlett" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Giddens' recent work has been concerned with the question of what is characteristic about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_institution.html" title="Social institution">social institutions</a> in various points of history. Giddens agrees that there are very specific changes that mark our current era, but argues that it is not a "post-modern era", but just a "radicalised modernity era" (similar to <a href="../../../z/y/g/Zygmunt_Bauman_6948.html" title="Zygmunt Bauman">Zygmunt Bauman</a>'s concept of <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_modernity.html" title="Liquid modernity">liquid modernity</a>), produced by the extension of the same social forces that shaped the previous age. Giddens nonetheless differentiates between pre-modern, modern and late (high) modern societies and doesn't dispute that important changes have occurred but takes a neutral stance towards those changes, saying that it offers both unprecedented opportunities and unparalleled dangers. He also stresses that we haven't really gone beyond modernity. It's just a developed, detraditionalized, radicalised, 'late' modernity. Thus the phenomena that some have called 'postmodern' are to Giddens nothing more than the most extreme instances of a developed modernity.<sup id="_ref-Gaunlett_online_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gaunlett_online" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Giddens concentrates on a contrast between traditional (pre-modern) <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> and post-traditional (modern) culture. In traditional societies, individual actions are not matters that have to be extensively considered and thought about, because available choices are already predetermined (by the customs, traditions, etc.). In contrast, in post-traditional society people (actors, agents) are much less concerned with the precedents set by previous generations, and options are at least as open as the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_opinion.html" title="Public opinion">public opinion</a> will allow. Therefore individual actions now require much more analysis and thought before they are taken. Society becomes much more <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reflexivity_%28social_theory%29.html" title="Reflexivity (social theory)">reflexive</a> and aware, something Giddens is fascinated with, illustrating it with examples ranging from formal government at one end of the scale to intimate sexual relationships at the other. Giddens examines three realms in particular: the experience of <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_%28social_science%29.html" title="Identity (social science)">identity</a>, connections of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intimacy.html" title="Intimacy">intimacy</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_institution.html" title="Political institution">political institutions</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gaunlett_online_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gaunlett_online" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The most defining property of modernity, according to Giddens, is that we are disembedded from <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a>. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a>. In pre-modern societies, it were the elders who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expert_systems.html" title="Expert systems">expert systems</a>. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, there is always a heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a '<a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggernaut.html" title="Juggernaut">juggernaut</a>': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut traveling through space.</p>

<p>Humanity tries to steer it, but as long as the modern institutions, with all their uncertainty, endure, we will never be able to influence its course. The uncertainty can however be managed, by 'reembedding' the expert-systems into the structures which we are accustomed to. An example of this is <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, who uses expert-systems to guide people in their lives, but gives them a recognizability by being an ordinary woman, and not just a doctor in a white suit.</p>
<p>Another characteristic is enhanced reflexivity, both at the level of individuals and at the level of institutions. The latter requires an explanation: in modern institutions there is always a component which studies the institutions themselves for the purpose of enhancing its effectiveness. This enhanced reflexivity was enabled as <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> became increasingly abstract with the transition from pre-modern to modern societies, becoming institutionalised into <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">universities</a>. It is also in this regard that Giddens talks about "double hermeneutica": every action has two interpretations. The one is from the actor himself, the other of the investigator who tries to give meaning to the action he is observing. The actor who performs the action, however, can get to know the interpretation of the investigator, and therefore change his own interpretation, or his further line of action. This is the reason that positive science, according to Giddens<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientist don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and negate that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more incertitude there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut even gets more steerless.</p>
<p>In <i>A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism</i> Giddens concludes<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> that:</p>

</ol>
<p>Reflexive modernity and radicalised modernity are another important concepts Giddens introduces in his studies of modernity, as an alternative to the conception of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodernity.html" title="Postmodernity">postmodernity</a>. "The reflexivity of modern social life consists in the fact that social practices are constantly examined and reformed in the light of incoming information about those very practices, thus constitutively altering their character" (<i>The Consequences of Modernity</i>).<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> But contrary to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> expectations, that increased knowledge did not lead to peace and certitude, instead the intensification of individual and institutional reflexivity in the absence of sure foundations for knowledge has a chronic propensity to manufacture uncertainty and have resulted in a 'radicalised modernity'.<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Giddens_b095.html" title="Edit section: The Third Way">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Third Way</span></h3>
<p>In the age of late and reflexive modernity and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_scarcity.html" title="Post scarcity">post scarcity</a> <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy.html" title="Economy">economy</a> the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">political science</a> is being transformed. Giddens notes that there is a possibility that "life politics" (the politics of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-actualisation.html" title="Self-actualisation">self-actualisation</a>) may become more visible than "emancipatory politics" (the politics of <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inequality.html" title="Inequality">inequality</a>); that new <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_movement.html" title="Social movement">social movements</a> may lead to more social change than <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political parties</a>; and that the reflexive project of the self and changes in gender and sexual relations may lead the way, via the "democratisation of democracy", to a new era of <a href="../../../j/%C3%BC/r/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas_115d.html" title="Jürgen Habermas">Habermasian</a> "dialogic democracy" in which differences are settled, and practices ordered, through <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discourse.html" title="Discourse">discourse</a> rather than violence or the commands of authority.<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Giddens, relying on his past familiar themes of reflexivity and system integration, which places people into new relations of trust and dependency with each other and their governments, argues that the political concepts of 'left' and 'right' are now breaking down, as a result of many factors, most centrally the absence of a clear alternative to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and the eclipse of political opportunities based on the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">social class</a> in favour of those based on <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifestyle.html" title="Lifestyle">lifestyle</a> choices.</p>
<p>In his most recent works Giddens moves away from explaining how things are to the more demanding attempt of advocacy about how they ought to be. In "Beyond Left and Right" (1994) Giddens criticizes the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_socialism.html" title="Market socialism">market socialism</a>, and constructs a six point framework for a reconstituted <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_politics.html" title="Radical politics">radical politics</a>:<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>repair damaged <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity_%28sociology%29.html" title="Solidarity (sociology)">solidarities</a></li>
<li>recognize the centrality of life politics</li>
<li>accept that active trust implies generative politics</li>
<li>embrace dialogic democracy</li>
<li>rethink the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_state.html" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a></li>
<li>confront violence</li>
</ol>
<p>The "The Third Way" (1998) provides not only the framework within which the 'third way' is justified, but a broad set of policy proposals aimed at what Giddens refers to as the 'progressive centre-left' in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_politics.html" title="British politics">British politics</a>. According to Giddens himself, "the overall aim of third way politics should be to help citizens pilot their way through the major revolutions of our time: <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalisation.html" title="Globalisation">globalisation</a>, transformations in personal life and our relationship to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">nature</a>".<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Giddens remains fairly <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimistic.html" title="Optimistic">optimistic</a> about the future of humanity. "There is no single agent, group or movement that, as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>'s <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletariat.html" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a> was supposed to do, can carry the hopes of humanity, but there are many points of political engagement which offer good cause for optimism".<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> (<i>Beyond Left and Right</i>) Giddens discards the possibility of a single, comprehensive, all-connecting <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a> or political programme. Instead he advocates going after the 'small pictures', ones people can directly affect at their home, workplace or local community. This, to Giddens, is a difference between pointless <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopianism.html" title="Utopianism">utopianism</a> and useful utopian realism,<sup id="_ref-Halpin_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Halpin" title="">[2]</a></sup> which he defines as envisaging "alternative futures whose very propagation might help them be realised".<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup> (<i>The Consequences of Modernity</i>). By 'utopian' he means that this is something new and extraordinary, and by 'realistic' he stresses that this idea is rooted in the existing social processes and can be viewed as their simple extrapolation. Such a future has at its centre a more <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialization.html" title="Socialization">socialized</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demilitarization.html" title="Demilitarization">demilitarised</a> and planetary-caring global <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_order.html" title="World order">world order</a> variously articulated within <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_movement.html" title="Green movement">green</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_movement.html" title="Women's movement">women's</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_movement.html" title="Peace movement">peace movements</a>, and within the wider <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_movement.html" title="Democratic movement">democratic movement</a>.<sup id="_ref-Blackwell_16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blackwell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
