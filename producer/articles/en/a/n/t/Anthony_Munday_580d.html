<p>He was once thought to have been born in 1553, because the monument to him in the church of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Stephen_Coleman_Street_7ad3.html" title="St. Stephen Coleman Street">St. Stephen Coleman Street</a>, stated that at the time of his death he was eighty years old. From the inscription we likewise learn that he was "a citizen and draper". In 1589 he was living in the city, and dates his translation of "The History of Palmendos" "from my house in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cripplegate.html" title="Cripplegate">Cripplegate</a>". That he carried on the business of a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draper.html" title="Draper">draper</a>, or had some connection with the trade as late as 1613, may be gathered from the following passage at the close of "The Triumphs of Truth," the city pageant for that year, by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Middleton_4ab2.html" title="Thomas Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a>: "The fire-work being made by Maister Humphrey Nichols, a man excellent in his art; and the whole work and body of the Triumph, with all the proper beauties of the workmanship, most artfully and faithfully performed by John Grinkin; and those furnished with apparel and porters by Anthony Munday, Gentleman." The style of "gentleman" was probably given to him with reference to the productions of his pen.</p>

<p>He had probably already appeared on the stage as an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a> when in 1576 he was bound apprenticed for eight years to John Allde, the stationer, an apprenticeship from which he was soon released. By 1578 he was in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. In the opening lines of his <i>English Romayne Lyfe</i> (1582) he states that he went abroad solely in order to see strange countries and to learn foreign languages; but he may have been a spy sent to report on the English Jesuit College in Rome, or a journalist who meant to make literary capital out of the designs of the English Catholics resident in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. He says that he and his companion, Thomas Nowell, were robbed of all they possessed on the road from <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> to <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiens.html" title="Amiens">Amiens</a>, where they were helped by an English priest, who entrusted them with letters to be delivered in <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reims.html" title="Reims">Reims</a>. These they handed over to the English ambassador in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Under a false name, as the son of a well-known English Catholic, Munday gained recommendations which secured his reception at the English College in Rome. He was treated with special kindness by the rector, Dr. Morris, for the sake of his supposed father. He gives a detailed account of the routine of the place, of the dispute between the English and Welsh students, of the carnival at Rome, and finally of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Atkins_2163.html" title="Richard Atkins">Richard Atkins</a>. He returned to England in 1578-1579, and may have become an actor again, with the Earl of Oxford's company.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Munday_580d.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Popish Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Popish Years</span></h3>
<p>In a Catholic tract entitled <i>A True Reporte of the death of M. Campion</i> (1581), Munday is accused of having deceived his master Allde, a charge which he refuted by publishing Allde's signed declaration to the contrary, and he is also said to have been hissed off the stage. Whatever might have been Munday's previous life, in <a href="../../../1/5/8/1582.html" title="1582">1582</a> he was placed in an unenviable position. He had been instrumental in detecting the Popish Conspiracy in that year, which aroused the bitter animosity of the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuits</a>.</p>
<p>Munday admits in his own account of <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Campion_5bff.html" title="Edmund Campion">Edmund Campion</a> and his confederates, that he was "some time the Pope's scholar on the Seminary of Rome," but always denied that he was a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. Perhaps the most curious tract upon this subject is that entitled, "A breefe and true reporte of the Execution of certaine Traytours at Tiborne the xxviii, and xxx dayes of May 1582. Gathered by A.M. who was there present." He signs the Dedication at length "A. Munday," and mentions that he had been a witness against some of the offenders. The persons he saw executed were, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Ford_ed33.html" title="Thomas Ford">Thomas Ford</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Shert_3a92.html" title="John Shert">John Shert</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Johnson_%28martyr%29_9e51.html" title="Robert Johnson (martyr)">Robert Johnson</a>, William Filbie, Luke Kirbie, Lawrance Richardson, and Thomas Cottom; and he seems to have been publicly employed to confute them at the foot of the gallows, and to convince the populace that they were traitors and Papists, denying the supremacy of Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>. He had a long dispute with Kirbie upon matters of fact, and, according to his own showing, was guilty while abroad, at least of a little duplicity. He noticed having seen Captain Stukely at Rome, who was killed at the Battle of Alcazar in 1578. In the conclusion he promises his "English Romaine Lyfe" "so soon as it can be printed," in which he purposes to disclose the "Romish and Sathanical juglings," of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>About this time he wrote five anti-popish pamphlets, among them the savage and bigoted tract entitled <i>A Discoverie of Edmund Campion and his Confederates--whereto is added the execution of Edmund Campion, Raphe Shenvin, and Alexander Brian</i>, the first part of which was read aloud from the scaffold at Campion's death in December 1581.</p>

<p>His political services against the Catholics were rewarded in 1584 by the post of messenger to her Majesty's chamber, and from this time he seems to have given up acting. In 1598-1599, when he travelled with the Earl of Pembroke's men in the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>, it was in the capacity of playwright to rewrite old plays. He devoted 'himself to writing for the booksellers and the theatres, compiling religious works, translating <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadis_de_Gaula_9d97.html" title="Amadis de Gaula">Amadis de Gaule</a></i> and other French romances, and putting words to popular airs. He was the chief pageant-writer for the City from 1605.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Munday_580d.html" title="Edit section: His Works">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">His Works</span></h2>
<p>At what date he acquired the title of "poet to the city" is not known; he had certainly been previously employed in a similar capacity, as <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> introduces him in that capacity in "The Case is Altered," which was written in 1598 or 1599. He ridicules upon <i>Don Antonio Balladino</i> (as he calls Munday), and Middleton mentions him in his "Triumphs of Truth".</p>
<p>Munday was a very voluminous author in verse and prose, original and translated, and is certainly to be reckoned among the predecessors of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> in dramatic composition. One of his earliest works was "The Mirror of Mutability," 1579, when he was in his 26th year: he dedicated it to the Earl of Oxford, and perhaps then belonged to the company of players of that nobleman, to which he had again attached himself on his return from Italy. The Council Registers show that this nobleman had a company of players under his protection in 1575. Munday's "Banquet of Dainty Conceits" was printed in 1588, and we particularise it, because it was unknown to Ames, Herbert, and Ritson. Catalogues and specimens of his other undramatic works may be found in "Bibliographia Poetica," "Censura Literaria," "British Bibliographer," etc.</p>
<p>Nearly all the existing information respecting Anthony Munday's dramatic works is derived from <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Henslowe_fdb3.html" title="Philip Henslowe">Henslowe</a>'s papers. At what period he began to write for the stage cannot be ascertained: the earliest date in these manuscripts connected with his name is December 1597; but as he was perhaps a member of the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_de_Vere%2C_17th_Earl_of_Oxford_a5f3.html" title="Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford">Earl of Oxford</a>'s theatrical company before he went abroad, and as he was certainly at Rome prior to 1578, it is likely that he was very early the author of theatrical performances. In the old catalogues, and in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_Langbaine_fc81.html" title="Gerard Langbaine">Langbaine</a>'s "Momus Triumphans," 1688, a piece called "Fidele and Fortunatus" is mentioned, and such a play was entered at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stationers%27_Hall_29b8.html" title="Stationers' Hall">Stationers' Hall</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/8/1584.html" title="1584">1584</a>. There is little doubt that this is the same production, two copies of which have been discovered, with the running title of "Two Italian Gentlemen," that being the second title to "Fidele and Fortunatus" in the Register. Both copies are without title-pages; but to one of them is prefixed a dedication signed A.M., and we may with tolerable certainty conclude that Anthony Munday was the author or translator of it, and that it was printed about the date of its entry on the Stationers' Books. It is pretty evident that the play now reprinted from the only known edition in 1601 was written considerably before 1597-8, the year when it is first noticed in the accounts of the proprietor of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rose_%28theatre%29_a86d.html" title="The Rose (theatre)">Rose</a>. The story is treated with a simplicity bordering upon rudeness, and historical facts are perverted just as suited the purpose of the writer. Whether we consider it as contemporary with, or preceding the productions of the same class by Shakespeare, it is a relic of high interest, and nearly all the sylvan portions of the play, in which <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a> and his "merry men" are engaged, are of no ordinary beauty. Some of the serious scenes are also extremely well written, and the blank-verse, interpersed with rhymes, as was usual in our earlier dramas, by no means inharmonious.</p>
