<p>Plugging in "Eco Codding" to Wikipedia, I get no results other than this page. Therefore, I've removed it. Perhaps it was just mispelled, but I can't determine what the correct spelling is, if so. --<a href="../../../d/y/f/User%7EDyfrgi_6693.html" title="User:Dyfrgi">Dyfrgi</a> 19:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="../../../p/j/t/User%7EPJTraill_4845.html" title="User:PJTraill">PJTraill</a> 22:01, 16 July 2006 (UTC) — I'm not entirely happy, as the (always unsatisfied) link was originally "cryptic code", then to "eco code", then "eco codding" (coding?). And the description ("<i>Using abbreviatures in variables or functions instead of complete (self-descriptive) names</i>") does describe a recognisably bad solution to a problem, though it could be corrected and tightened up as "<i>Using abbreviations instead of complete (self-descriptive) names</i>". But I could not find anything useful under those names by googling with <code>antipattern OR anti-pattern OR "anti pattern"</code>. In fact I googled several things (ee.g. "cryptic", "naming", "name", "abbreviation") with that and got nothing conclusive (but plenty of quotes from versions of this article). I think the anti-pattern tries to solve two problems attributed to excessive code size:
<ul>
<li>difficulty of producing code (better solutions: learn to type, use an IDE, cut and paste the name),</li>
<li>difficulty of understanding code, specifically: of appreciating the overall structure at a glance. This is more plausible, and an article on when this is reasonable would be useful. But perhaps a <i>pattern</i> for naming would be even more useful.</li>

<dd>After looking over policy and noticing a category called <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-patterns_4541.html" title="Category:Anti-patterns">Anti-patterns</a>, I think that the category serves a pretty good purpose already and a footer box is not required.

<dd>By now, the list of anti-patterns has acquired extra value, in the form of the brief explanations.

<p>Double-Checked Locking is not a anti-pattern. It can be made to work correctly(even with multi-processors). It's not because someone doesnt know how to use something, that it should mean it is an anti-pattern.</p>

<p>I added this one after discovering a VERY nasty problem with a hand-made C++ object pool that was supposed to be a wrapper for ADO transactions.</p>
<p>The nasty little creature would run a transaction that did not commit, and the object would return to the pool while still in a transaction state from a previous use. Eventually as the object is reused, the instance would die and a HUGE rollback would occur when the object was torn down or errored out.</p>

<p>What is the fenceposts problem doing here? This is clearly a bug, and has nothing to do with patterns. Even the best programmers, coding wonderful pattern-based code, run into trouble with fenceposts. -- 84.159.227.16 09:46, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../p/j/t/User%7EPJTraill_4845.html" title="User:PJTraill">PJTraill</a> 13:25, 28 November 2005 (UTC) Surely this is a coding anti-pattern, whereas most are design anti-patterns, and a few are management etc.
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you don't understand the difference between an anti-pattern and a bug. An anti-pattern is a flawed design scheme which may result in code which is functionally correct but difficult to maintain or likely to introduce bugs in the future. A bug, like fenceposts, is something which is functionally incorrect but not the result of a bad design. At best you could argue that the prevalence of certain types of bugs indicates that the language itself has design flaws. -- 67.188.119.42 07:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On reflection, I agree in this case, though I still think that the concept of anti-pattern is general enough to apply to coding as well as to higher-level design. And a fencepost error is still not just a bug, but a particular <i>way</i> of introducing a bug. -- <a href="../../../p/j/t/User%7EPJTraill_4845.html" title="User:PJTraill">PJTraill</a> 01:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You misunderstand. Nobody is claiming that coding versus design has anything whatsoever to do with the distinction between a bug and an anti-pattern. The difference is exactly as 67.188.119.42 has put it. A fencepost error is a kind of bug, i.e. it <i>directly</i> causes the program to malfunction. Anti-patterns don't - but they may <i>indirectly</i> lead to errors, in both design and coding, that may cause the program to malfunction. -- <a href="../../../s/m/j/User%7ESmjg_a789.html" title="User:Smjg">Smjg</a> 11:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the foundations of OO programming implies that extending an object, of itself, does not change behavior.

<ul>
<li>Principles
<ul>
<li>Pitfalls are not the same as anti-patterns, but there is a lot of overlap.</li>
<li>Both occur in recognisable situations, and both have the "recognisability" of patterns.</li>
<li>An anti-pattern implies a particular (wrong) solution, whereas a pitfall can mean a family of mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organisation
<ul>
<li>Separating pitfalls from anti-patterns would probably be couterproductive.</li>
<li>A separate category for pitfalls might well be desirable.</li>
<li>Many of the "anti-patterns" linked from here are better classified as pitfalls. We could tag them as such.</li>
<li>This would bring a few links back into the article, such as fenceposts (a pitfall, not an anti-pattern).</li>
<li>It would be going too far to add highly language-specific mistakes, we want things at a fairly conceptual level.</li>

<p>I removed the entry for "software never gets released syndrome"; there is no such anti-pattern defined in the literature. While the problem of neglecting test/QA up front leading to massive schedule slips at the end (the result of a shoddy product being delivered) is well known, it isn't known as this.

<dl>
<dd>I added the section again because the explanation for removal is insufficient (IMHO). --Fasten 12:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here's a better explaination for why the "social anti-patterns" section should be removed from this article: They're off topic, and largely irrelevant to the (somewhat academic) topic of "anti-patterns" as discussed elsewhere on the page. The notion of "anti-pattern" has its origins in software engineering and software engineering management, which is why the other two categories of anti-patterns all concern things that happen at IT shops. While the term "anti-pattern" can be extrapolated to negative or counterproductive behaviors in other domains (including politics and sociology), such usage is rather informal. The use of the term anti-pattern in the software engineering context is well-established in the literature, and can be demonstrated with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, starting with the <i>AntiPatterns</i> book. Your extension to social issues is, at best, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</dd>
<dd>Further, <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">User:Improv</a> is correct; you list is <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. I agree with your opinions on many of them; but many of the topics you address are controversial ones for which you will find many opponents. For example, many people support laws opposing mind-altering drugs and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, and consider these to be beneficial to society, and would disagree with your claim that <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victimless_crime.html" title="Victimless crime">victimless crime</a> is an anti-pattern.</dd>
<dd>At a minimum, for anything on your list which is disputed, the dispute should be addressed. Anything which isn't discussed as an "antipattern" in the literature should be removed. To use <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victimless_crime.html" title="Victimless crime">victimless crime</a> as an example: I typed <tt>+antipattern +"victimless crime"</tt> into Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2Bantipattern+%2B%22victimless+crime%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2Bantipattern+%2B%22victimless+crime%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and came up with five unique links. Two of them were unrelated commercial sites likely engaging in <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyword_stuffing.html" title="Keyword stuffing">keyword stuffing</a>, one was slide presentation which happened to contain the two terms out of context, and two were Wikipedia mirror sites' presentations of this article. Clearly, declaring <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victimless_crime.html" title="Victimless crime">victimless crime</a> to be an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-pattern.html" title="Anti-pattern">Anti-pattern</a> is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> at best, original research at worst. In either case, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>I vote to strike the whole section, for the reasons above. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 17:11, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>They are not anti-patterns in a sense analogous to that applied in software engineering: <b>recognised wrong solutions to recognised problems</b>(?). They are more like pitfalls (see the discussion 3 sections earlier) but not really that either, as they are usually not a result of misrecognition. Some of them just grow like that (not design at all), others develop because of selfishness. It is perhaps significant that there is no category for them. If this usage were to apply in sociology it would call for a separate article and a spot of disambiguation.</li>
<li>As to POV, I am not <i>quite</i> sure. Calling something an anti-pattern is clearly a value judgement, and <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> is right that that is controversial in most of these cases. One <i>could</i> say they are "considered to be anti-patterns" – but by whom? – sounds a bit <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7Eweasel_8f0b.html" title="WP:weasel">weaselly</a>!.</li>

<p>The assumption that antipatters are bad is not correct. It is subjective. A technique can often be used for good or bad so why not inform the readers.

<p>When I look at your definition of Anti-Pattern, I feel that some anti-patterns don't belong here, or aren't anti-patterns at all. Your definition is: <i>commonly-reinvented bad solutions to problems</i>.</p>
<p>Bad managament: doesn't feel like an anti-pattern because it's too general. The definition almost makes sense to me, though.</p>

In addition, I can't see the difference between Golden Hammer and Silver Bullet. I'd be tempted to say that Silver Bullet actually means "right tool for the job", which is the antonym of Golden Hammer and not an antipattern at all. Could someone be more precise on the meaning of <i>Silver Bullet</i>?</p>
<p>Configuration management antipatterns: I don't see how any of these belong to a discussion about anti-patterns. This talks about software deployment, not software design.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/o/Stovepipe.html" title="Stovepipe">Stovepipe</a>: has a red link.

<p>Magic strings links nowhere (there's a typo in there, by the way), and looks a lot like hard coding. If not, a stub with a couple examples would be great. Do you mean something like <i>if ( obj.GetType() == "System.String" )</i> instead of <i>if ( obj is string )</i></p>

<p>As a software manager i'm often referring my co-workers to some blue links here, the most common anti-patterns, the ones with a real description.</p>

<p>I'm also skeptic about some of these, because they go too far on the four-words-say-it-all tagline-style naming, especially when much irony and winks are involved (and this --- is not an anti-pattern but <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_analogy.html" title="False analogy">False_analogy</a> fallacy). This could lead to oversimplification, and some cultures are not receptive to irony --- at all.</p>
