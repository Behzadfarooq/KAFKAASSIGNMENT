<p>During the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> submarines were a new menace. Previously they had been limited to relatively calm and protected waters. The vessels used to combat them were a range of small, fast surface ships using <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">guns</a> and good luck. They mainly relied on the fact a submarine of the day was often on the surface for a range of reasons, such as charging <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batteries.html" title="Batteries">batteries</a> or crossing long distances. The first approach to protect warships was chainlink nets strung from the sides of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleships</a>, as defense against <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedoes</a>. Nets were also deployed across the mouth of a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbour.html" title="Harbour">harbour</a> or naval base to stop submarines entering or to stop <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedoes</a> fired against ships. The <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrophone.html" title="Hydrophone">hydrophone</a>, an underwater microphone, was used to listen for submarines; the German <a href="../../../u/-/b/U-boat.html" title="U-boat">U-boat</a>, <i>UC-3</i>, was sunk with the aid of hydrophone on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_23.html" title="April 23">April 23</a> 1916, in company with the first <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charges</a>. By early 1917 the Royal Navy had also developed <a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loopworks.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loopworks.htm" rel="nofollow">indicator loops</a> which consisted of long lengths of cables lain on the seabed to detect the magnetic field of submarines as they passed overhead. At this stage they were used in conjunction with controlled <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_mine.html" title="Naval mine">mines</a> which could be detonated from a shore station once a 'swing' had been detected on the indicator loop galvanometer. Indicator loops used with controlled mining were known as 'guard loops'. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaplane.html" title="Seaplane">Seaplanes</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">airships</a> were also used to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrol.html" title="Patrol">patrol</a> for submarines, with <i>Fregatten-Leutnant</i> Zelezny scoring the first submarine kill by aircraft on 15 September <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916_in_aviation.html" title="1916 in aviation">1916</a>, while <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html" title="Sonar">dipping hydrophones</a> appeared before war's end; the trials were abandoned.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, the submarine menace revived, threatening the survival of island nations like Britain and Japan which were particularly vulnerable because of their dependence on imports of food, oil and other vital war materials. Despite this vulnerability, little had been done to prepare sufficient anti-submarine forces or develop suitable new weapons. Other navies were similarly unprepared, despite the fact that every major navy had a large, modern submarine fleet.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, most navies had few ideas how to combat submarines beyond locating them with sonar and then dropping <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charges</a> on them. But sonar proved much less effective than expected, and was no use at all against submarines operating on the surface at night. The Royal Navy had continued to develop <a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loopworks.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loopworks.htm" rel="nofollow">indicator loops</a> between the wars but this was a passive form of harbour defence that depended on detecting the magnetic field of submarines by the use of long lengths of cable lain on the floor of the harbour. Indicator loop technology was quickly developed further and deployed by the US Navy in 1942. By then there were dozens of <a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loops.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loops.htm" rel="nofollow">loop stations</a> around the world. Sonar was far more effective and loop technology died straight after the war.</p>

<p>Many different aircraft from airships to four-engined sea- and land-planes were used. Some of the more successful were the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Ventura_79f6.html" title="Lockheed Ventura">Lockheed Ventura</a>, <a href="../../../p/b/y/PBY_Catalina_84c1.html" title="PBY Catalina">PBY Catalina</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consolidated_B-24_Liberator_9395.html" title="Consolidated B-24 Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_Sunderland_b4dd.html" title="Short Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vickers_Wellington_ecbd.html" title="Vickers Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a>.</p>
<p>The provision of air cover was essential. At first, the British developed temporary solutions such as <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merchant_aircraft_carrier.html" title="Merchant aircraft carrier">merchant aircraft carriers</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/CAM_ship_a101.html" title="CAM ship">CAM ships</a>. These were superseded by mass-produced, relatively cheap <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escort_carriers.html" title="Escort carriers">escort carriers</a> built by the United States and operated by the US Navy and Royal Navy.</p>
<p>At this point there was a significant difference in the tactics of the two navies and criticism was aimed at the British. The Americans favoured aggressive hunter-killer tactics using escort carriers on search and destroy patrols, whereas the British preferred to use their escort carriers to defend the convoys directly. The American view was, this tactic did little to reduce or contain U-boat numbers. There were rarely sufficient escorts for extensive hunts, and it was certain U-boats would be found in the vicinity of convoys. In the event, the tactics were complementary, suppressing and destroying U-boats.</p>
<p>An important Allied advantage was provided by the breaking of German naval codes (information gathered this way was dubbed <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra.html" title="Ultra">Ultra</a>) at <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bletchley_Park_0226.html" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a> in England. This enabled the tracking of U-boat packs to allow convoy re-routings: however, whenever codes changed, convoy losses rose significantly.</p>

<p>German sub sinkings were significantly increased after Allied forces began combining hunter-killer tactics with newly-developed <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-submarine_weapons.html" title="Anti-submarine weapons">anti-submarine weapons</a> such as Hedgehog and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_24_FIDO_Torpedo_1897.html" title="Mark 24 FIDO Torpedo">FIDO (Mk 24 'mine')</a> homing torpedo.</p>
<p>In the Pacific, Japanese antisubmarine forces often found themselves overmatched when trying to defend both naval ships and merchant shipping from attacks by U.S. and Allied submarines. The primary weapon of attack continued to be the depth charge, dropped from aircraft or deployed by surface ships. Japanese sub detection gear was not as advanced as that of some other nations. Their primary Japanese anti-submarine weapon for most of WWII was the depth charge, and Japanese depth charge attacks by its surface forces initially proved fairly unsuccessful against U.S. fleet submarines. Unless caught in shallow water, a U.S. submarine commander could normally escape destruction, sometimes using temperature <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gradient.html" title="Gradient">gradients</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermocline.html" title="Thermocline">thermoclines</a>). Additionally, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_75b5.html" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">IJN</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> emphasised fleet action, not convoy protection, so the best ships and crews went elsewhere.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Moreover, during the first part of the war, the Japanese tended to set their depth charges too shallow, unaware U.S. submarines could dive below 150 feet (45m). Unfortunately, this deficiency was revealed in a June 1943 press conference held by U.S. Congressman <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_J._May_7622.html" title="Andrew J. May">Andrew J. May</a>, and soon enemy depth charges were set to explode as deep as 250 feet (76m). Vice Admiral <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_A._Lockwood_48d1.html" title="Charles A. Lockwood">Charles A. Lockwood</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_slang_aabc.html" title="U.S. Navy slang"><small>COMSUBPAC</small></a>, later estimated May's revelation cost the navy as many as ten submarines and 800 crewmen.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Late in the war, the Japanese Army and Navy used <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_Anomaly_Detector_9a32.html" title="Magnetic Anomaly Detector">Magnetic Anomaly Detector</a> MAD) gear in aircraft to locate shallow submerged submarines. The Japanese Army also developed two small aircraft carriers and Ka-1 <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autogyro.html" title="Autogyro">autogyro</a> aircraft for use in an antisubmarine warfare role.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of submarines capable of carrying <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballistic_missile.html" title="Ballistic missile">ballistic missiles</a>, great efforts have been made to counter the threat they pose. In particular, the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> has emerged as a prime anti-submarine platform.</p>
<p>In some areas of the ocean, where land forms natural barriers, long strings of sonobuoys, deployed from surface ships or dropped from aircraft, can monitor maritime passages for extended periods.</p>
<p>Seaborne forces developed better <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomb.html" title="Bomb">bombs</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charges</a> and a range of towed sonar devices to overcome the problem of ship-mounting that required ships to pass directly over the attacked submarine. Helicopters can fly courses offset from the ships and transmit sonar information to their <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_Information_Center_8b24.html" title="Combat Information Center">combat information centre</a>. They can also drop sonobuoys and launch homing torpedoes to positions many miles away from the ships actually monitoring the enemy submarine. Submerged submarines are generally blind to the actions of a patrolling aircraft until it uses active sonar or fires a weapon, and the aircraft's speed allows it to maintain a fast search pattern around the suspected contact.</p>
<p>Increasingly anti-submarine submarines, called attack submarines or <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter-killer.html" title="Hunter-killer">hunter-killers</a> became capable of destroying, particularly, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballistic_missile.html" title="Ballistic missile">ballistic missile</a> submarines. Initially these were very quiet diesel-electric propelled vessels but they are more likely to be nuclear-powered these days.</p>
<p>A significant detection aid that has continued in service is the Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD), a passive device. First used in World War II, the MAD uses the earth's magnetosphere as a standard, detecting anomalies caused by large metallic vessels, such as submarines. Modern MAD arrays are usually contained in a long tail boom (fixed-wing aircraft) or an aerodynamic housing carried on a deployable tow line (helicopters.) Keeping the sensor away from the plane's engines and avionics helps eliminate interference from the carrying platform.</p>
<p>At one time, reliance was placed on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_warfare.html" title="Electronic warfare">electronic warfare</a> detection devices that exploited the submarine's need to perform radar sweeps and to transmit responses to radio messages from home port. As frequency surveillance and direction finding became more sophisticated these devices enjoyed some success. However, submariners soon learned not to rely on such transmitters in dangerous waters. Home bases can then use <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremely_low_frequency.html" title="Extremely low frequency">extremely low frequency</a> radio signals that can penetrate the ocean's surface to reach submarines wherever they might be.</p>

<p>In modern times <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forward_looking_infrared.html" title="Forward looking infrared">infra-red</a> (FLIR) detectors have been used to track the large plumes of heat that fast nuclear-powered submarines leave while rising to the surface. FLIR devices are also used to see <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periscope.html" title="Periscope">periscopes</a> or <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snorkel.html" title="Snorkel">snorts</a> at night whenever a submariner might be incautious enough to probe the surface.</p>
<p>Today many nations cultivate offshore seabeds of listening devices capable of tracking submarines within the coverage area of the devices. It is known to be possible to detect man-made marine noises as far as right across the southern <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Ocean_dac8.html" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.</p>
