He was the son of John Roberts and Mary Ellmaker. His family moved to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster_County%2C_Pennsylvania_7b3a.html" title="Lancaster County, Pennsylvania">Lancaster County</a> in 1804. Growing up, Roberts received the limited education available from the local <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_school.html" title="Common school">common school</a>. In 1816, at the age of thirteen, Roberts began working for his uncle Isaac Ellmaker as a clerk in Isaac's country store in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Holland%2C_Pennsylvania_cbc6.html" title="New Holland, Pennsylvania">New Holland</a>; at the age of twenty, Anthony received a share in the ownership of the store, and continued in the business until 1839.</p>

He then moved to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster%2C_Pennsylvania_3663.html" title="Lancaster, Pennsylvania">Lancaster City</a>, where he served his three-year term as sheriff from 1839 to 1842. In the fall of 1843, Roberts ran for a seat on the Twenty-Eighth Congress on the Anti-Masonic Party ticket, but he was defeated by the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29_806f.html" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whig Party</a> candidate, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah_Brown_7539.html" title="Jeremiah Brown">Jeremiah Brown</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Ellmaker_Roberts_5f4b.html" title="Edit section: The incident">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The incident</span></h3>
<p>Just a few months after Roberts was appointed Marshal, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> passed the <i><a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugitive_Slave_Law_of_1850_9fb4.html" title="Fugitive Slave Law of 1850">Fugitive Slave Law</a></i> as part of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compromise_of_1850.html" title="Compromise of 1850">Compromise of 1850</a>. The law put Roberts in a difficult position as a Marshal who was also an abolitionist, because he was expected to enforce laws promoting the return of runaway slaves to <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">the South</a> or risk a fine of one thousand <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">dollars</a> per incident.</p>
<p>After many tense incidents in the north between local communities harboring runaway slaves and southern slave owners seeking to reclaim their "<i><a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_%28ownership_right%29.html" title="Property (ownership right)">property</a></i>". An incident arose in which blood was shed: on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a>, Edward Gorsuch, a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> slave owner, came to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christiana%2C_Pennsylvania_16ed.html" title="Christiana, Pennsylvania">Christiana</a> in Lancaster County to reclaim a runaway slave named Nelson Ford. A group of runaway slaves in Christiana, headed by William Parker, had formed a vigilante group to protect one another from any attempts by Southern slave owners to enslave them again.</p>
<p>Edward Gorsuch soon learned that his former slave was staying with William Parker. He went to William Parker’s house along with a small <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang.html" title="Gang">posse</a> to take back the slave he claimed to own. The fugitive slaves, led by William Parker, sounded an alarm, which summoned other <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">blacks</a> as well as some local white abolitionists. As Edward Gorsuch advanced to reclaim his “<i>property</i>”, William Parker led an active resistance, and a small battle ensued. One hour later the incident was over and Gorsuch lay dead.</p>
<p>Two days later, Anthony Roberts was on the scene with a detachment of Philadelphia police. Those who participated in the resistance, including the white bystanders, were arrested and put on trial for treason, beginning with the white <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Society_of_Friends_321e.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> Castner Hanway. Thaddeus Stevens took on the case as the defense <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">attorney</a>, while Roberts was responsible for keeping those on trial in custody.</p>
<p><a name="Involvement_in_the_slaves.27_trial" id="Involvement_in_the_slaves.27_trial"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Ellmaker_Roberts_5f4b.html" title="Edit section: Involvement in the slaves' trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Involvement in the slaves' trial</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_attorney.html" title="County attorney">prosecuting attorneys</a> held two blacks in “<i>voluntary</i>” custody for the case. These men discovered Edward Gorsuch’s plot to reclaim his slaves the day before the resistance took place and warned William Parker. The prosecution was planning to use their testimony to prove that the Christiana incident was an organized effort to resist the laws of the United States. Two weeks before the trial began, however, the two blacks mysteriously disappeared from custody. The prosecution hinted that Marshal Roberts had let them go, since there was no evidence of a broken lock or use of force in their escape. The defense denied the accusation.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years later, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Still_b32a.html" title="William Still">William Still</a>, the black leader of the Philadelphia <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_Railroad_7d7b.html" title="Underground Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>, revealed the truth. While in custody, the two black men had been identified by their owner as runaway slaves. Still reports that the two men did indeed find a “<i>true friend and ally</i>” in Roberts. Still clarified the matter further when he wrote in response to the suspicions of the prosecuting attorney with respect to Anthony Roberts: “<i>To add</i> now, that those suspicions were founded on fact, will doubtless do him no damage<i>”.</i></p>
<p>Roberts did other things within his power to sway the outcome of the case. As the Marshal, Roberts was responsible for summoning potential <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury.html" title="Jury">jurors</a>. Robert J. Brent, Maryland’s <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Maryland_a336.html" title="Attorney General of Maryland">Attorney General</a>, who was part of the prosecution team, later claimed that “<i>a large majority</i>” of the potential jurors called by Marshal Roberts were “<i>unfavorable to a conviction</i>”. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a>, Anthony permitted a <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> meal to be prepared for all the prisoners, and even joined them in the prison for the meal. The incident caused the Maryland Attorney General to censure Anthony’s lack of “<i><a href="../../../i/m/p/Impartiality.html" title="Impartiality">impartiality</a></i>” and “<a href="../../../e/t/i/Etiquette.html" title="Etiquette">decorum</a>”.</p>
<p><a name="Scott.27s_testimony" id="Scott.27s_testimony"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Ellmaker_Roberts_5f4b.html" title="Edit section: Scott's testimony">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scott's testimony</span></h3>
<p>Later in the trial, Roberts participated in another event that had a major role in determining the outcome of the case. A certain black named George Washington Scott was going to offer testimony to the fact that he was at the scene of the battle on September 11, that he saw the men who shot Gorsuch, and that the group was organized to “<i>resist all slave holders</i>”. When called upon to testify in court, however, he changed his story and claimed that he was not present that day (an admission that came as quite a surprise to the prosecuting attorneys). It turned out that the night before, Roberts had allowed several black men into the prison to “<i>converse</i>” with Scott.</p>
<p>Maryland’s Attorney General cried foul, and indirectly accused Marshal Roberts of witness tampering, citing the interesting fact that all of the black men in custody had a neat appearance except for Scott who was “<i>ragged, dirty, and filthy</i>”. Despite protests from the prosecution, Scott maintained that he was not at the battle scene and that he had initially lied about being there because he was scared. In the end, Castner Hanway was acquitted. Since his was a test case, the prosecution decided not to prosecute the remaining cases.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Ellmaker_Roberts_5f4b.html" title="Edit section: Late political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Late political career</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_election%2C_1854_a8a5.html" title="United States House election, 1854">congressional election</a>, Thaddeus Stevens put his support behind Roberts as the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Know-Nothing_movement_a970.html" title="Know-Nothing movement">Know-Nothing</a> candidate for the congressional seat of the ninth district of Pennsylvania. The Whigs were appalled by Roberts’ candidacy; an article in the <i>Lancaster Examiner</i> reflects this attitude:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Inconsistent in everything else, he is consistent only in his blind obedience to Thaddeus Stevens. If he is elected, we shall be represented by the shadow of Mr. Stevens without his brains.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Despite such resistance to Anthony Roberts, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, Roberts defeated his rival and relative, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Ellmaker_Hiester_e22a.html" title="Isaac Ellmaker Hiester">Isaac Ellmaker Hiester</a>, by a vote of 6,561 to 5,371 (with 4,266 votes going to the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> nominee). Thus Roberts won Pennsylvania’s Ninth District seat in the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty-fourth_United_States_Congress_ee9f.html" title="Thirty-fourth United States Congress">Thirty-Fourth</a> Congress.</p>
<p>That same year, the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> was beginning to form around the central tenet of stopping the spread of slavery. In 1855 and 1856, Roberts was among the leaders who established the Party in Pennsylvania, and he strongly advocated its principles. When his first term in Congress ended, he sought re-election as a Republican, and won a second term. During his second term he served on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Public_Buildings_and_Grounds_4b36.html" title="United States Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds">Public Buildings and Grounds Committee</a>. Altogether, he served in Congress from <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a>, to <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a>, as the first Republican to represent Lancaster County in Congress.</p>
<p>He was not a candidate for re-nomination in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>. Roberts continued in politics as an active organizer of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania. He ran for Mayor of Lancaster in 1867, but was defeated by the Democratic candidate in a city that had strong Democratic support. Roberts' obituary, published in the <i>Clarion</i> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">January 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, states that his actions in Congress “<i>were always true to his constituents</i>”.</p>

<p>Roberts active public life resulted in his appointment to many committees. In 1830 he was part of a committee to distribute <i>remonstrances</i> (protests) in <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Township%2C_Lancaster_County%2C_Pennsylvania_4af1.html" title="Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania">Earl Township</a>, in response to a proposal to form <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conestoga_Township%2C_Pennsylvania_dae4.html" title="Conestoga Township, Pennsylvania">Conestoga County</a> from parts of Lancaster, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_County%2C_Pennsylvania_3fbb.html" title="Chester County, Pennsylvania">Chester</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berks_County%2C_Pennsylvania_3617.html" title="Berks County, Pennsylvania">Berks</a> counties.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>, Roberts was chosen as a secretary of a meeting in which citizens of Lancaster adopted resolutions to express their sorrow and grief over the unexpected death of President <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Henry_Harrison_e87c.html" title="William Henry Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>, Roberts was appointed to a committee to solicit contributions to mitigate the losses suffered two weeks earlier in a devastating fire in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allentown%2C_Pennsylvania_afe9.html" title="Allentown, Pennsylvania">Allentown</a>. After the death of President <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, Roberts was appointed as one of the vice-presidents of a committee to arrange the president’s funeral services. Roberts also served for a time as chairman of the visiting committee of the School Board in Lancaster.</p>
<p>Roberts owned a lot of real estate in and near <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Holland%2C_Pennsylvania_cbc6.html" title="New Holland, Pennsylvania">New Holland</a> in Lancaster County. He seems to have used his real estate holdings to promote education and the general public welfare. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a>, he bought a plot of ground with a brick house on it known as the <i><a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> Meeting House</i>. Six years later he sold it to the Earl School District.</p>
<p>In 1850, he completed construction on what was then the largest dwelling in eastern Lancaster County. The construction's purpose was mysterious until its comletion, when Roberts announced that a select school would be opened in part of his home. He also assisted in freeing many pieces of property from rent structures that harmed the common people dwelling in New Holland. In 1860, in the City of Lancaster, he was one of the incorporators of an institution dedicated to providing homes for poor and uncared for children. One biographer notes that "<i>[the common people of New Holland] looked upon him as their friend and champion of their rights</i>". As a close friend of Thaddeus Stevens, Roberts was designated one of the executors of Stevens' will.</p>
