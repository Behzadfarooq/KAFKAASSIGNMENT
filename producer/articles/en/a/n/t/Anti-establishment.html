In particular, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satirical humour</a> is commonly used to undermine the deference shown by the majority of the population towards those who govern them.

<p>Individuals who were anti-establishment often spoke of "fighting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_man.html" title="The man">the man</a>", selling out to the Establishment, and "tearing down the Establishment." Many historical figures innovated great changes to society by standing up to "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Establishment_e26a.html" title="The Establishment">the Establishment</a>", including <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Martin_Luther_King_Jr._96e9.html" title="Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>. In many pop publications, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> was said to have been anti-establishment because he defied convention and the local authorities.</p>
<p>The "Establishment" was not simply the people of the older generation. It encapsulated all of American society, so included the socio-economic "<a href="../../../m/i/l/Military-industrial_complex.html" title="Military-industrial complex">military-industrial complex</a>", a complacent and conservative "<a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_America_31c5.html" title="Middle America">Middle America</a>", a legal system that perpetuated the status quo, religions that required unquestioning obedience, and the juggernaut of tradition and custom that demanded "conformity".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-establishment.html" title="Edit section: Early Usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Usage</span></h3>
<p>The anti-Establishment push began in the 1940s and simmmered through the 1950s. Many <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veteran.html" title="Veteran">veterans</a>, who had seen horrors and inhumanity, began to question every aspect of life, including its meaning. Urged to return to "normal lives", plagued by <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_4f05.html" title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</a> (and unable to discuss it as not being "manly"), many veterans found <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburbia.html" title="Suburbia">suburbia</a> cloying and empty.</p>
<p>A vague unease spawned diverse paths. The <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell%27s_Angels_00c3.html" title="Hell's Angels">Hell's Angels</a> was originally composed of WWII veterans feeling rebellious: the name came from WWII fighting units. The image of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Brando_e47f.html" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> as a motorcycle rebel in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wild_Ones_58e1.html" title="The Wild Ones">The Wild Ones</a></i> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dean_4236.html" title="James Dean">James Dean</a> as a <i><a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Without_a_Cause_0adf.html" title="Rebel Without a Cause">Rebel Without a Cause</a></i> horrified some Americans and electrified others. Some veterans founded the Beats Movement, then were denigrated as <i>Beatniks</i> and accused of being "downbeat" on everything. <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Ferlinghetti_56d2.html" title="Lawrence Ferlinghetti">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a> wrote a Beat autobiography that cited his wartime service.</p>
<p>Many people craved angry "true" commentary such as Lenny Bruce's acid-tongued comedy, or simply a desire for more personal freedom, even "vices". <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_magazine.html" title="Playboy magazine">Playboy magazine</a>, with its famous nudes, was the first <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin_mag.html" title="Skin mag">skin mag</a> sold alongside national magazines, and caused a scandal and backlash. Men who had traveled discovered that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> was not a killer weed as official sources contended.</p>
<p>Many women also harbored a deep resentment. During the war years, they had been encouraged to assume men's roles in industry, both <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_collar.html" title="White collar">white collar</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_collar.html" title="Blue collar">blue collar</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosie_the_Riveter_5853.html" title="Rosie the Riveter">Rosie the Riveter</a> was a national icon. But after the war, women were forced to give up their jobs and become homemakers.</p>
<p>Citizens had also begun to question authority, especially after the Gary Powers <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a> Incident, where President Eisenhower repeatedly assured people the USA was not spying on Russia, then was caught in a blatant lie. This general dissatisfaction was popularized by <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Lee_ce42.html" title="Peggy Lee">Peggy Lee</a>'s laconic pop song "Is That All There Is?", but remained unspoken and unfocused. It wasn't until the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Boomers_3fa9.html" title="Baby Boomers">Baby Boomers</a> came along in huge numbers that protest became organized (or disorganized in the case of the hippies), who were named by the Beats as "little hipsters".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-establishment.html" title="Edit section: 1960s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1960s</span></h3>
<p><i>Anti-Establishment</i> became a buzzword of the tumultuous 1960s. Young people raised in comparative luxury saw many wrongs perpetuated by society and began to question "the Establishment". Contentious issues included the ongoing <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> with no clear goal or end point, the constant military build-up and diversion of funds for the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, perpetual wide-spread poverty being ignored, money-wasting <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boondoggle.html" title="Boondoggle">boondoggles</a> like <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pork_barrel.html" title="Pork barrel">pork barrel</a> projects and the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Race_5b79.html" title="Space Race">Space Race</a>, festering race issues, a stultifying education system, repressive laws and harsh sentences for casual <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreational_drug_use.html" title="Recreational drug use">drug use</a>, and a general malaise among the older generation. On the other side, "<a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_America_31c5.html" title="Middle America">Middle America</a>" often regarded questions as accusations, and saw the younger generation as spoiled, drugged-out, sex-crazed, unambitious <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slacker.html" title="Slacker">slackers</a>.</p>
<p>Anti-Establishment debates were common because they touched on everyday aspects of life. Even innocent questions could escalate into angry diatribes. For example, "Why do we spend millions on a foreign war and a space program when our schools are falling apart?" would be answered with "We need to keep our military strong and ready to stop the Communists from taking over the world." As in any debate, there were valid and foolish arguments on both sides. "<a href="../../../m/a/k/Make_love_not_war.html" title="Make love not war">Make love not war</a>" invoked "America, love it or leave it."</p>
<p>As the 1960s simmered, the anti-Establishment adopted conventions in opposition to the Establishment. T-shirts and blue jeans became the uniform of the young because their parents wore collar shirts and slacks. Drug use, with its illegal panache, was favored over the legal consumption of alcohol. Promoting <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_and_love.html" title="Peace and love">peace and love</a> was the antidote to promulgating hatred and war. Living in genteel poverty was more "honest" than amassing a nest egg and a house in the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburbs</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">Rock 'n roll</a> was played loud over <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_listening.html" title="Easy listening">Easy listening</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draft_dodger.html" title="Draft dodger">Dodging the draft</a> was passive resistance to traditional <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_service.html" title="Military service">military service</a>. Dancing was free-style, not learned in a ballroom. Over time, anti-establishment messages crept into popular culture: songs, fashion, movies, lifestyle choices, television.</p>
<p>The emphasis on freedom allowed previously hushed conversations about sex, politics, or religion to be openly discussed. A wave of "liberations" came out of 1960s: the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_movement.html" title="Feminist movement">Feminist movement</a>, the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_Party_31db.html" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panthers</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Power_2858.html" title="Black Power">Black Power</a>, Gay Rights, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> awareness, even "Gray Power" for elders. Programs were put in place to deal with inequities: Equal Opportunity Employment, the Head Start Program, enforcement of the Civil Rights Act, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desegregation_busing.html" title="Desegregation busing">busing</a>, and others. But the widespread dissemination of new ideas also sparked a backlash and resurgence in conservative religions, new segregated private schools, anti-gay and anti-abortion legislation, and other reversals. Extremists tended to be heard more because they made good copy for newspapers and television. In many ways, the angry debates of the 1960s led to modern right-wing talk radio and coalitions for "traditional <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_values.html" title="Family values">family values</a>".</p>
<p>As the 1960s passed, society had changed to the point that the definition of the Establishment had blurred, and the term "anti-establishment" fell out of use.</p>
