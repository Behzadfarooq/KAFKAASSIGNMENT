<p>OF course his bedroom is tidy, he never spends time at his house!

<dl>
<dd>Saying that someone claimed he was gay is not the same thing as saying he actually is. Considering it's just about the most press he's had in a while, it's probably notable.

<dd>I don't understand what you mean when you say "anyway you don't own this domain or this profile".

<dd>I say that the sexuality should go in. It's notable information about a notable guy. He's appeared in the press repeatedly over his sexuality. Sexuality is an issue for a guy who sings love songs. If he were a professor of engineering, I could accept that it's irrelevant. The text from my edit is, I think, the best attempt at including the info in a way that's verifiable and sourced. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richard Cavell</a> 04:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why don't you include every media article on Anthony then?? and not just what you percieve to be of interest. It has nothing to do with anything. This profile, is about Anthony's achievements.No relevence whatso-ever. It may have been sourced but I would hardly call Sydney Confidential the most reliable source of information and the whole issue is about a Traffic Reporter gossiping on a Radio programme where he was there just to do the traffic.

<dd>Actually, the profile is about the <b>person</b>, not just his career. Anonymous editors are adding the same content, and consensus seems to be building towards including it. -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 14:17, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anthony has enough talk and speculation on the WWW about his without it being on here as well. As, has been said it is unsubstantiated gossip and Anthony has said he wants to keep his private life separate from his work life. Don't see any sense on putting gossip on a profile. refer Marks comments below dwally</p>
<dl>
<dd>What I added wasn't gossip - it was a properly referenced statement that a radio announcer said he was gay. It also said that Anthony denied it. All of which is notable and referenced.</dd>
<dd>So far, your reasons for removing the info have been:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Anthony doesn't want it. Besides sounding like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, that also has no bearing on the information or the article. I'm pretty sure <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Haggard_ad26.html" title="Ted Haggard">Ted Haggard</a> doesn't want the controversy surrounding him to be on his page, either.</li>
<li>It's gossip. As I said above, speculation about his sexual orientation is indeed gossip. But the controversy around a radio announcer outing Callea isn't gossip - that's news.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Do you have any other objections that would keep the info off the page? -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 15:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mark's comment below says he is opposed to the use of the category (I agree on that point) and above he mentions consensus. As per <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> this subject is still under discussion and consensus has not been reached, so it is premature to remove the information. At the moment there are some people in favour of keeping the information. I will add myself to that list. I dislike the tendency of some articles to submerge themselves in gossip, but in this case we are reporting what has been said about him and we are linking it to an acceptable source. The comments made about his sexuality have been reported in various media and we are doing no more than reporting what has been said. It may be "gossip" but if someone's career is potentially impacted by public and media speculation about an aspect of his personal life, then mentioning it our biographical article is fairly important for comprehensiveness, as long as care is taken to avoid giving the subject undue weight. It could have an impact on his career, much more than if he worked in a non-public field so in this case it has relevance. We are not (and we must not be) using this speculation as a way of presenting this information as fact. Furthermore Callea's wanting "to keep his private life seperate from his work life" is not relevant. He's chosen a career as a public figure and the media are going to talk about him and write about him. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_people_78e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living people">Wikipedia:Biographies of living people</a> is the main thing to look at here in terms of determining what is appropriate.

<p>Twice today I have removed gay-related categories from this article. If this trend continues, I will semi-protect this article.</p>
<p>The grand sum of all the sources relating to Callea's sexuality amounts to speculation, and no solid proof. Whilst by all means we can report on the speculation, to take that one step further and say that Callea <i>is</i> gay is wrong. Here is a quote from <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_Gender%2C_race_and_sexuality_8826.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization/Gender, race and sexuality">the guidelines on categorisation of people</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Inclusion should be justifiable by external references. (For example, even if you have personal knowledge of a notable individual's sexual orientation, they should only be filed in a gay-related category if factual, reliable sources can be provided to support the assertion.)"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>My reading of that is that such categories should not be used if such sexuality is equivocal. Because Callea says he is <i>not</i> gay, we should not say he is. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 14:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thankyou Mark dwally</p>
<p>I agree Mark and am wondering, while it keeps being added, about the 'revert' rules. This was not widespread 'news' but appeared in some states only. It's unsubstantiated gossip and not relevant to his career or work. That certain elements of the press discuss people in the public eye in this way is not a reason or justification. Saying that it will 'potentially damage his career' is a value judgement I disagree with. If it were true, then all the more reason not to print it. Print details about his career and recent performances rather than meaningless unsubstantiated speculation by someone who's basically little known and who should have been talking about the traffic.(Darllenwr 16:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>I've added a "controversy" section that I hope presents the information in an NPOV way. I agree that the categories should stay off. -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 15:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

So you have the transcript of the conversation from the Radio station? As I have read it in no way did the traffic reporter say that he was gay!! I am wondering your source, It sounds a bit like Chinese Whispers to me sourced from a blog as the detail you "thoughtfully" added is not in any reputable publication I have read. I am also now wondering your interest in this whole article. Have you added achievements to his profile in the past or just this one from this tabloid Sydney Confidential hardly known for their headline breaking articles. dwally</p>
<p>I see the article has now been edited to only include what was reported &amp; not someones spin.User talk:dwally</p>

<p>I have semi-protected this article as a result of the continuing blanking of the controversy section by anonymous contributors. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 01:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
