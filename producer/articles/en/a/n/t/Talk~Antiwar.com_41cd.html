<p>I don't want to junk the page up with a bunch of extra names, but how exactly should we determine which personnel to mention and which to omit? Are we looking for noteworthiness or for those who do the most work at the site? It seems like Scott Horton might be a noteworthy addition considering he's also the host of a comparatively popular talk radio show. - anon</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, with regard to the <i>staff</i> of antiwar.com, I think we should try to get some sense of how important a role each person plays in producing the site. Obviously, Raimondo and Garris are key figures; in addition, I have the impression that Matt Barganier has an important role as editor, and, from what I remember about the newspaper profile on antiwar.com a few years ago, the executive director, Alexia Gilmore, is important, too (as is her husband). Sapienza is maybe kind of a stretch, but, what the heck, he has a Wikipedia article and he is listed third on the AWC masthead. I think adding anyone else would be too much clutter. As far as columnists are concerned, we should definitely go by how notable they are as people. I think the current list is pretty good, although Nebojsa Malic seems pretty obscure apart from his antiwar.com column. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 13:12, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The people who register .com domains are not ignorant. One domain is as good as another from a technical point of view, but .com is the most popular, and hence the one people are used to typing. In other words, if you make the mistake of registering a non-.com domain, a certain percentage of email and web traffic intended for you will be misdirected. dan.info is a pretty name, but do you want dan.com reading your email? .com has long ceased to mean "commercial"; it is the all-purpose generic domain. There is no benefit to registering non-.com domains, except to the people who profit from selling domain names and the trademark lawyers who police the domains (somebody registered cocacola.xxx?

<p>Is this actually true? I'm certain the site was talking about this group before others, but does it actually go back to the sites inception?

<p>They weren't mentioned as much because they weren't in power at the time. Justin mentions neo-conservatives in his books years before the site's founding, so I would assume he mentioned them offhand somewhere along the line.</p>

<p>I protest the removal of the material I added, pointing out that Antiwar.com carries a significant amount of news content as opposed to opinion. Frankly, I'm surprised someone thought this needed removing; if anything, I think what I put in is anything but "POV" and in fact shows that Antiwar.com is less POV than might be thought at first glance, since a lot of the content comes from the world press (much of it mainstream). Please look at what I put in and see what you think. --<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 21:52, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is the source for your material? It appears to be your personal opinion. If you can find a notable source which says that they this site carries more news than other news sites, then I have no objection to it. But otherwise it is just an unsourced POV and original research. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:58, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for responding. Yes, this is "original research", and I thought it would be fairly self-evident to anyone who observes Web sites of this ilk. I do happen to read Antiwar.com regularly, so I can attest to the characterization I made in the article. As to comparisons with other sites, well, anyone can do these as well; having perused a fair number of similar sites (say, the Huffington Post, Z Magazine, Commondreams, etc.), I can attest that Antiwar.com has a much higher ratio of news to opinion. That, really, was all I was trying to convey in what I wrote. I can only say that any reasonable person reading this and other sites would probably agree; I don't think exhaustively documented research, replete with footnotes, is required here. --<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 22:22, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see the applicable policy: <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:no original research</a>. For our purposes, "self-evident" is limited to only the simplest matters, like the fact the Antiwar.com is a website. Whether it has more mainstream news links than other "news" sites is not self-evident and since "mainstream" is a debatable concept it never could be. Personal attestations by editors are not allowable sources for any facts or opinions in this project. However, if you find a quote from somebody notable then we can use that. Such as, "According to Famous Pundit, it is a better news source than Biasednews.com". -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:34, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This still seems like something that could be repaired. The fact is that Antiwar.com runs a lot of non-opinion links, there are people on staff who work exclusively on that. if we removed a comparison to other sites, most of the deleted content could probably return without any problem. On any given day, the vast majority of the links on the Antiwar.com frontpage will ne news links from around the world.</dd>

<p>75.2.245.222 has continued to post the same uncited points of contention. Not only are they not cited by any kind of source, but they glaringly violate the Terms required of NPOV. Just because you do not like someone or a position held by an organization, does not mean that you can disparage them. Follow the terms, cite sources and stick to NPOV.</p>

<p>I see there was a previous vote on deletion of this article, which was high in favor of "keep". However, why hasn't any editor included NPOV, sourced and verifiable information in this article which clearly demonstrate why this website is notable enough for an article. The writing may be fabulous and provocative, but where are the traffic statistics, the outside references to it from other prominent outlets, news coverage, etc? To read this article on its own, I wonder why this website is important. Does it have a national audience? Is it more a Bay-area thing? Is anything published anywhere in a completely independent, verifiable and reliable source that covers this information?<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 16:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
