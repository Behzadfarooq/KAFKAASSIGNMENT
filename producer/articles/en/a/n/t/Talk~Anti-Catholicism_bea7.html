<p>The disputed portion on feminist opposition doesn't cite facts nor mention how they oppose the Catholic Church. This section will need to be fleshed out if it's to remain. Can someone cite specific actions or statements by feminists which are anti-Catholic? (I don't think there's a shortage of examples).

<dd>You're welcome but that was just a down payment on the house, so to speak. I didn't have a lot of time this morning and I don't have a lot of time now but I think the point you make is "on the money" and it needs even more fleshing out. I hope to get back to this in the next few days with more concrete examples and citations. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 21:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Dems110 deleted the following text twice "It has tended to be associated with the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">Left-wing</a> of the political spectrum, and with middle and working class intellectuals."</p>
<p>Dems110's second deletion was accompanied by the edit summary "prejudice is not on any side of the political spectrum".</p>
<p>This is true as a general truism but it ignores the history of anti-clericalism in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Now anti-clericalism and anti-Catholicism are not exactly the same thing but much anti-Catholicism has its roots in anti-clericalism so we should at least consider the possibility that the deleted text has some validity in some countries in certain eras.</p>
<p>The truth is that Catholicism has often sided with secular power in the past, often throwing its spiritual authority and secular influence on the side of monarchy, nobility and aristocracy. For these reasons, the Catholic church has often been seen as being on the side of reactionary oppressors of the masses (this rhetoric was espoused by socialists and Communists;I am not necessarily agreeing with it;I'm just describing it).</p>
<p>In many Catholic countries of Europe, the Pope was a supporter of (or contender with) the ruling classes. The bishops were bourgeois along the same lines as minor nobility and mid-level bureaucrats and the local clergy were often petit bourgeois.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that Marx argued that "religion is the opiate of the masses". He argued that religion, specifically Christianity, simply palliated the suffering of the masses so that they could continue being oppressed by the aristocrats and capitalists.</p>
<p>This was also true in colonial empires such as the Spanish colonies in Latin America and, I believe, the colonial empires in Africa and Southeast Asia. Even in 20th century Latin America, the Catholic church was seen as being part of the oligarchic power structure. It is against this perception (and reality) that liberation theology was born.</p>
<p>Now, I concede that this section is poorly written and the sentence in question is certainly no exception. However, to delete it dismissively with the suggestion that it is unsourced and POV risks glossing over an important facet of modern-day anti-Catholicism.</p>

<dd>To be fair, it <i>was</i> unsourced.

<p>I think this whole section needs to be reviewed and reworked. The points that I made in the section above should be worked into the text but we need to keep in mind that there is an article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-clericalism.html" title="Anti-clericalism">anti-clericalism</a> and so we have to decide how much to say here and how much should be left for discussion in that article.</p>
<p>I am leaving on vacation in a few hours and won't be back until Monday but I will read any responses then and get to work on this section if no one else has taken it up in the meantime. Have a good weekend, all!</p>

<p>The article portrays Scotland as being an anti-catholic country, this just isn't the case! I'm a Roman Catholic and I've lived here all my life, I've had the choice of going to Catholic Schools but didn't and have never been subject to anti-catholic abuse! Why? Because in this country it doesn't exist!</p>
<p>Some people will argue about the chants of Rangers Fans at football games or the occasional fight in Glasgow, but this is between people who think Catholics worship the Virgin Mary and not Jesus and that Protestants don't believe in God. Im going to edit it according too the truth! <a href="../../../g/a/v/User%7EGavin_Scott_2ae2.html" title="User:Gavin Scott">Gavin Scott</a> 19:03, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Different people will react differently to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. One item that's hard to deny, however, is that they are mocking the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Webster's New World Dictionary defines mock as "ridicule" or "to mimic, as in fun". I suggest that's exactly what they do -- like them or hate them. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajoreditor_3104.html" title="User:Majoreditor">Majoreditor</a> 20:54, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
