<p>"In Japan and South Korea, much anti-Americanism has focused on the rude behavior of American military personnel, aggravated especially by repeated sexual assaults on locals by U.S. servicemen. The on-going U.S. military presence in Okinawa remains a contentious issue in Japan.[14]"</p>
<p>Yes, the on-going U.S. Miltary presence in Okinawa is a contentious issue. NO the mention of REPEATED sexual Assualts on locals by US servicemen is not neccessary.</p>
<p>Funny also that the article mentions "Guantanamo Concentration Camps".. and "CIA Torture Flights" Bias Showing through?</p>
<p>Contemporary understanding of what constitutes a "concentration camp" is not Gitmo.. it's Auschwitz.</p>
<p>CIA Torture Flights have not been confirmed to have been made, either by the "receiving" govts involved, or the "exporting" US govt. Perhaps a National Inquirer citation should be thrown in there. Also, the naming of such flights as "CIA Torture Flights" is extremely inflamatory, suggestive and irresponsible if the goal is a factual, unbiased article. But since a newspaper names it that, I guess that makes it O.K.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We've had a problem with an editor pushing POV. It needs a thorough going over. On your points:
<ul>
<li>Disagree on one. "Repeated" is taken directly from the BBC source. It warrants a mention: absolutely (and of course naturally) the sexual crimes have been a locus for anti-American sentiment in Jap. and Kor.</li>
<li>Agree absolutely on concentration camps. "Torture flights" should be put in brackets if it is used at all. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 16:21, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>True; the sexual assault cases have been notable in the context of Japanese anti-americanism, but the phraseology used is still leaning towards POV. I've changed "repeatedly" to "high-profile cases of" since it reflects the two important facts: A - That there was more than one case (though I think I'm correct in thinking that not all are actually proven cases, some are still ongoing) and B - That the incidents were widely reported in Japan (and mentioned by BBC, FOX et al).

<dd>I agree, Edders, that anti-Americanism is not always based on facts or proof, as you said. From my experiences, <b>I</b> believe some nonviolent anti-Americanism is based on stereotypes and trendiness, which is not well represented in this article, and my challenge is to attempt to add items to illustrate that.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is also why I believe the article should <i>show</i> the anti-Americanism instead of hosting detailed descriptions of why this or that region of the world is anti-American. Show the anti-Americanism and let the reader decide for themself. I think that is <b>imperative</b>. But to present something as fact because someone perceived it that way is dangerous.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Squaring the circle</span></h2>
<p>With the pic issue addressed I'd like to go back to the larger issue of definition. It seems to me that rather than debating what it is, the actual question is "when can it properly be employed?" Suggest for the first para:</p>
<p>"<b>Anti-Americanism</b> is a prejudice against the United States or the American people. In popular practice, a disparate variety of actions and attitudes critical of the United States have been labeled anti-Americanism, including hostility toward its government and culture. The usefulness and accuracy of the term in describing such a broad range has thus often been questioned. The widely-used <b>anti-American sentiment</b> less explicitly implies an actual prejudice and is often used instead."</p>
<p>The first sentence is actually <i>more</i> strict than at present, the point being "if you want to call it anti-Americanism, it actually has to be prejudicial." Toinet, for example (again verbatim in O'Connor): the term "is only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition - a sort of allergic reaction - to America as a whole." This is <i>not</i> a right-wing American polemicist saying "look how bad everyone is to America" but a French academic rather skeptically pointing out "if you actually want to use this term, it actually has to rise to this level." Let's try and make this distinction and edit accordingly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:20, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>"Critical and reasoned expression of a disagreement"</b></p>
<p>"By anti-Americanism, I mean the critical and reasoned expression of a disagreement with what Americans say or do. By Americanophobia, I mean the total visceral rejection of anything that has to do with American culture, democracy, or economy, in short, with American civilization. Anti-Americanism expresses itself through critical acts or words; it may not be reasonable, but it is openly debated in the public sphere and is related to the concrete events that mark the ups and downs of Franco-American relations. Philippe Roger and Jean-François Revel’s recent books abound in examples of this nature (see Chapter one)."</p>

<p><b>"Never extending to a total rejection"</b></p>
<p>"... Anti-Americanism, if we choose to retain the term at all, should be seen as a weak and ambivalent complex of anti-feelings. It does not apply but selectively, never extending to a total rejection of both forms of Americanism: the cultural and the political. Thus we can have either of two separate outcomes; an anti-Americanism rejecting cultural trends which are seen as typically American, while allowing of admiration for America’s energy, innovation, prowess, and optimism, or an anti-Americanism in reverse, rejecting an American political creed that for all its missionary zeal is perceived as imperialist and oppressive, while admiring American culture, from its high-brow to pop varieties. These opposed directions in the critical thrust of anti-Americanism often go hand in hand with opposed positions on the political spectrum. The cultural anti-Americanism of those rising in defense of Europe’s cultural identities is typically on the conservative right wing, whereas the political anti-Americanism of the Cold War and the war in Vietnam typically occurred on the left. Undoubtedly the drastic change in America’s position on the world stage since World War II has contributed to this double somersault. Since that war America has appeared in a radically different guise, as much more of a potent force in every-day life in Europe and the larger world than ever before. ..."</p>

<dd>Certainly not in the formula suggested above, and also not in the current version, which, in addition, is misleading and, at least in part, inaccurate and wrong. I suggest further reading of original sources to reach a better understanding of the term and its usage. Maybe we can first collect a number of relevant quotes and condense them into a more reasonable version. If users insist e.g. upon citing a definition of anti-Americanism as something irrational, verbatim quotes from primary sources, not taken out of context, would certainly help to evaluate their relevance. We can later decide whether such definitions, if they exist, need to be mentioned in the introduction. Rkrichbaum 12:56, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Source: "By anti-Americanism, I mean the critical and reasoned expression of a disagreement with what Americans say or do."</p>
<p>Current intro: "Whether sentiment hostile to United States reflects reasoned evaluation of specific policies and administrations, rather than a truly prejudiced belief system, is a further complication."</p>
<dl>
<dd>The definition of anti-American as "critical and reasoned expression of a disagreement" is obviously not "covered" by a sentence that speaks of "hostile sentiment" and that "it is a further complication" if such feelings "reflect a reasoned evaluation", rather than a hypothetical and unsourced "truly prejudiced <i>belief system</i>".

</dl>
<p>Source: "... Anti-Americanism, if we choose to retain the term at all, should be seen as a weak and ambivalent complex of anti-feelings."</p>
<p>Current intro: "However, it has also been suggested...that the term merely signifies a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices and criticisms towards Americans or the United States [3]."</p>
<dl>

<dd>Sir, I think you have an "in degree and in kind" problem. Treating differences in the latter sense, when they are more properly dealt with in the former. Either that, or you just like to argue. Kroes would like to form a binary--good for him. Perhaps we can use this, if and when we want to point out the difference between cultural and political criticism. His preface to the point is this: "Yet the range of (American) behavior is simply too wide—ranging, in culture from the sublime to the vulgar, and in politics from high-minded internationalism to narrow nationalism—to warrant any across-the-board rejection." This differs in degree from, but is not out of keeping with, Katzenstein, which we have in the intro. It differs in degree from, but is not out of keeping with O'Conner, which we have in the intro. Tweak, if you feel "does not rise to total rejection" needs mentioning. But please cease positing gaps that do not exist. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:22, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is indeed an interesting edit. For quite a while, the claim was "criticism of lack of gay rights ..., and, conversely (put), acceptance of homophobia". Then an anonymous vandal apparently didn't like it and simply changed "acceptance of homophobia" into the opposite "acceptance of homosexuality", without so much as an explanation, let alone a source. Someone reverted this anonymous vandalism, then someone came along and re-reverted, with the explanation that the word "conversely" was allegedly not appropriately used.</dd>

<dd>I am, like you, very much interested in the source for the claim that "acceptance of homosexuality" is part of what is perceived as "anti-American" criticism, as opposed to, say, the homophobia of the people around Fred Phelps whose activities are indeed frequently cited in the foreign press as an example of outrageous homophobia that seems to be acceptable in the US.

<dd>It is probably more an issue of anti-Westernism than anti-Americanism in this case.

<p>It may be a good idea to include some historical facts into this article to justify anti-americanism, like the issues i've mentioned above. Obiously history could be considered. 24.23.51.27 02:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I copied this from another website. While I think the writers choice of words may be a bit strong, I nevertheless agree with his main ideas. The writer contends that Anti American sentiment has been increasing drastically since 2000 because the Bush Administration:</p>
<p>1. Intentionally misled the country into an illegal war.</p>
<p>2. Willfully and knowingly violated American law by bypassing FISA court to spy on Americans without judicial approval, including those with no connection to terrorism.</p>
<p>3. Willfully and knowingly violated international law by authorizing an illegal invasion of a sovereign nation.</p>
<p>4. Collusion with numerous corporate entities to increase corporate profits fraudulently with taxpayer dollars, resulting in rampant war profiteering.</p>
<p>5. Conflict of interest, drawing salary from private entities while in office and returning large no-bid government contracts to these entities.</p>
<p>6. Defamation of character, organized attempts to defame their critics.</p>
<p>7. Leaked classified information about their perceived political enemies.</p>
<p>8. Using taxpayer dollars to create and disseminate propaganda deemed illegal by the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>9. Violated existing American treaties by authorizing the use of torture.</p>
<p>It sure does seem like it's easy to blame President Bush for a lot of the things wrong with our country. But then again, there are probably reasons that so many people feel the way that they do about him(Oh wait a tick, there are!

<p>An anecdote: "a short account of a particular incident or event of an interesting or amusing nature, often biographical (dictionary.com, quoting <i>Americna Heritage</i>)." Anecdote(s) is what the propesed section amounts to. I'm not debating whether the words were said but whether they belong. The uncited "has caused much resentment in Communist China, and socialist Europe" is the only link. Do present day Chinese really give a shit about quotes from R. Nixon?

<p>I'd like to make an observation, if I may. Most of the individuals editing this page seem to be under the impression that if a Frenchman utters "Those American's. It was so wrong to invade Iraq!" then that makes them Anti-American. It's as if, and my bias may be showing a bit here, but at least I'm honest about it and don't make any excuses, but it seems to me like a conservative tactic of those that support our current administration (The people in this country that aren't "Anti Bush") to try to explain away the critiscism from foreign entities as "Anti American". Think about it. Are you "Anti Mexico" because you want congress to pass a hardline immigration bill? There's even a peice in this article that says these "Anti American extremist brainwashing factions" create an "other", a group of people that aren't them, that are unkown and must be feared for their strange ways. This is exactly, EXACTLY what this conservative administration is doing to the us! The fact of the matter is that there was no "logical" reason to invade Iraq. Instead, Bush whipped up Anti-Iraq sentiment with false reports of weapons of mass destruction, catchy bumper sticker slogans, and the inherent suspicion that ALL people, American and Non-American, carry to varying degrees in their heart of those that are different. I defy any of you to open up a Quaran and show me the part where it says you get 72 virgins for dieing in Allah's name. That whole thing was made up by some Americans to try and get the rest of them to hate Muslims. I guess the point of my rant is that before you start throwing rocks at least make sure to move out of your glass house first. And I know what some of you are about to say to yourselves right now, and no, I'm not "Anti-American". I think that the country we have is something very unique and special. But that doesn't mean that I always think we're right, or good, or just. Remember the Native Americans? What did we do to them? How about the Japanease during World War Two? I mean, we weren't killing them like the Nazi's did to the Jews, but we still locked them up for being the race that they were. And to try and portray us as anything else than what we are, well, I think that that makes you the Anti-American, not me. Patriotism isn't just a word you slap on a bumper sticker. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazik007_dc57.html" title="User:Spazik007">Spazik007</a> 01:24, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The first image (cover of Anti-Americanism) should definately stay, though I think another five pictures after that (at time of typing this) is a bit excessive and only serves to screw up the formatting. In my opinion the Nazi propaganda poster should also stay (due to its' relative fame) along with one other. Edders 16:14, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a side note, I made a minor edit to the propaganda poster to hopefully better reflect the most relevent themes it utilizes. Edders 16:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I plan to expand it. It is essential to anti-americanism to understand the negative stereotypes. Stereotyping is a form of prejudice and prejudice is of course the defining aspect of anti-americanism. Prejudice is what underlies the assumption of the worst when given partial or inconclusive informaiton. Prejudice is what makes people (esp. in the middle east) disposed to believing propagnada and conspiracy over reports from reliable US institutions such as free media. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 08:52, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Anti-Americanism</b>, often <b>Anti-American sentiment</b>, refers to a broad range of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude_%28psychology%29.html" title="Attitude (psychology)">attitudes</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Action (philosophy)">actions</a> opposed or <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hostility.html" title="Hostility">hostile</a> to the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_the_United_States_235d.html" title="Government of the United States">government</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_States_a6a3.html" title="Culture of the United States">culture</a>, or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_the_United_States_f832.html" title="Demographics of the United States">people</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Anti-Americanism has been described as a belief that configures the United States and the American way of life as threatening at their core <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.However, it has also been suggested that Anti-Americanism cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon and that the term merely signifies a rough composite of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotypes</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">prejudices</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critic.html" title="Critic">criticisms</a> towards Americans or the United States <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. Interpretations of anti-Americanism have often been <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polarization_%28psychology%29.html" title="Polarization (psychology)">polarized</a>, with heated cold war era exchanges charging that the term is propaganda <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> coupled to counter charges that criticism of the term is propaganda <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. As a result, a central issue in understanding Anti-Americanism is distinguishing sentiment hostile to the United States that is a result of balanced and reasoned evaluation of specific policies and administrations <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> from hostile sentiment that is a result of prejudiced, manufactured, or unbalanced criticism of the United States using principles that take a blind eye to or cannot be applied to the actions of other states and organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contemporary anti-American positions range from opposition to the foreign policy of the United States government, opposition to the economic policies of the United States, opposition to American popular culture, and opposition to globalization and the dominant role of American interests. Increases in global anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies such as the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_war.html" title="Vietnam war">Vietnam war</a> or <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_war.html" title="Iraq war">Iraq war</a> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>, One may also believe that Anti-Americanism is a by-product of anger, jealousy, and envy generated by anyone who doesn't posses the same quality of life as the general United States public enjoys (per captia GDP). Logically, this would include less fortunate people also living in the United States<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>.

<dd>The problem Mrd, is that attempting to describe "recent trends" typically deginerates into an anti-Bush rant and suffers from the "if this, why not that problem"--what example is sufficiently clear and obvious that it belongs in the intro? Vietnam and Iraq were chosen because of their breadth. I actually like the intro because it's fairly well-packed with scholarship, and the scholarship seems often to be <i>about the legitimacy of the term.</i> Though maybe it's not perfectly on-target with the body. Perhaps a sentence on geography over time: the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries = Europe, the twenthieth = global, with perhaps a mention of the mid-east. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:13, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">GA nomination comments</span></h2>
<p>It isn't realistic to nominate an article for GA while a section has a template for lack of citations. Someone with Photoshop ought to crop and correct the histogram on an underexposed image of protesters. Also, while the topic of the article <i>is</i> anti-Americanism, it's rather bad taste to show a burning American flag at the very top of the article - not the sort of image very likely to attract further reading by Americans who might wish to understand and <i>correct</i> the problems that lead to anti-American sentiment. Compare to the leading images at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Bosniak_sentiment_89e4.html" title="Anti-Bosniak sentiment">Anti-Bosniak sentiment</a>. Since the article here is not about the particular book whose cover image is depicted, the fair use copyright claim is shaky.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of balance, this article lacks examples of individual Americans who suffered due to prejudices against their country. Compare to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobia.html" title="Russophobia">Russophobia</a>. While violence directed against American civilians due to their nationality has certainly been less severe, the article should mention the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_hostage_crisis.html" title="Iran hostage crisis">Iran hostage crisis</a> and <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> as well as a sampling of other acts such as the murder of wheelchair-bound <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Klinghoffer_ebce.html" title="Leon Klinghoffer">Leon Klinghoffer</a> during the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achille_Lauro_4870.html" title="Achille Lauro">Achille Lauro</a> hijacking. A fair treatment of this topic ought to acknowledge that the United States is not monolithic - individual Americans do not necessarily agree with the practices of their government.

<dd>I think the photo is perfect actually, as it catches one visually and shows the most obvious example of AA expression. Is there any more common symbol of the phenomenon than flag burning?—the act itself may be bad taste; our showing it is not. (Though you may have a point about the fair use claim.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The problems that lead to Anti-American sentiment." No, no, no. Again, all this leads to is anti-Bush tirades or laundry lists of what people don't like about America. We must document the phenomenon as it exists first and foremost (i.e., expression as opposed to putative cause). Of course discussing <i>what</i> will include some discussion of <i>why</i>, and I don't think this is totally absent here. I would also say Wikipedia is not in the business of correcting anyone's behaviour; it should document, not agitate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, the article can certainly be filled out, but after a year-and-a-half of watching it that needs to proceed slowly to avoid the inevitable shitstorms.

<dd><i>"The problems that lead to Anti-American sentiment." No, no, no.</i> This takes my statement out of context. Perhaps I should clarify the point: to many Americans, one of the most offensive acts possible is to burn the flag. The article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> doesn't begin with a reproduction of the <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_7433.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>. Instead it starts with a rally <i>against</i> Islamophobia and closes with an image of the "Stop the hate" campaign by the Islamic Political Party of America. None of the images here challenge Anti-Americanism, nor does the text compensate for that imbalance. This is an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> issue. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 13:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It encapsulates one part of anti-Americanism, namely the POV that it is not based on "reasoned evaluation of specific policies and administrations". It also suggests that the strong aggressive feelings sometimes expressed are representative of the phenomenon. I think it is somewhat of an exaggeration of at least the contemporary situation. In my opinion, the "Anti-American mural" picture would be a better choice at the beginning of the article, and flag-burning could be shown where extreme attitudes are explained in detail. -- <a href="../../../c/o/f/User%7ECoffee2theorems_d84c.html" title="User:Coffee2theorems">Coffee2theorems</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/f/User_talk%7ECoffee2theorems_5669.html" title="User talk:Coffee2theorems">Talk</a> 12:37, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As an afterthought, the picture is particularly unrepresentative if it is also intended to illustrate what is typically criticized as being "anti-American", as the term is mostly used of much less heated forms of expression than flag-burning. -- <a href="../../../c/o/f/User%7ECoffee2theorems_d84c.html" title="User:Coffee2theorems">Coffee2theorems</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/f/User_talk%7ECoffee2theorems_5669.html" title="User talk:Coffee2theorems">Talk</a> 12:47, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I maybe wrong but at present the article only refers to international disagreement with practices of the U.S. Though the introduction and early sections are OK - the latter part of the article appears to want to own the term "anti-American" and run with it, claiming that opposition to certain U.S. practices is inherently "anti-American".

<dd>I didn't spot the "Un-American" caveat at first reading, which maybe is a good reason to expand that area within the article. The second point, the long-standing debate, has to me been unresolved judging by the latter part of the article. The article still attributes sentiments of "anti-Americanism" to subjects where this is surely in dispute. For instance our article says;
<dl>
<dd>"The Vietnam War boosted anti-American sentiment: here, American critics felt, was naked imperialism at its worst"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This (unsourced) sentence is referring to American critics who felt that the war was "imperialism at its worst". No more, no less. It is original research for us to attribute that to "anti-Americanism". That is, as I offer earlier, an example of this article owning the term "anti-American" and running with it. It was the key reason why I forwarded the "anti-Americanism in various countries" to be deleted, which it duly was.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 11:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Propaganda thesis</span></h2>
<p>In the lead, the article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The propaganda thesis has itself been challenged as a form of Anti-Americanism[7] that seeks to frame the consequences of difficult US policy choices as evidence of a specifically American moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.[8]</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't understand what this sentence is implying. I presume that it is referring to works such as Chomsky's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_model.html" title="Propaganda model">Propaganda model</a> in general, rather than a specific propaganda thesis of the term "anti-Americanism", which makes no reference to "American moral failure". I can't imagine why anyone would view the "anti-American"/propaganda thesis as an attempt to describe "American moral failure". This appears to be a mix up. Also, the references do not clarify this and thus I am none the wiser. Can anyone explain what I am missing?--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 16:45, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to answer for Raymond, but I think the point is "scrutiny of standard." Very crudely, the United States acts selfishly—as has, essentially, every nation-station (or pre-national polity) in history. In the case of the contemporary United States, its decisions are magnified given its global role. Thus people "hate" the United States because of Iraq but could not, say, identify Darfur or Chechnya on a map, where state-sponsored (or at least state-allowed) slaughter is greater (perhaps they can't find Iraq either--it just becomes a trope to criticize the US). Step two, after focusing on the American devil while ignoring others, is treating the devilishness as <i>specific to Americans.</i> And then you just wind up with crude bigotries as often as not. Above on this talk, for instance, "american's are narrow minded and really unintelligent&#160;:-)". Great point.</dd>

<dd>Well, if I could answer for myself this time...&#160;;-) Marskell's assessment wasn't quite what I had in mind. That, in itself, is important. The writing is so obscure that it leaves some readers puzzled, while some others who think they understand it draw divergent conclusions.</dd>
<dd>My interpretation may be better illustrated by the parallel term of anti-semitism, where the phenomenon I have in mind is much more common. There are those who claim that charges of anti-semitism are merely a way of short-circuiting criticism of Israel (see e.g., various <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">Guardian</a> columnists), to the point that in some quarters accusing someone of anti-semitism is felt to be equally objectionable as actually holding anti-semitic views. As a result, legitimate complaints of anti-semitism may be dismissed. Replace "anti-semitism" with "anti-Americanism" to obtain my decoding of the sentence in question. I haven't seen much evidence that this phenomenon has a significant part in the debate over anti-Americanism (in contrast to anti-semitism); taking its apparent lack of importance with the obscurity of the wording leads me to the conclusion that the material is best left out. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 00:42, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There were two clauses there "...itself a form of propaganda" and "...a specifically American moral failure", the conflating of which may have been the root of confusion. To shift gears slightly, Josef Joffee defines Anti-Americanism as:
<ul>
<li>reducing Americans to stereotypes;</li>
<li>believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature;</li>
<li>ascribing to the US a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe;</li>
<li>holding the United States responsible for all evils in the world;</li>
<li>and seeking to limit the US by destroying it or cutting oneself of from its polluting influence</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It was this type of demonization that I believe the second clause "...specifically American..." was suggesting, but it was roped into a counter-point of the propaganda model, which didn't make sense.</dd>
<dd>Two simpler sentences:
<ul>
<li>"The propaganda model has been criticized for a counter-vailing tendency to deny legitimate complaints of anti-American stereotyping," i.e., Criticism of the US = Anti-Americanism = short-circuiting criticism; but, Anti-Americanism = propaganda = ignoring real bigotry. If it can be sourced.</li>
<li>"One suggested anti-American pattern is the description of evil or selfish tendencies as specifically American characteristics and world problems as specifically American failures;" or something like that, as a separate point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Scanning the talk page above I see a proposal for the introduction that includes the sentence;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In popular practice, a disparate variety of actions and attitudes critical of the United States have been <b>labeled</b> anti-Americanism, including hostility toward its government and culture.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that the introduction should include, and be centred, around that sentence. In keeping with other introductions of disputed terms on Wikipedia. <b>Labeled</b> is the key word here and would set the tone for the article. We are discussing behaviour that has been <b>labeled</b> anti-American rather than discussing a bunch of people in Liverpool booing Condi Rice for her foreign policy, and other such people who have never been labeled Anti-American to our knowledge. In the article, we want to know <i>who</i> is being labeled anti-American, <i>where</i>, and most importantly - <i>who is doing the labelling</i>. Does anyone have any more thoughts as to whether this should be placed in the intro? --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 21:58, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe the lead should very much be in the manner of the introduction to the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">Evil</a> page. The first sentence is the same as our article - but it is the second sentence where I believe our article sets the wrong tone. On the evil page is states "Evil is sometimes defined as...". Our article states "Contemporary anti-Americanism typically focuses on..." meaning that we are taking a disputed term and running with it. An equivalent would be "Contemporary <i>evil</i> can be found in...". I believe it should read "<i>In popular practice, a disparate variety of actions and attitudes critical of the United States have been labeled anti-Americanism. Contemporary examples typically focus on international opposition to United States policy, though historically the term has been applied to more varied concepts". --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 13:26, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Don't agree with Dan Carkner re:statement concerning the page. If it is sourced and correctly attributed, which I believe it is, then there is no issue. Anti-Americanism <i>has</i> been described as a "belief that the United States and the American way of life is threatening" and similar by significant sources beyond the ones provided on the page. I'm also confident that most people (outside the US) know of someone who shares that belief. It was a common feeling in Europe after the war, alongside a general fear of modernity. Marskell, do you have any thoughts about my proposal for inserting that sentence in the lead. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 19:31, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'd be concerned that we're subtly siding with one half of a difficult debate. Labelled seems to denigrate the applicability of the term and shouldn't be in the first sentence; a consistent pattern on this talk has been an attempt by various to over-analyze the term to the point that the phenomenon can be dismissed. (Paraphrasing Sartre, from Revel: "Anti-Americanism? I don't know what that means.") I'm in favour of relatively didactic first sentences: a) it is a bigotry b) it has a name. I added "the broad range" bit once upon a time per the concern the term is thrown about so often. Perhaps:</dd>

<dd>"Anti-Americanism, often Anti-American sentiment, is a prejudice toward the government, culture, or people of the United States." What it IS. "In practice, a broad range of attitudes and actions hostile or opposed to the United States are labeled Anti-Americanism."

<dd>That is pretty much what I've done (see the page). Though I believe it should be "refers to a prejudice...". Even though I never normally warm to the "refers to.." introductions in wikipedia, in this case I don't believe we should <i>tell</i> readers what the definition of a disputed term is, we should <i>show</i> readers how a term is applied as much as possible. If Satre and Chomsky don't know what that term means, there is no reason why we should jump the gun and own the definition ourselves. Other than that, your two sentences are fine by me. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 11:28, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But now there's redundancy. "Actions and attitudes" twice. The dispute, I would suggest, is not that people can be predjudiced against America but rather whether non-prejudicial stances are swept into the definition. I think "is a prejudice" is fine. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 12:03, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your version of the paragraph now on the page is spot on, Marskell, or as close as. Next, lower down the introduction the article states "<i>Increases in global anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies</i>". Now this is sourced to a perception from a particular writer, Peter W. Rodman. Though the piece is titled "The World's Resentment - anti-Americanism" the writer doesn't elaborate on the term itself, he discusses international diplomacy, policy and perceptions of US unilateralism. I don't believe that Peter W. Rodman owns the defintion of the word "anti-Americanism". Certainly not to the extent where he can attribute it to other parties, and thus make his perceptions unquestionably true. I think it should read <i>Increases in <b>perceived</b> global anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies</i>, or something similar.

<dd>Studies such as the Pew Global Attitudes polls have shown a marked increase in negative views of America after the Iraq war began. I'm not aware of any poll that directly asks the question "are you anti-American?" But the questions are posed in terms of "negative views of America" (or occasionally "Americans"), not disagreement with Bush or specific policies. There may be other studies out there that gauge anti-American sentiment by looking at press reports, demonstrations, and so on. Have to admit I'm a science geek and a bit out of my element here... <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 14:40, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "appears to" qualification refers more to the studies themselves, it still reads as though "anti-Americanism" is a non-disputed defintion. In this case "anti-Americansim" is assumed to be opposition to US foreign policy and unilateralism without qualification. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 10:23, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Failed "good article" nomination</span></h2>
<p>This article failed good article nomination. This is how the article, as of September 23, 2006, compares against the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">six good article criteria</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> The prose is extremely good. This is my fourth review, and umpteenth article read, but I think this article may have some of the best writing I have seen.</dd>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> Everything seems accurate, as far as I know. There is, however, a serious problem with citations. Most sections include ample (and well-formatted) citations. However, certain sections that make fairly broad statements are not sourced. Some quotes have only an author listed, but no information about which publication the author made such a statement. That's a big problem, and it's the main reason the nomination failed.</dd>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> The article is very thorough, and hits on most important points. The only exception is when it comes to the causes of anti-Americanism (see below).</dd>
<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> In the course of my review, I read through the comments on the nomination above. Here is the second big problem with the article: it paints anti-Americanism as unjustified, even going as far as to compare it to anti-Semitism. The article needs to include the motivations behind the <i>French intellectuals, Islamist fundamentalists, South Korean students, Latin American populists, and even Americans themselves</i> who are "anti-American" and provide each group's stated rationale for this sentiment.</dd>
<dd><b>5. Article stability?</b> Not stable at all. There appears to be controversy over whether the nomination was a good idea, so I'm not surprised that many continue to make significant edits.</dd>
<dd><b>6. Images?:</b> Images are all good, and appropriate. The burning flag is probably the easiest-to-recognize symbol of anti-American protest in the world today, so it's inclusion is fine.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I see this essentially renames "History" --&gt; "Causes". I would oppose this as the wrong slant. Should we say that "America's racial make-up <i>caused</i> AA in 19th century Europe" or simply "America was viewed through the eyes of European racism"? Further, it invites the POV tack-ons we see constantly here. "AA has been caused by George Bush/not signing Kyoto/the death penalty/Iraq/McDonalds/lack of gun control/talking too loud". I think we should be careful before opening the "causes" door, as we'll find ourselves commenting on something we can't answer.</dd>

<dd><i>Anti-Americanism in various countries</i> was deleted after almost universal agreement in the afd poll and extensive lobbying by myself. It contained next to no references, was inherently POV by the title and appeared to be written with no understanding of the disputes surrounding the term. I'd argue against any attempt here to recreate the themes of that page here. Even if a source attributes an act to "anti-Americanism" by name - we shouldn't write that up as confirming evidence of "anti-Americanism". It is an allegation made by a particular source. One of the main reasons behind my reticence is that I don't believe US sources are neutral judges when deciding what is "anti-American" behaviour in Europe, Asia, the Americas etc. For example, the deleted page carried an absurd section on Cuba. I knew that every US claim that Cuba is rife with "anti-American" sentiment could be countered by a Cuban source vehemently denying this - praising America/Americans themselves - and being only hostile to specific policies of the US government. Fidel Castro himself is often cited as a high priest of "anti-Americanism" - yet the same person described the people of Harlem as his "closest friends",<a href="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43b/128.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43b/128.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> offered extensive aid to New Orleans which was echoed by the Cuban School of Medicine's call for "solidarity with the American people" <a href="http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/2005/septiembre/05edfidelingles.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/2005/septiembre/05edfidelingles.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and invariably refers to Americans as "noble people" <a href="http://www.cuba.cu/gobierno/discursos/2006/ing/f240106i.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cuba.cu/gobierno/discursos/2006/ing/f240106i.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Notably here, our "anti-American high priest" offered this response to such allegations:

<dd><i>Our struggle is not against the American people. Perhaps no other country receives Americans with the respect and hospitality displayed by Cuba.

<dd>If sources are used to attribute "anti-Americanism" to subjects such as Castro, they should be dealt with in a neutral fashion and not presented as truth or fact.

<dd>Maybe set up a sandbox rather than edit the page so we can see what you have in mind - I'd be very careful about any major restructuring here at this point. Looking at your outline, users may have major concerns. Always remember that <i>we</i> don't get to decide what is "Anti-American" behaviour. To do so is what I would consider taking a disputed term, extracting a particular definition from it, owning it and then running with it. That would be, in essence, original research. I would support keeping this article as on-topic as possible - centred and sourced around the term itself. I don't want to return here and read about how "anti-American" Cubans are supposed to be again, based on some 2+2 theorising.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 14:30, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think that the flag burners jpg is there to push an agenda. I think it is a photo that was selected to evokes an emotional response.

<dd>Mrdthree, I think you have a point about the different connotations of the two images. Though the book cover is pushing the boundaries of promotion somewhat. Do you have any alternative ideas that are less likely to cause edit conflicts? That is, if we need such a representation of a an abstract disputed term at all?

<dd>The book cover is much better in terms of substance -- it's visually striking, and more importantly it implies we're considering the phenomenon in an academic context.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Chomsky</span></h2>
<p>Marksell, you've removed a series of points cited to Chomsky that are key to exploring the usage of the term. You've reasoned this with "Wanders - and POV magnet". Please elaborate? --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 15:05, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wanders b/c I thought the Italian example unneeded after the clearer example of Anti-Sovietism and b/c it devotes too much space to a single source. Chomsky is essentially a polemicist in this regard, after all. Because of his profile he belongs, but in terms of his training, he doesn't deserve primacy. As a further note, this section is essentially a continuation of the intro; all of the points are introduced briefly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>POV magnet should be obvious. People who don't like him (there are many) will do one of two things when reading it: insert <i>ad hominem</i> asides as had already occured ("Aytollah of Anti-Americanism") which is unencyclopedic, or think "well, I'm going to pull out a right-wing polemicist for good measure" and then we'll have a tit-for-tat structure, which is usually quite bad. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:25, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You write "in terms of his training he doesn't deserve primacy". Remember that this is Chomsky we're talking about, who essentially reinvented linguistics in its modern form as academic study, is a key text in discussing propaganda and the media (I should know - I taught it for years), and is the most cited figure around the term "anti-Americanism" both in his writing and in criticisms of his writing. I'm not going to press this and I'll take the page off my watchlist. The page, which stinks at the moment in my view, will have to go without my input. I'm not interested in hearing about how <i>unencyclopedic</i> you think a piece of cited important exploratory detail is (I wrote the "Ayatollah of Anti-Americanism" by the way, it was clearly cited and presented in a neutral fashion), when the page carries unsourced nonsense like "Just as the United States has defined itself against Monarchical and Communist countries during its history".--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 11:36, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this is an unfortunate reply. Re first, "'dismissed with ridicule' in Rome" is less a linguistic comment and more a cultural POV. Of course, he's a fine source for definitions, and this page should definitely mention him, but I just felt the section had had due weight thrown off by explaining at length his political opinions rather than his observations on usage. Plus, the point had already been made above with the O'Conner. Which leads to two: it invites someone else to post a polarized paragraph of equal length (say, pull out the FrontPageMag) and then we'd have a somewhat polemicized section rather than a neutral description of the sources we've tracked down.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critism of Anti-Americanism?</span></h2>
<p>Every good article on controversial topics has a critism section, but not this one! There are some critisms of Anti-Americanism out there, why are they kept from Wikipedia?</p>
<p>One critism I know of is the "snob bashing."</p>
<p>For example: A person writes an Anti-American story about how tough Americans "pretend" to be on the personal level. When she/he receives critismfrom Americans, she/he writes that the critism is proof of the authors claim that Americans are not as tough as they claim to be. However, people who agree with the author are lauded by the author for seeing "the truth."</p>
<p>Many Americans have complained to me of books, stories, hell one even told me a pornographic story (which I later read and based the example on) in which the authors claimed that if Americans responded negatively to the authors writing, it was proof the authors were right. And that when Americans did not respond, the author would either write more anti-American works, or make the claim that she/he "defeated" the americans.</p>
<p>The critism is that this is not a fair way to make critisms of America, its the "snob" or "childish" way to do so, and very un-scientific of emprical results are expected and very unfair to Americans.</p>
<p>In the case of the story above that was the example, I wrote the author saying that "it is unfair to stereotype Americans at the personal level based on little or no research other than the perceptions (the author) received from the nightly news, and (his/her) psychology class. There are strong Americans, there are weak ones. At the individual level every nationality people that would fall into both catagories." I received a email back that it was just proving the authors point that I, as an American, could not stand her writing anything bad about Americans, and that it was proof of our (she/he used "your") inner weakness.</p>
<p>Edited in: Scryer_360 posted that. How do you get the damn auto-sig to work?</p>

<dd>For the auto sig its ~~~~. Right below "show changes" you'll see "sign your name" or, in the icons at the top, you'll notice one that shows the squiggles of a signature. These both do it automatically.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, "every good article on controversial topics has a critism section" is something I disagree with. Many editors are of the opinion that they are a bad idea as they invite people to post rants or personal musings rather than encyclopedic content; <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article__91fe.html#Criticism_sections" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article?">here</a> is one discussion.

<p>Hello, I would like to take a second to introduce myself. I am a student who is writing a research paper on Anti-Americanism.</p>
<p>I am introducing myself because this wikipage, like any good wikipage, has "vested insterests": hardworking authors who have invested a lot of time in this article to make it excellent, and want to keep it that way. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">User:Mrdthree</a> outline above is wonderful.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, I hope with everyones support and blessing, I am going to contribute several dozen hours to this wikipage. I want to let everyone know that although I am admitedely (and often shamefully) very biased, I firmly believe that both sides should have equal time. If you don't like me edits, please let me know.</p>
<p>I look forward to editing this page, and working with you all personally. Thanks to the contributions and suggestions of hundreds of wikieditors, I have written some solid research papers before. This article is already top notch, as the good article editor said above. Thanks to the work of previous editors, I already have information and ideas which I can include in my research paper.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> is a vitally important subject, which has worldwide implications.

<p>I think the outline may be overly detailed and misclassify some things but its the best I can do. Maybe someone else has better ideas about how to classify the stuff? I will put together an example item of anti-american incident. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 16:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm a little iffy at the moment. The previous structure was largely chronological and now that aspect is being shoehorned under various headings. It doesn't read right to have "degeneracy" after "anti-technology", for instance. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well how about giving it a day of criticism and then reverting it back so I can see what people find essential and then rethink the outline. My thought about the chronology is that (almost?) none of the listed criticisms have disappeared. But I admit the chronology of the criticisms arising is not something I thought of when I wrote hte outline. TO me the contemporary column is just there for sake of avoiding the controversy of categorizing current criticism. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 19:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Due to the variety of motives for anti-americanism sentiment, support of this sentiment varies with context. Similarly, some motives are viewed as more or less legitimate by both Americans and non-Americans.</p>
<p>Some Pro-Government Americans criticise Anti-americanism on the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Americans charge that anti-Americanism stems from jealousy, especially from rival powers. This is the traditional argument used to qualify Anti-Americanism in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.<a href="http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5323762" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5323762" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
<li>Conversely, other forms may be attributed to up-and-coming would-be superpowers who wish to unseat the US in status. This is a view of anti-Americanism in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, and the former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</li>
<li>Some attribute anti-Americanism to radical <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. By this view, the critics are viewed as objecting to women's rights and human rights, and therefore viewed as regressive or religiously fanatic. This style of anti-Americanism is considered a common motivation for countries such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, and radical Islamists like <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a>, although many anti-americanists argue that "radicalism" is simply a label attached by the Americans.</li>
<li>Some view much anti-Americanism as a left-over effect from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, and anti-<a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalist.html" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> sentiment in general. Because the United States is a prominent capitalist country (which can be viewed as either a virtue or a fault), it is assumed to logically follow that many anti-American critics will be motivated by economic philosophies in their arguments. This is often the argument leveled against <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a> protesters.</li>
<li>Some critics hold consistent criticism against American policies, by the Left as well as by foreign critics. The claim often made is "damned if we do, damned if we don't". Thus American intervention in 1999 in Kosovo led to popular protests in Europe, while the UN has criticized America's <i>non</i>-intervention in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. According to this view, no policy by the United States can ever hope to satisfy everyone and all US actions will inevitably be interpreted and presented in a negative way.</li>
<li>Other critics of anti-Americanism claim that it is a simplistic view or over-generalization, sometimes bordering on discrimination. However, the objection often raised is that since Americans are not a race, it cannot technically be called "racism". It should be noted that early forms of anti-Americanism indeed had racist overtones, such as French naturalists' view that North American flora and fauna were biologically inferior.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Stereotypes that Americans are somehow more "fat" or "stupid" than other people are sometimes criticized as prejudiced, and are often center around an assumed image of Americans as a universally <a href="../../../w/a/s/WASP_ca86.html" title="WASP">WASP</a> people.</li>
<li>Some critics draw parallels between modern anti-Americanism and the defamation campaign against European Jews during the 1920s and 30s. One example would be a controversy in Germany about a caricature depicting American investment bankers as mosquitoes with top hats, labeled "die Aussauger" (the suckers),<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> imagery that in the view of some critics resembles a caricature depicting "the Jew" as a spider.</li>
<li>Some critics argue that anti-American criticism from the Left is sometimes in line with criticism from nationalist movements, or radical Islamists. They charge that well-meaning critics are unwittingly aiding causes that are not considered "progressive". One example would be in Japan, where both anti-American right wing groups ('<a href="../../../u/y/o/Uyoku.html" title="Uyoku">uyoku</a>') and Leftists agitate against American military bases, while only the right wing groups also agitate for a rearmament of Japan with nuclear weapons.</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">...MYTH #5: ANTI-AMERICANISM IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
<p>Phrased in this way, this myth seems terribly naive to many. Bur it represents the belief held by the great bulk of U.S. policymakers and observers of US. world affairs, which is that the United States is fundamentally a force for democracy and prosperity around the world and that any disagreements between it and other countries can be resolved to the satisfaction of both. This myth grows out of the deep roots of the U.S. self-image as a Wilsonian "innocent abroad" on the world stage, and maintains that there is a false dichotomy between U.S. and foreign interests. According to the optimists and patriots who wholly buy into this myth, anti-Americanism is the result of false perceptions and misinformation...</p>
<p>...Seeing anti-Americanism as a mere image problem reinforces the widely held neoliberal assumption that what is good for the United States is good for the rest of the world. This simplification frees officials from the responsibility of doing anything to change the painful realities that give rise to negative images in the first place...</p>
<p>...To counter the anti-American hostility that spread out from the ripples of the Cuban Revolution in the 1960s. the strategy in Washington, where officials were ready to conjure up images of pathology, was to cure what CIA Director Allen Dulles called "Castro-itis" with a good old-fashioned dose of salesmanship. The highly image-conscious John F. Kennedy, for instance, actively championed a more prominent role for the USIA, which included a huge boost in anti-Castro propaganda to Latin America. He multiplied the aid budget and renamed it the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_for_Progress_efbf.html" title="Alliance for Progress">Alliance for Progress</a>, and he and wife Jackie - she a Spanish speaker and both being Catholics-made frequent, highly successful goodwill visits to Latin America. On the one hand, Kennedy's strategy worked well enough: a survey of seven Latin American nations found that. "in all seven countries--the overwhelming majority of those aware of the Alliance, [sic] also approve of it, with opposition to the program averaging 1 percent in all seven countries and indifference averaging about 3 percent." 24</p>
<p>On the other hand after 1959 the U.S. government admitted to almost no wrongdoing in Latin America. As Castro erased U.S. influence from Cuba by taking over U.S.-owned farms, alarm bells sounded in Havana and Washington. Expropriation was theft, U.S. landowners argued (not without some reason), and the State Department agreed. But it was more than that. Expropriation was typically irrational "Yankee-hating" because U.S. landowners had been good to Cuba. U.S. officials repeatedly argued this line to Cuban officials, who shook their heads in disbelief. Nor once did U.S. policymakers express doubts about the benefits of U.S. foreign investment to Cubans. Not once did they suggest that owners who valued their land four or five times higher than their taxable amount were greedy. And not once did they concede that maybe, just maybe, U.S. investment had been exploitative. The dialogue of the deaf that surrounded the Cuban Revolution was another reminder of the long-standing U.S. reluctance to plumb the depths of anti-U.S. discontent.</p>

<p>My edit:</p>
<p><b>Anti-Americanism</b>, often <b>Anti-American sentiment</b>, is opposition or hostility toward the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_the_United_States_235d.html" title="Government of the United States">government</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_States_a6a3.html" title="Culture of the United States">culture</a>, or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_the_United_States_f832.html" title="Demographics of the United States">people</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-dic_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dic" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first edit is unsourced. I added a the words "opposition or hostility" from the Random House Unabridged Dictionary.</p>
<p>Basically, there are two ways that people see Anti-Americanism, they see it as "internally" (i.e. what America is) often embraced by conservatives, or "externally" (i.e. what America does) often embraced by liberals. Some serious scholars have recently studies anti-Americanism and came up with a more complex picture: that Anti-Americanism is both. Maybe I can post some of the research papers on this soon. I already added one in the external links section.</p>
<p>Stating that <b>Anti-Americanism</b> is prejudice is an internal view point.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that two of the quotes in the opening sentence which I looked up, are from O'Connor, who subscribes to the "interal" view of anti-Americanism:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I argue that anti-Americanism is not a comprehensive or coherent belief system or ideology, but rather a series of criticisms and prejudices regarding America that have haphazardly been labelled anti-Americanism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A better introduction would be an explanation of internal and external viewpoints, and the new research in the field. I think O'Connor has a part in this wikiarticle, but in the internal section. I don't want to squelch anyones contributions, and I want all major voices to be heard in this article.</p>
<p>I will add some links too some of the articles right now, and if I get around to it, I will write some of these ideas into the article. That way the article reflects scholarly research on the subject too. Signed: RWV 23:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've read the dictionaries. I don't want to revert over it, but will only recapitulate the discussion: because "hostile" and "opposed" are open to interpretation, reducing it to the simplest is simplest. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what explanation you're referring to. "Hostile and opposed" is a re-addition, not an addition, BTW. It had read as such for eight months.

<p>...Drawing from the rich literature on anti-Americanism, one type of factor influencing attitudes towards the United States may be described as "external." Several authors have proposed that external factors are attitudes toward the United States determined by the character of U.S. foreign policies and actions, ranging from military campaigns so the export of Hollywood movies. Other authors emphasize "internal" factors as causal agents. They argue that foreign attitudes derive from the particular psychological, cultural or political aspects of each nation. The relative importance of the classification of these two factors has become a subject of heated debate both inside and outside the United Stares, leading to the polarization of public discussion on the United States image abroad...</p>

<p>Changed مرک بر آمريكا to مرگ بر آمريكا. Also, the literal translation of that is the famous 'Death to (upon) America', not 'Down with the USA' or anything as euphemistic - though the interpretation of the phrase may differ, the literal translation is pretty direct. I leave this to the discretion of other editors though. My Persian is very limited, so I may stand to be corrected. Just thought I'd mention it (forgive me for not going through the archives to check if it already had). Wouldn't hurt to mention Jalal Al-e Ahmad's term, <i>gharbzadegi</i> غربزدگى ("Westoxication") in the middle east section either - though the translation to "gharbzadegi" is ultimately lost in translation (and beyond my meager skills). <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a> 18:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But see, "مرگ" means more than "death" in Persian. It is much more metaphorical than that. Like, if I said "Marge Bizâns" (The death of the Byzantines) I am not speaking of a literal death, but rather their downfall. And also, it doesn't really make much sense to translate "Marg bar Komyunizm" to mean "Death to communism". It means "Down with communism". This is not a euphemism. --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime"><font color="red">Ķĩřβȳ</font></a><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam"><font color="green">♥</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirbytime_d8cd.html" title="User talk:Kirbytime"><font color="pink">Ťįɱé</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirbytime_b7f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirbytime"><font color="blue">Ø</font></a> 02:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the editor who deleted out the polomic from the anon.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-Americanism&amp;curid=283797&amp;diff=84885672&amp;oldid=84817267" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-Americanism&amp;curid=283797&amp;diff=84885672&amp;oldid=84817267" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Too many people (mostly patriotic Americans?) feel that discussing anti-Americanism is anti-American. IMHO these editors are putting their head in the sand. Anti-Americanism is strong, and getting stronger. Denying its existence does not make it go away.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this article is slanted to what scholars call the "internal view" that Anti-Americanism is, to be very simplistic, "everyone elses fault". I see this bias in some of the comments of some of the editors above also.</p>
<p>Does this mean I am unbiased? No. I gravitate to the "external view", that people hate america for what it does. This does not mean that the internal view does not have merit, it definetly does.</p>
<p>I just argue that if this article is to be a truly encyclopedic article, then wikieditors on this article will have to write in a less biased way, using scholarly research (see the external links section which I added) with all <b>scholarly</b> hypothesis being equally heard. All sides should be in this article even if some editors, with those scholarly views. I argue that even if <b>most</b> editors disagree with these scholarly views, these scholarly views should be in the article.</p>
<p>I would change the article myself, but the subject simply does not interest me enough to spend the hours changing it, which would be required...So, like the editors above, I will rant here, which is must easier. :)</p>
<p>Further, lets all keep in mind that wikipedia is not a web blog. New editors are the most guilty of going off on long polemics like the anon did. This is understandable, as a new editor, I used too also. I am still trying hard to curb this desire to rant....I am getting better, but I still often go off on irrelevant topics.

<dd>If you are truly interested in the subject, I would suggest reading some of the articles posted in the external links section. Some of the non-peer reviewed articles are good too, and less time commitment (you get out what you put in). Your answer would probably fall into the "internal" camp. They hate us for what we are, not for what we do... Some researchers say there is no such thing as these two camps [the doctronial dissertation from Louisiana posit (theorizes) about this (I think I am using the word "posit" correctly], and they are both external and internal reasons for anti-americanism. I agree with the external/internal idea the most, but for simplicities sake I only quote the two oposite polls.

<dd>No where in my last post did I ever state that anti-Americanism was a personal opinion; it is to some scale, however, an international opinion. Don't you think that the negative opinion the world holds of American individuals should be included in this article? I daresay that the main reason many people dislike Americans as a group is not because of their fundamental opposition to American foreign policy, but rather because of the rude American tourist they met once. I cannot back this up with statistics, but I do suggest that someone more knowledgable than me attempt to, because I am sure that this is just as prevalent as the other aspects of anti-Americanism discussed in this article. I might also say that it is extremely ignorant for you to say that, "they hate 'us' for what we are, not for what 'we' do..." and, veteran user or not, this too is an opinion, but I am not game for a personal feud. My suggestion is simply that the aforementioned aspect of anti-US attitudes be included in the article, because, like it or not, it is extremely prevalent and thus important.
