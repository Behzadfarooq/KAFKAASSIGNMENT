<p>I disagree with your block of me last night. I will admit I was out of line when I vandalized Redvars page, and left him a nasty note. However I felt abused by him, and unfortunately responded in a negative fashion unstead of appropriately. Although I apologize for my actions and admit my wrong, I will note at the time I was being harassed by other individuals who abused their power in an attempt to torment me. <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.136.222.198.html" title="User:74.136.222.198">74.136.222.198</a> 06:42, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You redirected the featured article on the Main Page to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a>, were blocked for three hours, and then you launched a series of vicious personal attacks on everyone who defended Wikipedia against your malicious actions, including a bizarre "justification" for the autofellatio redirect, and you were blocked again. Now you are claiming that others abused <i>you</i>? <i>What??</i> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 14:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That characterization is not accurate in the least and you know it. It seems you are indeed fond of abuse. Yes, I redirected the featured article as a joke. I indeed deserved a warning, not a block. I was enraged by the characterization provided by Redvars, and in anger responded to harshly. Aeon1006 decided at that point to warn me, I attempted to dispute his claims and he embarked on a campaign of harassment, removing all of my comments. I did not, as you so inaccurately put it, launch a series of vicious personal attacks on everyone who defended Wikipedia from my "malicious actions". My actions against Redvars were sadly, malicious, but the same is not true towards anyone else. <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.136.222.198.html" title="User:74.136.222.198">74.136.222.198</a> 15:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely disagree. There was nothing wrong with my block. You do NOT get a "free pass" to vandalise once (i.e. the "warning" you think was an entitlement of yours), and you do not get a "free pass" to leave nasty comments just because you didn't like the consequences to your earlier action. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 23:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not obvious to me. I've never heard of it, though it gets a lot of Google hits. Somewhere within the GIS section, certainly: maybe one of the GIS articles needs a section on active projects to assemble experts and data within specific sub-disciplines. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 19:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Antandrus,</p>
<p>I'm stuck trying to transport a nice image of a <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinet.html" title="Spinet">spinet</a> from the French Wikipedia to the English one. It looks like it's legit, but I can't summon up a proper license for it. Could you take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Epinette_Rouaud.jpeg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Epinette_Rouaud.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Epinette_Rouaud.jpeg</a> and let me know if there's any way to address the conundrum described there?</p>

<dd>Yikes. I'm looking, but it's not obvious to me, yet. Thanks for finding the image though!

<p>I thought it probably was him, but I was assuming good faith, for no particular reason. I'm really tempted to put that "This article is crap" template on the List of clichés in music page, but I won't. I've already gotten on enough peoples' nerves there. I was accused of holding the article hostage&#160;:P I'm afraid that if I tried to make it better, as one editor suggests, I would be accused of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I do keep thinking of an excellent sourced one, though: "By the end of the decade [1580s] the <i>concerto di donne</i> was a courtly cliché in northern Italy." (Newcomb, 99) I'm encorporating a bunch of stuff from Newcomb into that article now, and when I'm done I think I'll have a Peer review, so look forward to some talk page spam&#160;:-) Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 02:59, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ROFL, that is a temptation, no? Heh. --Hey, imagine what Wikipedia would be like if it were edited by Italians around 1580. You think <i>this</i> place is drama? &#160;;-) I'm looking forward to <i>concerto di donne</i>: I may actually have something to contribute for a change!

<p>- Victory is mine now and forever, you people can not even listen to least reason and especially when I was right many times. The only thing Heros was right is that i am not squid, i may be g reeves dude, but i was accused of bs i had nothing to do with... So many mistakes I found on wiki, you have no idea, some I reverted, some corrected, most I will not touch, besides all post graduate programs are informed and do not use wiki as reliable source...</p>
<p>I have bachelor's in history and music was my minor, I know a lot on and about your kind of music, including composition, I could have done a lot for you and even contributed to music, but alas, you all made up your mind against me long time and ah well, I am wasting my time again on loosers, but you, mak, curps and few others lost! And go back to school of ethics, the ethics you have are the ones you made up in your bird-brains. And so much for your philosophy....

<p>What you mean nice day, you accused me of vandalizing pages I've never heard of before, shame on you all, great detectives you are, many times I had terrible belly laugh from the garbage you wrote about me or the great "investigation" you did into me, lol, all, mostly, wrong. And the way you block people is totally unjustified, there are classic examples all over, like below.

<p>Dear Antandrus, thank you so much for your beautiful words, your kidness and your trust in me. My <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Phaedriel_2_3e0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Phaedriel 2">Request for Adminship</a> is finally over, and the support and appreciation that the community has gifted me will stick in my mind as long as I live. I have no way to properly express how grateful I am to you for all you've done for me, and all I can tell you is, I'll try not to disappoint you nor anyone else with my use of the buttons... and if I mess up, make sure to <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel">come here</a> and give me a good yell!&#160;:) Seriously, tho, if you ever need my help, either for admin-related stuff or in any other way, you'll always be welcome to message me, and I promise I'll try my very best.<br />
Dear Antandrus, this is the perfect opportunity to finally speak to one another after reading your words for months and months. I am sure that we'll be able to talk often, and trust me, it'd be my pleasure. Both your contributions and, most important your warm way to deal with others made me notice you long, long ago; and being supported by a person I look up to, like you, meant the world to me. I sincerely hope this is but the beginning of a friendship, and such thought fills me with joy. Please, take good care, and visit me any time you wish!&#160;:) With a big hug, your friend,</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">I enjoyed your article on the composer John Bull. In your article, you mention that there's evidence that he was involved in espionage missions for Queen Elizabeth.

<p><font color="#FF0000">Hello Antandrus,</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">I'm wondering if I can seek your advice. I've recently been involved in a dispute with <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_klein_03ef.html" title="User:Robin klein">User:Robin klein</a> that has greatly exacerbated my <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikistress_dd0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikistress">wikistress</a>. I'm wondering if you would be so kind as to assist me in two ways: firstly, as an experienced editor and music scholar, to offer a third opinion, and secondly, to advise me as to how I might have handled or should continue to handle the situation in the most productive and cooperative fashion possible.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The dispute began on the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> page. I copyedited the lead to try to make it clearer and more understandable and my edits were reverted without comment. I then began a discussion on the article's <a href="../../../m/u/s/Talk%7EMusic_6eea.html" title="Talk:Music">talk page</a>. To my chagrin, this apparent feud continued on the issue of <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_instrumental_music.html" title="Voice instrumental music">Voice instrumental music</a>. I found this article a while back, couldn't understand what it was about, and tried to copyedit it for a while. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">User:Hyacinth</a> changed it to a redirect to vocal music, calling it <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>, and moved the rest of the contents to <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocal_music.html" title="Vocal music">Vocal music</a>, after which I copyedited more, removing a lot of what did not seem appropriate for a survey of vocal music. I now think the article was OR as I cannot find any use of the term "voice instrumental music", other than mirror sites of wikipedia. Robin, as the initial author, feels differently. Her comments are on on <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkBuckles_11a7.html#Voice_instrumental_music" title="User talk:MarkBuckles">my talk page</a> and my comments on <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobin_klein_85dc.html#Music_article" title="User talk:Robin klein">her talk page</a>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">I don't wish to burden you - I'm just not sure what's best to do in this situation and I hoped you might be able to help. Thank you.

<dd><font color="#FF0000">Thanks for getting back to me! I didn't realize you were on Wikibreak when I first posted this. I hope the conference went/is going well! The situation has become amicable most thankfully, but has not been resolved. There are two unrelated issues. First, the lead of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a> article. Some discussion regarding this at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Talk%7EMusic_6eea.html" title="Talk:Music">Talk:Music</a>. Second, the future of <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_instrumental_music.html" title="Voice instrumental music">Voice instrumental music</a> or its former content. Copious discussion of this at both our talk pages. I would be most grateful to get a third educated and experienced opinion, whether or not you agree with my views. Your general advice on the interaction is also quite welcome. I think I'm learning from this experience and I'm hoping to improve my general method of Wikitalk. Since text-based communication tends to be dehumanizing in a way, and because people are inherently protective of their creations (even though this is a Wiki), I've found assuming good faith to be extremely important at all times - and not just that you assume it, but that you actively demonstrate it in the tone and content of your messages, since that's all we have to go by. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkBuckles_4300.html" title="User:MarkBuckles">MarkBuckles</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkBuckles_11a7.html" title="User talk:MarkBuckles">(talk)</a> 06:00, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Hello. I'm afraid I'm having a bit of a tango with <a href="../../../d/a/f/User%7EDafoeberezin3494_6b6c.html" title="User:Dafoeberezin3494">Dafoeberezin3494</a> concerning several major changes that he or she been undertaking in the "classical composers" catagory. I posted something about this on August 12th at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music/Noticeboard#What_is_going_on_with_the_catagory_of_.22composers.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music/Noticeboard#What_is_going_on_with_the_catagory_of_.22composers.3F" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>], but haven't had any response. At my suggestion, he or she has posted something to the composers project page at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Composers#Are_my_edits_helpful.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Composers#Are_my_edits_helpful.3F" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] but this seems to be escalating rather than deflating.</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FF0000">My main problem is that he or she is using very questionable sources (a textbook generally used in non-music major Music appreciation classes at American Universities, "standard repertoire" lists and the like....) and has a tendency to use lots of non-POV language such as "the greatest", "the best" , "the most important". This wouldn't really be a problem except that he or she works very quickly and this is starting to change the whole structure of the catagorization of composers. I can personally can foresee several problems with this.</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FF0000">This person should obviously be encouraged as a young person with lots of energy, but quite frankly, I'm not the person to do so as we're not getting on at all. I'm wondering if you would mind perhaps communicating a bit about this and perhaps giving some insight. I think that if I say anything else, that this person is probably going to explode. And really, at this point, I would quite understand. It's just not a "fair fight". If you can't help with this, I would appreciate your passing this on to someone who can. Thanks in advance.
