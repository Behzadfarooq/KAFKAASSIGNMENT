Anthony in the Big Brother house</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Anthony Hutton</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>) is a <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">70s</a> dancer and former <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairdresser.html" title="Hairdresser">hairdresser</a> from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consett.html" title="Consett">Consett</a>, in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Durham_194a.html" title="County Durham">County Durham</a>. Anthony first appeared in the public eye when he appeared as a contestant on the sixth series of the reality TV show <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_UK_series_6_8d5d.html" title="Big Brother UK series 6">Big Brother</a>. Anthony triumphed as winner of the series, just narrowly beating fellow contestant <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Sully_d616.html" title="Eugene Sully">Eugene Sully</a> to the £50,000 prize. Since leaving the house Anthony experienced a taste of fame, but this was short-lived and, despite the occasional television or public appearance, Anthony has now returned to his home town of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consett.html" title="Consett">Consett</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Durham_194a.html" title="County Durham">County Durham</a> and returned to normal life. He was born in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, and raised in <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Anthony_in_Big_Brother" id="Anthony_in_Big_Brother"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Hutton_1195.html" title="Edit section: Anthony in Big Brother">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anthony in Big Brother</span></h2>
<p>Anthony became famous in the house for his variety of catchphrases, including "Alreet!" (All right in his <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geordie.html" title="Geordie">Geordie</a> <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accent_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Accent (linguistics)">accent</a>) and shouting out "Taxi".</p>
<p>Upon his entrance to the Big Brother house Anthony had the unusual honour of being the first Big Brother UK winner to be booed, due to his insistence on posing and performing his trademark dance moves for the crowd (once in the house he told his fellow housemates that the security guards who told him to move along were the ones who were being booed).</p>
<p>In Week 6, it was rumoured that Anthony had had sexual intercourse with <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makosi_Musambasi_4b96.html" title="Makosi Musambasi">Makosi</a> in the pool. Makosi denied this at first, but later claimed she was "95% certain" that she was pregnant with his baby. During their final interviews on leaving the house, <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemal_Shahin_4ffb.html" title="Kemal Shahin">Kemal Shahin</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Coates_49ae.html" title="Craig Coates">Craig</a> (who was in the pool at the time) and Anthony all denied the couple had had sex. However, Makosi's side of the story has been backed up in print by <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlaith_McAllister_9889.html" title="Orlaith McAllister">Orlaith McAllister</a>. Fellow housemate Maxwell believes they had sexual intercourse too, and Craig also thought this at the time (it is not known when Craig changed his opinion on the matter). Makosi sold her story to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a> and claimed she did have sex with Anthony. The same day the story went on sale, both contestants appeared on the <a href="../../../b/b/l/BBLB_d037.html" title="BBLB">BBLB</a> Reunion show. During his interview, incensed at Makosi stating she could prove it whilst Anthony was being interviewed, Anthony shouted over to her "You know you can't, you're an absolute liar!" and had to be told to calm down by the show's presenter, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermot_O%27Leary_f71b.html" title="Dermot O'Leary">Dermot O'Leary</a>.</p>
<p>During Anthony's stay in the house he became close with a gay hairdresser named <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Coates_49ae.html" title="Craig Coates">Craig Coates</a>; it was widely spread amongst the fellow contestants and the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> that Craig was obsessing over Anthony and this caused him to be branded with the "<a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatal_Attraction_7e33.html" title="Fatal Attraction">bunny boiler</a>" image on the outside. Upon his eviction from the house Craig was shocked that he had been branded a "bunny boiler" and refused to endorse it. Since leaving Big Brother, Anthony refuses to criticise Craig, perhaps recognising how much Craig helped him to win. Craig has said in a radio interview that he is no longer friends with Anthony, although their friendship was recently the butt of jokes in the August 17 edition of Big Brother's Little Brother, where Anthony was a phone-in guest.</p>
<p>Anthony appeared in the 2005 and 2006 series of Sky One's The Match producing credited appearances noticed by the Legends his Celebrity squad faced. But most notably by the viewers who voted him to receive the Man of the Match award in both series he has appeared in show.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Hutton_1195.html" title="Edit section: After Big Brother">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After Big Brother</span></h2>
<p>Upon leaving the house Anthony, like the vast majority of the other ex-housemates, received a large amount of attention from the press and the public; this generated Anthony into a well known celebrity for a short period of time, with Anthony making various public and television appearances. Anthony also did various photo shoots (some naked) for <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazines.html" title="Magazines">magazines</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid_newspaper.html" title="Tabloid newspaper">Tabloid newspapers</a>.</p>
<p>Anthony also recently appeared on the <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_One_1b6b.html" title="Sky One">Sky One</a> reality television series, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Match_%28TV_series%29_a4b5.html" title="The Match (TV series)">The Match</a> and has also appeared on <a href="../../../b/b/l/BBLB_d037.html" title="BBLB">BBLB</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother%27s_Big_Mouth_c333.html" title="Big Brother's Big Mouth">Big Brother's Big Mouth</a> numerous times. Anthony also released a work-out video which revolved around his 70s disco dance movements; despite recently winning <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_UK_series_6_8d5d.html" title="Big Brother UK series 6">Big Brother</a>, Anthony's work-out DVD failed to sell well.</p>
<p>Despite occasional television and public appearances Anthony has now returned to normal life in his home town of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consett.html" title="Consett">Consett</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Durham_194a.html" title="County Durham">County Durham</a>, mainly due to the fact that he is no longer in the public eye as a new series of Big Brother has ended meaning that Anthony's successor <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Bennett_2548.html" title="Pete Bennett">Pete Bennett</a> is now experiencing the limelight.</p>
<p>Anthony was a phone in guest on the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">August 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> episode of <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother%27s_Little_Brother_5e23.html" title="Big Brother's Little Brother">Big Brother's Little Brother</a></i>, and he stated that he was supporting housemate <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glyn_Wise_9e59.html" title="Glyn Wise">Glyn Wise</a> to win the show, however the following day <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Bennett_2548.html" title="Pete Bennett">Pete Bennett</a> was announced winner of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_7%29_a7ce.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 7)"><i>Big Brother 7</i></a>.</p>
<p>Anthony made an appearance on Party Poker on the morning of 8 February 2007 for the European Masters Tournament, but was the third person to lose his chips on the table.</p>
