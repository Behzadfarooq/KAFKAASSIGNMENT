<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction to Possible causes of Anti-American sentiment</span></h2>
<p>I do not like that part. "Anti-American sentiment is a broad term" is a non-information. I find hard to see that any reasonable person would honestly claim that any racist sentiment could be "legitimate", and those who allegedly hold it - I deleted them - are probably spread all over the world - I know that there are many in Korea and Muslim communities in Asia and I find hard to believe that there are none in Africa. The opinions parts of this article connect to "anti-Americanism" are widespread in the US as well. Plus, it is ridiculous to put emphasis on left-wing intellectuals. Intellectuals per se are not more racist than average people, and have no doubt that Neonazis hate the US as much as any "evil commie". <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 21:55, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If "anti-Americanism" is taken to mean criticism of American foreign policy or culture, it isn't racist. Nowhere is it claimed that racist sentiment is legitimate. I'm fine with no singling out any particular groups in the intro, in fact I'd prefer it â€” I just didn't want to make too radical a change from the previous version. It is certainly informative to say that anti-Americaan sentiment is a broad term, because it's important to know that no-one agrees on what exactly it is, or whether the term is even meaningful. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 22:01, 29 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If "anti-Americanism" is taken to mean criticism of American foreign policy then we have to start articles about "anti-Indianism", "anti-pakistaniism", "anti-Saudiism", "anti-Japanism", "anti-Libyanism", etc., etc. Words ending on -ism and describing an attitude usually label a strong, nearly fanatical conviction of something, like marxism, jingoism, anti-semitism. Hence when connected with "anti-" and a particular country they are racist. The problem is that many try to label criticism of policies as anti-...ism in order to defame and downplay it. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 01:41, 30 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately we can't change the meaning of the word in order to make it easier to write articles on it. Many people who criticize American government policy only, and actually praise other aspects of America (e.g. <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chomsky.html" title="Chomsky">Chomsky</a>) are <i>frequently</i> labelled as anti-American. True, this may be deliberate exaggeration in order to dicredit such people, <i>or</i> there may be people who genuinely believe (wrongly, IMO) that strong criticism the government during a war is anti-American. The article needs to take into account the whole range of POVs. I do agree that "anti-Americanism" looks like it ought to mean fanatical and irrational dislike of anything American, but the fact is that so many people who aren't like that at all are labelled anti-American that we have to be a bit more flexible about what the word means. Still I would be welcome to see a careful distinction between people/things that are <i>accused</i> of being anti-American and people/things which almost undoubtably <i>are</i> anti-American by any reasonable definition of the word. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 12:54, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not important if neonazis hate america just as much as commies or more. The important part is that historicly propaganda spread by the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> has greatly increased antiamericanism across the world. Earlier propaganda by the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> was much less spread and has been almost completly forgoten.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is your opinion that:</dd>
<dd>* "Soviet propaganda" was propaganda.</dd>
<dd>* It increased anti-Americanism (whatever you take that to be).</dd>
<dd>We cannot state these things as facts in the intro; it's too controversial and POV. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 12:54, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think no one would reject that there was anti-American propaganda in the Soviet Union or Islamic countries and that it increased anti-Americanism in the countries of the Warsaw Pact and Islamic countries. What we should not do is pretend that legitimate criticism of the US could legitimately be labeled anti-Americanism or that this kind of racism was more widespread in Europe than elsewhere or that leftist intellectuals had a greater tendency to it than working class nationalists. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 16:47, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mostly agree with you here. However, we should <i>not</i> call anti-American propaganda in the Soviet Union propaganda, because calling anything propaganda is inherently POV. Of course, if we had any specific examples of such propaganda, we could certainly point to information showing it to be false â€” a far more NPOV aproach. My issue with your argument is only that "anti-American(ism)" is frequently used to label people who are <i>clearly</i> not racist or reflexively against anything that has any association with America, and this useage of the term (even if it has its origins in hyperbole and smear-tactics) should be mentioned and discussed in the article, since it is so widespread. Othwerwise, the article is in danger of implying that lots of (potentially) legitimate criticisms of America are anti-American. If we really want to describe anti-Americanism as a form of racism, we would have to remove <i>all</i> mention of criticism of American culture and foreign policy from the article, since such criticism could not have anything to do with anti-Americanism in this narrow (racist) sense. (NB: I do not regard criticism of specific aspects of a country's culture to be racist, which may be moderately controversial, I don't know. In any case, my point about foreign policy still stands...) <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 17:53, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I live close to the former Berlin wall. That wall was called "anti-fascist protection fence" by the government of the GDR. Do you think this should not be called propaganda?
<dl>
<dd>It shouldn't be called propaganda for the reasons I gave above. It's fine to explain why it is usually preceived as propaganda, though. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 20:30, 30 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Propaganda just means that the information was presented in a way to fit the ideological preferences of the one who uses it. It is overdone if you always avoid the term propaganda. The "Country of Evil" term is clearly propaganda, as were Soviet terms used towards the US. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 20:36, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Calling something propaganda implies that it isn't true, which is POV in the case of subjective statements such as "X is evil" or "X is Fascist". Easier for everyone to avoid using the P word in such circumstances, or at least explain <i>who</i> thinks that it's propaganda and <i>why</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 20:43, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is legitimate to write that anti-American racism exists, that "anti-Americanism" is often used to defame and downplay legitimate criticism of the US and understanding those legitimate criticisms is vital for understanding "anti-American" racism because the negligence to distinguish between criticism of particular aspects of a country and hatred towards the country as a whole is what makes the difference between racists and critics. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 20:25, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with what you say, but it's still POV. Anti-Americanism is often used to describe non-racist sentiments. This is <i>possibly</i> owing to exaggeration on the part of the user of the word, but it <i>might</i> be because they actually think that certain criticisms of American policy or culture are inherently anti-American. For example, flag-burning is not racist by any stretch of the imagination, but people who indulge in the practice might well be described as anti-American by commentators on the right. In my opinion, this is because they're using smear-tactics â€” labelling people who make legitimate protest as anti-American when in fact they are not, but this is just one POV. We can't promote this POV in the article, because it isn't NPOV to imply that large number of right-wing commentators are duplicitous in their use of the word. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 20:43, 30 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Well I completely disagree, and so would a lot of other people. You can't promote that POV in the article. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>The sentence <i>"Anti-American sentiment" is a broad term, and opinions vary greatly on what constitutes anti-American sentiment, whether it is legitimate, who holds it, and what can be said to cause or explain it.</i> is obsolete after the introduction. If you want to keep parts of it move them to the top, it does not make sense to define the term twice.
<dl>
<dd>I do not want to keep the Muggeridge quote because it makes seem as if anti-Americanism was mainly based on envy which I doubt very much and that explanation is described above already. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 20:40, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The first one is also the one that I suggested to Cecropia. We should not have titles like "anti-" at all, they are inherently not neutral - except for <i>anti</i>biotics and such 8^p I do not like the fourth variant because this article does not only deal with criticism but also with racism. Second and third are to wide because one might start to sneak in opinions on a whole bunch of things that are not connected with the topic - like they have the best baseball team, the most beautiful vice president, the greatest camping areas or whatsoever. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 22:24, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Would you criticize an title like <i>"Pro- and anti-American sentiments"</i> as much? I think "anti-American" is a word of such wide spread that it is merited to be put in a title. It's nothing Wikipedia has made up. It's one important aspect limiting the posibilities of many a democratic US-friendly government (and some undemocratic also, I think).</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">4.228's paragraph about Canada</span></h2>
<p>An anonymous user in the IP range 4.228 has been repeatedly trying to insert this paragraph for several days now:</p>

<dd>It is worth noting in this connection that patriotism and nationalism exists all throughout the world. One particularly egregious example is the Canadian press, which often purports that Canada is more racially diverse than the United States. Many Canadians believe this, when in fact, 87% of Canada is white <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/Ethnicity/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;View=1&amp;Code=0&amp;Table=2&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;B1=Distribution" class="external autonumber" title="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/Ethnicity/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;View=1&amp;Code=0&amp;Table=2&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;B1=Distribution" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.statcan.ca/english/census2001/dict/pop127.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statcan.ca/english/census2001/dict/pop127.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Many Canadians are also unaware that <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_in_Canada_f5f6.html" title="Slavery in Canada">slavery</a> existed in Canada's history and that discrimination still <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Canadian_dd2a.html" title="Black Canadian">exists</a>.</dd>

<p>But Get-back-world-respect and I have been removing it because this paragraph is purely about Canada, whereas this article is about what people think of <i>America</i>. Rather than discuss it here, he's been trying to sneak it in via various deceitful edit practices. I figured I might as well start off a discussion here myself, taking the moral high road as it were, and see if that gets him to follow along and actually talk about it here too. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:33, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He was discussing above (Death penalty and Canada), saw that what he wrote could not convince anyone and decided to engage in edit wars. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 22:24, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I see now. Never mind then. I was planning to stick to the three-revert rule and do everything "by the book" trying to get him to talk about this, but at this point he looks like a plain old troll to me. (I also notice that he hasn't touched the talk: page in ten days, so I can't really count the stuff above as being discussion of <i>this</i> particular edit.) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:46, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
