<p>The chapter "[Balasingham is a former journalist, who worked for a Colombo newspaper and as a translator at the British High Commission in Colombo. It is rumoured that he was a Ph.D candidate in the late 1960s, writing his dissertation on the psychology of Marxism at the South Bank Polytechnic in London, when the LTTE made the transition from Marxist Leninism to Tamil nationalism. The 63-year old British citizen had extensively written and published on the subject. According to published reports, the tutors at the polytechnic (now known as the South Bank University) still remember him as a bright, but unusual student.]" is not factually correct at all. I have spoken to everybody at Psycology at South bank to find out, there is noboidy who remembers an Anton Balasingham. The South Bank polytechnic wasn't in existence until 1970. I checked all the records at the university to find there was no such registration since the polytechnic was started in 1970. There was a small school called Borough Polytechnic in London in 1960's which did not have the status to offer PhD's. The Borough POlytechnic was merged with other training colleges in the area and elevated it to the Polytechnic status in 1970, when it was renamed the South bank Polytechnic. So this person should not have registered for a PhD there in 1960's when there was no such school. The polytechnic was promoted to university status in 1980's calling it the 'South Bank University' which was renamed in 2005 to 'London South bank University'. I will speak to the registrar of the school regarding this entry next week. Somebody's taken the leniency of the British university system and press freedom to include this chapter to justify Anton's continuos use of the title 'Dr', which obviously he is not. Since LTTE is branded as a terrorist organisation in almopst all major countries and the EU, the organisation may find it is important to have a doctorate to their theoretician and this is how they achieve it. A credible source like Wikipedia should not be allowed to misuse this way. (more about South bank Uni www.lsbu.ac.uk)(07:32, 29 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Well since you last posted the above in July, it is clear to me that it has taken you more than a Week and you are still unable to disprove that Anton holds a doctorate. It is quite strange that all the Sri-Lankan (Sinhala) newspapers and Tamil Press still refer to him as Dr Anton Balasingham. Also how is it you spoke to everyone at psychology when you can’t seem to spell the word correctly? Did you know that it is part of the data protection act of this great country of the UK which in turn ensures it is illegal for one such as yourself to delve into the information of another individual? In simple terms, it is impossible for you to verify that he has a PHD without his consent. So how is it you were able to check the records? Impossible, yet laughable Also in a Times UK article, they listed his credentials (of which amongst one was his PHD doctorate). I believe you need help as your telling tales or porkies. Please don’t try to take what little honour this Tamil individual has. P.S. Learn to spell and use grammar, since nobody can understand what it is your trying to state.</dd>

In addition they are violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> by making blatant statements like "Balasingham was cremated shortly afterwards at a private ceremony leaving the people for whom he was fighting for by his intellectual wisdom." There is also vandalism by anonymous ip's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Balasingham&amp;diff=96228497&amp;oldid=96157636" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Balasingham&amp;diff=96228497&amp;oldid=96157636" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> via <b>removal of cited content</b> critical of the 8 million rupees spent to reserve the great hall when people are starving in the north and east.</p>

<p>If Anton Balasingham is a theoretician without using his intellectual wisdom what he will be using, what is there in Tamilnet, if we could use other Sri Lankan newspapers for reference? Take Daily News, the national newspaper of Sri Lanka which doesn’t bring any truth to the world on what is happening in the Tamil areas.</p>
<p>When the Tamils are being murdered the Daily News will only justify the facts biased to the Government making every other Tamil as a LTTE member. Only Tamilnet has brought to the world the truth. Otherwise subsequent Sri Lankan governments might have already wiped out the Tamils from the Island.</p>
<p>Even in Puthukudiyiruppu, there were 60 school girls killed in a carpet bombing by 5 supersonic jets continuously, but the Sri Lankan President apparently denied they all were LTTE members while the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission and other UN Agencies were telling, “they are only school girls”. So who are the real terrorists, tell me an example after independence any Tamil fought using guns or any other weapons against then Sri Lankan governments to demand their rights. The moderate Tamil politicians like S. J. V. Selvanayagam and others were attacked by mobs just in front of the then Sri Lankan parliamentary complex by stones and clubs. Could any one deny this? They brought Sinhala only policy and then standardization by marginalizing the Tamils in education and well before that they started planned colonization in the Tamil traditional home lands. That time Tamil politicians were democratically demanding their rights to live peacefully with equal respect. After all their attempts failed only there were Vellupillai Prabhaharan and other Tamil military groups among Tamils. Can any one deny these facts? There are many hardcover and paperback editions are available in the market with detail research.</p>
<p>Anton Balasingham was a theoretician and he used his wisdom and fought for Tamils to gain the political rights. Whether he was attached to LTTE or a political party is a different issue. Sometimes he might have opted a military group to associate with, it was because of the past incidents what happened to other moderate Tamils.</p>
<p>What do you mean by Terrorism? If Sri Lankan Governments can use the heavy Tanks and super sonic jets in a densely populated Jaffna Peninsula under the name of establishing sovereignty and could be justified those killing and then could glorify those military victories, then what is the difference between the Government and the LTTE, the way they are using to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>It’s is pathetic to observe the amount they have spent for his funeral which could have utilized for the North East Tamils. Government is systematically starving the people and killing by artillery shelling time to time, no one is noticing. It is ridiculous those who are not bothering those now caring for Balasingham’s funeral money for those poor masses.</p>
<p>Open your heart and mind; you will get the right picture.</p>
<p>Not only will the Wikipedia Administrators, the entire world come to know the truth very soon.</p>

<dd>The sad thing is hapenning is that the LTTE is creating a humanitarian disaster by preventing the government from supplying food to vaharai. Then the LTTE mouth pieces and the eelamist who reside abroad use various internet fora and misuse wikipedia as their soapbox to propogate their lies against the government. However as the following news item shows <a href="http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/3846" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/3846" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> the goverment air lifted a large stock of essential items to jaffna.

<dd>Of course it isn't Rajsingam or his cohorts who have the pleasure of living abroad in luxury who are paying for the food sent to jaffna, it is majority sinhalese, and the muslims and the sri lankan tamils who pay for it via taxes on their honest living. So remember that your alleged racists sinhalaya's are, and have been kind enough to keep paying out of there pockets to keep the tamils in the north from starvation all this years and at least have the decency to acknowledge it.</dd>

<dd>The reason for this agitation in the eelam lobby is that they are in dire strait's, there is no visible prospect of achieving eelam in the near future, LTTE's suicide attacks on the Army Commander, and the presidents brother all failed. The war is turning against them with them loosing heavily in the eastern province with a severe weapons shortage and we have a strong leader at last via President Rajapakse. That is why they are trying to use this internationally prominent media to try to discredit and rape our government.</dd>

<p>It is so funny to know the fact that the LTTE is creating a humanitarian disaster by preventing the government from supplying food to vaharai. Closure of the A-9 and the Vaharai fiasco is only the Government’s agenda on Politico-Military level and nothing else. Sri Lankan Government first started its offensive in the Mutur area by a unilateral military offensive violating the ceasefire agreement in the LTTE control areas and LTTE strategically withdrew and then attacked in the northern frontier Muhamalai area. In retaliation to that only the Sri Lankan Government closed the A-9 rout and starving the people. If they are really caring the people they won’t do it. But the continuous chauvinistic sentiment for decades which is still prevailing in the mainstream Sri Lankan politics, Tamils are being victimized.</p>
<p><br />
When the Tamils are going to raise their voice they used to be identified with LTTE and marginaling them by Eelamist, mouthpieces of LTTE and by various other slants.</p>
<p>After diplomatic pressures from India and various other countries of the Co-Chairs of Sri Lankan Peace initiative only the Government was forced to do something. It’s crazy to note a poor country like Sri Lanka is boasting it is airlifting the goods for Jaffna Peninsula while there is a major highway.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It is ridiculous to note the statement, 'Sinhalaya's are, and have been kind enough to keep paying out of there pockets to keep the Tamils in the north from starvation all this years'. Not only Sinhalese even the Tamils are paying Tax.</p>
<p>While Ranil Wickremesinghe was campaigning for a power devolution under 'Federal model', the Great Mahinda Rajapakse came with chauvinistic 'Unitary model' and defeated his opponent and paved the way for all recent chaos. I am not praising LTTE for all its activities or their killing but my understanding is a highly conservative southern sentiment towards Tamils in power sharing is the mother of all chaos in the ethnic crisis.</p>
<p><br />
I too kindly expect the wikipedia administrators to keep an eye on by not allowing the respected wiki to be used by the chauvinist elements and the state terrorists of Sri Lanka, using another propaganda.</p>

<dd>The problem is that the conflict is so all-pervading that there is no NPOV in the situation. I myself am Tamil, but I try to view this objectively. My dislike for LTTE stems from the fact that they are not a Hindu group, but I also dislike seeing my Tamil brethren killed. The article seems to be NPOV right now (quite reasonable compared to Sinhalese propaganda and Eelam mouthpieces that other articles seem to be stuck between).<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 16:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>you mean the disclaimer&#160;??? Well, for me it shows how transparent this News-Paper is..My friend, there is no absolute truth in the world neither absolute reliability.Many, neutral sources can easily be specious..So ,I strongly believe all the media,which are run by humans who are born to make errors, should carry disclaimers like the Asian Tribune.So instead of blindly accepting all of them, we can actually analyse them thoroughly and make conclusions..For what I have seen in Asia Tribune, It carries some flaws which are general to every single media organization.And if we dismiss it as a POV pusher, I don't think we have much of choice left..The main point is , Asia Tribune is not a Sri Lankan government source,so unlike tamil net which is purely pro-LTTE, we just cant dismiss every thing written on it.thanks</dd>

<dd>I read your article,at Tamil nation,or dear even that article failed to give any description at all,other than blaming the GOSL ..Unlike LTTE control area, where you must kiss the ar** of the sun-goat to survive, tamils have more freedom in South, and that's why thousands of tamils who are moving to south to live.And there are many news-papers and neutral media, which follows all the GOSL actions and questions them.

There are good Tigers and Sri Lankan Forces, but what I discussed is only the incidents and other evidences. But once you read those stories and analyse you will come to know the incidents were purported by some misguided forces. I am not blaming each and every one of the Sri Lankan Forces. If we are calling others terrorists then we should have more discipline and order.</p>

<p><i>He only used his intellectual capacity not weapons at least to put him under "terrorists tag', then majority the Tamils are supporting the LTTE's "Cause", Do you think then they all are terrorists?</i></p>
<p>Absolutely True. In the civilized world anyone who directly or indirectly supports a crime is considered to be similar to actually committing a crime. You have clearly said that majority of the Tamils are supporting the LTTE. That is totally bull because I have been known many Tamil friends, eastern as well as northern, since I was a school kid. This is not a place to discuss such things. Talk pages are dedicated to talk about the article. If you want to eliminate that section from this article remove it from all the articles and come back here to talk with me about it.

<p>First you should know the origin of the Sri Lanka ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>LTTE or other organizations came into the scene when the Tamil democratic leaders demand for a political devolution failed only.</p>
<p>I am not justifying the LTTE's violence, but again the Sri Lankan Forces and even the IPKF in their operation used "Tit for Tat" tactics and many thousands of Tamils were vulnerable for that (please read "Attributed State Terrorism"). To gain their goals they didn't behave like Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Of course a large section of Tamils helped all the movements (not only LTTE). But it is the LTTE in the internal power struggle came to the top.</p>
<p>My strong standing is Anton Balasingham is a theoretician and used his intellectual wisdom.</p>
<p>If you are finding fault with Anton Balasingham's association with LTTE makes him a Terrorist then we can make others also "Terrorist" who were attached to the Sri Lankan Government which was directly or indirectly responsible for many thousands of Tamils and their disappearances (please read "Attributed State Terrorism").</p>
<p>Even in Puthukudiyiruppu, there were 60 school girls killed in a carpet bombing by 5 supersonic jets continuously, but the Sri Lankan President apparently denied they all were LTTE members while the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission and other UN Agencies were telling, they are only school girls.</p>
<p>Who first antagonised the Tamils?</p>
<p>I like to remind you, since the independence no Tamils fought using guns or any other weapons against then Sri Lankan governments to demand their rights. The moderate Tamil politicians like S. J. V. Selvanayagam and others were attacked by mobs just in front of the then Sri Lankan parliamentary complex by stones and clubs.</p>
<p>They brought Sinhala only policy and then standardization by marginalizing the Tamils in education and well before that they started planned colonization in the Tamil traditional homelands.</p>
<p><br />
Whether Anton Balasingham was attached to LTTE or a political party is a different issue. Sometimes he might have opted a military group to associate with, it was because of the past incidents what happened to other moderate Tamils.</p>
<p>I like to ask you "what do you mean by Terrorism? (Do you mean its only "Governmental Level" they have banned the LTTE? then, George Washington also a terrorist (that was the way he was identified in the American Revolution by the British Empire).</p>
<p>I like to ask once again, "If Sri Lank an Governments can use the heavy Tanks and super sonic jets in a densely populated Jaffna Peninsula under the name of establishing sovereignty and could be justified those killing and then could glorify those military victories, then what is the difference between the Government and the LTTE, the way they are using to achieve their goals."</p>
<p>Anton Balasingham tried his best for permanent solution with Ranil Wickremesinghe for power devolution under 'Federal model' but it was failed because of the Southern hardliners. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajsingam_c57d.html" title="User:Rajsingam">Rajsingam</a> 02:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having looked over this, I see quite a bit of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a>. I would encourage everyone to take the rhetoric down a few notches, and to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of those on the other side. Rajsingam, I would advise you to consider the position of those on the other side. They do have some valid concerns, and I would strongly encourage you to think over them-if this person did support terrorist actions, he may well be classified as such, even if he has also done a great deal of good. However, generally, when information in a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biography</a> is controversial, especially category tagging, it's generally best to leave the category out unless there is overwhelming consensus to include it.

If there is genuinely no consensus here, a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> is often the best way to settle the issue-best to do an RFC on an article before they start getting filed on users!

<p>While I hate dignifying puerile 'blah blah blah' by apologists of terror groups with responses, I am unfortunately left with no choice but to respond.</p>
<p>And I can only restate what I've already said. AB is a terrorist. Period. Even if u claim that he didnt murder children or rape women himself(a tall claim actually, considering his affiliations), as an avowed member of an internationally banned terror group, he is well within the realms of the "Terrorist" tag. And whether he suffered from diabetes or syphilis is irrelevant to the discussion. Keep that out of this discussion even if you cant help being awed by the fact that he had a screwed up medical history.</p>
<p>And, please dont give me nonsense like - "Why is Dawood Ibrahim not tagged?", "Why is Milosevic not tagged" etc.,. Those are the least of my concerns. If you feel that they ought to be tagged as terrorists too, please go ahead and do it. I cannot be expected to answer for articles that I dont edit.</p>
<p>A terrorist by any other name would stink just as bad. And, AB is a terrorist. Nothing more. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 16:31, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are no reliable sources to back up a "terrorist" tag, no matter what mischief LTTE is up to. Rajsingam's "case for murderers" is a fantasy as well. Not calling him a terrorist is hardly propaganda, as it seems right wing Sri Lankan neocons are the only ones calling him a terrorist. Accusing editors of complicity with separatist orgs is definitely a personal attack, and merely brings into prominence some deep rooted prejudices you have (note that no other ethnicity has a "militant" cat).<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 23:08, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Even Norwegian special envoy for the peace process in Sri Lanka Jon Hansen-Bauer praised late Anton Balasingam for his invaluable contribution to the peace efforts, and said "Norway will miss a much valued friend."

<p>Stopped by from an RfC. First and foremost, I have limited knowledge of this subject, which means I don't have any stake in which labels are or are not applied to Mr. Balasingham. That being said: I'm not seeing any definitive proof, linked or in-article, that he actively participated in terrorist acts. I don't follow the argument that anyone that belonged to a group that may have had terrorist acts perpetrated by some of its members qualifies as being "a terrorist," or there'd be a lot of French Quebeckers and Irish folks with an awful lot to answer for. I don't think "terrorist" should be applied unless there is some incontrovertible proof that he actively engaged in terrorist acts; that wouldn't include celebrating them, writing about them or contemplating them publicly, no matter how despicable such things might be. Does that make sense? If somebody has proof that the man was a terrorist -- criminal conviction, self-confession, documented evidence -- then by all means apply the tag. But if he was just called a "terrorist" by people that were opposed to his politics and affiliations, that doesn't make the tag justifiable. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattShepherd_b745.html" title="User:MattShepherd">MattShepherd</a> 21:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><s>Listen <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattShepherd_b745.html" title="User:MattShepherd">MattShepherd</a>. There is nothing even to discuss about this Terrorists category. I don't see anything here rather than the absence of common sense of my fellow Wikipedian. Anton Balasingham is the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups that has carried out the highest number of suicide attacks and most of them were targeted at innocent civilians. And not even that, <a href="../../../l/t/t/LTTE_021c.html" title="LTTE">LTTE</a> was banned by more than 20 countries including US, UK, Canada and EU. I've seen here a lame argument raised by one of my fellow wikipedians comparing the number of countries that banned the LTTE with the total number of countries in the world. He is the adviser in the top level who is also the composer of the LTTE leader's annual speech and a representer of LTTE in all the unsuccessful peacetalks since 1985. Obviously he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE even before the plan is taken into the discussion table. So my friend there is no need of any documented evidence or anything else other than the <a href="../../../l/t/t/LTTE_021c.html#Human_rights_and_terrorism_issues" title="LTTE">Human Rights Violations in the LTTE article</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_7d95.html" title="Terrorist attacks attributed to the LTTE">Terrorist attacks attributed to the LTTE</a>.

<p>Lahiru, Rajsingham, I think maybe you could both benefit from a bit of a cooling-down period. You obviously both feel very strongly about the issue (and I'm sure you both have excellent reasons for believing what you do), but saying someone is a terrorist in the absence of concrete evidence isn't helpful on Lahiru's side, and Rajsingham, whatever the Sri Lankan government may have done doesn't change the material fact of whether or not Balasingham engaged in acts that are legigimately considered terrorism. You may feel that whatever actions he engaged in were justified, but that's not the issue at hand. Frankly, I don't feel qualified to define "terrorist" to universal satisfaction in an RfC, but I don't see anything in this article that says more than he was affiliated with a group that is considered by some to be a terrorist organization. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattShepherd_b745.html" title="User:MattShepherd">MattShepherd</a> 14:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Balasingham&amp;curid=4092099&amp;diff=113467160&amp;oldid=111863628" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Balasingham&amp;curid=4092099&amp;diff=113467160&amp;oldid=111863628" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>, the attribution "anti-rebel" has been removed with the summery "Unnecessary wording". This is not unnecessary, but the result of a compromise. See <a href="../../../s/l/r/WP%7ESLR_2364.html#Classification_of_sources" title="WP:SLR">WP:SLR#Classification of sources</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/r/WP%7ESLR_2364.html#Motivation" title="WP:SLR">WP:SLR#Motivation</a> for why this is necessary.</p>
<p>However, the whole paragraph is not very encyclopedic; it can be easily argued that it doesn't fulfill <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. We therefore have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the paragraph completely per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a></li>
<li>Reinsert the attribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the latter is the less dramatic change I will do that one for now. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 02:53, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that this should be REMOVED because as you stated of the Note. This is a biography of this man and we cannot just add stuff that is not at all related to him. This should be taken off immediately as he had nothing to do with this "Spending". What the LTTE do after his death is a whole different fact. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchdogb_a098.html" title="User:Watchdogb">Watchdogb</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/t/User_talk%7EWatchdogb_f084.html" title="User talk:Watchdogb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Watchdogb_9e9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Watchdogb">contribs</a>) 03:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I took off the sentence as per WP:N. Also remember this is a biography what the LTTE did for his death does not have anything to do with his biography. He is not the one who asked for the 8 million rupee spending (even if we were to assume its true). Also on conflicting views LTTE has said no one in their de facto state was starving while the 5 year CFA was in place. So then we will have to add that source also as per WP:NPOV and then this will not be a biography anymore.

<dd>If you are covering his "elaborate" funeral, then you have to mention the criticism of it. Either take out the the entire funeral section, or keep both sides of the story.</dd>
<dd>And I suggest everyone read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> very closely, as I don't see how it is even <i>related</i> to this paragraph. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 16:04, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly I did not cover his funeral. Secondly even if it did not fail WP:N then there is still a problem with the whole point of biography. This is a biography page. He did not do anything to spend the money as stated in the anti rebel website. Its not his fault that he died and its not his fault that someone had spend a lot of money for his funeral.

<dd>PS the article says that some "People's retrieval force" has put out these posters. So back to the WP:RS... How are we going to assume that what the "People's retrieval force" is indeed saying the truth&#160;? How are we to believe that the money came from srilanka&#160;? Remember he worked in england and as I know the england pound is way over 100 Srilankan rupees. Please bring proper proof of the source of "People's retrival force" about this money comming from Srilanka and not the UK.</dd>

<dd>Your not clear with what your saying. Because if the funeral section is included, then the criticism of it should also be included. If you want wither delete the entire section, or leave the <b>entire section</b>.</dd>
<dd>It does not say as a fact that X money was spent on the funeral, it simply says that there were posters condemning the funeral. It's up to the reader to judge whether the posters were true or not.</dd>
<dd>And I'm just completely lost as to what the current exchange rate has to do with any of this.--<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 02:07, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry but I never said that we should keep the funeral section. I did not say we should take it off either. Thats not my problem however, my problem is adding the info without proper citation. Asian tribune is QS and it should not be used to establish notability according to WP:SLR. Also you obviously do not understand the fact that anyone could have written the posters without any proof or truth behind it. If I were to put up posters about the Srilankan army and if LTTEPS publish this info then are we going to add that to the SLA article&#160;? LOL I allready know people who will jump on the oppertunity on deleting that part.</dd>

<dd>Again this fails WP:N as the Asian Tribune does not give proper reference to the article. Asian Tribune just simply says "Peoples retrieval force" posted these articles. As per WP:N Asian Tribune does not give detailed info about this incident and we would need some sort of RS to back up this information. Since we don't have any then this fails WP:N .</dd>

<dd>Moreover This is a biography and how is LTTE spending 8 million rupees on posters apply to him&#160;? HE did not do the spending and he did not ask for such spending (especially the part about people starving in the east (again no proof)). This is more related to the LTTE than Anton himslef. His funeral&#160;? I agree some of the part on the funeral does not belong here but again some of it does. Like the part about people weeping shows how much this man was loved by his people and the fact that many came from other countries also should stay to show the dedication of the people to this man. As for the parts that do not belong... you can take it off if you want. I do not want to look like I want to sabotash the article in anyway. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchdogb_a098.html" title="User:Watchdogb">Watchdogb</a> 03:54, 10 March 2007 (UTC) 02:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;deindent&gt;Per SLR? do you think a handful of users can decide to label stuff "pro-government", "anti-LTTE" etc etc? If I form a project and decide to call the LTTE terrorists in every article will that go? No. If you want to call a news organization something like that, you need to provide citations. And if this "is a biography" and the LTTE spending 8 million rupees on posters doesn't apply to him, what does "An eloborate funeral was organized at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Palace_48ce.html" title="Alexandra Palace">Alexandra Palace</a> in north London"? He was dead so he didn't stage it. You're talking about a double edged sword here. Either both sections stay, or both go. I don't mind either way. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 07:20, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>::::I have only one question about this whole series of edits. Where is the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> verifiability of the posters that were to have been pasted in Britain (all over Britain - removed it because it was silly) in Tamil language. We can verify so called elaborate (I removed it because it was un-encyclopedic) funeral from <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamilnet.html" title="Tamilnet">Tamilnet</a> via pictures and TV programs, but how do we verify what Asiantribune says&#160;?</s></p>
<p><s><s>::::My POV says that many SL Tamils may have felt the way what Asiantribune posters supposed to have said but that is besides the point.</s></s></p>
<p><s><s>::::That’s why my original position, that Asiantribune is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> reputable source stands unless people prove me wrong.

<dd><s>Also this is what Wikipedia says about <b>questionable sources</b> - <i>A questionable source is one with no editorial oversight or fact-checking process or with a poor reputation for fact-checking. Such sources include websites and publications that express views that are widely acknowledged as fringe or extremist, are promotional in nature, or rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions. Questionable sources may only be used in articles about themselves.</i> For me Asiantribune may meet this definition and we can take it to mediation about it too, if that's what it takes.

<p>I have been following these discussion and I have noticed how the hard singalese supporters allways claim anything that is anti-LTTE is Reliable source but then when it comes to sites that are Pro-LTTE they claim it is not. I do not see how that can be&#160;? I think we need some admins to take a look at this. This is wikipedia not State-Terrorism promoting site. 130.63.110.21 15:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
