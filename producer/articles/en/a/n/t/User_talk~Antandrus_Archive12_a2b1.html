I noticed that you are a sysop as well, but I was wondering why you haven't done so yet or if there is a proper procedure or hurdles that need to be overcome first before locking?

<p>Hi, Antandrus. There's been somewhat of an edit war at <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriging.html" title="Kriging">kriging</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geostatistics.html" title="Geostatistics">geostatistics</a> with User:JanWMerks. I noticed that you chimed in early on, but I seem to be the only person trying to communicate with Dr. Merks.</p>
<p>I've been trying to point out the central tenets of Wikipedia: NPOV, verifiability, no original research, but it hasn't seemed to help much.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are my edits and comments reasonable, do you think? I've been trying to find verifiable material to try to represent Dr. Merks' views, but doesn't seem to be enough --- the same original-research material keeps getting rephrased and inserted again and again.</li>
<li>Would it help if someone else tried to communicate or help out? Could you help?</li>
</ol>

<p>Dear Antandrus,</p>
<p>The article "Open vs Closed Encyclopedias" was a test project for our school. We (the students in the advanced current events) were claiming Wikipedia is very reliable and nearly as much as Britannica. Our teachers liked the old books on the shelves more and wanted us to conduct a test to see how it work would, we saying That they have people deleting articles, saying this is desputable, etc.</p>
<p>We therefore put together a really nonsense article, that made absolutely no sense, with the object in mind to get it deleted or marked in someway that showed it wasn't a reliable source.</p>
<p>Thank you - I believe this will allow us to continue to use Wikipedia as a student body, which every student in the advanced current event class said he or she used.</p>
<p>I would also like to know, is there a project that looks out for these types or articles, or are there a group or administrators who look out for them?</p>
<p>Sincerely, Kerry</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Kerry,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These kinds of articles are relatively easy to spot, and we get most all of them. I do a lot of "recent changes" patrol, and caught the edits by User:GLEE. as well as by 71.116.147.160; I looked at both the article and talk page, and after having a chuckle at the idea of 18th century Ancient Greeks, deleted the article. I think overall Wikipedia is fairly reliable. There are errors in it, of course, but the probability of running into deliberate misinformation is not all that high.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's hundreds of people here who look out for "test articles" and vandalism; some are administrators (like me) and many more are not.

<p>Hi. User:Broken Winds seems to be an alternative incarnation of User:Breaky McWind, who you banned indefinitely<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Breaky_McWind&amp;diff=35109489&amp;oldid=35109449" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Breaky_McWind&amp;diff=35109489&amp;oldid=35109449" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> a few months ago. "Broken Winds", though inactive, probably should get the same treatment. More importantly, his user page should be deleted, or at least blanked, being an offensive (albeit indirect) attack on another Wikipedian.

I hope you don't mind.) —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">Chris Chittleborough</a> 20:04, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Antandrus. Thanks for your help! I appreciate not being alone in trying to instruct people about NPOV.</p>
<p>Sadly, I think my attempts at trying to convince Dr. Merks to edit in an NPOV way have probably failed. See <a href="../../../j/a/n/User_talk%7EJanWMerks_4bce.html#We.27re_just_going_in_circles" title="User talk:JanWMerks">User talk:JanWMerks#We're just going in circles</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/User_talk%7EJanWMerks_4bce.html#Gridlocked" title="User talk:JanWMerks">User talk:JanWMerks#Gridlocked</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to proceed. I think that the main articles at <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriging.html" title="Kriging">Kriging</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geostatistics.html" title="Geostatistics">Geostatistics</a> have reached a reasonable NPOV state. (Can we remove the POV flag on <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geostatistics.html" title="Geostatistics">Geostatistics</a>, do you think?). Dr. Merks has made a couple of very POV articles: <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spatial_dependence.html" title="Spatial dependence">Spatial dependence</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_variogram.html" title="Sampling variogram">Sampling variogram</a>, which I've labeled as such. I interpret his comments to mean that any attempt to make these articles NPOV would be reverted.</p>
<p>I could leave these articles as-is, becoming a strange POV wart in Wikipedia, labeled as such. I could try to list these on VfD (but personally don't like the VfD process). I could try to get more community input. What do you think?</p>
<p>(Personally, I feel like I've spent far too much time on this in the last 2 weeks.)</p>

<p>xx Sigh xx. Now Dr. Merks is blanking my comments on Talk pages, even after I've explicitly asked him not to on his talk page. See history of <a href="../../../t/o/l/Talk%7ETolstoy_syndrome_f1be.html" title="Talk:Tolstoy syndrome">Talk:Tolstoy syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>Isn't this considered vandalism under Wikipolicy?&#160;:-(</p>

<dd>Ah, I didn't realize you were on Wikibreak. I should take a break, also -- I'm spending all of my time either 1) reverting vandalism or 2) reverting NPOV edits. WP seems to be going to heck in a handbasket.</dd>

<dd>One step that we can take before RfC is to post a comment to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics</a>, explaining what is going on (in neutral terms), and appeal for more expert editors to help reach a consensus. We would have to do this for an RfC anyway, so this can be considered a partial step. What do you think? Would you care to write it? (You may be able to write about it more neutrally) Or, I can write about it, either way. -- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a> 05:05, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I, too, am looking forward to the hiking season. Although, we've had an <i>enormous</i> amount of snow in the Sierra --- we recently had a huge spring storm. I suspect this is one of those years where June hiking will be on snow, and July will be full of bugs.</p>
<p>I haven't been on the High Sierra Trail for years, and only the first 7 or so (west end) miles. Hamilton Lake looks pretty, I want to go there some time (although the years keep flowing by!). Alta Peak also looks fun.</p>

<p>Hello Antandrus. Please note that I've deleted the redirect from [[Insert text]] to MediaWiki:Badtitle. The phrase "Insert text" is quite common and should be reserved for a future article. Further, it is easier to find vandalism if it contains redlinks, and readers may be confused by the error message if they click through.</p>

You wrote <i>my own experience dealing with ISPs is less than encouraging</i>. That's exactly what I figured, and one reason why I've never even tried contacting ISPs myself. ISPs probably won't act unless they're sure that the request is really being made on behalf of Wikipedia, and at the moment no can do so, barring very rare personal intervention by Jimbo or board members. There really needs to be some not-quite-so-exalted persons who can do this on a more frequent basis. Just like the ArbCom was created to delegate dispute resolution and remove the need for Jimbo to intervene personally in every dispute, there should be some committee or officially designated Wikipedia office person who can handle ISP abuse reporting, with the authority to make abuse reports in the name of Wikipedia. A good talking-to from the NCV's ISP and their warning him that he's violating their terms of service would probably get him to stop. Well, let's wish Essjay luck if he decides to pursue it. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:27, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(I don't yet have a talk page, so perhaps you can add your thoughts here - or on the discussion page)</p>
<p>Firstly, your insight (I presume unbiased as to the links involved) is most welcomed. I wish to ask your opinion on how it is that we can elect to delete any and all references to schools/manufacturers who specialize in this field, but at the same time allow links to websites which are oftentimes written by novices who lack proper training or experience within the scope of the subject matter (i.e.<a href="http://piano.detwiler.us/text.html" class="external text" title="http://piano.detwiler.us/text.html" rel="nofollow">How to Tune a Piano Yourself</a>)?</p>
<p>In speaking to several members of the PTG (I too have been in this profession for 25+ years) there is a consensus that bad information is much worse than no information at all. Simply put, unqualified opinions on instructional matters is dangerous (particularly given the topic). In order to assure that information is held to a much higher standard, how might you suggest to reconcile this very important issue?</p>
<p>I submit that in order that anyone offering a treatise on piano tuning (or any subject requiring a learned skill) at least pass some sort of communal test of competency before being able to add or modify instructional input. For Wikipedia to thrive as a valid repository of information, it seems only logical that a basis of experience be the "trial" for which any scholastic or instructional links be allowed as a guide to the subject matter.</p>

<dd>Your first question is a good one, and has to do with the quality of the links. The only way I can see handling it is community consensus: even if a link is non-commercial and seems to contain a lot of information, if most people don't want it (e.g. because it's by a novice and contains misinformation) -- then out it goes. As of having links to piano tuning schools and manufacturers of piano tuning equipment -- maybe what we need is an <i>article</i> on just that topic, one which would contain too much detail to go simply in the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_tuning.html" title="Piano tuning">piano tuning</a> article. Piano tuning methodology, Piano tuning pedagogy, Teaching of piano tuning ... I'm not sure what to best call it, but to me it's an obviously encyclopedic topic. <i>That</i> would be an obvious place to put such links, and it could itself be linked from the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_tuning.html" title="Piano tuning">piano tuning</a> article. Just an idea. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 03:50, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After visiting Assisi, Italy, I've been working hard to raise the article <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilica_of_San_Francesco_d%27Assisi_6f90.html" title="Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi">Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi</a> from a stub to a full-fledged article, illustrated by photos taken by me and others. Since I'm not a native English speaker, I could use some help from a native speaker (and fellow administrator) who is also interested in the arts. Even if your main interest is in music, I suppose you have enough background to contribute to this article especially by rephrasing my somewhat wooden style. In my opinion the article is rather complete for an encyclopedia. But any additions by you are off course most welcome. I could have added much more about the extraordinary richness in 13th-14th century Italian paintings of this church, but then the article would have grown into the length of a book. Therefore some help would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 18:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Antandrus, I'm working on the Earle Brown page. I welcome any corrections or additions, but I think it's important that the page is kept alive, because he was such a wonderful man.

<dd>Antandrus, thanks for the kind message! I hope that we can work on Brown's page together. I saw the Calder mobile in E.B.'s office on a documentary. I also saw a lot of Calder mobiles in museums... They are fascinating... You can put it in the article and cite the documentary! It's on the E.B. Foundation page now. I think we can also get some rights to publish images of eg. December '52 and perhaps an example of a mobile score.

<p>I am sure that you noticed my addition to the Al sharpton article when you revised. In the event that you have forgotten, I simply placed the communism template on it. I did so, as all wikipideans might do, it persuit of truth, or as you might say, I was "being bold." Perhaps you are aware that the honorable Al sharpton is affiliated with extremely radical leftist ideologies. Therefore I request that you remove your warning from my messages and allow me more chances, or I will know that I was convicted for something that I did not do, and that wikipedia has been abandoned for less than the purpose of truth.</p>

It currently resides as a small section within the page referring to the 13th century Latin text.

What do you think? Do I need to do anything in terms of requesting a "split" or can I just go ahead and write the new article. A few people have already requested that on the discussion page.

<dd>Well, I've listened to two minutes of one of the lectures so far, and absolutely no context has been given. They're just tape recordings of class lectures, which might be interesting to some people, but they're not searchable or scannable, you can't see the musical examples. And so far (at 2m 20sec.) he's just blathering on. Now, maybe his class is great, but I don't think these links are going to be that useful to most people. I think they are not probably commercial-type linkspam, probably just a student who thinks this guy is the bee's knees. I'm going to remove the links, and maybe leave a soft note on the talk page. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 22:06, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I saw you contributed to the discussion at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EPersondata_a985.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Persondata">Wikipedia talk:Persondata</a> about adding "flourished" as a field. It looks like the discussion died off although some good points were being raised by the end of it, and I thought it may be worth restarting before Persondata is used in so many places that it would be a serious problem to change the fields. There are many people for whom "flourished" dates are known accurately (so it is not all about objectivity/subjectivity) yet birth and death can only be guessed at, so there is a prima facie case for making use of "fl." Additionally, other biographical sources also make use of "fl." It seems that you are well aware of these advantages and wondered if you thought there was a case for adding floruit as a Persondata field? If you're interested, I've started a new discussion on it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Persondata#.22Flourished.22_and_burial_location" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Persondata#.22Flourished.22_and_burial_location" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>Ah, I had not seen that. Interesting. I thought the idea of prod was that people would see it, say "Noooo!" clean it up a little, and then remove the prod. I guess it probably doesn't work that way. If you want to remove the prod, I won't in any way be offended. But, as you can see, it doesn't seem to be any more accurate or sourced than it was previously. I mean, Boccherini? Really? I dunno, and I would check the source, but there is none! Oh well, that's the wiki way. I also just hate the phrase "One-hit wonder". It's so condescending and disrespectful to many composers who had full careers a professionals. Just because people seem to only know Beethoven's Ninth (<i>Freude schoene gute funken something aus Elysium!</i>) doesn't mean he was a one-hit wonder, and the same is true of Pachelbel. Also, it's historically biased, simply what has been "rediscovered" in the twentieth century, not what was big in the composer's lifetime. It's not that important.

<dd>Yes, I noticed that about the "married" women. I didn't want to put too much of that stuff in to gaurd from copyvios and to keep the article balanced, although I'm not opposed to a whole section on it eventually, it should be a substantial article. I wish I could compare the old one with the Columbia. By the way, the List of Classical one-hit wonders was de-prodded, but not improved in any way, as was another thing I prodded, Small Shoes (I'm not sure where this guy wants it merged to, but he's certainly not doing it). Well, harrumph, no big deal. I'm thinking about AfD'ing the One-hit-wonders, but I'm trying to decide if I want to put up with the flack.

<p>I'm new here, so I'm shouting out for help.</p>
<p>Please check out the Pinochet article once more. Someone has cut it rather severely, hurting the integrity of the information presented, and I don't know how to do the "revert edits" function. Look on the discussion page to see my rationale.</p>
<p>Also, I'd appreciate you taking a look at the article and providing a disinterested third-party opinion.</p>
<p>I am very concerned with the material cut — information has been lost, and it is leading to a narrower, more POV-prevalent article that does not provide clarity.</p>
