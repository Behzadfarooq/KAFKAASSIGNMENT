<p>Thanks for your help, but no, that's not what I'm looking for at all... I remember there being a small, yellow-coloured template that said "This article may contain sections that need expanding" or something like that.

<p>Saw your comment on david...'s talk (trying to make up my mind whether to email him again or not) and realised that this subject has been explored quite a lot recently, I do hope he follows up, as this is seen as quite critical re Sukarno's career and the whole decolonisation issue for the whole of sea, and yet they were for such a short time. There is no excellent range of materials on this for singapore (at least 4 diff versions of the fall of singapore in borders shop in singapore in april this year:) but unfortunately quite a lot of untranslated japanese and dutch materials as well &#160;:( cheers <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 10:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there; I obviously have no problem of any kind with editors editing articles that I have written: but you have categorised a number of articles originally by me as "invalid ISBNs". And they are not; the ISBN numbers are those printed within the reference books used. Whether they have been changed I know not, but that would in any case not invalidate my point.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 21:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anthony, it doesn't really matter, since all the articles are now fixed, but the last number you gave me is correct (bar a hyphen) and the articles were wrong, as my calculations suggested. "Inflexible" you fixed (but you labelled the fix a revert - having thought I changed the number, which I didn't), the other two I've removed the spurious "9" they now start 0-8 not 09-8.

<p>Yes of course, I would have anyway but I didn't want to bore you. An ISBN is made up of four parts, the first identifies the "language area" a sort of nebulous concept, but 0 is English for example, However this part can be longer so that 99451 (or something like it) represents Congo . This means you can have lots of books in the English (or French - 2) sections, and not so many in the Congo - which makes sense. The next chunk is the publisher, and the same system applies. "Big" publishers get short numbers like Penguin - 14, and Yale I think 300. Then you get a serial number chosen by the publisher, this takes it to 9 digits, for example 0-593-01518 is an English book by Bantam Press, and probably their 1518th book. The last part is a check digit (or X) in this case 5 so the full ISBN is 0-593-01518-5. So that is what the four parts are. As to layout, the international ISBN agency "ISBN User Manual" states "The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly by hyphens or spaces" although it allows these to be omitted for internal data processing. (On Wikipedia we can't use spaces, because the ISBN magic doesn't work with them.) (Incidentally looking at a book on my desk, the ISBN is correctly hyphenated on the back above the bar code, and in the book's publishing data page, but not on the inside flap.) To confuse matters this will be changing on 1st Jan 2007, with the addition of a 978- before all ISBNs to make them compatible with <a href="../../../e/a/n/EAN_1a5c.html" title="EAN">EANs</a> and allow more numbers to be introduced later with a 979- prefix.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense, <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 23:39 <a href="../../../2/5/_/25_August_8ed8.html" title="25 August">25 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</p>

<p>Hi, and thanks for your comment. You asked <i>"Is there any way of notifying NP patrollers of inaccuracies?"</i> and I believe that the answer is probably 'no'. The reason is that 'inaccuracies' is something that is, in many ways, in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes you can look at a new article and see from the writing style (word choice, order, colloquialisms, etc) that something "isn't quite right" and if some quick checks into subject-related articles and search engines show it isn't valid, or is way over-simplified, then it will probably deserve deletion. But someone else coming along who already has some knowledge of that particular subject area may have the ability to see what the intent of the article was meant to be - and edit it accordingly - or make it a redirect to something else, or agree with the deletion. The more articles you look at, the more you start to see what you are looking for in something acceptable - even as a stub.

<p>I was not aware that removing a deletion tag was considered “serious vandalism”. In fact, I was given the exact opposite impression from the notice you placed on the page. I quote: "You may remove this message if you improve the article, <b>or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason</b>. To avoid confusion, it helps to explain why you object to the deletion, either in the edit summary or on the talk page.” Given this message, and the fact that I do object to the deletion of the article, I removed the message and stated why in the talk page. Your addition also states “If this template is removed, it should not be replaced". However, after removal, you immediately replaced it. I am struggling to understand what portions of your additions you actually meant. Please forgive my ignorance and help me understand.</p>
<p>Also, I must point out, and please forgive me if you know this or find it offensive, that “Bad-faith placing of afd or speedy-deletion tags” is regarded as serious vandalism.Garretro 05:34, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While the article technically meets the definition, the general rule of thumb here is that if the content is "see <a href="../../../x/_/_/X.html" title="X">x</a>", it's better to just turn it into a redirect.

<p>About your objection to the Drug Tariff - just because a GP has not heard about it does not mean it is not an important document, worthy of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In fact you could fail pharmacy registration exams if you do not know your way around it.</p>
<p>All community pharmacies use this document, especailly for pricing. It also gives details on what charges a patient has to pay for drugs e.g. three charges for Heliclear and Tridestra, or one charge for each stocking, not found in BNF or MEP. Also it has all the blacklisted items listed (denoted in the BNF with a NHS in a box with a diagonal line through it).</p>
<p>Please go see their website - <a href="http://www.drugtariff.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.drugtariff.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugtariff.com/</a></p>
<p>Again this document is not used by GPs generally (though with an increasing number of dispensing GPs maybe they should) but a lot by pharmacists!</p>
<p>I have deleted your objection and put some more info that the Drug Tariff is used by dispensing pharmacists and doctors.</p>

<p>Hey No Problem -</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe I should add that is probably the most boring text in the world. Next time you in a pharmacy ask to have a look and you will see what I mean:):) P.S. If you want something a bit more to get worked up about look at MerckSource and see if you think this is an advert for Merck or not - got to love drug reps!</p>

<p>Hi, I assess articles on quite a strict interpretation of the criteria, others are more lenient in their assessing. The articles I think you are refering to in my opinion did not contain enough content and some did not contain images eg.(<a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Lord_Clyde_%281864%29_b261.html" title="HMS Lord Clyde (1864)">HMS Lord Clyde (1864)</a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Pallas_%281865%29_2c55.html" title="HMS Pallas (1865)">HMS Pallas (1865)</a>. In your opinion they may be Start instead of Stubs and you can change them if you want, im not going to lose any sleep over it.

<dd>It's one of those things, I'm afraid. If you add {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} to your talk page and (very important) paste in the contents of the block warning screen so we can identify the autoblock, then it can be fixed reasonably easily as you saw above. I'm sorry you keep getting caught up in this, unfortunately there are some people who are only here to disrupt the project and we do need to keep them away; this sometimes has unfortunate effects for other users of the same ISP. The autoblock feature, as you probably know, exists to stop them simply logging out and carrying on abusing other editors. Normally the autoblocks expire after a day or so, I think, unless the banned user is persistent. In this case we have protected his Talk page to stop him continuing to make baseless and vile accusations against other Wikipedians, so hopefully the disruption will be short-lived.

<p>Yes, my {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} was in response to his vandalism of your talk page. I also reverted almost simultaneously vandlism to your user page. I blocked the user account Scorcherman who vandalized your user page as his history was long and not distinguished. I suspect, though don't know, that the IP is the same person. However there wasn't really grounds to block to IP, but a test4 seemed entirely appropriate.

<p>I think most people would agree that there is no real assertion of notability by the author about the subject, which most certainly is speedyable (assuming that's how you correctly spell a nonsense word).

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>In general we try to keep user and talk pages unprotected unless they are under sustained attack. The general principle of Wikipedia is that its open to everyone to edit. The downside is vandalism, but the advantages are immense. If the vandals start up again, I'll be happy to step in and temporarily protect, but as there isn't any current activity I'd rather leave them unprotected at the moment.

<dd>Well I don't think you'll get much support to have protect userpages in all but cases of vandalism. Your userpage is published under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> the same as all other pages on Wikipedia, which means you give up the right to prevent others from changing it. The <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a> policies are fairly clear on that and its established Wikipedia convention that we try to keep all userpages unprotected when possible. Anyway, like I said if the vandalism returns let me know and I will protect your page for a short while.

<p>Although my revert was a mistake, the use of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram.html" title="Ram">ram</a> is not correct, since "ram" is a disambiguation page. Instead, you should use [[Domestic sheep|ram]], since that is what <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram_%28animal%29.html" title="Ram (animal)">Ram (animal)</a> redirects to. ~ <a href="../../../p/h/d/User%7EPHDrillSergeant_1389.html" title="User:PHDrillSergeant"><font color="green">PH</font></a><a href="../../../p/h/d/User_talk%7EPHDrillSergeant_fb07.html" title="User talk:PHDrillSergeant"><font color="blue">DrillSergeant</font></a>...<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHDrillSergeant_fc3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHDrillSergeant"><font color="maroon">§</font></a> 21:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Don't forget that the bow (where the ram is) is called a Ram because it once was normal to have an iron ram's head on the end. I thought that's what you were referring to (I am in the US Navy, I know what the parts of a ship are). ~ <a href="../../../p/h/d/User%7EPHDrillSergeant_1389.html" title="User:PHDrillSergeant"><font color="green">PH</font></a><a href="../../../p/h/d/User_talk%7EPHDrillSergeant_fb07.html" title="User talk:PHDrillSergeant"><font color="blue">DrillSergeant</font></a>...<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHDrillSergeant_fc3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHDrillSergeant"><font color="maroon">§</font></a> 21:39, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi there; certainly this the derivation of the word, although the Greek and Roman galleys who followed this practice placed their ram's head well above the water line. In the British Victorian navy the ram was an underwater prolongation of the armour belt, producing an armoured beak designed to sink opposing ships on a single impct. The theory was flawed; with the exception of a single incident at the battle of Lissa, between Italy and Austria, the only major warships sunk by the ram were sunk by accident during manoevres; the most famous is probably the <b>Victoria <i>-'</i>Camperdown</b> collision.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 22:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tony, I notice that you state, in your article on <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_ram.html" title="Naval ram">Naval rams</a>, that the ramming by the <a href="../../../c/s/s/CSS_Virginia_d06d.html" title="CSS Virginia">Virginia</a> <b>failed</b> to sink the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Cumberland_%281842%29_5ebb.html" title="USS Cumberland (1842)">Cumberland</a> at the Battle of Hampton Roads. All the sources I have read insist that the <i>Cumberland</i> did indeed sink; according to the current <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads_f10a.html" title="Battle of Hampton Roads">Wikipedia article</a>, <i>Virginia rammed Cumberland below the waterline and she sank rapidly, "gallantly fighting her guns," Buchanan reported in tribute to a brave foe, "as long as they were above water."</i> This, of course conflicts with your statement in <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_ram.html" title="Naval ram">Naval ram</a> (repeated above) that the only successful (i.e. intentional) ramming in the battleship era was at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lissa_%281866%29_0711.html" title="Battle of Lissa (1866)">Lissa</a>. Are you sure of your facts? Also, should not ancient use of the ram (which long predated the Romans) take precedence in the article over the 19th-century revival of the weapon?</dd>

<p>Hi. I did put a speedy tag on the "main" article (Lincolnshire Pallet Services) but prod-ded the others because they weren't strictly the same thing.

<p>Hi, I'm not sure what you mean by "in twice". I have created stubs for both the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, as per the format and structure that we're using for Olympic articles on Wikipedia. Each nation gets an article for each Games, and summer and winter Games are not combined for the same year.
