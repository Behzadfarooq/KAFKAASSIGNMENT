Also I would like to know why Circumcision and Anti-semitism is not involved. It is another relevant but disputed article listed on <a href="../../../v/f/d/Wikipedia%7EVFD_27e0.html" title="Wikipedia:VFD">Wikipedia:VFD</a>. I do not care which is decided one way or the other, but I believe to be logically consistent we must list both articles or neither. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 02:41, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my comment above it does (<i>i.e.</i> it is my opinion, I'm uncertain about applicable policy, if any, nor was formal policy a consideration, to be honest). Fact is that the two <i>new</i> articles went on VfD virtually as soon as they were created, and I don't consider them to be stable enough for our readers to be linked to them through stable articles until the VfD period has expired. Again, this is my opinion, and whether it's noted in policy or not, I find it reasonable to exercize such caution. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 01:23, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I think Fubar is applying an unrealistic standard. Given the nature of WIkipedia it is likely that <i>someone</i> here has already heard of <i>anyone</i> that could be mentioned in an article. That an editor has "heard of him" is an absurd standard for evaluating the appropriateness of a source. Shahak was a chemistry teacher who became a dilettant in history. He had no training in history, and as far as I can tell did not publish any books through academic presses or articles in peer-reviewed journals. We have to reject him as an authority on Jewish/Zionist/Israeli history. Nor was he an important political figure. If we quote him on Israeli or Jewish history, we might as well quote my neighbor's gardener. I am not trying to silence a voice from the Israeli left, but surely there are established historians, politicians, and human rights activists who are more established than Shahak (e.g. Betzelem, the Israeli chapters of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, Shalom Achshav, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, politicians in Shinui). <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:11, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Shahak is basically quoted by the antiZionists because he is famous because he is quoted by the antiZionists. If he were publishing a proZionist point of view he would be unknown; which perhaps is why he is not. I assume that, as you suggest, there are folks on the antiZionist side who have some sort of independent reason to pay attention to their writings. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:24, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is reasonable to quote him in certain contexts.

<dd>Shahak is clearly not an authority on the history of anti-Semitism and can't be quoted as such. But the entire section where the quote occurs is flawed. It's supposed to be about "Anti-Semitism and modernity", but only the first paragraph is on topic. Apparently someone has confused different uses of the word modern. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Diderot_ecdb.html" title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> 19:42, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it's trying to do more. But in any event, the issue here is whether or not Shahak's views on the subject are notable, and thus worthy of quoting in the article.

<dd>Werner Cohn, a noted Jewish academic, has described Shahak as, "the world's most conspicuous Jewish anti-Semite." Rabbi Immanuel Jakobavits, the former Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth, has also accused Shahak of anti-Semitism in "A Modern Blood Libel - L' Affaire Shahak". If Shahak has been criticised by such eminent people as these (and in this respect) then the inclusion of his definition of modern anti-Semitism seems notable. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 09:20, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>(1) To say what characterizes "modern anti-Semitism" is to make a statement about the history of anti-Semitism. It is not a 'definition' of anti-Semitism. It is a statement about historical facts. (This would be an example of a definition: "By the term 'modern anti-Semitism', I mean anti-Semitism wholly or partially supported by a secular ideology." (2) Even if Shahak is interesting as an example of an anti-Semitic jew, that neither (a) make his views on anti-Semitism authoritative, nor (b) make his views on anti-Semitism notable. As for (2)(b): If his views on anti-Semitism were to be viewed as notable but not authoritative, then they should be quoted as such. (Clearly spelling ou the reason for their inclusion and in a section devoted to, for example, notable anti-Semites.) (3) As I have previously argued, the section should be either about "anti-Semitism and modernity" or about "modern anti-Semitism". Discussing both together becomes very confusing for the reader. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Diderot_ecdb.html" title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> 10:55, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>RE (1) To say what characterizes modern anti-Semitism is at least to partly define it, any statements about its history can only be infered.<br /></dd>
<dd>RE (2b) <i>If his views on anti-Semitism were to be viewed as notable but not authoritative, then they should be quoted as such.</i> What wording would you suggest please? If Shahak's writings can elicit a written response from the Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth then he is at least noteworthy.<br /></dd>

<dd>Let me put it this way, Conch Shell; <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> has been described as an anti-Semite by many, but that doesn't make Duke an expert on anti-Semitism, or his views of what anti-Semitism is worth quoting. If I don't see more support for quoting Shahak on the topic soon, I'm going to remove the quote. And by they way, almost all people accused of anti-Semitism dispute that they are anti-Semites, as do their fans. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup>

<dd>Werner Kohn's article contains inaccuracies and at least one falsehood, he doesn't seem to be a notable character in other respects so I shouldn't have mentioned him with regard to Shahak. However Shahak's quote was from a book which has received written criticism from Immanuel Jakobavits, which makes its contents at least noteworthy. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 13:15, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've seen no evidence of Kohn's article containing a "falsehood", and he seems about as notable as Shahak. As for Jakobovitz, the fact that he refuted a story Shahak told in no way indicates that Shahak's general views on anti-Semitism are notable. I haven't seen anyone else support the notability of Shahak's view, and a number of people who have said it is not notable, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to take out the quote. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:31, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shahak doesn't ask us to 'celebrate' this nor does he describe it as 'progressive', though he does refer to its 'horrendous atrocities'. Then there's the 'Jews worship Satan' copyedit which we've already discussed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lord Immanuel Jakobovitz would have at least read Shahak's book before criticizing it, unlike some of his other critics.

<dd>Shahak does indeed view the Chmielnicki massacres as an entirely reasonable Ukranian peasant uprising against their Jewish oppressors, even if he doesn't use the specific words "celebrate" and "progressive". And Shahak did indeed say the Jews worship Satan, and the quote given quite perfectly captures Shahak's claim, as we've already discussed. As for Jakobovitz, he debunked Shahak's claim regarding a specific incident which Shahak made up. He did not respond to the book as a whole, and your argument is a famous logical fallacy known as an "<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_silence.html" title="Argument from silence">Argument from silence</a>". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:50, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Perhaps the most outstanding example is the great massacre of Jews during the Chmielnicki revolt in the Ukraine (1648), which started as a mutiny of Cossack officers but soon turned into a widespread popular movement of the oppressed serfs: 'The unprivileged, the subjects, the Ukrainians, the Orthodox [persecuted by the Polish Catholic church] were rising against their Catholic Polish masters, particularly against their masters' bailiffs, clergy and Jews. This typical peasant uprising against extreme oppression, an uprising accompanied not only by massacres committed by the rebels but also by even more horrible atrocities and 'counter-terror' of the Polish magnates' private armies, has remained emblazoned in the consciousness of east-European Jews to this very day - not, however, as a peasant uprising, a revolt of the oppressed, of the real wretched of the earth, nor even as a vengeance visited upon all the servants of the Polish nobility, but as an act of gratuitous antisemitism directed against Jews as such.</i> In <i>Jewish History, Jewish Religion</i>, Chapter 4, section "Anti-Jewish Persecutions". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:12, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow. It's interesting how much of his abovecited analysis follows a sound basis:</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>For centuries after the creation of the Commonwealth, the <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox.html" title="Orthodox">Orthodox</a> people of <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a> had felt oppressed by the Polish <a href="../../../s/z/l/Szlachta.html" title="Szlachta">szlachta</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> priests and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> traders.

Unwilling to attend to the details of administration themselves, Polish <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnate.html" title="Magnate">magnates</a> often made <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> traders their go-betweens in transactions with the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasants.html" title="Peasants">peasants</a> of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.

<p>But then bizzarely falls very short, whereas the Wikipedia <a href="../../../c/h/m/Chmielnicki_Uprising_1b4c.html" title="Chmielnicki Uprising">article</a> continues with:</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Khmelnytsky told the people that the Poles had sold them as slaves "into the hands of the accursed Jews." With this as their battle-cry, the Cossacks killed a huge number of Jews during the years 1648–1649.

<dd>This still remains a peasant revolt against all feudal agents and not an act of gratuitous anti-Semitism.

They pillaged the estates of the Jews and <i>nobles, burned churches and killed their priests, leaving nothing whole</i>.'</dd>
<dd>Does this also make the peasants anti-Catholic bigots? And how do you infer Shahak's 'self-hatred' from the above? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 14:20, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was not a <i>typical</i> one in that the number of Jewish casualties was very high. It is unecessary to remark that not only the Jews were targeted and killed, that's a given. And, yes, there was strong anti-Catholic animosity, that's also a given. I infer Shahak's 'self-hatred' from him calling it a <i>typical</i> peasant revolt. The massacare of the same name makes it atypical. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:32, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I got the impression that 'typical' refered to the reasons not the consequeneces. In any case Shahak's point in JHJR was that the Jews massacred during the Chmielnicki revolt were not murdered because of their religious beliefs or perceived racial characteristics but because of their social role. Perhaps this is why he doesn't seem to identify with them. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 14:50, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>At the event, the two are inextricably tied, while your suggestion, intimating that 'typical' is left to the subtext and open to interpertation, rests on rather loose foundation. Again, I return to the question of scale: he could have easily written that initially this took the form of a typical peasent revolt, but then... Instead, he jumps ahead: <code><i>This</i> <b>typical</b> peasant uprising against extreme oppression, <i>an</i> [<b>typical</b>] uprising accompanied not only by...</code> This oversight is too easily fixable, an omission which stands out, and yes, that's how I read it. I wonder, though, which sources he uses for that example. All this notwithstanding the hypothetical reasons behind self-indentification (or lack thereof), but rather, what is being depicted, and how. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:32, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hum, well once again, because it was <i>not</i> typical, thus, his (purported) 'demystification' fails to avoid a strong bias, rather than a careful, detached analysis which takes all of the above into account. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 20:18, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The word 'typical' implies indifference not hatred. If you look at the massacres from an ethnocentric perspective then the fact that a Jew is indifferent to the plight of other Jews may seem surprising. However if you view them from a universal perspective then a man being indifferent to the plight of the agents of a brutal feudal regime is less surprising. Many younger Germans are indifferent to the bombing of their country during WWII (in which hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed) for a similar reason. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 10:53, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To a leftist, its morality or lack thereof isn't particularly pertinent or significant one way or the other. I'm not certain what he is driving at (with such a heavily sarcastic tone) wrt this practice. At any rate, it seems to cross the line and standard set by Marx's <i>On the Jewish Question</i>: against the admonishment of religious particularities <i>viz.</i> economic-historic legacy (and for Marx, this was a minor footnote, whereas for Shahak it seems to be a life work). To what end, I'm still not certain. Obviously Jewish doctrine has some issues which are a product of its age and time of origin (the concept of Kharma in Hinduism is more reactionary than that of Buddhism, for ex.). I'm wondering, does he actually have a significant point to any and all of this? <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:25, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

While the existence (and rise of) fascistic tendencies in Israel is a frightening reality (as it is wrt to Christian fascists in the United States, Islamic fascists in Saudi Arabia, Buddhist facsists in Sri Lanka, etc.), reading it in isolation, I fail to see how his explanation sheds light on any of this.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Shahak false and misleading</span></h3>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can determine, having only a very limited knowledge of Jewish religion and customs, Shahak's writings are filled with false or misleading statements. Many of his statements seem to be simply variations of age-old anti-Semitic accusations.</dd>
<dd>For example, Shahak discusses the commands to "go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass" <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/15-3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/15-3.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and to "kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him"<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/31-17.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://bible.cc/numbers/31-17.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Then he says that these commands and other similar examples
<blockquote>
<p>are much used and generally approved of -- and this includes in recent years -- by most of the intellectuals and many of the leaders of the Zionist "left"</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>He proceeds to claim that an "education officer" regularly preaches to the new recruits in the IDF and tells them that the Palestinians in the occupied territories are like the ancient Amelekites.( The "Historical Right" and the Other Holocaust in <i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i>, Spring 1981). Surely not even Conch Shell believes that to be true? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Diderot_ecdb.html" title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> 21:04, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't find the paper to which you refer but on page 91 of <i>Jewish History, Jewish Religion</i> Shahak states that rabbinical pronouncements "which do in fact state correctly the position of the Halakhah - are rarely contested by the Zionist 'left'." On page 92 he states "In fact, it is not uncommon for reserve soldiers called up to do a tour of duty in the Gaza Strip to be given an 'educational lecture' in which they are told that the Palestinians of Gaza are 'like the Amalekites'."

<p>I understand the reflexive tendency to revert sensitive materiale, but it makes more sense to actually read it, and edit it for NPOV. The version before was highly inaccurate, and made the awful mistake of appearing to attribute anti-Semitic comment directly to Jesus, without any context or clarification. In fact that meaning depends on an obfuscation of it. It did not explain the distiction between Pharisees and Jews in general, and failing to do so, copies the basis for their historical use as anti-Semitic propaganda. Two flawed interpretations do not make a right one. The section did not even attribute the quotes properly to Jesus, Stephen, John, respectively. Put all of this together, and the reactionary revert looks more like censorship than anyone's good editing. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">SV</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">t</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">add</a> 19:53, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read it, and found it both inaccurate and filled with POV.
<ul>
<li>Can you imagine that phrases like "its not just to say" or "its proper to note" or "a more rational and consistent reexamination" are in any way unbiased?</li>
<li>As well, the section defending Jesus as "explicitly disapprov[ing] of condemnation" is an off-topic apologetic, particularly in light of the many condemnations by Jesus listed in the New Testament, and in any event it does not say one shouldn't condemn Jews, it says Jesus doesn't want to call down fire from heaven to destroy a town.</li>
<li>Moreoever, the long section describing attempts at Jewish-Christian reconciliation belong in the article on that topic; this section, however, was about passages in the New Testament that have been considered to be or used as a justification for anti-Semitism.</li>
<li>As well, it has a specifically Catholic orientation, ignoring the other half of Christianity.</li>
<li>It is also simply false; for example it claims "In the New Testament Jesus does not in fact refer to "the Jews" in his condemnations, but rather to the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saducees.html" title="Saducees">Saducees</a>" In fact, in the passage quoted from John, the text is explicit that it refers to the Jews: John 8:31 "Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him etc." John is full of references to "the Jews". What's more, it's not particularly relevant, nor are the specific speakers; the section is not discussing sayings of Jesus which are considered anti-Semitic, but statements in the New Testament which are considered anti-Semitic; Jesus, John, Stephen, Paul, whoever, it doesn't really matter, they're all "holy writ".</li>
<li>The fact that the section does not distinguish between the Jews and the Pharisees is precisely the point; for most of Christian history the church didn't either, and as a result these passages were interpreted this way. Many Christians still do interpret them this way. For someone to come along now and say "well, they interpreted it all wrong, this is what they really meant, so it's not anti-Semitism at all" is not only a historical anachronism, but the height of POV.</li>
<li>And finally, it's not my responsibility to NPOV fatally flawed insertions, but rather the editor's responsibility to enter reasonable material in the first place. My reversion was considered and measured, just the opposite of "reflexive". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:28, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Patrick Reynolds, at first I was going to say that I do not see how a personal attack is appropriate or necessary. Jayjg is pretty well-respected (and I speak as someone who has disagreed with him in the past, including brief revert battles). Now I see you are an anti-Semite, there is no point. But for everyone else, let's stick to the purpose of this page, which is to improve the article. The thrust of Jayjg's last comment is that although Jayjg has spelled out his views to explain why he reverted SV's, SV did not respond to that explanation, or provide one of his own, for reverting. Compromise and collaboration are impossible if people won't respond to one another's comments.</p>
<p>As for the article itself, SV, I think I agree with Jayjg, at least on some points. Christian anti-Semitism is a tricky topic and I think your edits were motivated by a desire to be even-handed. That is a worthy goal, but I don't think the particular changes you made effectively accomplish that. First of all, some of what you wrote is inaccurate -- Jesus and his apostles did not just criticize Saducees and Pharisees, they did speak of Jews in general. Moreover, <i>all</i> Jews today are heirs of the Pharisees, and in retrospect, an attack on Pharisees is an attack on all Jews today. Indeed, some have suggested that the NT attacks against the Pharisees were inserted <i>after</i> Jesus was murdered, at the time that the Pharisees had emerged as the hegemonic form of Judaism and especially the form of Judaism directly competing with early Christians for Jewish supporters. Now, I do not think that any of what I just said belongs in the article. But it does show how tricky it is to talk about these things, and why there is a need to be as accurate as possible. Second, I just disagree completely with your use of the phrase "true" or "truth." Everyone thinks their religion or their version of their religion or their politics is "true." For an article to affirm that a particular view of Christianity is the "true" version is a flagrant violation of NPOV. Yes, there are <i>different</i> interpretations of the NT, but no one here has the right or authority to say which one's are true and which one's are false. Yes, Christianity has changed over the years -- Vatican II being one example. But again, it is not for us to say which version is right.</p>
<p>This article is not on Christianity, it is on anti-Semitism. The section on anti-Semitism in the NT should <b>not</b> list statements any of us think are anti-Semetic (which only invites someone else to explain why they are not anti-Semitic, which is an equally inappropriate thing to do). Wikipedia articles <i>never</i> express the views of their authors. They provide an account of <i>other peoples</i> views. So let's try to find out which passages in the NT have actually been used to promote anti-Semitism, and which verses Jews believe are anti-Semitic, and provide that information (even if we do not agree, personally). Then we should have a very brief statement that some Christians interpret these verses differently and a link to another article that can go into detail. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:09, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm jumping in here without reading everything up to this point to differ with your statement that only anti-semites and anti-Christians view the Gospels as containing any anti-Semitism. I have a book by a Christian scholar, William Nichols, called <i>Christian Antisemitism</i>. He's one of several Christian scholars who have examined the anti-semitic element in the New Testament. Here is one of his comments: "But the Gospels in their finished form set the tone for future Christian attitudes toward Jews. They have imprinted on Christian history the stereotype of the Jews as determined but hypocritical opponents of Jesus and in the last analysis Christ-killers. No uncriticial reader of the New Testament could easily come away with any but the most negative opinion of Jews." He also says, "Christian anti-Judaism is not a later distortion of an originally pure religion. It is embedded in the foundation documents of the faith. By the completion of the New Testament, the basis for later anti-Judaism and antisemitism had already been firmly established." (p. 168). --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 16:40, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. At least that approach has some balance and substance, rather than simply loose speculation without overall context or even personal attribution. I may even agree with most of the conclusions in <i>Christian Antisemitism,</i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568215193/104-9247128-6566361?v=glance" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568215193/104-9247128-6566361?v=glance" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> but note that by saying "No uncriticial reader of the New Testament could easily come away with any but the most negative opinion of Jews" he's simply covering all his bases: He correctly points to (as this article should) the huge difference between the interpretation of the "uncritical reader" and the (implied) "critical" one. There are equally "uncritical" interpretations in the article section, and that is precisely my point: IMHO it's simply banal to mirror the uncritical (ie. popular, dominant) view, and its far more relevant to reflect the critical (and accurate) one. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">SV</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">t</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">add</a> 19:47, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Bohdan Khmelnytsky massacres</span></h2>
<p>I question validity of including Khmelnytsky uprising massacres of Jews and Poles in this page. The uprising was a result of the political/economical oppression of Cossacks by Polish nobles and economical by Jews. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia: <i>The uprising of the peasants in the Ukraine has been ascribed by most historians to their oppression by Jewish leaseholders, as well as to the privileges granted to the latter by the kings and nobles of Poland</i> <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

Notwithstanding this, the Jews managed to gain control of the commerce of the country, as is evidenced by the complaints of the Christian merchants of Lemberg, Kamenetz, Kiev, and many other cities, shortly before the Cossack uprising ("Archiv Yugo-Zapadnoi Rossii," v., part i., xxxiv. 134, xl. 156, cxxi. 323; "Starozytna Polska," 11, 1023, 1369; "Sbornik Mukhanova," p. 192; Antonovich, l.c. p. 189).

<dd>Let's see if I understand your argument correctly. A period of pogroms when perhaps more than 100,000 jews were murdered has little to do with anti-Semitism? And the basis for this is the opinions of some 19th century historians that some of the peasants initially revolted against Jewish leaseholders? Assuming that these historians were right, wouldn't that at best be a partial explanation of the peasants' anti-Semitism? How could it possibly be a disproof of anti-Semitism? Note also that this picture of the Jews as privileged leaseholders has been disputed by modern historians. (It was also partly diputed by the source you quote.) The problem is that there are few reliable sources for this period, and therefore it's difficult to say anything about the motives with certainty. (Frank E. Sysyn. "The Jewish Factor in the Khmelnytsky uprising" in <i>Ukrainian-Jewish Relations in Historical Perspective</i> 2nd ed. (1990) p 43-56)<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/cius/excerpts/potichnyj/ujr/fs44.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utoronto.ca/cius/excerpts/potichnyj/ujr/fs44.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/cius/excerpts/potichnyj/ujr/fs45.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utoronto.ca/cius/excerpts/potichnyj/ujr/fs45.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> For a review of the literature until the 1980s, see Joel Raba: <i>Between Remembrance and Denial</i>(1996). It should also be added that studies of later periods of Ukraine history have shown very little correlation between the actual privileges of the Jewish population and the peasants' beliefs about such privileges. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Diderot_ecdb.html" title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> 20:32, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point is better verbalized by Bohdan Wytwycky article in <i>Encyclopedia of Ukraine</i>, University of Toronto Press, 1984, Vol. I, pp. 81-83:</dd>

<dd>"...The first major outbreak of violence directed against the Jews of Ukraine occurred during the popular rebellion led by B. Khmelnytsky (1648). In discussions about anti-Semitism (A-S) some writers, eg, E. Wiesel in <i>Jews of Silence</i>, have tried to draw a parallel between the 17th-century massacres of Jews and Poles by the Ukrainians during the Khmelnytsky rebellion and the mass killings of Jews by the German Nazis. Such attempts at analogy have typically obscured more than illuminated, and they seem to originate in an inability to recognize a fundamental distinction, a shortcoming common to many writings about A-S, between hostile acts or sentiments directed at Jews that derive from prejudice (A-S) and such acts or sentiments that derive from other sources (eg, <b>real and significant socio-economic or political conflicts rather than imagined or invented ones</b>).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>G. Allport's classic definition of ethnic prejudice, of which A-S is a species, defines it as antipathy based on faulty and inflexible generalizations. Whereas Nazi attitudes and practices clearly instantiate such antipathy, those of the 17th-century Ukrainian peasant masses do not. Jews were the principal administrators of a system of economic, religious, and national oppression imposed upon the enserfed Ukrainian peasantry by the colonialist Polish nobility. Thus, the mass killings of Jews and Poles during the rebellion, when tens of thousands perished, were prompted by objective conditions of oppression and probably had little to do with ethnic prejudice in the sense defined above. A similar analysis applies to the killing of Jews during the bloody Haidamaka uprisings of the 18th century.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Though more terrible in outcome than the expulsions and most other acts of persecution that Jews have had to endure over the centuries in, eg, Western Europe or Russia, the massacres of Jews and Poles by Ukrainians during the rebellions of the 17th and 18th centuries stand in important contrast to the many practices of persecution against Jews in the lands referred to above. The reason for this is that Jews constituted but a beleaguered and oppressed minority in Western Europe or Russia, while in Ukraine they were, vis-a-vis the Ukrainians, <b>part of the ruling classes</b>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Additionally, Jewish economic oppression of Cossacks is described in this quote from <i>Columbia Encyclopedia</i> <a href="http://www.bohdanyurkiv.cityslide.com/page/page/178734.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bohdanyurkiv.cityslide.com/page/page/178734.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"...Forbidden to own land, but allowed to lease it, Jews often became leaseholders. Thus, on the vast lands of the Ostrorog family, for example, there were about <b>4,000 Jewish leaseholders, and in 1616, over half the crown lands in Ukraine were leased out to Jewish entrepreneurs</b>. Because they had to make good their investment in a relatively short period of two or three years, they exploited the properties and peasants mercilessly, without regard for future consequences. It was not uncommon for a leaseholder to demand six or seven days of labor from the peasants and, with the help of the magnates' minions, to drive them into the fields. Another form of leaseholding was the leasing out of an estate's monopoly on the production and sale of alcohol and tobacco to a leaseholder, who then charged the peasants whatever price he wished for these prized commodities. Needless to say, such practices did not make Jews popular with the Ukrainian population..." (Emphases added)</dd>

(Although most people would argue that this form of A-S also falls under Allport's definition, but that's a different issue.) Therefore your arguments are beside the point. Perhaps I should also mention that the second quote isn't from the <i>Columbia Encyclopedia</i> as you claim. It's from Orest Subtelny: <i>Ukraine: A History</i>(1st ed 1988) (though I haven't verified its accuracy). As I've already made clear, Subtelny's views are disputed. The reference to "19th century historians" highlighted a certain carelessness regarding sources which normally characterizes <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologists</a>.

<dd>(1.) When "Jews had it much better," this was only because of their capabilities (aside from the fact that your statement is a gross and misleading overgeneralization, given that many Jews lived in "<i>appalling poverty</i>" (<i>Polish Jews</i>, Roman Vishniac, 1973)). Additionally, you are only speaking of "<i>much better</i>" financially, while societal factors must be considered: The Jews were "<i>isolated among an ignorant, hostile, and unlettered peasantry, protected only by autocratic whim</i>" (<i>Triumph of Survival</i>, Berel Wein, 1990). By the way, this is an interesting quote:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Recent historical research... indicates that the Jews living in the cities, particularly in those of the Ukraine, were not afforded the protection enjoyed by other citizens, and moreover were excluded from the privileges granted to the Christian merchants and burghers (Antonovich, "Monografii po Istorii Zapadnoi i Yugo-Zapadnoi Rossii," i. 188). Notwithstanding this, the Jews managed to gain control of the commerce of the country, as is evidenced by the complaints of the Christian merchants of Lemberg, Kamenetz, Kiev, and many other cities, shortly before the Cossack uprising ("Archiv Yugo-Zapadnoi Rossii," v., part i., xxxiv. 134, xl. 156, cxxi. 323; "Starozytna Polska," 11, 1023, 1369; "Sbornik Mukhanova," p. 192; Antonovich, l.c. p. 189). It was the combined opposition to the Jews of the urban and the peasant populations that made it possible for Chmielnicki to arm the entire country against them within so short a time.</i>" <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>

"<i>[I]n which as many as 200,000 Jews were slaughtered</i>," is a perfectly appropriate quote, as it is true that numbers are cited between 10,000 - 200,000; the 200,000 estimate comes from sources no less authoritative than the 10,000 estimate. However, if you'd prefer, the text could be changed to "<i>in which around 100,000 Jews were murdered</i>," that being the most commonly cited figure in academic texts. By the way, you said "<i>Even on the same article few lines earlier there is more correct number of 10.000 to 100.000 killed Jews</i>." Actually the article stated that "<i>estimates range from 10,000 to <b>well over 100,000</b></i>." (3.) Arkadiusz: You deny that the Ukrainian Cossacks (Haidamaks) waged war against the szlachta of the PLC?! (4.) "<i>[T]heir privileges and autonomy were enormous</i>." I addressed this in the article: "<i>Boleslaus granted the Jews rights that were impressive in post-Crusades Europe. These included recognition of legal testimony of Jews, fines for harming Jews or Jewish property, prohibition of blood libels, and equal commercial rights.</i>" But please don't tell me that they were treated almost like nobility! (5.) "<i>[W]hy invented story of Walentyn Potocki is mentioned?</i>" If you'll note, I called the story "legendary." However, if you are interested in the validity of the story, please see <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_Abraham_8f7b.html" title="Abraham ben Abraham">Walentyn Potocki</a> and the ensuing talk page. (6.) I don't know why there is a seperate chapter for Poland and not some other countries, but when I saw the following I couldn't leave it as it was:
<dl>
<dd><i>The reign of Casimir III, the Great (1333 - 1370) made Poland a safe asylum for Jews. The Jewish population of Poland played a very prominent role and their position was comparable with the status of nobles. After the partitions of Poland, and the final defeat of the January Uprising (1863-1864), Polish nationalists and Jews began to diverge on many issues.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is always hard to estimate historical numbers. Yes, we may change it as you suggest, but I wouldn't be suprised if Jewish death tall was 200,000. Before Chmielnicki and The Deluge, Commonwealth had 10 million inhabitans. Afterwards, it lost ~1/3 of its population - read: 3 million people perished in those and related events. So I can definetly see 200,000 Jews in there. Of course Jews were underpriviliged comapred to nobilit (szlachta), this is not disputable, and you are right the above sentence was erroneus. Jewish position in PLC was quite good compared to Jewish position on other European countries, but to say they were close to nobility is plain wrong. Calling Potocki legendary seems sufficient to me. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 20:54, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree to all points (but it should be added that Poland was only quite good for Jews compared to other European countries until the mid-seventeenth century, after which the Netherlands and England became better and several other countries became fairly equivalent to the PLC with regard to Jews). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 00:27, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, please feel free to add information or sections on anti-Semitism in other countries. (7.) You've accused me of POV and propagandizing. Would a propagandist add this section that I wrote?:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Due to the attractive opportunities Poland offered for Jews at the time, as well as extreme persecution and summary expulsion of Jewry from Spain, a burgeoning Jewish population developed in Poland. Jews were allowed to open Yeshivas and had a measure of independence regarding judging religious legal cases.</i>"</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Arkadiusz, why are you so defensive about the behavior of Poles generations ago, that you have to slander a perfectly accurate and appropriate article? "<i>Some kind of obsession or what</i>?"

<dd>BEcause Jews had it much better than peasants. First, peasants couldn't move out of their villages. Jews could. Jews had it better econimically, they paid less taxes, and they could act as lease-holders who managed whole villages (And charge for privileges of using churches, for example). As for role of the nobles, well, before counterreformation some Jews were wearing the sabres. Some were used in government. No other social class could just convert to became nobles (as Jews could).</dd>
<dd>As for haidamaks, pleease read artciel about Haidamaks. Haidamaks is a phenomenon from later times. And they are not the same as Cossacks.The use of the word is anachronism here, not the fact itself. One have to note however that to present the issues as single Jew atrocity is false, since POLAND AS A WHOLE LOST (precentage-wise) more population than during world war ii. During the deluge some periods lost half of population.

<p>I propose to delete completely current content of this section and replace it with a sentence pointing readers to relevant pages which deal with the individual cases of Anti-Semitism or in-depth with the issues mentioned in the section. My reasoning is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the section's topics have already relevant wiki articles: newly updated <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_Chronology_e655.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland Chronology">History of the Jews in Poland Chronology</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_anti-Semitism_9f9c.html" title="History of anti-Semitism">History_of_anti-Semitism</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_Abraham_8f7b.html" title="Abraham ben Abraham">Abraham ben Abraham</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/m/Chmielnicki_Uprising_1b4c.html" title="Chmielnicki Uprising">Chmielnicki Uprising</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Poland_f479.html" title="History of Poland">History_of_Poland</a>. Wikipedia is using hyperlink language for a purpose - to eliminate duplications. If the original author feels that these articles inadequately reflect his intended message, he should contribute to them first.</li>
<li>IMHO Anti-Semitism article attempts to present a big picture of this phenomenon rather than to dwell on histories of Anti-Semitism in the individual countries. Yet, the Anti-Semitism in Poland section constitutes 14.5% of the whole article, almost as much as Anti-Semitism in Russia/Soviet Union, Germany, France/England/Spain combined. More interestingly, this section deals with the period of Polish history (until 1795) during which the country was a relative "save heaven" for European Jews. Talking about <i>Some kind of obsession...".</i></li>
</ul>
<p>On a person note, I encourage the author to spend some time reading online <a href="http://www.thejewishencyclopedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.thejewishencyclopedia.com" rel="nofollow">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> and balance it with: Ivo Cyprian Pogonowski, <i>Jews in Poland.

<dd>Some eurocents to add here:
<dl>
<dd>1. Ditto, Piotrus. Also, the statement that <i>Jews had it much better only because of their capabilities</i> is also a huge POV - only to the other side.
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it is based on the <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" rel="nofollow">Jewish Encyclopedia</a>. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:27, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. And how about preparing a small table with names of historians and death toll estimates they cite? I made a similar box of the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_5289.html" title="Massacre of Poles in Volhynia">Massacre of Poles in Volhynia</a> article and it ended a quarrel there. Perhaps such a solution would do here as well..?

<dd>4. The privileges granted by Boleslaus were not the only ones granted to Polish Jewry. Also, there were lots of specific privileges granted to local Jewish communities by local authorities - up to almost complete self-governance (see the case of Kazimierz, for instance).
<dl>
<dd>(1.) True that they were not the only rights. (2.) There was a downside to the local authorities as some of them treated Jews particularly harshly. (3.) A measure of self-governance was required for Jewish communities with customs so foreign to Poland, especially considering the social isolation of the Jewish community. However, the Jews were additionally bound by Polish law. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:27, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>5 The legend deserves a mention, although the term "legendary" might be a tad ambiguous here. How about something along the lines of <i>alleged</i>?
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, <i>alleged</i> implies that their is no substantial basis for something (which you probably think is true here). However, in my opinion, <i>legendary</i> seems more NPOV. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:27, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>6 As to the Jewish rights - they most certainly had more rights and privileges than the serfs and their situation was in most cases identical to the legal status of other burghers, whatever their ethnicity or culture. And the decline in (mostly economical) freedom must be described together with the decline of rights of other burghers, conflicted with the szlachta.
<dl>
<dd>Technically, the Jews were, for the most part, protected more than most serfs, but less than burghers. Again, see the <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=808&amp;letter=C" rel="nofollow">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> article. This protection was granted by the royalty because Jews were considered a dependable source of income for the Crown; often damaging Jews was punishable with lashes, because it was legally considered as damaging royal property. Furthermore, the article isn't really about declines in royally decreed rights as much as it is about overt manifestations of anti-Semitism by the Polish people. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:27, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Technically, Jews were probably more protected than burghers. If I will had time, I will bring some quotes. Remember that jews very often came to cities, settled there by starostas and under protection of starostas, while refusing to pay city taxes and participate in city dwellers duties. But, after reading yesterday my books I think it's wrong to say "Jews had it better" or "worse" since situation in every century was different. BTW in article it is said that Jews were accused of aiding the Swedes. Well, sometimes tbey were. In at least one city they were defending city together with Swedes. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 07:18, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>7 Error. After the expulsion of Jews from Spain barely any of the Sefardim arrived to Poland. Most of them migrated to Northern Africa, modern Greece and Turkey. The Jews in Poland were mostly Ashkenazim, that is exiles from France and Germany, persecuted there since the Middle Ages up to 19th century.
<dl>
<dd>You're right. Thanks for the correction. (By the way, many Sefardim also immigrated to the Netherlands). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:27, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>...which doesn't make it any more or less NPOV...</li>
<li>Ok, so let's start right away. I will post a table below, feel free to add historians and data there</li>
<li>np</li>
<li>Then mentioning only those is a tad strange, because it might suggest that the decline in Jewish privileges started in 13th century. Also, the Jews living in Poland were of course bound by the Polish law, just like any other inhabitants of the state. The only difference was that they were subject to their own law as well (executed by the Kahal). I guess you can hardly call that a sign of anti-Semitism.</li>
<li>Well, the term <i>legendary</i> in this context might be interpreted as <i>famous</i> or <i>notable</i>, which is not what the article should say.</li>
<li>We'd have to focus on specific issues here since the matter is apparently disputable. How about preparing a list of differences?</li>
<li>Yup, and some of them also migrated to Poland, but they quickly melted into the Ashkenazim, a thing uncommon in other Jewish communities. Also, I've read a work some time ago about the interactions between the Sefardim and the Armenians in Southern Poland. The author stated that both cultures were also mixing. Poland was a very strange country back then and many uncommoin things happened here. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 07:33, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article is badly structured - way too many lv1 subsections. Several sections before the Polish one discuss 20th century events as well (Anti-Semitism and modernity, The Dreyfus affair, Modern passion plays) and then there is a section dedicated to 20th century. Note there is also a <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html#The_Bohdan_Khmelnytsky_massacres" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism#The_Bohdan_Khmelnytsky_massacres</a> section, adding to the confusion and mostly being duplicate of old Polish section. Besides Poland, only 'Anti-Semitism in Imperial Russia and in the Soviet Union' has its own section, and then there is a section entitled 'Germany' in the '20th century' section. It is a mess. The article is 56kb long, which is almsot twice the recommeneded 32kb. Thus I think it should be a) restructured with 2-level subsections (chronological history, features/discussion) b) info on Poland should be moved to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> (it can has a separate section on anti-semitism) c) unless there is a good reason why <b>only</b> Poland and Russia should have a separate sections in this article I think they should be removed entirely (linked in see also) or merged into a section 'national anti-semitisms' or sth like this, discussing briefly important events by country. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 10:38, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think anything should be moved until <i>all</i> sections detailing specifics and countries are moved. This means sections: 5,6,10-15. All of them. Either this article should be expanded and plenty of information should be added about specifics detailing the whole spectrum of historical anti-Semitism, or all of the above mentioned articles should be moved. As it stands, Joe-six-pack who is researching "A-S" on google will find the wikipedia article among the first ten hits (the 4th, I think). He may notice the major focus on Poland. However, as it stands, if he reads that section he will see two things: (1.) He will see that Poland was more benign than the rest of Europe for a good part of the past millenium, and certainly had no monopoly on anti-Semitism! (2.) He will see a prominent template at the top of the section, indicating that the section is contested and directing him to the talk page. If he reads the talk page, he will better understand how he should view the article. For these two reasons, I don't see any urgency in moving the spoken of sections, if it would otherwise be considered a better idea to expand the article. Nevertheless, as I wrote above, I am not averse to entirely moving 5,6,10-15 (including all subsections in 15), but I think that moving only the Polish and Russian sections is inappropriate. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 07:05, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ttyre, for the sake of being redundant, I don't support moving this section per-se. I prefer adding sections on other countries, and expanding this section to encompass modern times, as well. Hopefully, the various sections will <i>eventually</i> become comprehensive enough for their own articles. I think it's worthwhile to eventually have seperate articles specifically devoted to detailing anti-Semitism in particular countries. There's no dearth of information for these potential sections/articles, and the topics are definately noteworthy.

One such incident occurred in <a href="../../../p/o/z/Poznan.html" title="Poznan">Poznan</a> in 1399, when the local rabbi and thirteen other members of the Jewish community were tortured and burned at the stake after being accused of stealing Church property.</i> I looked at <a href="http://www.aish.com/literacy/jewishhistory/Crash_Course_in_Jewish_History_Part_49_-_The_Jews_of_Poland.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aish.com/literacy/jewishhistory/Crash_Course_in_Jewish_History_Part_49_-_The_Jews_of_Poland.asp" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and found there that: <i>"Poland became Christian very late, only at the turn of the 11th century, and only then did it join the European community of nations (so to speak). After that, it took a couple of hundred years before Poland started to emerge as a nation-state with strong development potential."</i>. After reading that I'd rather remove the previous comment from the article unless it is confirmed by a less dubious source. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> 17:08, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Responding to an idiotic comment on the discussion page of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_supremacy.html" title="Black supremacy">Black supremacy</a>, I found myself at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>. Mindful that this article is an overview of the subject with numerous other, related articles elsewhere on this web site, I still think this piece could use some major additions, major work. The subject is not a primary interest of mine, so I don't foresee myself contributing much more beyond that which I already have. But this is a general solicitation (I haven't done so on the wiki page set aside specifically for that purpose; I figured this was more direct) for contributors to converge upon the page and improve the piece. I've made some suggestions in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Holocaust_b53c.html" title="Talk:The Holocaust">talk</a> -- take 'em or leave 'em. But do contribute. The article seems to have been nominated for featured article status, and that effort (understandably) failed. The next time it's nominated, such a thing shouldn't happen again.

<dd>I just visited that article. As a gay man I have to say I'm delighted that the article boldly talks about the number of gays, disabled and other groups persecuted in the event. In fact I only now learned that 5 to 6 million was the number of Jews that died in the holocaust and that this only accounted for about half of the total. The way the media would present it, its as if gays were loved by the Nazis. This is obviously wrong. I would had suffered the same fate as the Jews if I'd lived in Nazi Germany as well as many other points in history where I would had been persecuted like this. It could even happen again since no one cares about it. I am not saying that the current version is perfect but I do want to stand up in defense for the important information that this article provides that seems to be overlooked by everyone else. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 03:29, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Do you really want me to go through and point out every line and paragraph in this article that is uncited? Do you guys really think that what I put in is invalid? And why is the onus on me to explain myself when u can just revert my good work for no reason? Was it JayJG himself that suggested that banning circumcision is genocide against Jews?

<dd>Mind your language, Sirkumsize. You have obviously been defending the same edit for too long, and now - even though it sounds pretty unbiased - it won't go down anymore.</dd>
<dd>It <i>should</i> be mentioned that some Jews apply "anti-Semitism" to government laws prohibiting circumcision and kosher slaughter. As we know, Switzerland has no kosher slaughter, yet without clear antisemitic motives. I know of no country that has banned circumcision, and perhaps this is why your edit is not accepted by some editors. The Seleucid Greeks banned circumcion, and that's quite a while ago. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 03:45, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Sirk, your link is not only not worth mentioning as backup for <i>any</i> WP article, it fails to prove your point, and certainly to support your unsourced edit. The Soviet ban on circumcision was enacted in an effort to suppress Islam, see <a href="http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/werner/paper_feasting.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/werner/paper_feasting.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. We've already long since had this discussion, and you have yet to bring forth a shred of reliable evidence to support your POV. And no, it was SlRubenstein who made that assertion. While I can speak only for myself, I don't think anyone has anything "against the circumcision issue", just against you inventing an issue and going around inserting this (IMHO warped) POV OR into various articles. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 04:08, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The link by igor was simply to illustrate that indeed a ban on circumcision has happened in recent times. Are you arguing that the link written by Igor is laughable because the soviet Union did not ban circumcision? I think that a handful of people in this community are utterly biased here. I've taken a look at some of the articles that support the current antisemitism article and they are not very scholarly. Of course this argument means nothing. This is not because the links are not unscholarly. It is because the wikipedia community has decided that whatever JayJG, Tomer and a handful of other people considers scholarly is scholarly. The things that Sirkumsize considers scholarly is laughable. Why? There is no why. The reason is simply because if the validity in the links I provided in the article on Circumcision and Antisemitism etc were recognized for what they were -- copious and scholary -- wikipedia would be forced to acknowledge that indeed circumcision is has been banned in recent times, and that it causes the Jews and other groups a great deal of trouble. That's something that certain members of wikipedia will not accept. It is also why I could care less about JayJG's ascertion that my work is POV, uncited etc. I have tried before to please him and come to see that it isn't about wikipedia policy. It is about him. So I will continue to revert the article until such a time as someone can give me a clear and compelling argument as to why all of the things I have already provided in the past are wrong, not just a silly song and dance or statements that like "Sirkumsize, everyone knows that the only people that bring up the circumcision issue have an abnormal growth in their cerebelum, therefore you must have that growth too, but since its so obviously true I don't need to provide a citation, but you obviously would if you made that claim about me" which is about as valid as the arguments I've heard so far. As for RFC, a fair one would come out in my favour, so I think you see where I'm going with that point. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 01:29, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have now reintroduced the concept of legal anti-Semitism, but I'm reluctant to make specific mention of circumcision, because legislations have banned various Jewish practices in history (e.g. keeping <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>, celebrating the new moon, saying <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shema.html" title="Shema">Shema</a> on time) and mentioning circumcision would throw this off-balance.</p>
<p>Sirkumsize: if you just relent about this tiny little point, things will not need to come a head. Your inflammatory strawman-oriented language just exacerbates things (nobody has suggesting cerebral growths).</p>
<p>I've had a few interesting fights with pro- and anti-circumcisionists lately (see e.g. <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cervical_cancer.html" title="Cervical cancer">cervical cancer</a>). The arguments on either sides (apart from the religious ones) are thin and fought over with much snarling, name-calling and abuse. Clearly this subject is heavily loaded, and moving the campaign to articles like the present one really don't help your cause. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 02:22, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some better sources exist -- I'm prepared to say at this point that it very much looks like the Soviets or perhaps the Russians or both banned circumcision at some time or another.

<p>Yay! The community has decided that whatever I decide is "scholarly" is really scholarly! I don't know why nobody bothered to inform me of this community decision, but I'm honored. Meanwhile, Sirkumsize, you very carefully ignored the evidence I presented that the Soviet Union outlawed circumcision specifically in an attempt to squelch Islam, not Judaism, and quite judiciously persecuted muslims who insisted on circumcising (while completely ignoring Jews who continued to circumcise their children). The evidence for this is overwhelming, even on the internet. Igor was not circumcised as an infant most likely because his parents couldn't possibly have cared less about being Jewish, nor their parents before them. It's no big secret that the vast majority of the Soviet Jewish community, especially prior to <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasnost.html" title="Glasnost">glasnost</a>, was not only apostatic, but apathetic, and that many Soviet Jews had no idea they were even Jewish (because their parents or grandparents chose to identify as Russian rather than Jewish), while many others who considered themselves Jewish, were, in fact, not (because of the way the Soviet gov't arbitrarily redefined Jewish nationality identity). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 14:19, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I'm sorry that the community forgot to inform you that they sided with your apathy towards the circumcision issue. I figured that would be clear when the article on Antisemitism and Circumcision was deleted despite dozens of high quality sources to back it up. As for circumcision not being intended to spite Jews, read my edit it. It says that specifically. At least we are making progress in one area. It sounds like some of us are finally coming to terms that circumcision has been banned since the Helenistic period. I was worried that this forum had become too bathed in ignorance about the issue to even accept this. Now that I'm seeing some evidence of growth in the form of some reasonable discussion on the topic, maybe we will see an increased consciousness about the link between circumcision and the strife of the religions that insist on the practicing them -- as you have pointed out -- not exempting Islam. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 03:47, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sirkumsize, what you provided was not "dozens of high quality sources", instead you provided a 1967 opinion piece. It's unclear that that opinion piece even expresses the view you were asserting. You failed to even demonstrate that neo-natal circumcision is strongly linked, in the public mind, with Judaism. Your source is definitely not "high quality", it is, rather, "out of date" and "unencyclopedic". Your claim that I'm "apath[etic] towards (sic) the circumcision issue" is ludicrous. I can't be apathetic since <i>there is no "circumcision issue"</i>, at least not wrt anti-semitism. If <i>you</i> have a bone to pick with Jews and/or Judaism because of neo-natal circumcision, as you seem to, that is <i>your</i> issue. There is not, however, any evidence whatsoever that anyone shares your issue. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 20:58, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I grow weary of and confused by these continuing arguments. In an attempt to be constructive, I will just make a few observations that may be constructive. A couple are based on sound historical research, the last one I think almost everyone will agree about, except Sirk.</p>
<ol>
<li>The commandment to circumcise male children is deep-seated in Judaism, the authors of the Torah as well as the Talmud considered it a critical constitutive act of being in the covenant with God. Individual Jews are welcome to not like it, but there is no doubt that historically it is a central Jewish practice that cuts (no pun intended) to the very core of Judaism</li>
<li>To prevent Jews from circumsising their young is an acto fo anti-Semitism. It may not be the only act of anti-Semitism, and if may not be the most common act of anti-Semitism, but it is nevertheless an anti-Semitic act. This prohibition is one of the things that sparked the Maccabean revolt, and — I am ashamed to say I forget which — either the grea revolt of 70 or the Bar Kozeba revolt.</li>
<li>Jews who chose to comply with any law proscribing circumsision need not view themselves as victims of and-Semitism; they may just be assimilationist (there were many before the Maccabean revolt).</li>
<li>The preceeding two points are not in conflict, because although normative Judaism exists as an idea, expressed in an authoritative body of literature, Jews are heterogeneous and have different attitudes to normative Judaism. For example someone who chooses not to circumcise his son is probably <b>not</b> saying "circumcision is not important to Jews," he is instead saying "I don't really care about normative Judaism." He can thus still recognize that most Jews do not share his feelings.</li>
<li>Any claim that the Jewish commandment to circumsize their own sons (which does not compel any non-Jew to do anything) is a cause of anti-Semitism is either an irrational fanatic or anti-Semitic him/herself, and, like all anti-Semitism, blames Jews, and not themselves, for their anxiety concerning, fear of, resentment of, or hatred for, Jews (meaning not just a group of individuals who call themselves "Jewish," but a group of people who identify themselves as Jewish because of <i>some</i> sort of identification with or attachment to Judaism.</li>

<dd><a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">User:Slrubenstein</a>, thank you for admitting that it was shameful that you forget about the said revolt. It must be nice to have a status whereby the community demands no burden of proof from you since there is not a shred of evidence anywhere to back up your claim, especially that the idea that linking anti-semitism to circumcision is in and of itself anti-semitic. You are simply redefining a term that carries a negative connotation is a febble attempt to censor the truth. I don't understand why this community is so afraid of the message I am bringing here that you are afraid even to let me add a three word qualification to the article which no one can really disagree with. I have been successful in providing dozens of scholarly encyclopedic links to back up the idea that such a link exists and that this very sort of censorship -- that I am a victim of right at this instance -- is used to blackmail academic into ignoring the truth that circumcision is a hideous mutilation and sexual assault that any advanced society would otherwise outlaw.

You really believe I'm an isolated case? Use your senses and your intelligence and see that the only way to solve this despite is if we work together and stop this silly reversion war.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pobedonostsev's quote</span></h3>
<p>"Articulated by Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a Russian statesman, the head of the Russian Holy Synod and a known anti-Semite, the policy was designed to "cause one-third of the Jews to emigrate, one-third to accept baptism, and one-third to starve". ("Jewish History of the Russian Federation: From Ancient Times to the Second World War." Heritage Films, Par.13)"</p>
<p>This part of article is not based on reliable sources. There is no evidence that Pobedonostsev said this phrase. "Jewish History of the Russian Federation: From Ancient Times to the Second World War." does not name person, who heard and reported this phrase. Attributing this phrase to Pobedonostsev needs HARD evidence. Otherwise it is libel.</p>
<p>If you search the web, you will find that the phrase has no exact form</p>
<p>"cause one-third of the Jews to emigrate, one-third to accept baptism, and one-third to starve" wiki variant</p>
<p>"one-third of Russian Jews should convert to Orthodoxy, one-third should emigrate and one-third should be killed." www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/051601Choral.shtml</p>
<p>"one-third of the Jews will convert, one-third will die, and one-third will flee the country" www.iona.edu/faculty/dwilliams/130/barnett.htm</p>

<p>Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations, Europe, edition 1995, page 91, entry: Croatia Quote: Slavko Kvaternik [the second in command to the Croatian WWII fuehrer, Dr Ante Pavelic] explained [on the day of formation of the WWII "Independent State of Croatia", on April 10, 1941] how pure Croatia should be built - by forcing one third of the Serbs to leave Croatia, one third to convert to Catholicism, and one third to be exterminated. Soon Ustasha bands initiated a bloody orgy of mass murder of Serbs unfortunate enough not to have converted or left Croatia on time. The enormity of such criminal behavior shocked even the conscience of German commanders... End quote</p>
<p><a href="http://psychcentral.com/psypsych/Ustashe" class="external free" title="http://psychcentral.com/psypsych/Ustashe" rel="nofollow">http://psychcentral.com/psypsych/Ustashe</a></p>
<p>The Usta?e embraced the Nazi ideology of the time. They aimed at an ethnically "pure" Croatia, and saw the Serbs that lived in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as the their biggest obstacle. Thus, Usta?e ministers Mile Budak, Mirko Puk and Milovan&#160;?ani? declared in May 1941 that the goal of the Usta?e was: One third of the Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia (ISC) to be catholicized One third of the Serbs to be expelled out of ISC One third of the Serbs in the ISC to be liquidated</p>
<p>So phrase in various forms is attributed to different people without any evidence. It is surely a libel.</p>

<p>Pobedonostsev writes about his impressions after visiting Smolensk Gubernia. He writes that "polish colonisation" is a problem. There are only two sentences about Jews. In English it is: "Another problem is Jews, which have moved to this region in great numbers and grasped all the money matters. Some of them register as first guild merchants (this is not difficult), buy large estates and become landowners." - no calls to cleanse some regions. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldDuck_c868.html" title="User:DonaldDuck">DonaldDuck</a> 07:07, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>One more excerpt from Pobedonostsev letter to Nicolas II (let him speak for himself) Rough translation to English:</p>
<p>"Envy and intrigue are common at the court. People, which constituted the society of Anichkov Palace did not know me, had no contacts with me, heard only rumors and anecdotes about me, and as they reproduced this rumours, they used their influence not only on Empress Maria Fedorovna but , partially, on Tsar himself . I continued to fulfil his orders, but felt that I was libeled. I didn?t interfere in business of other departments, lived in solitude, still in Russia and abroad I was considered all-powerful. All government decrees were attributed to me, even those I did not know at all. From various parts of Russia, from Europe, from America I have received malicious, threatening letters from Nihilists, Anarhists, Liberals of different types and Jews, attributing to me personally all restrictions, all deportation orders e.t.c." --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldDuck_c868.html" title="User:DonaldDuck">DonaldDuck</a> 07:53, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why do you think I don't like Polyakov?? I don't understand. Citation from Polyakov states that authorship of the "famous formula" is unclear, thus it proves that it was not articulated by Pobedonostsev.--<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaldDuck_c868.html" title="User:DonaldDuck">DonaldDuck</a> 10:46, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest to search for earliest source of this "quotation" to trace its origin. At present oldest source is "The Melting Pot" play written by Israel Zangwill in 1908. It is pure fiction.
