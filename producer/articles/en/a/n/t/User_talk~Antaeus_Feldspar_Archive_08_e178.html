<p>Hi, Antaeus. I'm sorry you felt you had to talk to the guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Swiss_Knight&amp;diff=28352320&amp;oldid=28351711" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Swiss_Knight&amp;diff=28352320&amp;oldid=28351711" rel="nofollow">like that</a>. He didn't act very sensibly, but surely there's room for thinking he was trying to help? For that matter, it's better not to shower even the vandals with sarcasm. I've found that modelling the kind of tone that you'd like to hear from them is often the most effective way of handling newbies. I aspire to it, I don't always accomplish it, needless to say.

<p>Hello.

I am not sure what his/her agenda is, but it seems that he/she keeps ignoring my hints at dropping all of it into the article for Melissa Scott. And when he/she does, he/she seems hell-bent on putting stuff up without references, and putting it in as many places as possible. Check out the article for <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Scott_8673.html" title="Eugene Scott">Eugene Scott</a> and see what I mean.

There's always someone around willing to slam you across the head with a stick if you've failed to show enough <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">WikiLove</a> but surprisingly few people seem to care about blatant open repeated POV-pushing.

The problem is that <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a> is too often interpreted as "As long as the person who has blatantly thumbed their nose at all Wikipedia's goals and standards maintains a straight face, nothing can be done about them." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:49, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Userfication for The Swiss Knight</span></h2>
<p>Userfying this seems like an obvious way to go to me.. did you see a problem with that? Normally I'd just do it but I see there's already been some disagreement over it. I dont' see that it's harmful as a user page, and it's obviously not an article. Is there some reason to continue dragging it through Afd? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:09, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the problem is that userfication is a process that has crept. When someone with the user name "JohnDoakes" creates a page titled John Doakes and uses it to tell the world "John Doakes is happily married with two kids and is a systems administrator in Dallas, TX" there's little to object to in userfying it; the user probably just made a user page, for the reason user pages <i>exist</i>, and simply didn't know that we have a specific namespace for those pages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But policy states that user pages are <i>not</i> for everything and anything, just because they're out of the article namespace. I suspect that many people choose to vote "userfy" because it seems like a way that they can affirm "no, this doesn't belong in the article namespace" without being labelled as the bad guy, the EVOL MEEN deletionist who wants to KILL ALL FUN IN WIKIPEDIA. The problem is that this seldom results in the obvious question being asked: is this appropriate for userspace either? It's a judgement call in each case, and unfortunately there is not a lot of set-in-stone policy. I was already leaning against userfication because the story of "The Swiss Knight" really has nothing to do with the purpose of user pages; we don't even know if The Swiss Knight is AshJW or merely someone who AshJW used to work with. Then the behavior of the various supporters in the AfD just put the cap on things; seeing lots of obvious meatpuppets puts my hackles up, having my "humanity" questioned because I don't think Wikipedia should host random fiction doesn't give me warm fuzzies, and having that same someone declare the discussion moot because he already took the decision out of people's hands makes me unhappy indeed. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:16, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You added "although two persons of undetermined credentials claim that this is a marketing technique rather than a scientific portrayal of how the drugs actually work."</p>
<p>You're a wiki-vandal, destroying the integrity of this article. Many respected researchers question the serotonin theory of depression and rightfully so. Please at least try to give the appearance of being NPOV. Francesca Allan of MindFreedomBC 08:52, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a rather large distinction -- at least any person with any shred of objectivity would concede that there is -- between "question the serotonin theory of depression" and "claim [the serotonin theory] is a marketing technique." If you think that it is in keeping with Wikipedia standards to put that second claim into the mouths of "respected researchers", under the misguided notion that anyone who "questions the serotonin theory" must of course <i>also</i> share the belief that the serotonin theory is a marketing technique created by the drug industry, then it is <i>you</i> who threatens the integrity of the article, by substituting your prejudices for actual facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I see that, like your fellow POV-pusher Ombudsman, you are quick to accuse but slow to actually check your facts -- even when simple fact-checking would be easy and show good faith. You were already notified that your hysteric complaints about "vandalism" were completely unfounded under the Wikipedian definition of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. But yet here you are again, screeching an accusation that you would know was false, if you had even bothered to <i>check</i> what someone else was telling you. You could have determined in a single minute that my warning about your misuse of terminology was in fact correct, but clearly, since you are still making the very same mistake, I can only assume you said "Oh, he's one of those stooges of the drug industry!" (as your compadre Ombudsman so <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civilly</a> dismisses me) and thus decided to completely ignore the warning, because I was someone of a different POV who was telling you things you didn't want to hear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, tell me again why I should be putting faith in the word of a person doing that, on what would "give the appearance of NPOV"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:18, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Antaeus, I found you via your edits on Neologism, and found that you have made various NPOV adjustments on Scientology so I think you would be a expert in this situation. There is an open arbitration request open on this page. There is a group of users who are using sources that have no citations on citeseer or google scholar. It seems that these users are trying to have "engrams" included as a fundamental concepts of NLP. I'm arguing that it should be restricted to one or two sentences, or even remove it altogether. It is not used by any of the original developers of NLP nor any mainstream NLP trainers or publications. The group headed by DaveRight, and now Camridge (who appeared after a arbitration request was made against a similar editor HeadleyDown) is using very flakey evidence to connect NLP to dianetics or Scientology -- and claiming that their view is scientific and any sources which provide counter-examples are pseudoscience -- it seems to be a mixture of original research and selective research. I'm requesting your comment on how best to calculate weight. For an academic field it is easy, you can demand references from peer-reviewed journals ONLY, otherwise it would be considered original research. However NLP is a mixed field with some academics, and non-academics. Some practitioners and trainers have no interest in academic, scholarship. Many authors and trainers make exagerated claims in training and marketing. So the question to you is party directed at wikipedia policy for subject of this nature. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">Comaze</a> 09:39, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly? Not impressed at all. His listing of what I did, and what he in his paranoia thought it was intended to imply, shows that he <i>does not have</i> the understanding that a normal, rational person has of the effects of his own actions. He lacks the ability to empathize; he can't understand his actions <i>except</i> from his perspective. And I couldn't have asked for anything better than for him to prove in this way, to every visitor of this page, that he is not a man acting from idealism but from an inability to process the world as normal adults have the obligation to do. He's his own biggest public relations disaster. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:34, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please explain why you think it is hypocritical. I would be interested to hear your argument. I don't think its obvious at all that it's hypocritical. It's completely in line with his exposing <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_North_0de2.html" title="Oliver North">Oliver North</a> et al on his namebase page. He isn't giving any personal information - he is just saying what people said and who said it. While I personally think screen names is good enough, I don't really see why you can say that its hypocritical for him to do that. Its what he's been doing for the past 40 years. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 16:17, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oliver North is a public figure, and it is a principle explicitly codified in American law that public figures have less expectation of privacy than ordinary citizen; that's a difference to start with. Second, what he collected on Oliver North was <i>already</i> public information; he merely collated that information, which was primarily public statements North had made. That's a far cry from what Brandt is doing, saying and proving "Hey, I <i>already know</i> what public statements these people have made, but that's not enough; I want their <i>personal</i> information and I'm willing to take it from anonymous sources who openly admit they are going along with this specifically to <i>hurt</i> those people. Not that that's why <i>I'm</i> doing it, of course. No, no, of course not. It's because, uh.... oh! Yeah, I'm gonna bring a <i>lawsuit</i> against them, so of course that means I <i>have to</i> collect their real names (and of course, reveal them to the entire Internet the minute I get them, because that's part of the normal procedure of a lawsuit, after all, trust me on this.) What am I suing them for? Uh... uhmmm... well, see, this guy here? He called me a 'kook', so of course I added him to the lawsuit! I mean, it's not <i>legal</i> for one person to call another a kook, right, so of <i>course</i> I'll be suing him! I'm <i>certainly</i> not scraping up these people's personal information in order to intimidate and harass them; a noted privacy advocate would never do anything like <i>that</i>."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in summary, the fact that Brandt has been collecting <i>public</i> information about <i>public</i> figures since the 1960s doesn't make him not a hypocrite for collecting <i>private</i> information on <i>private</i> individuals; even if he'd been doing <i>that</i> since the 1960s, he is still demanding that <i>he</i>, a public figure (go look at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html#References" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt#References</a> and ask how many private individuals get that many articles written about them in national venues) get an exemption from having <i>public information about him</i> revealed. And by the way, I expect to receive your apology for your unforgivably scurrilous and knowingly false allegations about me. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:38, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Outing</span></h2>
<p>I'd just point out that, whilst I understand that you are trying to say that it's not pointing out he is gay, and your intention is to point out that he is a hypocrite, that is still POV. At best, you can write in the article perhaps under a section "criticisms of Wikipedia watch" why some people think that his outing of people is hypocritical, given that he is a privacy advocate. Mind you, if doing that, you would need to also include why he is doing that, and his own justification for it, as well as other reasons why it is not hypocritical and not at all inconsistent with what he is doing. But it shouldn't be included in some subtle little link thing at the bottom. The problem is that it's not neutral. Saying "this guy is a hypocrite" can never be neutral. At least, not unless you are writing about <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocrates.html" title="Hippocrates">hippocrates</a> (I hope that I got his spelling right).

<dd>I think you're still laboring under some pretty heavy misconceptions. Chief among them seems to be "the article must be NPOV; therefore, it cannot describe any POVs or the reasonings behind them." The truth is of course that the goal of NPOV <i>is</i> to describe POVs and the reasonings behind them without <i>endorsing</i> those POVs. I believe you might be acting in good faith when you say "we can't make any reference to <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outing.html" title="Outing">outing</a> because people might read it and say, 'Gee, I never approved of the practice of outing, even though the unwilling sacrifices made of the privacy of individuals are supposedly done for the greater good; Brandt may claim he's invading people's privacy for the greater good but that doesn't explain why the only people he's trying to expose personal information are those who have criticized him, personally'. if the reader forms a POV on an issue because of what they read on Wikipedia, it must mean whatever they read is POV and has to be removed." I believe you may be arguing that in good faith -- but it's still completely mistaken. Providing people with information and perspectives so that they <i>can</i> come to their conclusions is what we're <i>supposed to do.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "Saying "this guy is a hypocrite" can never be neutral", yes, yes, you're completely right on that, but it's utterly irrelevant; <b>YOU</b> were the one who made your own comparison of Brandt's actions and your perception of the practice of 'outing' (which some people still approve, mind you) and decided that <i>in your opinion</i> Brandt's actions made him look like a hypocrite, <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_the_Elder_502d.html" title="Hillel the Elder">doing to his neighbor exactly that which he makes clear is hateful to himself</a>. <b>IF</b> the article were to say "Daniel Brandt is a hypocrite" then <b>THAT</b> would be unacceptably non-neutral. But extending that to "the article must not say that some people might consider Brandt's actions hypocritical"? Extending it even further to "the article must not include any references to points of comparison by which a reader might decide for themselves that Brandt's actions are hypocritical"?
