<p>Antimatter is a very important topic within physics, and one of the major discoveries of the 20th century, so I think it deserves a "top" importance designation. The article itself has lots of good information on physics, history, and speculation, as well as links to a number of other articles. I think it could use a bit of editing for readability and, there are a few broken links and other problems that could benefit from some cleaning up. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesino_560b.html" title="User:Wesino">Wesino</a> 17:58, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is this page really the right place for a description of the Antiuniverse theory? With the recent reports from ATHENA and ATRAP it is looking less and less likely that an Antiuniverse is plausible. I agree that there should be some mention of it, but I sincerly believe it should have a seperate article and (that article) should be referenced in the 'see also' section.</p>

<p>Ok, but should this universe be full of matter, should it not have the opposite in relativity!!! Could the universe that we live in, and is slowly expanding, could it not be expanding into the antiuniverse. It stands to reason that what we know is not the be all and end all of life and the likes. The existance of antimatter has been proven, therefor the universe must have its opposite, wheather it is in this or an alternate one. So I say could the universe that we live in, could it not be expanding into the antiunivers. Thus giving off the gamma rays that flood our scopes and graphs with no answer??? This is but a speculation and a theroy. Pastry!!!! 11.11.06</p>
<p>Am I right in saying that an Anti Universe should exist? I forgot who, but someone stated that everything has an oppisite, and antimatter is matters oppisite, so why shouldn't the universe have one (an oppisite)? It seems possible, but even if there was, we would have to leave it alone, due to the fact that if regular matter (including air) touched it, it would anniohlate. ---- Anonymous</p>

<p>Whilst I understand that, an antiparticle and a Particle will Anihelate in contact, What would happen if an Antimatter Counterpart, of, lets say, Uranium(Antiuranium?), would come in Contact with an atom of Hydrogen?, Would there be Anihilation?, Thank you for you'r time.-Maurizio Dikdan</p>
<dl>
<dd>What would happen is that the electron in the hydrogen atom would annihilate with one of the positrons orbiting the anti-uranium nucleus, and the proton in the hydrogen atom would annihilate with either one of the antiprotons or one of the antineutrons in the anti-uranium nucleus. This would cause a particle shower of the type described above, which would dump enough heat into the anti-uranium nucleus to boil it into its constituent components, resulting in a shower of antineutrons and anti-helium nuclei (antimatter <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_particle.html" title="Alpha particle">alpha particles</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Interestingly, the opposite reaction (dropping an antiproton into a uranium atom) has been proposed as one means of initiating fission in a nuclear-pulse-propulsion rocket (a variant of the AIMStar design, if I recall correctly). The idea is that the pulse of high-energy neutrons from one atom's disintegration would cause fissioning in many other nearby uranium atoms, releasing far more energy than the antiproton annihilation alone gave. This in turn would be used to ignite a fusion reaction in a pellet of frozen deuterium, and the resulting plasma fireball would be contained by a magnetic field and directed out the end of the rocket. Nobody's sure if this would work as intended, but it's an approach towards building an interstellar drive that would be far less massive than a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Orion_604a.html" title="Project Orion">Orion</a>-style nuclear drive or a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Daedalus_3237.html" title="Project Daedalus">Project Daedalus</a>-style laser-initiated fusion drive, while requiring far less antimatter than a beamed-core antimatter drive.

    No more than a handful of atoms have ever been made.
</pre>
<p>Hm. A "handful of atoms" is a lot of atoms. It's also a lot of energy, if we're talking antimatter atoms!</p>
<p>Hey, I'm slow, but I think a handful of blah, means five. I would assume they have made more than five and less than the zillions that make up a hand. So how many (at least an order of magnitude) have they made?</p>
<p><br />
<i>Hey, I'm slow, but I think a handful of blah, means five.</i> That's precisely the problem. In this context the colliqualism doesn't really make sense, so it shouldn't be used. It's like saying that something "sparked a wave of controversy"--sure those are both commonly used colliqualisms, but you still can't spark a wave.</p>

<dd>Electricity isn't the result of electrons specifically, its the result of the flow of charge. Protons, electrons, positrons, even charged atoms can create electricity. If you are significantly charged, you would be creating significant electricity simply by moving. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 09:09, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the past 40 years, the World has produced about a microgram of antimatter, but in 1999, NASA announced that they successfully made 9 antihydrogon atoms. If we were to build maybe, 1000 AM facilities in the future (possibly on the Moon), we will be able to make a millionth of a gram a YEAR. But, it would would make better sense to use this large amount for research purposes, instead of fuel and weapons, if we were to use it for that purpose it would be a waste of energy, because were using a large amount of energy to make an equal amount of energy equivalent to the antimatter made, so you would be wasting a perfectly large amount of energy.</p>
<p>The exhaunge rate is 500,000 matter subatomic particles to make 1 anti subatomic particle. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.249.162.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.249.162.69_5c98.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.249.162.69">contribs</a>) on 23:12, 23 March 2006.</small></p>

<p>I'm very far from a chemist or physicist or something, but somehow I have doubts about this, "Antiparticles can be considered as normal particles moving backwards in time".

<li>Yes, this is the standard interpretation of antiparticles in quantum field theory.

<p>The article says: "... possible to attain antimatter for $25 billion per gram (roughly 1,000 times more costly than current space shuttle propellants)". This has to be checked and clarified. What exactly is meant by "1,000 times more costly"? Surely it doesn't mean that current space shuttle propellants cost $25 billion per kilogram?

<dd>Your link does not appear to contain information about the question of annihilation products. My understanding of what actually happens is that proton/antiproton annihilation (the reaction producing most of the energy in an antimatter drive or bomb) produces one quark/antiquark annihilation, expelling the remaining quarks bound as <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pions.html" title="Pions">pions</a>. The initial annihilation produces gamma rays, mostly (as it would be a quark annihilating with its antimatter counterpart, just as with the decay of a <span class="texhtml">π<sup>0</sup></span> meson). The expelled pions are either two <span class="texhtml">π<sup>0</sup></span> mesons, which almost immediately decay into gamma rays, or a <span class="texhtml">π <sup>+</sup></span> and <span class="texhtml">π <sup>−</sup></span> meson, which decay into antimuons or <a href="../../../m/u/o/Muons.html" title="Muons">muons</a> (respectively) after a few metres of travel, which in turn decay after travelling hundreds of metres. During this time, <span class="texhtml">π <sup>+</sup></span> , <span class="texhtml">π <sup>−</sup></span> , <span class="texhtml">μ <sup>−</sup></span> , and <span class="texhtml">μ <sup>+</sup></span> can be deflected to provide thrust for a space drive, or can interact with electrons and nuclei in matter to provide heat for power or a different type of space drive. The main mode of energy loss if I understand correctly is with gamma ray emission during the first annihilation and for <span class="texhtml">π<sup>0</sup></span> annihilations (as the gamma rays carry away most of their energy or dump it as difficult-to-use heat in reactor shielding). Neutrinos carry away some of the energy when charged pions decay into muons, but quite a bit of it stays with the muons. I don't have exact efficiency numbers, but an upper limit for a space drive would be about 450 MeV of kinetic energy in two charged pions of mass 135 MeV/C^2, from a proton/antiproton pair with a mass of about 1880 MeV/C^2, for an efficiency of around 50%. Actual efficiency will be less due to neutral pion production. Efficiency of a power plant would be much less, because your final stage is a heat engine with a maximum efficiency of around 30%-50%. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 03:08, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have often wondered why we so quickly assume that the weight (not mass) of anti-matter is positive. If a hole in a silicon lattice is a good analogy of a positron in free space, then it is natural to think that positrons are repulsed by the gravitational force of a normal matter, since holes are. This could also help explain other problems. First, where is all the anti-matter? Perhaps in super-clusters of galaxy clusters. Why is the expansion of the universe accelerating? Imagine only two stars exist, one normal and one anti matter. They not only repel each other, they accelerate as they separate. The same may be true for large groups of super galaxy clusters mixed with anti super galaxy clusters. How do we know the weight of anti-matter? - Bill Cox; Feb 4, 2005; bill@viasic.com</p>

<li>If antimatter had negative mass, it would have negative mass-energy (e=mc^2) and so a particle-antiparticle collision would result in the two disappearing, and the leftover kinetic energy being used to create products. However, the observed enery totals after annihiations have far higher mass-energy than could be accounted for if only the kinetic energy was left to create products. -9/4/2005 smangham@hotmail.com: Badly expressed my objection origonally, reworded it to make more sense</li>

<p>Do black holes not give off gamma radiation?????? So does it not stand to reason that this could be the universes natural antimatter lab?????? This therefor could explain the absense of antimatter in our known universe. The gravitational pull of a said black hole draws even the smallest particals and the fastest into its centre. Could it be that the centre is just a compounded sphere of antimatter rotating at such a high speed that none are relesed and the matter that is drawn in is crushed and colide with the antimatter giving off gamma radiation in the process.

<dd>Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing anti-atoms of hydrogen, and also anti-deuteron nuclei, made out of an antiproton and an antineutron, but not yet more complex antimatter. In principle, sufficiently large quantities of antimatter could produce anti-nuclei of other elements, which would have exactly the same properties as their positive-matter counterparts. However, such a "periodic table of anti-elements" is thought to be, at best, highly unlikely, as the quantities of antimatter required would be, quite literally, astronomical.</dd>

<p>I'm far from knowledgable about antimatter, but why would it take "astronomical quantities" of antimatter to produce a more complex element than hydrogen?

<dd>I'm surprised they produced antideuterium at all.

Making anything heavier would involve producing large quantities of antideuterium and fusing that, which would be horrifically expensive and time-consuming. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 03:13, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd go with the $25 billion per gram value. A back of the envelope estimate can be obtained by assuming $0.05 per kWh (3.6 MJ), C^2 J/kg, and an efficiency of at best 1 part in 10^4 (for a facility optimized for antiproton bulk production; current facilities are about 1 part in 10^-6). This gives about $1.2 billion per gram at 1 part in 10^4 efficiency (not currently obtained).

The missing link for lab-scale experiments is a means of cooling antihydrogen from temperatures on the order of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronvolt.html" title="Electronvolt">eV</a> (what you get in the "cooled" antiproton traps) to temperatures on the order of micro-eV or lower (what you need for <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_cooling.html" title="Laser cooling">laser cooling</a> and long-term neutral atom confinement). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 04:19, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do a particle and its anti-particle convert into energy upon collision? What is the mechanism for this interaction, and should it be included in this article? <a href="../../../f/f/l/User%7EFFLaguna_e641.html" title="User:FFLaguna">FFLaguna</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Convert into energy" is a poor description, as "energy" is a bookkeeping number, not a tangible "thing". When a particle and antiparticle (or indeed, any other two particles) interact, the result of the interaction can be any other configuration of particles with the same energy, momentum, and other conserved values ("quantum numbers") that the original system had.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For ordinary, stable particles like protons or electrons bumping into each other at low energies, what you normally get out is the same particles that came in, with an exchange of energy and momentum, because these are the only allowed states within the energy limits. In high-energy collisions, you can get more exotic particles created, or particle/antiparticle pairs, as long as the total system energy (including <a href="../../../r/e/s/Rest_energy.html" title="Rest energy">rest energy</a> of the new particles) remains the same, and all other values are conserved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A particle/antiparticle collision is special, because all of the conserved values (quantum numbers) besides energy and momentum cancel out. That's actually one way of describing what antimatter is (matter with reversed charge, parity, baryon/lepton number, strangeness, etc). Because these values sum to zero, the outcome can be any other particle/antiparticle pair, or a pair of photons, or a combination of the above, or odder variations. What usually happens is that you get a shower of light-weight particles (like <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron.html" title="Electron">electron</a>/<a href="../../../p/o/s/Positron.html" title="Positron">positron</a> pairs and <a href="../../../m/e/s/Meson.html" title="Meson">mesons</a>) and high-energy <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_ray.html" title="Gamma ray">gamma rays</a> resulting. Not all of the energy has to go into the rest mass of particles, so when particles are created, they'll typically have quite a bit of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> as well, representing the difference between the rest mass of the products and the original particle/antiparticle pair's energy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For specific examples, a low-energy interaction between an electron and positron (mass of about 500 keV) will give you two 500 keV gamma rays going in opposite directions, and the annihilation of a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton.html" title="Proton">proton</a> and antiproton will generally give you gamma rays in the hundreds-of-keV range and <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pion.html" title="Pion">pi mesons</a>, though other combinations are possible (you can think of this one as resulting from one <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quark.html" title="Quark">quark</a> from the proton and one antiquark from the antiproton annihilating, but that's not strictly correct). High-energy collisions typically produce "jets" of particles, which represent heavy, unstable particles that are created and then immediately decay into showers of secondary products going in the directions of the originally-created particles. As long as the kinetic energy supplied is large, the interacting particles can be just about anything (not necessarily particle/antiparticle pairs, though they're often used).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "particle/antiparticles annihilate to produce energy" line, as far as I can tell, comes from a bad habit popular literature has of confusing <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a> with energy. It _has_ energy, but the light is composed of particles (<a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">photons</a>).</dd>

<dd>Black hole <i>jets</i> are certainly one place to find antimatter. This is not what was said in the article, which went on about black hole <i>horizons</i> and Hawking radiation.

Further, there is no observation of Hawking radiation, much less antimatter in any such radiation.

<dd>Regarding black holes, in my previous response, I list "near an event horizon" and "relativistic jet" separately for a reason, as these are completely different phenomena. If the horizon is described in terms of the <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unruh_effect.html" title="Unruh effect">Unruh effect</a>, pair production in a high temperature environment is the _mechanism_ by which antimatter is produced, making it an extremely relevant part of any description of Hawking radiation that takes this form. If you're claiming that Hawking radiation shouldn't be an example because it hasn't been observed, that's one thing, but claiming that pair production isn't a significant part of a description of Hawking radiation if it _does_ exist is quite another.

If Hawking radiation exists (which has not been shown) and if microscopic black holes exist (which observational evidence is against), then antimatter makes up less than half the resulting radiation.

<p>Ok, the "antimatter universe" section answered one question, but created a couple more. My original question was going to be "can antiparticles join together as sub units to create antiatoms and then to molecules." Well, obviously, if there were enough, then yes, due to the theory of antigalaxies and such. However, what about the little known dark matter. I'm not entirely sure what it is but seeing as how is seems to be classified as matter, and seems to be causing the universe to accelerate(or at least that is one theory as to why we are not deccelerating) that it must be numerous. Well, first question that comes to mind: "Is there anti-dark matter?" second question: "what if the normal dark matter comes into contact with what would have to be the anti-dark matter around an "anti-matter galaxy?" I know, this is all extraneous speculation, but, if you have an answer(or even, any idea) then please respond. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ahnung (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ahnung_19a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ahnung">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

Also, there's no reason to assume dark matter even has antiparticles, and even if it does, there's no reason they would interact with matter any differently.

<p>Forgive me if I'm unable to articulate this adequately but I was wondering... If matter in the Universe obtains sufficient mass you can get a black hole (I know that's rather a simplistic explanation) but what about Antimatter? Does the same apply or would different rules produce an altogether different effect? RawPhoenix 00:01, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the affect of matter and antimatter on the above headline?? Should either, all or just one be made of or start from antimatter?? I have no history in there areas but do have some extensive self knolage of this. Please excuss the typing. If you have any input on this i would be very interested.

<dd>A black hole made of antimatter would act exactly the same as a black hole made of normal matter. The <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_hair_theorem.html" title="No hair theorem">no hair theorem</a> says only mass, angular momentum, and electric charge make a difference. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baryon_number.html" title="Baryon number">Baryon number</a> is not one of those, so black holes with positive baryon number (normal matter), negative baryon number (antimatter), and zero baryon number (pure energy) would act exactly the same. White holes probably don't exist, but if they did, the situtation would probably be the same as for black holes. —<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeenan_Pepper_34f0.html" title="User:Keenan Pepper">Keenan Pepper</a> 21:11, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Keenan! Pastry 17.11.06</p>
<p>As the universe that we live in is made of matter, could the outer of our universe be antimatter?? or is it that the centre of our universe be made of antimatter and the matter that is attracted causes the expantion of ours to what it is now?? Pastry 17.11.06</p>

<p>Ok. I know that according to Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation that all matter gives off a gravitational field.

<dd>It is likely that the mass number would be a positive value due to the positive mass that an antiparticle has (See my discussion in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_interaction_of_antimatter.html" title="Gravitational interaction of antimatter">Gravitational interaction of antimatter</a>). However, the element itself would likely be marked with a bar above the symbol, also known as a macron.
