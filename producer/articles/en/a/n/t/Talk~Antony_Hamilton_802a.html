<p>I can find no printed source to support the allegations made in this article that Hamilton was rejected for the role of Bond because he was gay. Without a reputable source, such a statement violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy - not on Hamilton, who is dead, but on the producers of the Bond films, and therefore I have removed it. And there was no "firestorm of controversy" regarding Tula in For Your Eyes Only, either, only some mild tabloid snickering regarding someone who was on screen for less than a second. I can't find any source to support that Hamilton was even considered for the role of Bond in 1987 since Pierce Brosnan had been heir presumptive since Moore quit and Dalton was chosen after Brosnan pulled out. However this is less likely to be considered a BLP issue so I left it in pending someone providing a source. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:14, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Hamilton definitely auditioned, screen tested, and was for a long time a serious contender for the role of Bond in the mid 1980s. There are many printed sources to support this claim - mainly interviews with Hamilton himself, but also some interviews done with other people involved. You are right, however, in that there does not seem to be many of these printed sources easily available on the web at present. The only thing I can find after a quick web search using a search engine is a snippet from an article written by Rebecca Brickner for People Magazine in 1986 available under the "in print" section at: <a href="http://www.antonyhamilton.com" class="external free" title="http://www.antonyhamilton.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.antonyhamilton.com</a>. However, just because information is not on the Internet does not automatically mean the information is false, untrue, or does not exist, which many people seem to think these days. You probably have to go to you local research library in this case and look at their article databases in order to find more printed sources&#160;:-). Moreover - probably contributing to the fact that you cannot find much on the web about this - we are after all talking about a piece of news which is more than 20 years old and which has been little talked of since then seeing as Hamilton never got the role and in addition died more than a decade ago. Also, there generally being a lot of "hush-hush" when Bond is cast, there was not LOADS of documentation done on this event in the first place.</p>
<p>I know that there definitely has been several printed articles documenting Hamilton's Bond experiences, and supporting that he indeed was a serious contender for Bond, available on the web in the past - I can definitely remember reading quite a few of them about a year or so ago on some Bond and/or Hamilton webpage. These sources seem to have been removed at this point in the proceedings, though - probably, as also often is the case, and which you also have to take into consideration when finding or not finding things on the Internet, for copyright reasons.</p>
<p>You are however probably right in removing the information saying that Hamilton was rejected for the part because he was gay - seeing as this, as far as I know, was never properly confirmed by anyone, but merely newspaper speculation. Some magazines further speculated that it was because Hamilton was blond, others because he had too strong an Australian accent, etc, etc... (Ladynimon 16:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC))</p>
