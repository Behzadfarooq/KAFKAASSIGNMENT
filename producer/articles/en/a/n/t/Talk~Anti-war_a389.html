<p>Is this article an anti-war article that only pertains to the USA? If not, why not include other countries anti-war movement? Additionally, this is posted on here "<i>World War II seemed, for a time, to set anti-war movements at a distinct social disadvantage, it seemed, for some time, that only ardent pacificists would argue against World War Two and the results</i>"... Now does this only pertain to the USA also? And if so, it need to be changed, since there was a large anti-war isolationist movement in the USA during WWII, until the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Even after the bombing there was some anti-war opposition to the WWII. --signed an Anon</p>

<p>This was the intro:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Anti-war</b> is a term that is widely adopted by any social movement or person that seeks to end or oppose a future or current <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a>. It can be considered a somewhat <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_term.html" title="Loaded term">loaded term</a>, as anti-war activists are not always protesting against war <i>per se</i> (they may support one side over another, for example), nor are their opponents necessarily aggressively "pro war.".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In simple terms, 'anti-war' means 'against this war', be it <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War I</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">Gulf War II</a>, or any war. The protesters are not automatically pacifists, they are just against a war they believe is either unjust, unfair, or goes against their best interest. On the other hand, a <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifist.html" title="Pacifist">pacifist</a> believes that any war is wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anti-war thought became a much more dominant factor in global politics during the last half of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Public anti-war protests have been a common outlet for anti-war feelings in recent years, often attracting hundreds of thousands of participants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many large anti-war movements have been orchestrated in opposition to wars led by the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_the_United_States_235d.html" title="Government of the United States">government of the United States</a>, with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">Americans</a> themselves often being the most vocal critics. Anti-war sentiment in <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">America</a> reached a peak during the height of the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> and was rekindled to some extent in the months leading up to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> saw <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_protests_against_war_on_Iraq_2bd6.html#2003-02-15" title="Global protests against war on Iraq">the biggest global protest movement ever</a> against the predicted <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>, with millions of participants worldwide.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem with it, is that it describes war as something which is "led" - as opposed to being a conflict between two sides. So when someone says they are "against the war" it is not immediately clear whether they:</p>
<ul>
<li>oppose all war on philosophical grounds</li>
<li>simply want an immediate ceasefire (and nothing more?)</li>
<li>want one side (presumably the "aggressor") to withdraw or surrender</li>
</ul>
<p>This sentence simplifies nothing:</p>
<ul>
<li>In simple terms, 'anti-war' means 'against this war'</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not answer the question of <b>what it is about this war</b> which they oppose.</p>
<p>We need to distinguish, for each so-called "anti-war" movement, the elements of philosophical pacifism or political side-taking. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> July 7, 2005 18:44 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm confused here, <i>Much rhetoric about America's role in the Vietnam War employed this usage.</i> Is the author trying to say that America pulling out of Vietnam would NOT have stopped the war? Because I beg to differ, quite strongly actually. Perhaps 'rhetoric' is not the right word, because if you are calling the anti-war protesters POV 'rhetoric' you can't be unbiased. --bing (Sept. 12, 2005)</p>
<dl>
<dd>History says otherwise. America <i>did indeed</i> pull out of Vietnam with a peace treaty in 1973. The fighting had stopped, and then restarted only when it became obvious that we wouldn't return to defend the South. As for the word <i>rhetoric</i>, I read it as only saying that the protesters themselves had a POV. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandy2063_1f7c.html" title="User:Randy2063">Randy2063</a> 22:05, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Anti-war movements are generally more specific, focusing on a particular conflict, or how it is being managed. There have been anti-war movements since then, culminating in the movement developed in response to the American involvement in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These 2 sentences are unclear. Was it the "management" of the US military campaign in Vietnam that the protestors in the Sixties were criticizing? I think it's pretty clear that they only wanted the US to withdraw and let the North Vietnamese conquer the South. If there were other currents within the "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-war_movement.html" title="Anti-war movement">anti-war movement</a>", by all means let us describe them, but undoubtedly this was the main stream. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> July 7, 2005 19:00 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've made a number of minor changes to the "brief history" section to try improve the clarity of the language, add Wikipedia links, etc. I also made one substantive change, removal of this claim: <i>The tactics of a post-modern anti-war movement were also refined: away from demonstrations per se...</i> which is simply false. The <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15%2C_2003_anti-war_protest.html" title="February 15, 2003 anti-war protest">February 15, 2003 anti-war protests</a> were the largest the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>The brief history section is still poor. The Vietnam and Gulf War paragraphs are somewhat rambling and lack a coherent structure. They need some work. I removed the final sentence, <i>In many cultures anti-war protestors are viewed with contempt because they often cause a nation to 'loose its nerve' in defending itself.</i> which is biased, vague, and unsupported. Many cultures? Which cultures are these? Protests "cause" nations to do something? "Defending one's nation" is one of the key concepts in debate on this page and doesn't belong in an unsupported statement like this. Both paragraphs need some work.

<p>I find this to be sort of strange "Use of the term can cause confusion: is an "anti-war activist" equally opposed to both side's military campaigns, or are they choosing one side in particular? likewise, does against the war indicate a pacifist objection, or a preference for the victory of one side?" If a person roots for one side in particular in a military conflict, they are not anti-war. This is self-evident. What is the purpose of this text? I would like to snip it, but maybe someone can explain to me why it is not nonsense? Similarly if someone agrees that it is nonsense, please say so. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 23:27, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take the example of the Vietnam anti-war movement in the United States. The common point was a call for the U.S. to withdraw from Vietnam. Some also supported the Vietcong. The argument, or at least one argument, was that as the U.S. intervention was unjust, the Vietnamese had a right to oppose it militarily. There are several reasons why this position must be considered antiwar. Its holders were integrated into the same movement and often the same organizations as pure pacifists and anti-war American nationalists, such that all considered each other, usually, as part of the same fight. They were, undeniably, opposed to the U.S. waging of the Vietnam war - and they opposed it usually nonviolently, so that it would be silly to say that they were waging war against the U.S. If you deny that this position is anti-war, you're denying that <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-imperialism.html" title="Anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a> is anti-war, when historically it has been integral to every anti-war movement, from that against World War I to that against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. You're also denying that someone who opposes her nation's war on the grounds that the other side is in the right is anti-war.</dd>
<dd>The basic meaning of the term "anti-war" is, as the article says, "opposing one particular nation's decision to wage war." That says nothing about what someone who is anti-war in some context, e.g. that of the U.S., thinks of any other particular nation's decision to wage war - even the nation which is in this context the enemy, e.g. Vietnam.</dd>

<p>The main page was surely written by a hawk. The tone is such that the "anti war" movement is belittled. The questions asked surely have a rhetorical tone/feel. The suggestion, of the first section of the "Anti war page" is that anti-war proponents typically have one side that they support thus that they are hypocrital, when the reverse is true. Many wars that anti-war proponents oppose were started by one BULLY, thus anti-war supporters want the BULLY to stop/leave/etc. Yet the main page of Wikipedia is written to belittle the Anti-war movment.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.19.43.181 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.19.43.181.html" title="User talk:70.19.43.181">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.19.43.181_085e.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.19.43.181">contribs</a>) 6 June 2006.</small></p>

<p>It is simply wrong to put the peace symbol on the Anti-War article. Being anti-war does not neccessarily mean that your pro-peace, especially if it is in reference to the war on terror. Anyone of an adequate level of intelligence would be able to determine that some wars being fought successfully would more likely be more likely to bring peace than say leaving the arab nations in chaos as a result of leaving Iraq too early, or allowing terrorists to do whatever they wanted. I certainly don't find the vitriolic ramblings, and blatant anti-semiitism of a moveon.org puppet like Cindy Sheehan as promoting peace just chaos, appeasment, and national self destruction. Ghandi was an example of a real peace activist. A politically biased sock puppet like Cindy Sheehan is no 'Peace Mom'! No one wanting real peace and human rights would embrace A genocidal dictator like Hugo Chavez while making anti-semetic diatribes! Big difference between peace, and being anti-war. Any peace monger would be against all wars, but those on the anti-war side are not all for peace.</p>
<p>---It's not a "peace logo", it's the logo for the <a href="../../../c/n/d/CND_8d63.html" title="CND">CND</a>. I agree with the sentiment, though. The CND and the anti-war movement are two very different groups of people.</p>
<p>the peace sign represents not being in war. there for if we are not in war then we must be in peace?</p>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>The "peace sign" pre-dates the formation of CND doesn't it? In the UK, it is very much associated with CND, but not elsewhere, so I don't think it is too inappropriate. On peace and war as opposites, I guess being against specific wars (e.g. the Iraq war) is different from being against all wars ever, but that seems slightly pedantic.<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 16:17, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the United States government threatened a military strike against Iran in 2005 and 2006, even as violence continued in Iraq and Afghanistan, a growing number of Americans spoke up against military conflict with the country sitting between Iraq and Afghanistan.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to adherents of this new anti-war movement, the rationale for such an attack as put forward by the administration of George W. Bush bears a striking resemblance to that put forward prior to the Iraq invasion. The administration claims that Iran seeks a nuclear weapon without providing proof of this assertion. The Iranian government denies that it is seeking a nuclear weapon. The level of uranium enrichment U.N. nuclear inspectors say is occurring is consistent with a civilian nuclear power plant, which is allowed under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which Iran is a signatory. Even if Iran seeks such a weapon, they point out, the CIA has said it would take Iran about 10 years to produce a bomb.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>

The opposition to war in Iraq article points out that protests started before the war started, and in the case of what may-or-may-not-be an attack on Iran, it's clear that protests and other forms of opposition have already started and are being organised by all sorts of individuals and organisations, even including the majority of the international community (governments)... See the article for the sources. So the question is how to name it - i don't think we can deny that protests against wars now seem to start before the wars themselves start, but i agree that what's the best name for the section is unclear... <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 20:59, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anti-war movements in the modern sense can be traced by the use of mass <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration_%28people%29.html" title="Demonstration (people)">demonstrations</a>, even <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riots</a>, to oppose conscriptions and civilian casualties in a particular war. This separates them from anti-war parties during, for example, the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. The change comes from the different manner in which wars in industrialized societies are fought: relying on conscription and mobilization of the total resources of the society for the conflict. Popular opinion thus became more relevant. The attempt to end the political will to engage in a war from the inside increasingly used counter-mobilization to make the war effort unsustainable, when it no longer enjoyed sufficient popular support to be maintained. The tactics of an anti-war movement became directed towards creating the sense in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a> and everyday conversations of a basic social revulsion against the conflict, or war in general. Anti-war rhetoric therefore began to focus on war profiteering as well as the dangers to soldiers.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<dd>In the first paragraph, it refers to left-leaning political activists, rather than "active people". Activists could have any political leaning, but the distinction between anti-war and peace movements is probably of little concern to right-wing activists or pro-technology activists or deaf rights activists.
