<p>Antenaeus, you took such a good deal of time to polish your response that you failed to address the issue at hand. The matter is being handled by David. Please consider it closed, as the deletion of our message to you ought to have suggested. Your "private";;; messages, as we stated prior, post to an entire network. Please desist. Thank you. <i>-- unsigned message by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.126.173.124_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.126.173.124">24.126.173.124</a></i></p>

<dd>I don't know where you got the idea that David is the authority and that people like Uncle G. -- and like myself, when I don't tell you what you want to hear -- are merely "volunteers" to be arrogantly waved away. You simply cannot post articles about yourself on Wikipedia -- violating Wikipedia policy, as it has been explained -- and then instruct people the matter is "closed" to them. That is not your prerogative to determine, and neither is it David's. If you imagined that Wikipedia was a place where you would be free to advertise yourself to your heart's content and no one else would be allowed to say anything about it, then you are very incorrect; if you think that you can say things on Wikipedia when you think they'll get you what you want and then delete them without trace when it ceases to be convenient, you are again mistaken. Perhaps you should re-think your behavior in light of these realities. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:41, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Correction</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Feldspar, as well-crafted as your letter appears, your information is inaccuate and reveals poor research. Ms. Spicuzza and "her" collective, as you refer-- a contradication in terms in itself-- are internationally known. She did not submit "autobiographically." She "lent" her permission for use. We are consulting with David as to whether all history, including contributions, ought be eliminated from Wikipedia altogether. Most of us involved, some members, some not, are sorry we ever posted. <i>-- unsigned message by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.126.173.124_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.126.173.124">24.126.173.124</a></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Lent" her permission for use? Ah, I see. I didn't realize that it was <b>Wikipedia</b> which came to Ms. Spicuzza and to the collective and begged "Please! You are so internationally famous we <i>must</i> have an article upon you! Except no description from outside could possibly do justice to such an amazing subject, so it will <i>have to be</i> someone from the same IP whose contributions are sometimes signed 'Jeanne-Marie' who creates the article!" Oh, wait ... you mean it wasn't? You mean it was someone from the collective who decided, "Wow! Our collective, and our founder, are so 'internationally famous', Wikipedia <i>needs</i> an article on both!" Well, then, I don't see how it doesn't qualify as <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a> -- and I don't see how it excepts you from the warning which was clearly put in front of you when you started each new page: "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:41, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ms. Spicuzza "lent" her permission to the collective and non-members, not Wikipedia, as you've assumed, who share an ISP hub. I am not famous, nor did I claim to be. Ms. Spicuzza is. Your tone is quite rude, thus I make this my final posting. *Shelly Robbins, member</p>

<p>Well, look at it like this - if is wasnt for people like me who create articles, people like you wouldnt have anything to do, would they?

<p>PS. I just read something on your user page:</p>
<p>'there is a place on Wikipedia for descriptions for television shows and video games and webcomics, but how much detail these things actually deserve is proportional to how much influence they have actually had on the real world.'</p>
<p>Wow, thats arrogant beyond belief!!! Who are you to judge how influential any particualr thing has been on any particular societal group? Are you an expert on EVERY cultural and Social grouping on the planet? I think not!! If so, I was born in 1954 and live in Lincolnshire, UK, so tell me what was influential to me, if your an expert? I think if someone wants an article on some obscure comic that influenced him so much he remembered it from childhood, and you've never heard of it, then that hardly gives you a valid reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>I read the bits above about this, and you either have an unbiassed encyclopedia that encompasses all knowledge, of you censor it to some arbitrary ruleset defined by some personal subjective worldview. Personally, I prefer the former.....who are you to censor anyone else?</p>
<p>I think you need to reevaluate your own importance to the planet, dude............</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your opinion. I'll give it the appropriate amount of consideration, based on your idea that people who create articles are some separate, superior class to people who actually work on articles that they didn't create, working on more than just the bits that are fun, and that merely creating an article on Wikipedia gives you "artistic license" to undo the work of others.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Listign of purported hate groups</span></h2>
<p>I understand that type of issue. It seems like the hate groups should all be in the list of purported hate groups, rather than the hate groups article itself. As it was, I only dropped one - the empty category of anti-cult groups. If it's important to have that or other unsourced hate groups then we could create a subsection for alleged hate groups that do not appear on any source list. Let me take another look at it after dinner and see if there's a way to bridge the gap. Cheers, -Willmcw 02:16, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS- I just checked the history of the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_group.html" title="Hate group">Hate group</a> article and see that, indeed, the listings were merged. Nonetheless, every single one that was included was supportable by citations from the ADL or SPLC. So although I changed the criteria, that didn't make any difference (except for the new, empty section "anti-cult"). So, I don't see an actual problem- but maybe I missed it. FYI, Rick Ross and the old AFF list "controversial groups" (not cults), which include hate groups <i>and</i> NRMs. So if we need to broaden the scope of sources, we should be able to find a citation to support almost any group's inclusion. We've got open arms for hate groups! It's a big tent. Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:01, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no problem with your having edited User:JamesMLane/Rexlog. It's still a draft and I'm glad to get anyone's input. (I'm especially glad to see you're fairly active. I hope that means good news about your health.) Rex has also been stalking me, voting on a couple CfD's after I did. It's kind of funny that he stalks other people, given that he complained loudly when he thought others were tracking his edits. Once you're finished admiring the irony, though, is it ArbCom material? It's not a violation of any policy that I know of. I'm inclined to leave it out of a formal RfAr.

<dd>Well, if he takes it to the level that he did before, before his "leaving forever", it may rise to the level where it can be presented to the ArbCom as evidence of harassment.

<p>Deleting or redirecting links to a page being voted on for deletion is sabotaging the election process. As such it could be argued to be vandalism of the Wiki election process. If you see the Wiki deletion policy, it states that links to an article can be deleted and redirected to more suitable links after the article is deleted. I doubt anyone would condone doing this while the election is in progress. Please stop.</p>

<dd>Yes; absurd responses such as "It also means 9 shillings and 11 pence" convinced me very early on that talk was wasted; that I was dealing with someone doggedly determined to revert this redirect, not out of ignorance that for every citizen of the United States "9/11" means "the attacks of September 11, 2001", but <i>because</i> that is an indelible association for Americans, and Americans need to be put in their place. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:41, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing "absurd" about 9/11 meaning nine shillings and eleven pence. This is how the value of pre-decimal British coinage was written. Perhaps you recall the Mad Hatter's hat from <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_in_Wonderland_2da0.html" title="Alice in Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> where a ticket with the price of the hat at "10/6" remained tucked into the band - see <a href="http://www.dizneypins.com/images/DW%20Mad%20Hatter.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dizneypins.com/images/DW%20Mad%20Hatter.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The point of saying that was to illustrate that "9/11" can mean a whole host of things other than the date, expressed in a particularly parochial format, of a particularly nasty incident. Pointing out that people from outside of the USA do not spell certain words the way they do; or call certain objects by another name; or do not believe in the same values, or wexpress dates in a different format is not an attempt to "put Americans in their place". <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 08:00, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If I were to insist that <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing_Day_453b.html" title="Boxing Day">Boxing Day</a> be a disambiguation page, because in addition to being a national holiday for millions of people, it could be used by some people to refer to a particular day on which some particularly anticipated <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a> match is scheduled to happen, it would be clearly ridiculous, because the national holiday is by far the more prominent and encyclopedic meaning. It is true that not everyone in the entire world calls the events of September 11, 2001 "9/11". It is also true that if you say to any mentally competent American adult "9/11" they will understand immediately that you are talking about the attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath. In contrast, please show me the existing article that Wikipedia has on the subject of "nine shillings and eleven pence". Or an article for <i>any</i> money amount expressed in shillings and pence. Or an article for <i>any</i> specific money amount specified in <i>any</i> coinage system. You can't find it? Good; now you know why I called your suggestion that <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> needs to be a disambiguation page because it <i>could</i> mean "nine shillings and eleven pence", which we do not and never will have an article on, absurd. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:30, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing_day.html" title="Boxing day">boxing day</a> not Boxing Day. In any case we are talking about a redirect, so if you want to "fix" the redirect at "boxing day" go ahead. For the vast majority of the world that particular sequence of characters means 9th of September, but I am not suggesting that the page should redirect to that date. It should be a disambiguation page. I was not in anyway suggesting that we should have an article on the specific sum of money 9 shillings and 11 pence, merely that that particular form of characters can be used to express things other than the date. However there are many disambiguation pages which list meanings that do not require theer own article.

<dd>Well, I believe that by "adaption" you must mean the different reactions I had to two different situations. In all honesty I believe you must look at the differences between the two situations: one was an article that had been worked on by just one editor, and no one reasonably expects even the most fair-minded editor to produce something fully NPOV by themselves. The other, however, while under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;diff=11587798&amp;oldid=11585674" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;diff=11587798&amp;oldid=11585674" rel="nofollow">edit summary</a> "cleanup of non-neutral bias", introduced copious use of scare quotes around words such as 'improvements' and 'authoritative' and 'problem', and bolding around phrases such as "almost all of the latest studies have been sponsored by drug companies" and "rates of diagnosis vary widely even within the U.S. In some school districts as many as 60% of all children have been diagnosed with ADHD". Even accepting your explanation that you only meant to put these phrases in italics, and the bolding is accidental, it leaves the question of why these phrases needed to be italicized at all. What has not even been touched on yet is how this "cleanup of non-neutral bias" came to include insertion of so many statements either implying or directly stating malfeasance on the part of "the industry", as in changing "These questions cannot be answered unless one knows about the effects of these fatty acids on the dopamine system." to "These questions cannot be answered unless one knows about the effects of these fatty acids on the dopamine system<i>, and the economic realities regarding who is funding studies attempting to debunk the correlation.</i>" [italics mine] and "The process of obtaining referals for such assessments is being pushed vigorously by the pharmaceutical industry, in the guise of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Freedom_Commission_on_Mental_Health_e700.html" title="New Freedom Commission on Mental Health">President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health</a>". Ombudsman, I am willing to assume good faith of your <i>intention</i> to work for NPOV, but I am afraid that that edit, especially under that edit summary, presents a lot of evidence to make me wonder if you have really thought through what it entails. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:23, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I stated at your talk page, I admire your dedication to NPOV while wondering if you truly understand what it is. I don't know what "a straight line may not be viable, much less optimal" is supposed to mean; what I do know is that a great many editors think that when they have the article in a state where their POV is fully and sympathetically expressed, and everyone else's POV is grudgingly given an airing followed <i>immediately</i> by disclaimers that one would be a fool to believe such a thing, that this is NPOV because every POV is thereby represented in <i>some</i> form. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 12:37, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks for being on top of it. Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 08:51, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You wrote on m discussion page that you didn't mean it as a threat about the 3RR thing. If that were true, explain why you were intrested in counting up multiple revisions because the IPs were similar.</p>

<dd>Because you'd be surprised how many people are warned about the 3RR and violate it anyways -- thinking that "my reverts are 'good' reverts because I'm reverting to the <i>good</i> version of the article; his reverts are 'bad' reverts because he's reverting to the <i>bad</i> version of the article" has any relevance to the way the 3RR operates. Someone who responds to a heads-up about the 3RR with irrelevant blather about "my reverts were good; yours were bad" and "your reverts are worse because they're blind/you didn't repeat your reasons" is missing the point, and this is an excellent predictor of who's going to violate it again even after warnings. And someone who racks up almost enough reverts for <i>two</i> people (now that we know you and 229 are the same, unless you make a habit of answering messages to other people on other people's talk pages) is also quite likely to keep violating the 3RR even after being warned.</dd>

<dd>A <i>threat</i> would be "If you keep doing something <i>I don't like</i>, then I will <i>inflict some consequence</i>." My warning is "If you keep doing something <i>prohibited by the rules of Wikipedia</i>, then you may face <i>consequences inflicted by Wikipedia</i>." You may not see the distinction, but that says more about what you choose not to see than about the distinction not being there. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 11:48, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to tell you, I'm getting rather upset with this individual's behavior. Case in point: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candy_Girl_366d.html" title="Candy Girl">Candy Girl</a>. I've voted to delete this on general principle. In other words, blow this thing out of the edit history and if another editor wants to write an article - a real article - on the Frankie Valli song, they can start fresh. Better we have a red link IMO. - Lucky 6.9 23:03, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
