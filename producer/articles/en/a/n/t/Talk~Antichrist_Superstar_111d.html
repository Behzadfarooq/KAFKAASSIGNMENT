<dd>"Empty Sounds of Hate" is the hidden track on the album. I did a quick google search on it. All I could come up with was a random post in a forum that claimed that it was so titled because when the CD was played on some computers, that was the title which came up. Cannot say either way if this is true or false, but I figured I would pass it along.<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhorus_8a29.html" title="User:Warhorus">Warhorus</a> 06:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate crap "like industrial rock/metal" and "alternative". They are no musical genres to me, they are just some stupid expressions used when a genre can`t be easily categorized. What do Marilyn Manson, NIN, Kiss and Rammstein have in common? They are all "industrial"... Keyboards? Come on! As well, what do Marilyn Manson have in common with alternative metal bands like HIM, Rage Against The Machine, Korn, System Of A Down, Tool - all "alternative metal" bands?</p>

Well, what do you have in mind?</p>

<p>The song "Mr Superstar," it appears to me, is about the Worm killing the Superstar.</p>
<pre>
 "Hey, Mr. Superstar
 I'll kill you if I can't have you"

<p>Antichrist Superstar still features Adam as the sole character. He is the rockstar, then the rockstar/worm hybrid, then the disintegrator. Because the name Adam Kadmon represents the being that embodies all in the human realm and god realm, I figured that his change was incited by some divine influence to create an end to a destructive human path discussed more in detail on Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals. He isn't simply human, he is a deity and "Inauguration of the Worm" and "Disintegrator Rising" are Adam realizing this and using that power (part by choice, part reluctantly) to create balance on earth by any means necessary. All stories must have an end. It began with Adam it should end with Adam. His part in all three chapters is too large for Manson to simply write him off right in the middle of Superstar. "Man that You Fear" has too broad of a message to only apply to half of an album. It summarizes Adam's feelings of realizing how far he took his ideals and hatred (from all three records) and regretting his pleasure in it all, for he hurt all that he loved before.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>I agree that there is only one central character, but I disagree on the order. The three forms that the central character takes are</p>
<p>1. Worm 2. Rockstar/superstar 3. Antichrist</p>
<p>You may have placed rockstar first because of the first track, where the character is already a rockstar. In my opinion, the first track on the album actually takes place later in the story, after the worm has become the superstar. It is a common storytelling device to begin the narrative deep within the story, almost near the climax, and then "flash back" to discuss earlier influential events/themes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAntichrist_Superstar_111d.html" title="Edit section: Cryptorchid">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cryptorchid</span></h2>
<p>Note that Cryptorchid is probably intended as a dual meaning: a cryptorchid is a medical term for someone genderless or robbed from his malehood, but it can also be read as a "crypt orchid": a flower on a grave. In the song the transformation into an evil character is starting ("when a boy is still a worm it's hard to get to number 7" - "the moon has now eclipsed the sun, the angel has spread his wings, the time has come for bitter things"). In the video of the song (not sure if it an official video, but it is all over the internet) the Angel of Death appears, as a symbol of transformation into the evil character who in the end causes the apocalypse (in the song Reflecting God). Manson himself stated a few times that the album was based on his own view and interpretation of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Please note the errors in the previous post. The antichrist, Little Horn, does not destroy the world in The Reflecting God as was posted, because in this particular track, the antichrist has already destroyed the world and is reflecting on what he has done. He actually destoyed the world in Minute of Decay.</p>
<p>Second Opinion:</p>
<p>I don't agree. "The Reflecting God" is clearly the climax of the storyline, in which the antichrist brings apocalypse, not by literally "destroying the world", but by destroying the concept of God ('killing' God) in the minds of his followers. Part of the chorus is the superstar/antichrist character revealing the nature of God to his followers,</p>
<p>"I went to God just to see, and I was looking at me. Saw heaven and hell were lies, when I'm God everyone dies."</p>
<p>The antichrist understands that he can be God through his own will (this reminds me of Nietzsche's 'will to power' concept.) The subsequent "scar, scar, can you feel my power" represents the violent act of 'killing' God.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAntichrist_Superstar_111d.html" title="Edit section: Original research: storyline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Original research: storyline</span></h2>
<p>The "Possible storylines" section is most definitely original research, and has no citations. Unless one can cite quotes from Manson himself, or reputable music critics, then it should be removed without a second thought. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, the "Possible Storylines" section should be included, as it is informative and helpful when trying to understand some of Manson's more vague, yet crucial, points. Although fansites can provide these as well, they have a tendency to be biased and opinionated. It can be agreed that citations are of importance, however, a complete lack thereof should not be the only grounds for removal.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>This page deserves a simple, elegant description of the overall storyline that is consistent with lyrical/artistic evidence from the album. As for citations, we have just as much right as a "reputable music critic" to craft an explanation, and Manson mostly kept his mouth shut to allow fans to develop independent interpretations of his work.</p>
<p>As it stands I don't think the story explanation on this page is very good. It makes much more sense to talk about the development of a single character going through transformations, rather than a worm being "attracted to a self-abusive rock star" and then transforming into the Antichrist. We don't need to introduce surperfluous characters when a single one will explain things perfectly well. I don't have a quote for this, but didn't Mansion mention that he once had fantasies of personally being the Antichrist? If that is so, this album could parallel his own fantasy of transforming from a worm to a rockstar and ultimately to the disintegrator. Is anyone familiar with that quote? Lsyn 20:29, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Manson has said on more than one occasion that he considers himself to be the "all-american Antichrist". I quote of Rock 'n' Roll Nigger (Smells Like Children, 1995, Nothing/Interscope):</p>
<pre>
  "...because I am the all-American Antichrist..." 216.24.8.72 03:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
</pre>
<p>That being said, can we change the content of the main page to reflect the fact that there is only one central character who goes through two major changes from worm -&gt; rockstar -&gt; antichrist? If there are no objections in a week or so I'll change it.</p>

<dd>The grounds for removal is the original research is groundless. It has no basis in reality - anything regarding album themes should use interview quotes. As for the "Possible storylines" being removed, it's about time, and every time it's re-added I will gladly remove it once more - stick to the facts, not bullshit speculation. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 14:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that we do not need a highly speculative "possible storylines" section, but the page deserves a simple, one-line description of the main idea of the album that is more plausible than the one we have now, in my opinion. While I agree that quotes are important, the "basis in reality" for the bare-bones minimalist description of the storyline is the lyrical evidence from the album itself, which I think is quite clear. It makes no sense to completely ignore the information already given to us, directly by the artist, in the song lyrics. Yes, we should limit speculation to a minimum, and yes, we should find some interview quotes to back up more substantial claims. But you are proposing that we throw out the most basic source of information we have, in the hopes of having the foundational idea of the album spoon-fed to us in an interview. I do not think we will find that, and we should come to a rational, simple conclusion about the album theme with as few assumptions as possible, which is what I tried to do in my proposal. In any case, I found one interview quote that we could perhaps use,:</p>
<p>"For me, Antichrist Superstar was kind of an experiment, a study. A study about the abuse of power, how power can be abused in politics, religion, music. The whole thing about it was to put your emotions aside and become as powerful, as mighty as possible. To leave your feelings outside." <a href="http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/manson_int2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/manson_int2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/manson_int2.htm</a></p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your feedback and hope that we can come to a fruitful agreement on this matter. Lsyn 04:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
