<p>Most of the lines that seem to have created controversy here were written by me, as any quick check of the page's history would have told you. So why are you all so mad at Ceasar?. PS I think the Harper quote needs to come back, it shows how Canadians are <i>much</i> more likey than other peoples to question the value of their own home country. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevlar67_26f5.html" title="User:Kevlar67">Kevlar67</a> 08:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to Statistics Canada, the so-called "brain drain" in Canada is a myth. It is typically used by neo-conservatives looking for yet more reasons to cut social spending. I just had a little look through Google and while I can't find the StatsCan figures, I have found many articles which cite the figures. Does a citation need to be direct, or can it come second-hand? <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmashTheState_4aaa.html" title="User:SmashTheState">SmashTheState</a></p>

<p>The whole Brazil-versus-Canada story has been pretty much forgotten in Brazil. I bet most people don't even remember it. It was more a joke than anything else, as most things go in Brazil (for the good or the bad of it).</p>
<p>I was in Brazil in June 2005, and saw ads prominently using Canadian flags. Sure looked to me like nobody there remembers (if they are knew) of any trade spat with Canada.</p>

<p>The current wording misleadingly links the phrase Soviet Canuckistan with Pat Buchanan, and I'd go so far as to say it implies he coined it. Clearly this is not the intention of the article, so it needs fixing. --88.109.230.172 07:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you tell me where it says he invented the term? Can you prove to me he didn't? Even if he didn't, the article, by using the term first and then saying he used it, would, if anything, create the impression it existed before; this looks like a case of stretching an article well beyond what it actually says. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 08:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article says "Soviet Canuckistan is a phrase used by Pat Buchanan". How does that not imply his ownership of the phrase? I've moved the introduction to the phrase to the previous paragraph to provide some separation. I'm sure you're going to revert it.</dd>

<p>Phelphs isn't particularly anti-Canadian any more than he's anti-anything-else. Sure, someone who hates all western countries therefore also hates Canada, but that's a pretty trivial sort of "anti-Canadianism", so I'm not sure it's useful to mention him here. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 20:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hardly see how Taliban attacks <i>in their own country</i>, on Canadian soldiers can be viewed as anti-Canadianism. More like anti-colonialism. I think another example should be put in. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMista-X_e9fc.html" title="User:Mista-X">Mista-X</a> 03:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Only if you think Canadians are there to colonize Afghanistan, not exactly an uncontroversial idea. Anyway, terrorist attacks on Americans, outside of the US, are often cited as evidence of anti-Americanism, so I don't see how this is different. Furthermore, I made it clear in that paragraph that the Taliban don't single out Canada in particular, but are just anti-Western in general. If you can think of a better example of that, but which still involves Canadians, that's fine. I'd have no problem with that. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevlar67_26f5.html" title="User:Kevlar67">Kevlar67</a> 00:53, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The difference is that attacking Canadians soldiers in their own country is a bad example of anti-Canadianism, when their country is under attack/occupation. IF, for example, a Canadian journalist was kidnapped Iraqi resistance style, then one could argue anti-Canadianism (though it would most likely still be anti-western then specifically Canadian). I just don't see how targeting a soldier should be included. War is war and soldiers should expect to be attacked. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMista-X_e9fc.html" title="User:Mista-X">Mista-X</a> 01:49, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In your opinion maybe, but I'm not sure what else you call invading, occupying, terrorizing, killing, plummaging, forcing a certain socio-political system on another country, etc. Anyhow, my point is still that fighting a foreign soldier on your own turf is a bad example of discrimination. Would Soviet Soldiers be anti-German because they were fighting for their land in WW II? No, they were anti-Nazi. They recognized Germany was the enemy but not all the people.

<p>It seems to me that most Anti-Canadianism is either extremely trivial and generalized such as applies to all Western Nations, or is an example of over sensitivity. All neighboring nations (and most non-neighboring nations) have certain stereotypes about each other. Canada's tends to be overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>I don't think they even deserve an Anti-article. Though, Quebec might. Since to be honest, the only real Anti-Canadian sentiment in this article, stems from...other Canadians. All of which issues are covered in other specific articles. I don't think every nation that Fred Phelps ever bashed (the psychotic Westboro crazy that he is) deserves a wikipage about it.</p>
<p>I also find it rediculous that it notes Canada defiantly embracing self-deprecating humor, when the worst example is stereotypes about Hockey and Soviet Canuckistan. It hardly serves to draw a parallel with say, Jewish self-deprecating humor. Since unlike Canadians, there is a history of virulent mainstream anti-semitic messages. So to compare them (even subtly) is insulting.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Canadians are probably the least self-deprecating people on the planet. They are extremely sensitive.</p>
<p>In any case, any nation whose flag some liberal Americans use to sew on their backpacks while hiking across Europe, can hardly be a martyr worthy of a page devoted to it. Also, that 'few acres of snow' comment was misattributed. It was referring to a specific tiny area, I think, Victoria island or such, but Canada seems to love that quote regardless.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the popular culture examples are if anything, affectionate parodies without an ounce of actual anti-canadianism. Half of them were written by Canadians. Look at any other Anti-whatever article to see the difference. Come on. The examples are from Michael Moore, The Simpsons, South Park and Mystery Science Theatre. I'm sure there is an SNL skit somewhere or a Boys in the Hall skit that they can find to add.</p>

<dd>I agree it's not a heavy issue; I was mystified by how upset this article made one person.

<dd>It's just odd that we have articles devoted to Anti-Americanism, Anti-Islamism, Anti-Semitic...All of whom have had real and devastatingly unhappy consequences, from the mild loss of opportunity to death, sometimes on an mass scale. Yet alone of them, we have Anti-Canadianism, that uses as its main examples, affectionate parodies from cartoons, a rant by a madman which would be better included under Homophobia and an reiteration of the Quebec debate that is already extensively covered in another article. So it just seems that the inclusion of this article has no real merit beyond a sort've perverse pride. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.169.233.53_23bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.169.233.53">76.169.233.53</a> (talk) 12:11, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I believe the "few acres of snow" is from Voltaire referring to Acadia (now Nova Scotia). Sepeatist Quebecois who are anti-canadian aren't the only ones in regards to a particular region. Calgarians are known for some of this sentiment but particularly Newfoundlanders as some in that province are openly still for separation. Oh yeah, and if the "I am not Canadian" reference is going to be said for the "I am Canadian" commercial, mentioning "I am a newfoundlander" should also be written. In the parody commercial, the commentator speaks about his grandfather being "pissed off" at confederating. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanking_bca5.html" title="User:Canking">Canking</a> 00:33, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

wikipedia - no one is concerned about it - etc. But the word and this article are worthwhile because they reveal the absurdity of this type thinking
