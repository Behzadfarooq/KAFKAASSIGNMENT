<p>Why is this article still protected? As far as I can tell, the only problem is User Simonides. He is outrageously violating our NPOV policy. Our NPOV policy says that we do not just state a fact; rather, we say that Group A believes position B, while Group C believes position D. That is all that was added. We said that according to groups A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, anti-Semitism was resurgent across the globe; links were then given so that people could follow up on this (e.g. the the report on resurgent anti-Semitism by the European Union). Incredibly, Simonides repeatedly deleted all this NPOV data, then added polemical personal remarks denying that this phenomenom exists, offered us no sources, and repeatedly has given us a loony conspirary theory about "special interest groups" (i.e. the Jews.) <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>Simonides then states that there are no sources to support the idea that anti-Semitism is on a resurgence...yet it is Simonides himself who keeps deleting all of these sources. Note that Simonides is deleting sources from the European Union, the Secretary General of the UN, many researchers, and then denying that any sources exist. <strike>That is called trolling.</strike> <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:58, Jul 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"God"? "His Will"? Rabbinic exclamations? What is this doing here as an example?

<dd>But this is not a "secular encyclopedia article". It's a neutral article on a people who claim a history of connection to God (via <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>). Indeed, the claim of being the "<a href="../../../c/h/o/Chosen_people.html" title="Chosen people">chosen people</a>" is of central relevance to the issue of <b>why</b> so many people hate (or oppose) Jews.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the point is that the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> which Jews themselves revere contains dozens if not hundreds of adverse remarks about the ancient Jews; and Jewish leaders do <b>not</b> generally call these biblical remarks "anti-Semitic". So it's plain that the making of adverse or criticl remarks is not necessarily anti-Semitic -- it's more complex than that. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 02:08, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1)Neutral and secular are synonymous in the current context. 2)Many major religions claim a history of connection to their idols or gods - the Jewish do so in their own way. "The claim of being the chosen people" is <i>not</i> "of central relevance" to anti-Semitism, it is only one among several factors - it might be central to a specific anti-Semite's agenda, or a Jewish fundamentalist agenda, but it has no other privilege, and highlighting it only encourages the two extreme interpretations.3)There is a clear difference between the passage I removed and your explanation above. The removed passage uses terms like "God" and "His Will", capitalized, without any self-consciousness, ie without a concern for whether there are such things beyond theological confines. Your explanation, on the other hand, makes a historical generalization, without theological presumptions. But in either case I do not believe it worthy of inclusion as an example. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 06:00, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely you're not saying Wikipedia is obligated to write a "secular" article about a major religion ("the Jewish" as you put it) and how people hate or oppose them -- merely to be "neutral". --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:10, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neutral and secular are never synonymous when discussing religion, as secularism is itself a POV.

<dd>Secular, as an adjective, simply means "not overtly religious"; in this case, since I removed the above passage on account of its overt religiosity, being neutral and being secular are synonymous. In that sense, an article that refers to any religious group needs to remain secular, without inserting fluff like "His Will", that assumes specific religious beliefs among its readers. Nowhere was secularism as a doctrine brought up. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 22:40, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>While many more subtle manifestations of Church anti-Semitism can be traced to anti-Jewish sentiment in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, these more blatant early accusations of theological anti-Semitism has been particularly prevalent in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.

</dl>
<p>"early accusations of theological anti-Semitism" to me means that someone was accusing Christians of theological anti-Semitism. It seems unlikely that such accusations would have come from Christians, but that's what the rest of the sentence seems to say. Next, is the Church supposed to have co-opted <i>the Exodus mythology</i>, or to have co-opted <i>the rejection of the Exodus mythology</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems defining anti-Semitism</span></h2>
<p>One problem with saying what anti-Semitism _is_, is that we Jewish people are very sensitive -- and especially wary since the Holocaust. I think this sensitivity and wariness can sometimes blind us to the distinction between:</p>
<ul>
<li>valid criticisms of the behavior or thinkng of Jewish individuals or groups; and,</li>
<li>completely unwarranted criticism or persecution</li>
</ul>
<p>But I am not a "self-hating Jew", and I don't think it's _all_ our fault that the subject of anti-Semitism is so muddled. At least 75% of the problem (maybe 98%?) comes from groups so vehemently hostile to us that they feel no qualms whatsoever about telling outright lies. This morning's <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Sun_3d50.html" title="New York Sun">New York Sun</a> has an article by <a href="../../../m/e/m/MEMRI_1fae.html" title="MEMRI">MEMRI</a>'s head, listing four <b>categories</b> of these lies.</p>
<p>In the face of unremitting hostility, one is apt to become tongue-tied or even confused. As Christian psychiatrist <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._Scott_Peck_b9f7.html" title="M. Scott Peck">M. Scott Peck</a> says, one of the touchstones of evil is that one becomes confused in its presence.</p>
<p>I condemn anti-Semitism, of course, but the challenge we Wikipedians face is how to write about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>accurately -- which is hard, since its practitioners lie about it</li>
<li>neutrally -- which is even harder: how can one write about murder without getting upset?</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where I'm coming from, and I hope it helps us all with the article. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 21:20, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are no real problems defining anti-Semitism among the sane and perceptive. Only ignoramuses, or rather weasely people involved in politics, or attention-grabbing simpletons see criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism or (when it applies) self-hate, a view that has been actively promoted by some Israeli politicians and is disowned by most self-respecting Israelis. The problem on this page, however, is constant vandalism and a subsequent revision of history by the vandals to make themselves seem like persecuted victims - when irrelevant material is removed after explanations, they keep pasting it back in; they remove neutralizing comments and POVs; they delete work without explanation and then cry "censorship" when their own additions have been removed after discussion; it is clearly difficult to work with such immature characters. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 22:28, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Statements like "Only ignoramuses, or rather weasly people involved in politics, or attention-grabbing simpletons" in <i>no</i> way assist in writing such an article. It is a fact that many people consider at least some criticisms of Israel to be anti-Semitic. How many people and who, and how many criticisms (some, most, or all) and which, are empirical questions we should research and try to answer. But it is clear that a significant number of people believe this, and it is antithetical to Wikipedia to judge them as ignorant or weasely. We could also give space to two (logical) other views, that all criticisms of Israel are anti-Semitic (off hand I know of no one who believes this and would like to see hard evidence that a significant number of people believe this), and that no criticism of Israel can possibly be anti-Semitic (a position which, on its face, would seem hard to sustain and I no of no public figure who claims this -- but would be happy to see evidence that some significant number of people believe this). These remarks are meant to constructively guide us in working on this section. Can anyone suggest a more constructive approach that works within our goals of being encyclopedic and maintain NPOV? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>

<dd>The statement was a reply to Ed's "problem". There are plenty of statements on this page that do not assist in writing a good article, so your objection is superfluous. As for the latter point, you seem to be confusing the terms "criticism" and "hate/prejudice/etc." I understand this confusion is rather popular these days, with the preponderance of the inane rhetoric of the so-called War on Terror. But "criticism" simply means making comments, analyses, etc, some of which may be disagreeable but which still refer to something concrete - in that respect, a Japanese person living abroad, or someone descended from Japanese persons, who criticizes Japanese culture/ media/ policy etc is no more "anti-Japanese" than a Jew in a similar position. There is a lot of baseless prejudice directed at Israel, and at many other nations; but that is different from criticism, because criticism is something legitimate. Calling Jews or perhaps Israelis, say, money-grabbers, is not criticism; it's prejudice. Saying Israelis occupy disputed land is not prejudice, it is criticism. Now the criticism may be <i>motivated</i> by anti-Semitism, but when the criticism is legitimate the motivation is not only difficult to prove, but it becomes redundant. You can simply go around saying all criticism is motivated by racism or prejudice of some sort, and everything becomes a farce. So a "constructive" approach should always include being careful with the words in use, despite their inherent vagueness, instead of bandying them around to mean whatever they could possibly mean, which is what some members are engaged in here. If I call them simple-minded, I'm actually being generous in trying to account for the constant vandalism, lies, slander, propaganda and the basic ignorance, fear and prejudice that constitute their discussions, which is not going to change overnight. Being constructive would also include keeping them in check, so that even-handedness prevails over piles of garbage. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:14, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your clarificaton. I think your distinction between criticism and prejudice/hatred is valid and valuable. Given how contentious this issue is, I suggest not only being careful about which words you use, but being more explicit so that other readers (and remember, most readers of Wikipedia are not going to be as careful with words as most editors) will be clear. You may want to specify "criticism of Israeli politics or policies" or "specific criticisms (as opposed to general hatred)" <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
