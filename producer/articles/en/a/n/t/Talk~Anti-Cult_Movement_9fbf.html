<p>Andries, you are adding a request for sources, but sources are provided. It is not asserted as a fact, it is asserted as an opinion. What do you mean by "I think that just an interview is not a good source for this statement"? You have two sources provided (Introvigne and Barker). as well as a wikilink to <a href="../../../d/e/v/Deviancy_amplification_spiral.html" title="Deviancy amplification spiral">deviancy amplification spiral</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 19:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said before on my talk page regarding charismatic authority in a discussion with you, I think that an interview is not a very good source. I think that Barrett wrote it in his book too.

<p>Cut from intro (was 2nd paragraph):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term is often used in literature by scholars of NRMs, who imply that these various groups and individuals are one movement, closely linked, with the same or very similar agenda and objectives (Bromley, Shupe, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massimo_Introvigne_b95f.html" title="Massimo Introvigne">Massimo Introvigne</a>). On the other hand, people thus labeled point out that the various movements lumped together in this term are too diverse to justify such a label and that the existence of a uniform movement against cults has never been verified by a sociological study on these groups. (Kropveld, 2003, Langone 2005)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit new here at WP, but isn't the very first sentence in the article POV in that it completely begs the question<a href="http://www.skepdic.com/begging.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skepdic.com/begging.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> of whether ACMs actually even exist or not?: "The anti-cult movement, sometimes abbreviated as "ACM", opposes cults and new religious movements that anti-cultists see as harmful or dangerous for society and individuals." In other words, the opening sentence baldly <i>assumes</i> that an ACM even exists, which is not a fact but rather an opinion, and an opinion which is challenged later in the article. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 01:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I do of course disagree with the ACM concept, if you would change it to ACMs, you would do "original research" <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. There are many "scholars" who claim that there is an ACM. There are also opposing scholars, who are mentioned.</dd>
<dd>The word "anti-cultists", however, is really a bad one, since it suggests that these are cultists themselves. I thought I had corrected this months ago... but maybe I didn't, or maybe I did it elsewhere. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 07:23, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, "ACMs" was a typo, I meant "ACM". My only point is that the opening sentence assumes that there <i>is</i> such a thing as an ACM (singular) which I think starts the article out with POV because it is stated as a <i>fact</i> rather than an <i>opinion</i> (which is all that it is). I would propose something like "Many scholars of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Religious_Movements_2e22.html" title="New Religious Movements">NRMs</a> posit that there is such a thing as anti-cult movement, sometimes abbreviated as "ACM", that opposes cults and new religious movements that it sees as harmful or dangerous for society and individuals." That would be more objectively accurate, and the article wouldn't start out with a POV spin. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 20:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe a better solution would be to reword the intro. I'd suggest something like "Anti-Cult Movement is a controversial term to mean people opposing cults etc etc...", and then explain the two positions about the term and this why it is controversial. However someone else will have to come up with an encyclopedian language&#160;:) --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 20:46, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That sounds better, yes.

<p>Hi Jossi. I notice you rv'd my change to the first sentence. The "ACM" is only referred to widely in the literature by proponents of NRM theory and is POV. It is considered a meaningless pejorative by cult critics. e.g. <a href="http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/kropveld_michael_anexampleforcontroversy.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/kropveld_michael_anexampleforcontroversy.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<p>It's a peculiarity of the ACM that its members deny its existence. Members of other movements, notably the feminist, anti-war, or anti-globalization movements, will lengthily explain to you how "big" and "important" their movement is. The reason for this difference is quite simple: These movements do not pretend to represent society's "objective" concerns, but the openly oppose other groups (chauvinist males, warmongerers, big business etc.). In contrast, the rhetoric of the ACM is that every "normal" and "rational" person would oppose "cults", which are considered deviant. However, there are no serious scholars, not even those who favor the ACM, who would deny its existence (granted that at times the use different terms to characterize the groups that make up the ACM). <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa">Fossa</a> 15:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Actually, I rather doubt that anyone will bother to publish an "ACMs don't exist" article anywhere else than the CSJ; after all none of your "serious academics" have bothered to publish an article, in <i>any</i> journal (whether peer-reviewed or not), <i>demonstrating</i> that they <i>do</i> exist!

<dd>Hi Fossa. Hmmm...(1) You state "In contrast, the rhetoric of the ACM is that every "normal" and "rational" person would oppose "cults"..." This is merely inflammatory rhetoric since I doubt that you'll find any cult critic who <i>states</i> that every "normal" and "rational" person would oppose "cults", and (2) I agree with Tilman that you are strongly implying that in order to be a "serious scholar" once must support the theory that there is in fact an ACM, and that any scholar who <i>doesn't</i> support the concept is ipso facto not "serious". This may be your <i>opinion</i> but it is not a demonstrable <i>fact</i>.</dd>
<dd>For example, here is the opinion of a scholar (who strikes me as being pretty serious) on the ACM issue<a href="http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/kropveld_michael_anexampleforcontroversy.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/kropveld_michael_anexampleforcontroversy.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>:</dd>

<dd>Can you come up with studies from your "serious scholars" that actually <i>demonstrate</i> that an ACM exists?

But I could be wrong.&#160;:) In the absence of such studies the existence of an an ACM is <i>pure</i> assertion and speculation. Stating or implying otherwise in the article is POV. If you can find such a study then that strengthens your case but it doesn't eliminate the fact that the existence of an ACM is certainly certainly strongly disputed, and stating or implying anything else is still POV.</dd>
<dd>I'm not going to start an edit war with you, but I feel quite strongly about this and as I said to Jossi I'm certainly willing to take this through dispute resolution.

<dd>Boy, I know, why I refeained to edit in this area, since every quack here has the same weight as Anson Shupe or David Bromley. The whole question, if a ACM exists or not is so banal, no serious scholar, not even Stephen Kent denies that. He might prefer different terms ("Organized opposition against cults" or something like that), and indeed one may quibble, about the question, if the ACM is a movement in the narrow sense of the word. But there is absolutely no question that there is some collectivity that mobilizes against "cults".</dd>

<p>I added the sentence "The question of whether there actually is an ACM is debated" at the beginning of the second paragraph. I feel that it is important to emphasize the fact that there is disagreement over the term. One can deduce the fact of the debate from the rest of the paragraph, but the point is too subtle IMO.

<p>Under "Bibliography" I changed the first heading to "By protagonists or organizations labeled as being part of the ACM".

In a controversy such as this, where there is pure agumentation and absolutely <i>zero</i> proof on <i>either</i> side, <i>neither</i> position should be presented as "fact" in the article.</dd>

<dd>Jossi, as for whether the article should exist, please see my response to Andries. As for "substantion", there hasn't been <i>any</i> "substantation that an ACM <i>does</i> exist either! None at <i>all</i>. As for the 100's of mentions, they are just that "mentions", they certainly <i>talk</i> about the ACM as if it has been <i>demonstrated</i> to exist, and they make this <i>implication</i> in 100s of paper yes. But they conveniently never mention that there as been <i>no</i> substantion, zero, nada. So it is strong NRM POV to present the impression in the article that the existence of an ACM has been substantiated. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 18:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, that's me. I'm not member in anything, although I have loosely supported some organisations and been in the "leipzig award committee" (that is hardly organized&#160;:-)). I'm only slightly following the discussion. The ACM term is certainly a disputed theory, since the scholars don't agree on this (which the definition does mention later). (And I've witnessed many loud disputes in what some call "the ACM"!) Thus, it should be mentioned in the first sentence that it is a controversial term.

<dd>Yes, true, that is of course, the confusing thing about the ACM: there seems to be no way to become a member, but this is no different from the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_movement.html" title="Feminist movement">feminist movement</a>. Sympathizer would be a better word than "member". I do not even know the core beliefs of the ACM apart from the belief that some cults harm its members or at least that involvement in cults is risky. Following that last "definition" I am also a member of the ACM. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Andries, you are quite right here, a movement is organized to some extent, but it extends beyond movement organizations, that's true for the feminist movement as well as for the ACM. Sociologists tend to use the terms "members" or "participants", but they also distinguish between different types of membership. Surely, a movement member that is actively engaging in bringing about the movement cause is more active than somebody, who just pays his membership dues to a movement organization (e.g., <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenpeace.html" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a></i> as an organization for the ecology movement). A movement is also by no means monolithic in its tactics or goals (quite to the contrary, it's a definitional feature of a movement <i>not</i> to be monolithic). <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa">Fossa</a> 01:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quite simple: The term is fairly <i>uncontroversial</i> in academic circles. Even those scholars, who are seen as sympathetic to the goals of the ACM wouldn't dispute that an ACM exists. But for many ACM members, who do not understand, or who do not want to understand what a "movement" is, the term is problematic, because it reveals that they are not pursuing some "objective, rational" goal, but interest politics. Conversely, many new religious movements have taken up the term in their own rhetorics, precisely, because it shows that it is two different interest groups/collectivities, which are pitted against each other. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa">Fossa</a> 01:35, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fossa, interest politics? Please explain.

<dd>Yes, I make no bones about my opinion that I think that academic scholars should have more input into an encyclopedia than anti-cult activists or adherents of alternative religions.

<p>This is a dispute about whether the existence of an "Anti-Cult Movement" (ACM) should be stated or implied to be a fact.</p>
<p><b>Statements by editors previously involved in the dispute</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposition that the existence of an "Anti-Cult Movement" is a known <i>fact</i> is nothing more than a theory/hypothesis/proposition/allegation/assumption. It is a matter of legitimate dispute and is in fact disputed.

<ul>
<li>Do you have credible <b>academic</b> sources, which dispute the existence of an anti-cult movement? If not, I'd suggest to keep it as a "fact". I realize that many people, who are part of the ACM, do not consider themselves part of the ACM. Yet, we cannot base social scientific facts on the question, if the people covered by these facts like the term or not. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 01:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The theory is propagated by only a few cult apologists. And yes, there are credible academic sources, that dispute this existance. As already stated above and in the definition. Thus, it is a controversial term in academic circles. Kindof like the mind control controversy.

<li>Looks like someone forgot to close a blockquote somewhere above here on the talk page - but I'm not going to go rooting around for it. As to the issue at hand here, the current intro language: <i>Anti-Cult Movement, sometimes abbreviated "ACM", is a term used by some new religious movements scholars to refer to what they believe to be a coordinated opposition to cults and new religious movements that protagonists in this purported movement see as harmful or dangerous for society and individuals. The question of whether there actually is an ACM is debated, and the use of the term is disputed.</i> - seems most appropriate and NPOV. Certainly there have been numerous allegations by a select few alleged <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">cult apologists</a> that there exists an Anti-Cult Movement, but the most we could probably say is that there is a debate as to whether this exists, not that there factually is a movement. Any citation claiming that a movement exists would be just that - a claim. There would have to be some sort of proof of organization for that claim to have any bearing. On the other hand, documents such as the <a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/apologist/apologist19.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/apologist/apologist19.html" rel="nofollow">Confidential Memorandum</a> written by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Hadden_b9be.html" title="Jeffrey Hadden">Jeffrey Hadden</a> would certainly seem to suggest that there is an organized movement of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">cult apologists</a>. Smeelgova 12:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>Now, there are a few academics advancing what you pejoratively label as "cult apologist movement". I believe, however, that they are not (yet?) mobilizing sufficiently to be called a movement and their numbers are very few. But if you find some academic references that would talk about them as a movement, feel free to present that as a fact. Unless you do find this evidence in academic articles, you will have to keep bickering about it on your private web page. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 13:47, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As to your claim <i>Any citation claiming that a movement exists would be just that - a claim.</i> is certainly true. But claims presented w/o contest within academia should be treated as facts; otherwise we will arrive at a point, where one can say "Any citation claiming that the holocaust happened, would be just that - a claim.," which would obviously a preposterous statement. Now surely, this is an extreme example, but quite instructive, when it comes to the question, if all "claims" should be presented just as "claims". BTW: A movement is not necessarily a bad thing at all. Insofar is your choice of words ("allegation") is misleading. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 14:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is true that it is implied throughout the article that the ACM exists and this is how it should be. Again, no one disputes that there is some opposition against cults and <b>within academia</b> this is the most common term .

<p>The articles's new lead sentence is a wonderful start. Here are other changes I propose in order to move toward NPOV...</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the adjective "some" to the word "academic" in the first paragraph. Not all "academic scholars" use the term.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Outside of metallurgy, the term "amalgam" has a meaning of "a mixture or combination" or "a combination of diverse elements".<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=amalgam" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=amalgam" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> If the word "organized" is inappropriate in the first paragraph, then something should be included in the definition to reflect this definition of ACM that is offered in the second paragraph. Since the word "amalgam" is used in the definiton, I propose "Anti-Cult Movement, sometimes abbreviated "ACM", is a term used by some academic scholars to refer to an amalgam of those who offer opposition to cults and new religious movements".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The phrase "People, who are considered to partake in the anti-cult movement" implies the existence of an ACM and doesn't say who does the "considering". Change to "Cult critics".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The phrase "Depending on their background and goals, such individuals and groups are active in various fields" implies acceptance of the preceeding definition. Also, "scholars" was used just above by those who propose the existence of an ACM. Change to "Depending on their background and goals, scholars, other individuals and groups who criticize cults are active in various fields."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change "by their critical former members is generally not part of the ACM" to "by their critical former members is generally not described as being part of the ACM".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding "The ACM is to be distinguished from the concerns and opposition by the Christian countercult movement that unlike the ACM mainly concerns itself with theological differences"... (1) the usage "the ACM" assumes the existence of an ACM, (2) see below for a discussion re the POV of "CCM". Change to "The proposed ACM is to be distinguished from the concerns and opposition by Christian "anti-cult apologists".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding "The families of these young people became worried about what they considered bizarre belief systems and the behavior of their children and started to organize themselves in grassroot movements some of which merged into regional or national organizations."... It ignores their "worry" over use of unethical psychological influence tecniques. Change to "The families of these young people became worried about what they considered bizarre belief systems and the behavior of their children. They were also concerned about what they saw as the unethical use of psychological influence techniques. They started to organize themselves in grassroot movements, some of which merged into regional or national organizations."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Not all scholars considered themselves to be studying "alternative religions". Change "The cult controversies in the 1960s and 1970s also resulted in growing interest in scholarly research on alternative religions and the creation of academic organizations for their study", to "The cult controversies in the 1960s and 1970s also resulted in growing interest in scholarly research on what some scholars considered to be "alternative religions" and others considered to be "cults", and the creation of academic organizations for their study.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change "Taxonomies" to "Taxonomies offered by supporters of the ACM concept", thus identifying the following section as a POV.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the phrase "started with family members of adherents who had problems with the sudden changes in character, lifestyle and future plans of their young adult children who had joined NRMs"... The word "problems" can be considered pejorative as in, for example, "What's your problem?" Furthermore, their concerns weren't restricted to those stated. Change to "started with family members of adherents who had concerns with the sudden changes in character, lifestyle and future plans of their young adult children who had joined what the family members considered to be a cult. They also believed that unethical psychological manipulation techniques had been applied."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Cult watching groups" is a term largely used by proponents of NRM theory and is therefore "loaded" when used as the title of a section describing cult critics. Change "Cult watching groups and individuals, and other opposition to cults" to "Opposition to cults".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cult critics are also concerned about unethical use of psychological influence techniques. Change "are often centered around an unreliable charismatic leader; and may use deceitful ways of recruiting and retaining members" to "are often centered around an unreliable charismatic leader, may use deceitful ways of recruiting and retaining members, and may unethically employ psychological influence techniques to recruit and retain members.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change "Deprogramming has apparently been abandoned by the anti-cult movement" to "Deprogramming has apparently been abandoned by cult critics". Otherwise factual existence of an ACM is implied.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cult critics don't "criticize new religious movments", they criticize groups that they consider to be "cults" which is not only a subset of these "religious movements", but which also includes some groups that are completely secular in nature. Change "A very controversial subject between sympathizers and critics of new religious movements" to "A very controversial subject between sympathizers of "new religious movements" and critics of "cults"".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change "Some of those opponents are affiliated with the ACM" to "Some of those opponents are affiliated with organizations that criticize and educate about cults." Otherwise the sentence implies that existence of an ACM is a fact.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The term "counter-cult movement" is not a term used by the people being described, and is a technical terme used by proponents of NRM theory. Change the phrase to "but some of them also engage in "countercult apologetics".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The term "cult watching group" is not used by cult critics, it is a technical term coined by proponents of NRM theory. Change "Some have even have founded cult watching groups" to "Some have even have founded cult awareness groups".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change "Cult-watching groups often use testimonies of former members" to "Cult awareness groups often use testimonies of former members". (See above.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the section starting with "A somewhat similar movement that is generally not considered part of the ACM exists within established religion and is called the Christian countercult movement (CCM)".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Objections</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It is stated just below in the article that the term "countercult apologetics" has been in use since the seventies, and that it designates a "conglomerate" rather than a "movement".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the term "CCM" developed out of the term "countercult apologetics", then it was the proponents of NRM theory that did the developing. Those who engage in "countercult apologetics" don't call themselves a "movement".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Proposal</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I propose the following rewrite:
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many individuals and groups who criticize cults on the basis of religious, rather than secular, grounds. Two basic arguments for opposition to cults and new religious movement can be discerned in among countercult apologists: one is mainly based on theological differences, the other is based on defending human self-determinism and targets mainly groups (religious and non-religious) with alleged cultic behavior according to the definition of the secular opposition to cults.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>This focus on theological differences has a very long tradition in Christian apologetics. Since the 1970s, "countercult apologetics" has been in use, which actually does not designate a movement but a conglomerate of individuals and groups of very different background and scholarly level. Other designations are <i>countercult ministries</i>, <i>discernment ministries</i> (mainly used by such groups themselves) or <i>heresy hunters</i> (mainly used by their opponents).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Change "The secular anti-cult movement is not an United States" to "Secular criticism of cults is not a United States". Otherwise it assumes that the existence of an ACM is a fact.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change the heading "Cult watchers" to "Other opponents". Again "cult watchers" is not a preferred term among these "opponents".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding "While only a small fraction of the anti-cult movement has been involved in deprogramming, several deprogrammers (including its pioneer Ted Patrick) have served prison terms for the practice, while others have been acquitted in court"... the word "some" has less spin than "several. Change to "While only a small fraction of cult critics has been involved in deprogramming, some deprogrammers (including its pioneer <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Patrick_ba51.html" title="Ted Patrick">Ted Patrick</a>) have served prison terms for the practice, while others have been acquitted in court.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change the heading "Reaction of the anti-cult movement" to "Reactions from cult critics". Otherwise it implies that the existence of an ACM is a fact.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The heading "By protagonists or organizations considered part of the ACM, from an activist point of view" has a couple of problems. (1) It doesn't say <i>who</i> "considers" these people and organizations to be part of "the ACM", (2) the words "the ACM" imply that an ACM actually exists, which is a proposition that these very people and organizations vigorously dispute, My original rewrite of "By protagonists or organizations labeled as part of the ACM" was rv'd, but I hereby propose it again. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 22:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Not all "academic scholars" use the term.</i>". True. Academics, who write about rockets or <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panda.html" title="Panda">pandas</a> do not use the term. However, within the field of NRM research (which is, admittedly, tiny), the term is common coinage.</li>
<li>amalgam is indeed a dubious metaphor that should be substituted for something more specific.</li>
<li><i>The phrase "People, who are considered to partake in the anti-cult movement" implies the existence of an ACM and doesn't say who does the "considering". Change to "Cult critics".</i> As before: No-one in academic circles disputes the fact, that the ACM exists, some might want to call that animal differently, but ACM is still the most common term. We are not gonna change to something that is more agreeable to "cult critics". This is not the anti-cultpedia. ACM <b>is</b> the most common term and, frankly, "critics" is a euphemism in this context.</li>
<li>next bullet point: Same thing: Not contested in academic circles -&gt; fact. Otherwise, we will have to give creationists a considerable say on <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>.</li>
<li>On the question of ACM vs. CCM: There are various definitions of the ACM, some include, some don't include the CCM.<a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 23:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bromley and Shupe have used a number of words to characterize the collectivity of the ACM. I am not aware of "amalgam", but that doesn't mean that they did not use this term, too. Sociology, unlike mathematics, does not always use unique terms for the same phenomena: This is an indirect quote, so we do not have to use exactly the same vocabulary, but just to rephrase the meaning of their work and "collectivity" is on target. But if you have an alternative suggestion, I am all ears. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 01:03, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I majored in math and physics, and, believe me, it was difficult for me to adjust to sociological terminology in the beginning (I eventually got my Ph.D. in sociology, in case you haven't checked on my CV yet). I am still not all too happy about this lack of common terminology, but, alas, I cannot decree one all by myself, and I am unsure, if could, that that would be the best solution. Having said that, sociology might be <i>fuzzy</i>, but <i>arbitrary</i>, it ain't. There is so to speak, a corridor of what can and what cannot be said based on sociological research. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 01:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Opinions differ, I guess. As far as I can see from this talk page, sociologists are free to theorize and propound to their heart's content without having to back it up with <i>any</i> evidence. Just the fact that they are "scholars", that they publish their opinions in the right journals, that they are proper "academics", and that there are lots of them that agree on something seems to be enough. They apparently see no need at all to demonstrate objectively that their conculsions are true, I don't see how it can be called a "science" at all. But I probably shouldn't judge the whole field solely based on what I've read here.</dd>

<p>Nowhere in the literature it is mentioned that the ACM is "coordinated". In fact, not a single movement is coordinated, since it lacks a central organization. What is true, that <i>within</i> the movement some coordinated groups (aka as "formal organizations") exist, but the whole of the movement cannot and is not coordinated. This is a typical straw man argumenent by activists. I deleted it and demand exact references for any re-insertion. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 13:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am currently reworking the "definition" of the ACM to make more explicit that this is a sociological concept.

<dd>(Hope this is on topic.) Opinions differ... Amitrani, Marzio, 2001, quoting Benjamin Zablocki, professor of sociology and one of the reviewers of the rejected DIMPAC report, 1997:
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people have been misled about the true position of the APA and the ASA with regard to brainwashing. Like so many other theories in the behavioral sciences, the jury is still out on this one. The APA and the ASA acknowledge that some scholars believe that brainwashing exists but others believe that it does not exist. The ASA and the APA acknowledge that nobody is currently in a position to make a Solomonic decision as to which group is right and which group is wrong. Instead they urge scholars to do further research to throw more light on this matter. I think this is a reasonable position to take.</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, you don't reference your quote properly, so I cannot check it. I'd be surprised, if Zablocki would be able to say that in a peer-reviewed article or an academic book. Whatever a "Solomonic (Salomonic?)" decision maybe, it's clear that nobody at least among academic sociologists, still seriously entertains such theories. Most ACM activists themselves have abandoned it. And, BTW, academic consensus is not achieved by APA or ASA decisions, but by publications in relevant journals. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 00:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I am getting irritated, if somebody from the Netherlands, where excellent public libraries are abundant, chides me for using, excuse me, sources not freely available on the internet.</dd>
<dd>To your question: Quite simple, Barker speaks of five different "cult-watching groups", two of which are clearly part of the ACM (CAG/CCG) and one of which is at least partially involved in the ACM (ROG). These three groups are depicted as having quite different ideologies. Note: I am not saying that that is a useful typology (in fact, it is one, which I would not endorse), but it is one of many typologies that aim to depict ideological variance w/i the ACM. I will add a few more in the near future. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 00:18, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I did not chide you for using sources that are not freely available on the internet.

No, I am unconvinced that the citation that you gave supports the statement in the article, because Barker does not lump in that article the ACM and the CCM together. It is your personal conclusion based on Barker's article that Barker does not make.

<dd>ACM is a minority term. It's actually a "lite" hate term used by Bromley+Shupe and their fans, in an effort to lump different people together and to accuse them of practicing some evil methods.

<dd>It's a "lite hate term"? Give me a break? Who, besides anti-cultists like you, claims that?</dd>
<dd>Now, let's see:</dd>

<dd>** "Counter-Cult Movement" 1</dd>
<dd>** "Opposition to cults" 0</dd>

<dd>** "Anti-Cult Movement" 204</dd>
<dd>** "Counter-Cult Movement" 20</dd>
<dd>** "Opposition to cults" 10 (2, if restricted to finds w/o "anti-cult" also mentioned</dd>

A free interpretation? May be, but in this case I did not use this Barker's article to back up contents in the entry, but only to back up my opinion about article naming, so the standards are not so high. And it seems that Cowan based his opinion among others on Barker's older writings. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now "anti-cultist" is indeed a term I would avoid, it sounds less respectable than ACM. Barker herself does not use the term ACM in this article, but her typology has not caught on and you still did not answer the question: Why are there numerous references to the ACM in scholarly literature, <b>much</b> more than any other term? And why does Cowan represent his as a minority opinion? Who on earth among scholars proposes the label "Opposition to Cults and New Religious Movements"? <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 17:38, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, Cowan based his opinion on the older writings by Barker who in her later writings showed that she changed her mind. I admit that that <i>Oppposition to cults etc</i> is not a very common term, but clearly the entry ACM cannot contain media bias or apostates that is now treated at <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements.html" title="Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Opposition to cults and new religious movements</a> and hence many assertions will be off-topic here. Anti-cultist is only the adjective of ACM. She clearly deliberately avoided the term ACM. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:53, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not advocating media bias: I looked at the most important social scientific database, google scholar, and the largest research library. The result was unianimous and reflects Cowan's assessment. All what is written under "OTCNRM" can be written under this lemma as well (provided it is legitamate under either lemma). <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa"><font color="#FF9900">Fossa</font></a><tt><sub><a href="../../../f/o/s/User_talk%7EFossa_246a.html" title="User talk:Fossa">?!</a></sub></tt> 18:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I do not think that everything that is now at the lemma Opposition to cults etc. can be written here. How can media bias or apostate opposition reasonably be part of the ACM is beyond me. I think that lemma is a German/Dutch term.

<dd>You have a point with respect to the media bias. Indeed, that does only marginally belong into ACM, maybe in form like "effects of the ACM". I suggest that the media bias should be moved into the NRM/cult <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemma_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Lemma (linguistics)">lemmata</a>. Actually, lemma sounds Greek to me.

<dd>Yes, Fossa, a template is not "content" and therefore removing it cannot by <i>definition</i> be "vandalism". "Vandalism" has a very specific meaning. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 17:18, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether or not merger is jusfied, and to me an organized ACM is only a subset of those who are more critical of the claims of NRMs, if not merged, useful information on one that applies to the other should be referenced. For one example, the information in the ACM article [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Cult_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Cult_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>], followed to here[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostasy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostasy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>] is relevant to any discussion of the activities and relative credibility of former members, which is important to the article Opposition to Cults and NRMs and to discussions about NRMs. I think we need to consider the readers here and look at the various articles related to this subject as a whole for deconfliction and consistency. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 07:09, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I oppose the merger. The ACM article is about a disputed sociological concept. "Opposition to cults...", although it is currently heavily POV towards NRM theory, is about the reality rather than about a concept. They are different topics. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 17:25, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jossi is right: we should focus on the edits, not the editors. Anyone who pursues an agenda contrary to the aims of this project should be dealt with in another forum, such as an RfC.

<p>This is the text of a usenet post from Monica Pignotti, pointing to some primary sources, which I'll use later.</p>
<p>Here are the details on cult "researcher" Eileen Barker's book being funded by the Moonies:</p>
<p>In 1993, Barker's organization, INFORM (sorry, Dennis, no relation to you) lost funding by the U.K. government due to criticism about the Moonies contributing to her funding for her book. In 1989, a story came out by the Religious News Service, stating that Barker's book was funded by the Unification Church (the Moonies) and that Barker "freely admits that the Unification Church paid all her expenses to attend 18 conferences in Europe, New York, the Caribbean, Korea and South America." Barker stated that "MY UNIVERSITY AND THE SSRC (a U.K. government grants council) REGARDED THIS ATTENDANCE NECESSARY FOR MY RESEARCH." (emphasis added). As a result of the controversy over this funding, Barker's organization lost their U.K. government funding.</p>
<p>Sources: A. Carley, "Government Grant to Cult Watchdog Stirs Flap in Britain", Religious News Service, Jul. 10, 1989, pp. 6-7.</p>
<p>A. Meale, "INFORM - Cut in Funding by the Home Office," Press Release, House of Commons, London, Nov. 15, 1993.</p>
<p>I would say that Barker's work is about as credible as a study on the dangers of cigarette smoking funded by Phillip Morris.</p>
