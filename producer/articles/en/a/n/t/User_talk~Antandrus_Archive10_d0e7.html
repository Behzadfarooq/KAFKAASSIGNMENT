<p>Hello, Antandrus. I hope things are going well with you. I've just remembered that when I asked for help with the Lutosławski FAC you expressed frustration that you had been too busy to notice that a composer article was up for FAC. In the light of this, and in case you've not noticed it, can I bring <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Olivier_Messiaen_c212.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Olivier Messiaen">this</a> to your attention? I watch the article quite closely, and the initial nomination took <i>me</i> by surprise!

<p>Thanks for reverting the vandalism to my user talk. It was pretty funny that the block notice was under the heading "Welcome". Perhaps we should adopt that - "Welcome!

Unless there's something missing I don't know about, it looks ready to me (maybe some audio samples would be nice).

<p>I am so sorry about the article San Rocco di Venezia. I didn't realize there was already an article on him, because I only ever heard about him in Italy, never knowing he was known as Saint Roch in the English world. Since the old article is more extensive, I'll just delete mine.<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevahn58_2203.html" title="User:Devahn58">Devahn58</a> 04:57, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

A new user, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainhell_3ced.html" title="User:Brainhell">User:Brainhell</a>, insists on posting what seems to be little more than link spam to an author's website. I'm trying to be helpful; guy is being nasty. Sure enough, the article is back...and there isn't any biographical info on this individual to expand it beyond what it is. I don't want to get in an edit war, but I really don't appreciate this guy accusing me of vandalism when I'm trying to help. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 05:45, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No doubt there is a lot of link spam. But no doubt many contributors of good articles start small and then build the piece in layers. That's completely human and completely understandable. The better recourse would have been to insert that tag about possible deletion, rather than deleting within such a short period of time. I had just created the stub. I am new to Wiki and perceived that I was up against a vandal. Indeed I was. How much more disturbing to learn that the destroyer has some form of administrative rights.</p>
<p>I'm new here, and it's not a paying job, clearly. I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as "nasty" or "threatening" ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures -- but does not ultimately tolerate.</p>
<p>i am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem. That's probably the most corrosive thing to a volunteer effort. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainhell_3ced.html" title="User:Brainhell">Brainhell</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBrainhell_d931.html" title="User talk:Brainhell">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brainhell_5c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brainhell">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<dl>
<dd>You appeared on my watch list when you edited an article I had tagged. I went to your User Page &amp; decided you might be someone who can help me with some (very likely) basic operating questions about Wikipedia. I'm fairly new to Wikipedia. My edits thus far have been mostly adding birth &amp; death dates, places of birth, quotations, and re-wording sections of articles that deal with psychological and psychotherapeutic issues to make them more clinically objective. My main question (for now) involves Categories. I reviewed the information on Categories and it appears faily simple. However, when considering elements of an article for categorization, how can I know the exact wording of the Category without having to review the huge list each time? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_David_03f9.html" title="User:Michael David">Michael David</a> 13:46, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the input on Categorization. I'm still stumbling, but I will perservere. Yes, the Pirsig is from ZAMM. As you will see I couldn't resist putting in another one. There is a great deal I miss about Berkeley - most especially the PASSION for questioning things. Am I getting old, or is that missing today? Regarding the second Pirsig quote: You're so sure you'll do everything wrong because that's what you were taught very early by some very important people in your life. Kids take notes!</p>

<p>Thanks for noticing. I feel like the whole music section could still be beaten a bit (four years of music school really killed my writing abilities), and I don't think I'd feel hurt if the bio section was pruned a bit, but I think it's a bit better. One thing I found out which was cool, but I couldn't figure out how to fit in, is that apparently he put some of his pieces on player-piano rolls, some of which are extant. I wonder if it's even conceivable to get a recording of it not under copyright. Maybe when I'm feeling really energetic I'll look into it.

<p>Think we can get him for violating Verizon's ToS (Since UUNET is part of MCI is part of Verizon)? He's definately getting to be worse then WoW or any other vandal. 68.39.174.238 16:52, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If he's on Verizon's AUP, we've got him. Verizon's AUP sucks. It seems to be inherited from UUNET (!) in that it goes off about "making the text scroll faster then users can read it" and other IRC/USENET specifics, but says nothing about, say, fraud, ID theft, impersonation, etc, etc, other then under the vauge rubric of "unlawful, improper, or illegal purpose[s]" (Which is redundant in two parts, and disconcertingly vague in the third.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, if <a href="http://www2.verizon.net/policies/acceptable_use.asp" class="external text" title="http://www2.verizon.net/policies/acceptable_use.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> is it (Which it is according to <a href="../../../i/s/p/WP%7EISPS_7283.html" title="WP:ISPS">WP:ISPS</a> (I might also add it's extremelt hard to find via the Googles I tried)), I think he's violated these:</p>
<ul>
<li>2
<ul>
<li>(d): is objectionable for any reason,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3
<ul>
<li>(a) for any unlawful, improper or illegal purpose or activity; — Assuming we can define "improper"</li>
<li>(b) to post or transmit information or communications that, whether explicitly stated, implied, or suggested through use of symbols, are obscene, indecent, pornographic, sadistic, cruel, or racist in content, or of a sexually explicit or graphic nature; or which espouses, promotes or incites bigotry, hatred or racism; or which might be legally actionable for any reason; — Something of a stretch, however his "eliteism" crap may count (Again, this may be stretching it).</li>
<li>(c) to access or attempt to access the accounts of others, to spoof or attempt to spoof the URL or DNS or IP addresses of Verizon or any other entity, or to attempt to penetrate or penetrate security measures of Verizon or other entities' systems ("hacking") whether or not the intrusion results in corruption or loss of data; — If trying to evade Ipblocklist is "hacking" per them.</li>
<li>(d) to bombard individuals or newsgroups with uninvited communications, data or information, or other similar activities, including but not limited to "spamming", "flaming" or denial or distributed denial of service attacks; — If Wikimedia counts as an "individual", then he has been bombarding us(/it/them) against our wishes and has probably been specifically requested against it.</li>
<li>(h) to interfere with another person's usage or enjoyment of the Internet or this Service; — I suspect he's interfered with many peoples enjoyment of the Internet (I also suspect this clause is NEVER enforced in the 1st part, rarely in the 2nd part)</li>
<li>(r) to use the Service or the Internet in a manner intended to threaten, harass, or intimidate; — Depends on exactly how/why he's using the name "Cunio".</li>
<li>(t) to use the Service to disrupt the normal flow of online dialogue, — So does his crap AfDs of eliteism count as a disruption of the normal flow of dialog here?</li>
<li>(u) to use the Service to violate any operating rule, policy or guideline of any other online services provider or interactive service; — Using sockpuppets to evade bans, etc...</li>
<li>(x) to install "auto-responders," "cancel-bots" or similar automated or manual routines which generate excessive amounts of net traffic, or disrupt net user groups or email use by others; — Has he run a vandalbot?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If he's on Verizon's Buissiness TOS (Which is what uu.net redirects to) then we're just about sunk. It's SO LAME. About all it says is "You can't break the law", and some Email/USENET stuff.</p>

<dd>Hi Missmarple! I looked at it, and I'm not sure--it seems it could go either way. Many other categories pertaining to people are being subdivided -- "sharpened" -- by nationality, but there's a point where doing so becomes an unnecessary level of detail (kazoo players by nationality, sexual preference, and hair color). When I'm unsure or on the fence I usually don't vote... but I'll think on it some more. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:58, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Our little friend has been vandalizing pages having to do with African Americans again. He's asked for three admins to look at the case and make a decision; so I wanted to know if you would like to look at the case. He promised <i>ME</i> he would never vandalize again, I don't like it when people come back on their promises; he deserves a permanent ban.

<p>This is a dynamic I/P assigned by American Online, and I am the unlucky one to have it at the moment. If you view my history you will see many legitimate contributions and no vandalism in my past. Also, is there some way you can check whether it's a permanent or dynamic I/P before blocking it&#160;? I don't know if this is technically possible, but, if so, an I/P ban on a dynamic I/P address should be quite short term, perhaps an hour or so, to make it unlikely another user (like me) will be affected after the vandal logs off and the dynamic I/P is reassigned. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 21:57, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there a way to get any help here? I was banned and i had never edited anything beofre. I went to a page for Gene Okerlund and wanted to add that his son was a member of the the 1988 U.S.A. Olympic hockey team and I placed it in the wrong area. I went back to fix it today and I found out that I was banned. Why is this so? I love Wikipedia and have learned much. I am David Demarco from Winchester, MA. U.S.A. My email is david5512@aol.com Could you please go in and fix Gene Okerlund's page? I think it's an interesting piece of trivia. Thank you.&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are able to edit my talk page, you're not banned. Probably what happened is that you shared an IP with a vandal who was blocked (maybe by me?) -- but since you use AOL you get a new IP with each session, or possibly with each window you open. I'll go through the autoblock log and clear any that are obvious, but chances are you won't have any trouble editing the Gene Okerlund article if you go there again.
