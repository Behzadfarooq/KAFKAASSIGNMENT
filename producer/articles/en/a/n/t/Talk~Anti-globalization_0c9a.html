<p>I added some much needed clarification regarding "rioters" vs. "protesters" or "demonstrators", and "riots" vs. "protests" or "demonstrations". The single major differentiating factor is violence, including vandalism and stone-throwing, which some people seem content to pooh-pooh as being "not really violence". A protest or demonstration, once it becomes violent, has become a riot. See both the dictionary and Wiki article (<a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riot</a>) if you don't believe me. This is necessary to keep the article both factual and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/l/User%7EBullzeye_222b.html" title="User:Bullzeye">Bullzeye</a> 08:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the section about N30, there are no sources for any of the information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is an assertion that it was the Black Bloc who was responsible for every act of property violence, which is clearly untrue. I point anyone interested to the documentary "Breaking the Spell" released by CrimethInc.</p>

<p>I suggest changing the title of this article to what I stated above. There is a huge difference between criticism and being completely against it. Activists at WSFs for example aren't necessarily against globalization as are people demonstrating against the G8 summits. It is true that there is people completely against globalization but most participants at such demonstrations just want a fair globalization to happen. The linked German article for example is titled Globalization criticism</p>

<p>This comment is about the section "Lack of evidence for claims"</p>
<p>Whoever wrote this section: please adapt it, or I will have to remove it. Those ten "facts" or "trends" in favour of globalization do not refer to appropriate sources.</p>
<p>1. Note 6 doesn't lead me anywhere close to an article</p>
<p>2. Note 7 (about the decreased rate of child mortality "everywhere in the third world") refers to an article where somebody else states this "fact". This is no evidence. Actually it is a false statement – check the UNDP numbers and see.</p>
<p>3. Note 8 is about the gap between the rich and poor. You claim the gap is actually getting smaller! Don't believe every columnist you read, but go and check the UNDP numbers. Least of all REFER to a columnist if you want to proof such contrversial factual statements.</p>
<p>4. Note 9 leads to an ERROR (maybe a temporary one?)</p>
<p>5. Note 10 leads me to a site where I would have to subscribe! A note should be freely accessible to everyone; if it not, find another source.</p>
<p>In a section where you claim a lack of evidence for your oponent you should be very keen on your own sources. You have not been, I'm afraid. Pomos</p>

<p>I added the clean-up tag here because this article badly needs it. Who added the following?... "Antiglobalization militants saw a confirm of their preoccupation on the functionment of democratic institutions..." Huh?</p>
<p>The lead paragraph after the intro reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many participants consider the term "anti-globalization" to be a misnomer, and one which has been used to make inaccurate and simplistic criticisms of the movement, for example that it is purely negative, or that it simply argues for protectionism or even nationalism. In fact, the movement is self-consciously internationalist, organising globally and seeing itself as in solidarity with oppressed people around the world (see for example the organisation Peoples Global Action).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first sentence is basically POV and the second completely so. I could take dozens of examples from the article which basically reads as a brochure for various anti-globalization groups. I presume this article is relatively tightly guarded or I'd just wade in but if no one cleans it up I'll do my best. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:27, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>- sorry this is in the wrong place. But I have just seen what the dispute is all about and for the criticism to be present on the page makes a bit of a mockery of wikipedia. I work in an anarchist/anti-authoritarian group and are all hoping to protest against the g8 in 2005 in scotland. About 2/3rds of the group (about 7 of them) are jewish though I am an atheist. When I have been to summit protests (I have been to J18, Prague, Seattle, Evian, Maydays, etc), I have NEVER seen or heard anything anti-semitic and I went to Genoa with a practicing anti-globalist anarchist jew who is still a good friend of mine. the grassroots globalisation movement is not connected with anti-semitic groups, nor with dodgy islamicist groups that might be part of the anti-war movement. Please remove this slanderous rubbish off the page. Thank you. ***</li>

<p>There is no way one can talk about Anti-globalization without talking about the YES Men. They are a fixture in the movement. Is there anyone here who feels confident enough to give them a decent treatment?</p>
<p>I think maybe we should also talk about the anti globalization critics fears of Wal-Mart and McDonalds taking over the world and destroying cultures.</p>

<p>What exactly is the time period that you believe constitutes the era of "globalisation" as it is popularly known in today's discourse? I ask because in the paragraph which I'm assuming you wrote your statistics for life expectancy the time period begins at WWII, for the child mortality statistic no time frame is given, for "democracy" the time period given is 1900 to 2000, for literacy the time frame is 1950 to 1999 to name some of the parameters that are disputable because they encompass time periods which do not belong to the time period which the discourse on globalisation usually refers. Do you not recognize this as vague argumentation? It follows a pattern well recognized by many critics of globalisation, namely pro-globalists tend to inexplicably inc</p>
<p>lude the so-called "golden age of capitalism" (1955-70)characterized by fixed exchange rates, and relative pro-welfare state arrangements in their "statistics" in the course of advocating for globalisation because it makes the picture look better than it is. One further question, if there is such a strong correlation between globalisation and literacy then why does a relatively isolationist country like Cuba have a literacy rate that compares favourably to the US and Canada (according to UNESCO Cuba has the highest in the Western hemisphere)&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>As is clearly stated, the movement is anti-capitalist, not merely against free trade or floating exchange rates. As such, statistics that shows improvement under capitalism is relevant. Regarding Cuba, one nation do not prove anything about global trends. And:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Cuba has been among the most literate countries in Latin America since well before the Castro revolution, when it ranked fourth. Since then, Cuba has increased its literacy rate from 76 to 96 percent and is tied today for second place with Chile and Costa Rica. Argentina is the most literate country in Latin America. This improvement is impressive, but not unique, among Latin American countries. Panama, Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Haiti -- which all ranked just behind Cuba in this indicator during the 1950's – have equaled or bettered Cuba's improvement when measured in percentage terms[10] <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/wha/ci/14776.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/p/wha/ci/14776.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</dd>

<dd>I've removed a paragraph relating to capitalism in general, rather than globalisation in paricular. Perhaps it could be added as a 'responses to anti-capitalist arguments' section on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalism.html" title="Anti-capitalism">Anti-capitalism</a> page?

<dd>I don't see where the article says the movement as a whole is anti-capitalist; it says that the movement is critical of globalisation as a development within capitalism, and that some members of the movement want an alternative to capitalism. But it also talks about anti-globalizers who want to reform capitalism, or are pro-capitalist (e.g. Stiglitz). So I think a general defence of capitalism is out of place in this article, which is too long anyway. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 23:02, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ultramarine: The sources you cite for empirical evidence that higher literacy rates (and other improvements) are "due to capitalism" merely show correlation of those factors with economic freedom. They do not show causation, nor do they claim to:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>"[The Grubel study finds that] economic freedom does not have a cost in terms of income levels, income growth, unemployment rates, and human development." - freetheworld.com</li>
<li>"[The Fraser study finds that] lower infant mortality, higher literacy rates, lower corruption, and greater access to safe drinking water are also associated with increases in economic liberty." - Cato Institute</li>
</ul>
<p>The best conclusion you can make from these sources is that social improvements are "associated" with capitalism, not "due to". Otherwise you are committing a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation_implies_causation_%28logical_fallacy%29.html" title="Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy)">cum hoc ergo propter hoc</a> logical fallacy.

<dd>The degree of correlation could be 100%, but it wouldn't change the fact that the conclusion you are trying to present is fallacious (although not necessarily false). For example, it could be that countries with higher literacy are more likely to adopt free market economic policies. Or, for a more plausable example, it could be that countries with more liberal social policies (and thus higher rates of female literacy) are more likely to have capitalist economies. Regardless, I'm sure you see my point. This is why the writers of your sources have not made such presumptuous conclusions. A better way to frame the argument presented would be:<br /></dd>
<dd><i>Finally, critics argue that the anti-globalization movement uses <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdotal_evidence.html" title="Anecdotal evidence">anecdotal evidence</a> to support their views and that worldwide statistics do not support many of the contentions made by the movement. For example, although anti-globalization activists often argue that globalization has negative consequences for the poor, several studies have shown that there is actually a high correlation between liberalized economic policies and lower rates of poverty, lower infant mortality, higher literacy rates, lower corruption, and greater access to safe drinking water.</i><br /></dd>
<dd>This would more accurately reflect the statements made by sources you have cited. Drawing your own conclusions from these sources is not in keeping with the policies of NPOV and No Original Research.<br /></dd>

<dd>Yes, but once again you are showing correlation, not causation. You are also doing original research by extending these conclusions to areas not dealt with in the sources and by formulating criticism rather than strictly summarizing the criticisms made by others. If you cannot produce a single source that says higher literacy rates are caused by liberalization of economic policies, I will be inclined to reinstate my edit. I am also considering doing the same for universal sufferage. I do think, however, that you have provided adequate sources to say that it is contended that economic liberalization causes economic growth. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 00:08, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which study are you refering to? Please cite some specific text if possible. I have not been able to find any such claims in any of the sources you have cited. Rather, I have found 1 chart comparing literacy rates with economic policies and a couple of statements to the effect that literacy rates are higher in more liberalized economies. I have yet to see a single claim that certain economic policies <i>increase</i> literacy (other than your own claim). Nor have I seen a single mention of sufferage in any of the sources. Also I think it would be more helpful if you cited actual criticisms made by defenders of globalization rather than citing orginal studies and formulating your own conclusions.

<dd>I have certainly never said that original, peer-reviewed studies are inappropriate sources for Wikipedia. I was saying that the section on criticism of globalization is for discussion of existing criticisms of globalization. It is not appropriate for you to use the section to put forth your own criticisms of gloabilization regardless of your ability to justify those criticisms with facts or sources. BTW, it sounds like the <i>Constitutional Political Economy</i> article may be just the source you need to justify the inclusion of the literacy issue (although my concerns above still stand). I consider it a very weak citation, however, since the actual text is not available.

<dd>"Results in this paper provide no support for previous studies that suggest that political freedom significantly affects the level of economic well-being, but they do provide evidence for the reverse—that the level of economic well-being enhances political freedom. While we do not find support for a direct relationship between economic freedom and political freedom, the results do imply an indirect relationship through the level of real per capita GDP.

<p>Furthermore, this is much broader than just capitalism. Many anti-globalists in their propaganda imply that the third world is not improving or actually declining in living standards.

<dd>We're not anti-'capitalism', just anti-<i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism. If capitalism had no restrictions, then whoever has the most money would be able to take all the power- and who has the most money? Corporations, entities whose only purpose is to make more money. This would result in particular greedy humans to control society in a new feudalism. There must be humanist restrictions.<br /></dd>
<dd>Also, my concern over free trade and such is not so much about how many people are starving to death (although that number is still at least 24,000 per day), because those people are of no use to corporations. What good is a corpse? It can't work or create wealth for a corporation; corporations need workers. Corporations need <i>cheap</i> workers. Slaves in the American South were actually treated fairly well (compared to the popular perception of malnourishment and frequent beatings), just as a farmer would treat a workhorse. But slaves and workhorses hold no property. This is the goal of multinational corporations: Productive workers who are paid much less than the wealth they produce for the company; the difference is profit. So you see, corporations <i>want</i> people to get enough calories (although they would prefer if people didn't have to eat, so they wouldn't have to pay for food), but not much more, not enough for a <i>decent</i> living, and certainly not anywhere <i>close</i> to what they deserve. I'm sure you've heard of sweatshops, and they're the embodiment of the idea: Pay the workers just enough that they survive.</dd>

<dd>Ok, I'm interested in the subject and would like to learn more, and will contribute to a "impact of anti-globalization" section if I find substantive information. I personally believe in the ideals of the movement, but I just don't see how it can work in real life, particularly with the protest tactics that are often used, which I consider very ineffective.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For an object lesson as to why, I doubt that anti-globalization will meaningfully change the world, the situation in New Orleans is instructive. A politically-marginalized, impoverished population without adequate means to escape the recent hurricane and opngoing flooding was stranded to die by the government that was supposed to protect them. As long as the wealthy have the power, poorer populations are going to be shut out of the benefits of modernity, and instead suffer only its drawbacks. If this is the presently the case for impoverished populations in developed countries, I fail to see how this unfortunate situation is going to meaningfully change for the developing world in any reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>When you open this page there are two disclaimers - the first on Neutrality, the second asking for a 'clean-up' which is more acceptable but which does not appear to be more called for here than on many other pages.

<dd>Personally I don't know of any articles in the areas of social affairs on wikipedia which I could describe as neutral. I think the whole "neutrality in dispute" tag is a bit silly when you consider that the fawning page on Reagan is considered neutral, and the page which parrots the establishment view on "globalization" is likewise considered neutral. Some days, I think of the non-neutrality tag as a compliment. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernardL_5215.html" title="User:BernardL">user:bernardL</a></dd>

<dd>To be honest with you, I think those examples you've given, as well as several other articles on this website, are likely not neutral because of the sometimes mentioned but rarely seriously discussed bias in favor of liberatarianism on Wikipedia. Like it or not, there's an inherant lack of balance when the upper members of a site are mostly (if not all) from the same political party. If we had more diversity amongst the editors here, we'd have more balanced articles. And as a disclaimer, I'm a loyal fan of Wikipedia, and one of the editors who edits almost daily. However, I'm not about to deny the bias I've seen passed off as "NPOV" by some of the liberatarians here. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:23, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Judging from my limited experience of Wiki so far I agree with you about the pervasiveness of the libertarians. Nevertheless I guess the problem goes deeper for me. I can't even read a professional economic paper without recognizing its non-neutrality no matter how much it may attempt to shroud itself in a scientific pose. I guess I agree more with Gunnar Myrdal who believed that values were central to any purposeful enquiry, that they affected perceptions of the subject matter and the methods undertaken to understand them, and therefore when we undertake any enquiry we should attempt to make the underlying value premises explicit.

<p>The opening paragraph of the article mentions the term 'anti-plutocracy', which a) I've never heard of, despite being fairly heavily involved in alter-globalisation stuff and b) links to what looks suspiciously like a puff-piece for Ralph Nader.

<dd>Americanization is something unilateral, thus the exact contrary of globalization, which is the acceptance of a common world. There is a lot of mental confusion in the anti-globalists' mind. Maybe because they are anchored on traditional ideologies that has nothing to do with understanding the 21st century world. Btw, for me the symbol of globalization is pizza, a very local food from a poor italian region where people could only afford bread and a few toppings, and which conquered peacefully the world as a standard meal found about everywhere. Let us call it global pizzaisation.

<p>I'd like to address some problems with the following paragraph found in the "criticism" section.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Some critics point to pervasive anti-Americanism in the anti-globalist movement. They point out that globalization wasn't objected to when it European culture was spreading globally. French anti-globalists, for instance, fear Americanization of French culture, but apparently saw no problem with coercing three dozen nations to speak French."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Aside from the fact that critiques of globalisation, or indeed the conceputal development of the term, began long after the end of European empire-building, the assertion that French anti-globalists saw no prblem with colonialsim is incorrect. Insofar as much (though not all) of the French anti-globalisation movement originates on the French left, it would be more accurate to say that the anti-globalisation movement is equally-opposed to European imperialism. I would liike to see some evidence of this assertion of support for European colonisation and the spread of the French language.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Likewise, corporations are not treated equally: US corporations are often targeted for special criticism, eg. Nike is protested more than German Adidas. The same critique applies in the cultural sphere: French wine, Chinese tea, Japanese manga are not considered "dangerous" in anyway, yet Coca Cola or Hollywood are routinely villainized. Thus, these critics contend that anti-global groups routinely favor European style economic, political and cultural systems over Anglo-American ones, belying a cultural bias and not necessarily an objection to globalization itself."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Adidas, a company far smaller than Nike, has been protesed for its manufacturing policies although, unlike Nike, it only switched to sweatshop labour within recent years. 'French wine', is not a brand and, unlike coca cola, is only produced in France, subject to import taxes wherever else it is sold. Japanese Manga is a minor cultural influence which, unlike Hollywood, does not effect the economies of film producers in every country across the globe. However, the small-scale protests against Japanese video games in the US in the eighties, and sexually-explicit manga in the nineties, indicates that they are not perceived as harmless.</p>
<p>If there is no evidence to back up these claims, the section of the article needs to be reworded.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 15:18, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-globalization&amp;oldid=23869809" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-globalization&amp;oldid=23869809" rel="nofollow">23rd September</a>, 67.164.60.250 changed this page to be a redirect to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Justice_Movement_084b.html" title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a> (to where she copied all the content from this page). I have reverted that change, primarily because it seems to me that a change of that sort ought to be discussed before it is implemented.</p>
<p>But to kick off such a discussion, let me say I oppose replacing this article with such a redirect; the term 'Global Justice Movement' is a much less appropriate one to use as the title for this article, for two reasons. First, 'anti-globalization' is a much better known and more commonly used term for this loose strand of political groupings (quick and dirty estimate: Google gives 196,000 hits for 'anti-globalization movement' vs. 91,500 for 'global justice movement').</p>
<p>Second, the term 'global justice movement' is generally used only by a subsection of the broader movement, particularly the sections grouped around NGOs; the anti-capitalist and anarchist sections of the movement, for instance, generally do not talk about the Global Justice Movement, and indeed are suspicious of those that do. In contrast to this, although, as the article says, many involved in this movement would reject 'anti-globalization' as a <i>description</i> of their movement, they would generally recognize that it is a term commonly used to <i>name</i> them. Thus, redirecting 'anti-globalization' to 'global justice movement' introduces a bias in favour of a particular interpretation of the term (why 'global justice' rather than <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_of_Movements_83b6.html" title="Movement of Movements">Movement of Movements</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter-globalization.html" title="Alter-globalization">Alter-globalization</a>, for instance?).</p>
<p>I have also, as a consequence of this revert, changed <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Justice_Movement_084b.html" title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a> back to its original content (which I must admit isn't all that great), rather than a copy of this page.</p>

<dd>I was the one who changed the content. I insist that <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Justice_Movement_084b.html" title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a> is the appropriate term for the movement. "Anti-globalization" is a misnomer used primarily by the opposition, neoliberals and neoconservatives. This term is used as a form of Orwellian newspeak to discredit opponents of neo-liberalism as being anti-globalization. This is not at all true. The anarchists and other anti-capitalists also identify with the term <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Justice_Movement_084b.html" title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a>.- Cemendur</dd>

<dd>Can you give me some examples of anarchists and anti-capitalists self-identifying as the "Global Justice Movement"? PGA, for instance, do not, and references to the Global Justice Movement on Infoshop are sparse. At the other end of the spectrum, the WSF doesn't use the term 'Global Justice', either. And I don't believe the terms (or its cognates) are widely used in continental Europe, although I could be wrong. This all suggests that 'Global Justice Movement' is not a good general replacement for the term 'Anti-globalization movement', insufficient though the latter may be. Besides which, I don't think many people within the movement object particularly strongly to the term 'Anti-globalization Movement', even if it is not the term they would themselves choose. For instance, a Google search for "Anti-globalization movement" brings up, on the first page, two Wikipedia entries, one article criticizing the movement, and the rest pages by supporters of the movement; so I think your claim that it is solely used to misrepresent the movement is questionable. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 08:06, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the first links are from a google search are mostly from news magazines. Plenty of them do have a leftist slant, except for the one likenening anti-globalization to anti-semitism, but only one of them appears to be any type of activist page. And that one (anti-marketing.com) appears to be an advertising service specializing in non-traditional forms of advertising. Several of the other articles talk about the pejorative nature of the term "anti-globalization" or refer to "the movement of movements." All the activists I've encountered, locally, nationally, pro and anti capitalist, sometimes use the term anti-globalization simply because it is so ubiquitous; and then they often try to correct themselves by saying global justice movement. However given its probelmatic nature surely shifting the page over to the global justice movement's article and then explaining on this page the rejection of the term accompanied by a redirect wouldn't be inappropriate.--<a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujeresliebres_ce64.html" title="User:Mujeresliebres">Mujeresliebres</a> 18:15, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made the following changes to the article:</p>
<p>1) Moved "Is anti-globalization a misnomer" down the article, it now follows "Anti-empire development". It was not useful to have at the beginning of the article. The article should move from the introduction to a more in-depth discussion of the topic; having the misnomer stuff at the front smacks of a "People's Front of Judea"-style argument.</p>
<p>2) Removed quotations from "anti-business" in the first paragraph of Ideology. Quotations such as these have the effect of promulgating a POV, which is inappropriate.</p>

<p>Again, differentiating the anti-globalization movement from others. Advocate is preferable to "promote awareness of", it's more concise. Support for human rights NGO's is not a primary feature of the anti-globalization movement, but stems from its core principles, so I moved it down the paragraph. "Struggle" replaced with "advocate", more neutral term. Cut down the list of supported topics and single-issue campaigns, this shouldn't read like a laundry list, and many of the topics/campaigns are mentioned elsewhere in the article. This paragraph is still pretty messy, so could someone else could take a crack at it?</p>

<dd>Actually George Soros did indeed criticise globalisation, at least as far as I know. He seems to have a kind of split personality... I think he criticised the currency speculation during the Asian crisis, but became rich himself by speculating against the British Pound a few years earlier. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 20:45, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the matter is not to criticize globalization, this is not the goal of the movement, but to see the world in a different way. "There Is No Alternative" (to liberalism, to free trade, to capitalism) could be the motto of Soros, while most people in the movement(s) think that "Another world is possible", a world of solidarity, a world with many different ideas, a world where it is possible to live without making market of everything. Remember the movement is not "against globalization" but "for a different globalization".--<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruman_Burbank_e26b.html" title="User:Truman Burbank">Truman Burbank</a> 17:53, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This term is rejected by almost every person who involved in the movement. I suggest moving all this content to a new article called "anti-neoliberalism"--a neutral term--and creating a new anti-globalization article that basically explains that the term "anti-globalization" is a perjorative term for the anti-neoliberal movement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be interested in seeing some evidence for the claim that the term "anti-globalization" is rejected by "almost every person who is involved in the movement." Even if that's true, I don't think it's a reason for renaming the article, as "anti-globalization" is the most common term used to refer to the movement (so, the term which most Wikipedia readers are likely to be looking for), and I don't think there is another term around which the movements could find consensus on using (for instance, some anti-capitalists oppose "anti-neoliberalism" because they believe it implies that non-neoliberal capitalism would be preferable; I imagine some NGOs might think that there specific issue is not included in the term "anti-neoloberalism"). -- <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 02:23, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>well, the term anti-globalization is seen as implying isolationism or even opposition to mutliculturalism. the "anti-globalization" movement is emphatically in favor of multicultural exchange and discourse...</dd>

<p>---Because <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a> has meanings which are cultural, technical, and economic, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find many people who call themselves "anti-globalization". My perception is that "anti-globalization" folks such as labor unionists, ecologists, farmers, sweatshop workers, people whose governments have undergone IMF structural adjustments, etc. -- are mostly not against globalizations like the Kyoto treaty, watching Bollywood movies outside of India, a certain amount of immigration, the spread of some technology, and international solidarity movements.</p>
<p>As far as evidence that the term "anti-globalization" is unpopular within the movement: in her book <i>Another World Is Possible If...</i>, the <a href="../../../a/t/t/ATTAC_8381.html" title="ATTAC">ATTAC</a>-affiliated writer Susan George says the first thing she says to reporters who ask her about the "anti-globalization" movement is to not call it that, because she is <i>for</i> fair globalization; in <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>'s Wikipedia article, they discuss how Chomsky doesn't like the term because he feels it is misleading; <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naomi_Klein_1095.html" title="Naomi Klein">Naomi Klein</a>, who is like the poster-girl for the English-language "anti-globalization" movement, discusses in this article</p>

<p>said that "...Anti-globalization Movement' turns out to be a name invented by journalists that has stuck. All the activists reject it, not least because it offers ammunition to opponents ('How can you be against Globalization? Are you against air travel? The internet? Cheap international phone calls?')" "Anti-neoliberalism" is too narrow, but "anti-globalization" is downright misleading. I would support the redirect of the article to another name, like the Global Justice Movement or Movement of Movements: if Wikipedia readers are looking for "anti-globalization", they'll just get redirected...<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsam_ef10.html" title="User:Katsam">Katsam</a></p>

<dd>I think this is absolutely right. This is definitely a perjorative term used by detractors to discredit the movement. It's hopelessly pov, as if the "women's rights movement" article was under the heading "antimotherhood movement." I suggest it be moved to "Global Justice Movement," the preferred name for members of the movement in question (121,000) hits in Google. Sylvain1972 17:30, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said below, I don't think we can fairly use any label. We should take the most NPOV approach and put information about the movement at "Movement against neoliberal globalization". Then, anti-globalization, alter-globalization, Global Justice Movement, Movement of Movements, etc. can exist as separate pages. The anti-globalization article can focus on the usage of the label anti-globalization by the media, and on how activists have responded to that term. That's the only option I see as truly fair. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 17:36, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it would be better to move everything to "Movement against neoliberal globalization", rather than fracture the article into a million pieces for every obscure sub label. Sylvain1972 20:08, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I think all the movement elements should all be in the same place, and that place should be neutral (hence why we should use a descriptory title rather than an imprecise label). If after cutting those parts out of the articles enough remains to be worthy of a separate article (I think there would be in the case of anti-globalization, if not for any of the other terms) then that's OK. But actually you're right. We'd be able to use a single article to cover the movement instead of the 5 we have right now. It's superfluous, but as long as we're sticking to using labels we're going to have repeated content. There seemed to be support for the suggested change below. Even if not everyone thought it was a necessary, I haven't heard any specific complaints about the idea. If there aren't any, it might be a good idea to go ahead and make it happen. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:10, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even though the term "anti-globalization" is more known than others (Alter-globalization for example) I don't think that's reason enough to chose that term. I find the term Anti-globalization incorrect and misleading and very political. As said, many who's against the current form of economic globalization objects to the term, and is wholeheartedly for other forms of globalization, especially when it's globalization in both ways (leading to enrichment of culture in societies) instead of one way globalization ("americanization"). If the name of the article is misleading and objected to by it's proponents, then I think the number of "google hits" or such comparements doesn't matter. Because otherwise we could just as well rename the "Orange" article to "Apple" because "Apple" gets more hits on google. I know I'm making an absurd comparement now, but consider this: if a democratic political movement in a dictature would be called The party of Pedophile Alcoholics (or something like that...) by it's goverment, and would thus also be known by the large majority of it's population by that name, then what would wikipedia name it? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerat_4dff.html" title="User:Merat">Merat</a> 14:07, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that there is no section regarding the movement toward counterhegemonic globalization. I believe that the person writing above me on this forum is speaking of the counterhegemonic movement without titling it. It is a movement against the forceful tactics of neo-liberal institutions that is not opposed to the idea of globalization in and of itself. Counterhegemonic globalization is a movement that this page seems to exclude, which is both interesting and crucially important for the future of the increasingly globalized world.<br />
<br />
Although I do not know enough about it to write a section myself on the subject, I believe it does deserve a section... The article "Counterhegemonic Globalization" by Peter Evans found in <i>The Handbook of Political Sociology</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2005) seems to be a good starting point. -- <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenlegdog_0cbb.html" title="User:Brokenlegdog">Brokenlegdog</a> 08:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Wikipedia as an opensource encyclopedia would be the best place to finally find an appropriate name for the movement(s). As it is said below most activists reject it. Here's the place to find a better term that a large majority can <b>identify with positively</b>. I see this positive identification with the movement as a key variable to sustained commitment, so I think it would be worth discussing it.</p>
<p>Personally I think that "movement of the movements" doesn't say much about the content and is rather vague. It also claims to incorporate movements that are not really related to the "anti-globalization" movement.</p>
<p>Are there any good arguments against "Alterglobalization Movement" &amp; "Global Justice Movement"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is some problem with using a minority term to represent something on Wikipedia. It's a project intended to reflect rather than construct reality. But on the other hand, it's POV to use a term popularized by the media over the preferred terminology of the movement itself. Personally I'd like to see the article moved to "Opposition to neoliberal globalization" or "Movement against neoliberal globalization" because it's both much more accurate and doesn't rely on more neological terminology. If anything, that would also be more NPOV because it wouldn't try to assign a name to a movement that has no single name. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm going to suggest it again: does anyone have a problem with moving the bulk of information of this page to a title where the movement is <i>described</i> rather than <i>labeled</i>? [[Anti-globalization]] can continue to exist as a page showing how that term is used in mass media and perceived by those in the movement. I would contend that is the fairest approach to all parties, and one that is in no way in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The most contentious issue is what description we should give the movement.

<dd>I'm not convinced that renaming the article is a good idea. One, the term "anti-globalization" is used and understood by the vast majority of news organizations and columnists (both for and against). Renaming it would be confusing, and would append a point of view to the article that leans towards "the movement" for the sake of appeasing a minority of potential readers.</dd>

It reminds me of that bit from <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Brian_e306.html" title="Life of Brian">Life of Brian</a> where the lefties squabble over the name of "People's Front of Judea" rather than going out and doing something about injustice. The text of the article itself, I think, is quite NPOV. We should stick to that, and assign titles based on the name that our sources typically use for it.

<dd>I'm not suggesting renaming it. The term "anti-globalization" clearly deserves an article in its own right, just as we have articles on "<a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter-globalization.html" title="Alter-globalization">alter-globalization</a>", etc. But using this label to represent the movement is extremely problematic, since the movement often considers itself pro-globalization. As a result, how the article is written is skewed, as is pretty evident in the awkward opening paragraph. The article itself notes three alternative names and widespread criticism of the term within the movement, showing the current selection is both arbitrary and POV. For a label to be fair, it can't simply be imposed, it also needs to be accepted. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:19, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sarge I don't think any label is without its problems due to the complex nature of the movement. "Movement against neoliberal globalization" is perhaps superior because the movement is not only about opposition, it seeks to build alternative institutions. In any case, the label is not as important as the exposition of its meanings. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernardL_5215.html" title="User:BernardL">BernardL</a> 22:33, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this is a POV problem - it's not appropriate to use a critic's title for a movement if you're trying to maintain neutral POV. Political parties and governments all have articles with their chosen title rather than "Power Hungry Schmucks" - it only makes sense to change this. I support "Movement against neoliberal globalization." Admiralblur 22:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still think this is a bad idea, and in particular I believe the title "Movement against neoliberal globalization" is a poor choice. First, the term "neoliberal" means approximately the opposite in the US as it does in the rest of the world. While I recognize the difference between European and American definitions of "liberal", many of my (admittedly ignorant) countrymen do not. Due to the persistent Ameri-centrism of Wikipedia, readers in any part of the world will be confused over whether it means a movement in opposition to left or right wing political and economic ideas. Second, it excludes any right-wing opposition to globalization, such as <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleoconservatism.html" title="Paleoconservatism">paleoconservatism</a>, which has some ideas in common with neoliberalism such as aspects of free-market capitalism. Third, the term "anti-globalization" is the most frequently used name for the movement in the sources for this page. I would accept a change to "movement against globalization", but since this is virtually identical to "anti-globalization", I wonder what good that would do.
