<p>A distinction between single-firm and multi-firm conduct is fundamental to the structure of U.S. antitrust law which, as noted antitrust scholar Phillip Areeda has pointed out "contains a 'basic distinction between concerted and independent action.'"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and "is judged more sternly."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> European competition law also includes a fundamental distinction between single-firm and multi-firm conduct, but a different analytical structure is applied.</p>
<p>In U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act addresses single-firm conduct by providing a remedy against "[e]very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several States."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> This prohibition does not condemn monopoly per se but only monopoly that has been acquired or maintained through prohibited conduct:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Most businessmen don't like their competitors, or for that matter competition. They want to make as much money as possible and getting a monopoly is one way of making a lot of money. That is fine, however, so long as they do not use methods calculated to make consumers worse off in the long run.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With regard to multi-firm conduct, the Sherman Act addresses this by prohibiting "[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Conduct falls within the scope of this prohibition only if some form of agreement or concerted action can be proven.</p>
<p>In considering multi-firm conduct, another distinction is also fundamental: the distinction between conduct that is deemed anticompetitive per se and conduct that may be found to be anticompetitive after a reasoned analysis. There does not appear to be a precedent for per se condemnation of single-firm conduct. Monopoly power alone, without some act of wrongful exclusion or other legally cognizable anticompetitive conduct is not prohibited. To the contrary, as the respected jurist Learned Hand noted, "[t]he successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned on when he wins."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> U.S. antitrust law thus does not attack monopoly power obtained through "superior skill, foresight and industry."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the prohibition on where agreements "in restraint of trade," it is not enough to show that an agreement in some technical way restrains trade. Under U.S. law, at least, the scope of the prohibition is limited to agreements where the restraint of trade is unreasonable:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Only obviously anticompetitive conduct such as overt price fixing is placed into this category of conduct so clearly detrimental to competition that detailed analysis is unnecessary. Otherwise, antitrust plaintiffs are required to demonstrate, by "the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied," the nature of the challenged conduct and why it is harmful to competition.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The following types of activity are often subject to antitrust scrutiny.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/d/Bid_rigging.html" title="Bid rigging">Bid rigging</a> - A form of price fixing and market allocation, and involves an agreement in which one party of a group of bidders will be designated to win the bid</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_fixing.html" title="Price fixing">Price fixing</a> - An agreement between business competitors selling the same product or service regarding its pricing</li>
<li>Geographic market allocation - An agreement between competitors not to compete within each other's geographic territories.</li>
<li>Walker Process fraud - Illegal monopolization through the maintenance and enforcement of a patent obtained via fraud on the Patent Office (the term comes from the Supreme Court case Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172 (1965).</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Edit section: Consumer protection">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consumer protection</span></h2>
<p>Consumer protection laws seek to regulate certain aspects of the commercial relationship between <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer.html" title="Consumer">consumers</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a>, such as by requiring minimum standards of product quality, requiring the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disclosure.html" title="Disclosure">disclosure</a> of certain details about a product or service (e.g., with regard to cost, or <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implied_warranty.html" title="Implied warranty">implied warranties</a>), or prescribing financial compensation for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_liability.html" title="Product liability">product liability</a>. Consumer protection laws are distinct from antitrust. Some consumer protection laws are enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which also has antitrust responsibilities. However, many competition agencies -- including the Justice Department antitrust division and the European Commission Directorate General for competition -- lack authority over consumer protection.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Edit section: Rationale">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rationale</span></h2>
<p>Antitrust laws prohibit agreements in restraint of trade, monopolization and attempted monopolization, anticompetitive mergers and tie-in schemes, and, in some circumstances, price discrimination in the sale of commodities.</p>
<p>Efficiency-oriented economists reject the goal of competition and instead argue that antitrust legislation should be changed to primarily benefit consumers. No Congress or administration has supported this position. These economists largely ignore the political issues that motivated the laws in the first place.</p>
<p>Anticompetitive agreements among competitors, such as price fixing and customer and market allocation agreements, are typical types of restraints of trade proscribed by the antitrust laws. These type of conspiracies are considered pernicious to competition and are generally proscribed outright by the antitrust laws. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resale_price_maintenance.html" title="Resale price maintenance">Resale price maintenance</a> by manufacturers is another form of agreement in restraint of trade. Other agreements that may have an impact on competition are generally evaluated using a balancing test, under which legality depends on the overall effect of the agreement.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopolization.html" title="Monopolization">Monopolization</a> and attempted monopolization are offenses that may be committed by an individual firm, even without an agreement with any other enterprise. Unreasonable exclusionary practices that serve to entrench or create monopoly power can therefore be unlawful. Allegations of predatory pricing by large companies can be the basis for a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopolization.html" title="Monopolization">monopolization</a> claim, but it is difficult to establish the required elements of proof. Large companies with huge cash reserves and large lines of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_%28finance%29.html" title="Credit (finance)">credit</a> can stifle competition by engaging in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predatory_pricing.html" title="Predatory pricing">predatory pricing</a>; that is, by selling their products and services at a loss for a time, in order to force their smaller competitors out of business. With no competition, they are then free to consolidate control of the industry and charge whatever prices they wish. At this point, there is also little motivation for investing in further <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technological</a> research, since there are no competitors left to gain an advantage over.</p>
<p>High <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barriers_to_entry.html" title="Barriers to entry">barriers to entry</a> such as large upfront investment, notably named <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunk_costs.html" title="Sunk costs">sunk costs</a>, requirements in infrastructure and exclusive agreements with distributors, customers, and wholesalers ensure that it will be difficult for any new competitors to enter the market, and that if any do, the trust will have ample advance warning and time in which to either buy the competitor out, or engage in its own research and return to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predatory_pricing.html" title="Predatory pricing">predatory pricing</a> long enough to force the competitor out of business.</p>
<p>From an <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a> perspective, the relatively recent <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_organization.html" title="Industrial organization">industrial organization</a> research has focused on construction of microeconomic models that predict and/or explain the prevalence of imperfectly competitive markets and deviations from competitive behavior, partly as a response to the criticisms of antitrust laws and policies by the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_School_%28economics%29_8db1.html" title="Chicago School (economics)">Chicago School</a> and by members of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_and_economics.html" title="Law and economics">law and economics</a> school of thought.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>There are 2 main kinds of monopolies: <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure_monopoly.html" title="De jure monopoly">de jure monoplies</a>, which are those that are protected from competition by government actions and <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto_monopoly.html" title="De facto monopoly">de facto monopolies</a> which are not protected by law from competition and are simply the only supplier of a good or service. Advocates of laissez-faire capitalism advocate that the only type of monopoly that should be broken up is a <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_monopoly.html" title="Coercive monopoly">coercive monopoly</a>, which is the persistent, exclusive control of a vitally needed resource, good, or service such that the community is at the mercy of the controller. There are no suppliers of the same or substitute goods to which the consumer can turn. In such a monopoly, the monopolist is able to make pricing and production decisions without an eye on competitive market forces and is able to curtail production to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_gouge.html" title="Price gouge">price gouge</a> consumers. Laissez-faire advocates argue that such a monopoly can only come about through the use of physical coercion or fraudulent means by the corporation or by government intervention and that there is no case of a coercive monopoly ever existing that was not the result of projectionist intervention.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">Free market</a> economist <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Friedman_66cc.html" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> states that he initially agreed with the underlying principles of antitrust laws (breaking up <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopolies</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oligopoly.html" title="Oligopoly">oligopolies</a> and promoting more competition), but came to the conclusion that they do more harm than good.<sup id="_ref-friedman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friedman" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics also argue that the empirical evidence shows that "predatory pricing" does not work in practice, and is better defeated by a truly <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> than by anti-trust laws (see <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predatory_pricing.html#Criticism" title="Predatory pricing">Criticism of the theory of predatory pricing</a>).</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Sowell_4946.html" title="Thomas Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a> argues that even if a superior business drives out a competitor, it doesn't follow that competition has ended:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In short, the financial demise of a competitor is not the same as getting rid of competition. The courts have long paid lip service to the distinction that economists make between competition — a set of economic conditions — and existing competitors, though it is hard to see how much difference that has made in judicial decisions. Too often, it seems, if you have hurt competitors, then you have hurt competition, as far as the judges are concerned.<sup id="_ref-www.forbes.com.546_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-www.forbes.com.546" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> argues that the very existence of antitrust laws discourages businessmen from some activities that might be socially useful out of fear that their business actions will be determined illegal and dismantled by government. In his essay entitled <i>Antitrust</i>, he says: "No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible." Those, like Greenspan, who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results --low prices. As long as a monopoly is not a <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_monopoly.html" title="Coercive monopoly">coercive monopoly</a> where a firm is securely insulated from <i>potential</i> competition, it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising. Hence, legal action is uncalled for, and wrongly harms the firm and consumers.<sup id="_ref-www.polyconomics.com.547_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-www.polyconomics.com.547" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Proponents of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_school_%28economics%29.html" title="Chicago school (economics)">Chicago school of economics</a> are generally suspicious (and critical) of government intervention in the economy, including antitrust laws and competition policies. Judge <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bork_b6b7.html" title="Robert Bork">Robert Bork</a>'s writings on antitrust law, along with those of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Posner_6ca9.html" title="Richard Posner">Richard Posner</a> and other <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_and_economics.html" title="Law and economics">law and economics</a> thinkers, were heavily influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Thomas DiLorenzo found that the "trusts" of the late 19th century were dropping their prices faster than the rest of the economy, and holds that they were not monopolists at all.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>The antitrust laws comprise what the Supreme Court calls a "charter of freedom," designed to protect the core republican values regarding free enterprise in America. The main goal was never to protect consumers, but to prohibit the use of power to control the marketplace. Although "trust" had a technical legal meaning, the word was commonly used to denote big business, especially a large, growing manufacturing conglomerate of the sort that suddenly emerged in great numbers in the 1880s and 1890s. Indeed, at this time hundreds of small short-line railroads were being bought up and consolidated into giant systems. (Separate laws and policies emerged regarding railroads and financial concerns such as banks and insurance companies.) Republicanism required free competition and the opportunity for Americans to build their own businesses without being forced to sell out to an economic colossus. As Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sherman_%28politician%29_b87f.html" title="John Sherman (politician)">John Sherman</a> put it, "If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life." The <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_5918.html" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> passed Congress almost unanimously in 1890 and remains the core of antitrust policy. The Act makes it illegal to try to restrain trade, or to form a monopoly. It gives the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Justice_619c.html" title="United States Department of Justice">Justice Department</a> the mandate to go to federal court for orders to stop illegal behavior or to impose remedies.</p>
<p>Business consolidation roared along in the 1890s and 1900s. As a result the Progressive Era put anti-trust high on the agenda. President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, while <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard_Taft_3129.html" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a> sued 75. In 1902, Roosevelt stopped the formation of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Securities_Company_ab7f.html" title="Northern Securities Company">Northern Securities Company</a> which threatened to monopolize transportation in the northwest.</p>
<p>The most notorious of the trusts was the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Oil_06fa.html" title="Standard Oil">Standard Oil Company</a>; <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Rockefeller_a11c.html" title="John D. Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a> in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, although in fact he always had nominal competition. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900-1904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act. It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon and now <a href="../../../e/x/x/ExxonMobil_c2ab.html" title="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a>), Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco), Standard Oil Company of New York (Mobil, again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California (Chevron), and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the "rule of reason": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil, and the courts are to make that decision (not the executive branch). To be harmful a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors.</p>
<p>Roosevelt for his part distinguished between "good trusts" and bad ones allegedly on the basis of their contribution to the economy. Such arbitrariness gives business leaders reason to believe that they will be prosecuted if they do not cultivate political support for their business.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Steel_9b0e.html" title="U.S. Steel">United States Steel Corporation</a>, which was much larger than Standard Oil, won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did. In fact it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition and so contending that it was one of the "good trusts" that benefitted the economy is somewhat doubtful. Likewise <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Harvester_f979.html" title="International Harvester">International Harvester</a> survived its court test, while other trusts were broken up in tobacco, meatpacking, and bathtub fixtures. Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison.</p>
<p>One problem under the Sherman Act was that businessmen did not know what was allowed or not. Therefore in 1914 Congress passed the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton_Act_2d38.html" title="Clayton Act">Clayton Act</a> which prohibited specific business actions (such as price discrimination, tie-in sales, exclusive dealership agreements, mergers, acquisitions, and interlocking corporate directorships) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Trade_Commission_eba7.html" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to "consent decrees" which provided an alternative mechanism to police anti-trust. However the law is still very unclear. For instance there is no clear definition of what constitutes a "market". In the words of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel_Paterson_67a6.html" title="Isabel Paterson">Isabel Paterson</a> "As freak legislation, the antitrust laws stand alone. Nobody knows what it is they forbid.".</p>
<p>America adjusted to bigness after 1910. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a> dominated auto manufacturing, but he built millions of cheap cars that put America on wheels, and at the same time lowered prices, raised wages, and promoted efficiency. Ford became as much of a popular hero as Rockefeller had been a villain. Welfare capitalism made large companies an attractive place to work; new career paths opened up in middle management; local suppliers discovered that big corporations were big purchasers. Talk of trust busting faded away. In the 1920s and 1930s the threat to the free enterprise system seemed to come from unrestricted <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutthroat_competition.html" title="Cutthroat competition">cutthroat competition</a>, which drove down prices and profits and made for inefficiency. Under the leadership of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, the government in the 1920s promoted business cooperation, fostered the creation of self-policing trade associations, and made the FTC an ally of respectable business. This reduced competition and may have helped lead to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. During the New Deal, likewise, attempts were made to stop <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutthroat_competition.html" title="Cutthroat competition">cutthroat competition</a>, attempts which appeared very similar to cartelisation which would be illegal under antitrust laws if attempted by someone other than government. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Recovery_Act_feb8.html" title="National Recovery Act">National Recovery Act</a> (NRA) was a short-lived program in 1933-35 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robinson-Patman_Act_01ec.html" title="Robinson-Patman Act">Robinson-Patman Act</a> of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business the New Deal policy makers preferred federal and state regulation-- controlling the rates and telephone services provided by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (<a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_b74e.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>), for example--and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.</p>
<p>By the 1970s fears of "cutthroat" competition had been displaced by confidence that a fully competitive marketplace produced fair returns to everyone. The fear was that monopoly made for higher prices, less production, inefficiency and less prosperity for all. As unions faded in strength, the government paid much more attention to the damages that unfair competition could cause to consumers, especially in terms of higher prices, poorer service, and restricted choice. However there is no evidence that antitrust prosecutions were or are dictated by the damage to consumers. It is not the policy of the antitrust division to estimate the damage to consumers and then prioritise prosecutions on the basis of that damage. In 1982 the Reagan administration used the Sherman Act to break up <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_b74e.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a> into one long-distance company and seven regional "Baby Bells," arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold, so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market. In 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. A highly publicized trial found that Microsoft had strong-armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netscape.html" title="Netscape">Netscape</a> browser. In 2000 the trial court ordered Microsoft split in two to punish it, and prevent it from future misbehavior. In his defense, CEO <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> argued that Microsoft always worked on behalf of the consumer, and that splitting the company would diminish efficiency and slow the pace of software development.</p>
