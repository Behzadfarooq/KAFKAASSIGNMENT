	    <p>Anyway, I cleared the talk page and put it in the Archive above since it was getting pretty lengthy. I also wish to personalize my User page as many people have been doing. I am unfortunately, a bit ignorant as to how to do that. If anyone can give me a pointer or even add something on here that would make it look, for lack of a better word, "pretty", please do so!</p>

<p>Hello. Good work on <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Rasiowa_903c.html" title="Helena Rasiowa">Helena Rasiowa</a>, and thanks for the contribution. However, you did not provide any <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references or sources</a> in the article. Keeping Wikipedia accurate and verifiable is very important, and as you might be aware there is currently a push to encourage editors to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite the sources</a> they used when adding content. Can you list in the article any websites, books, or other sources that will allow people to verify the content in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Rasiowa_903c.html" title="Helena Rasiowa">Helena Rasiowa</a>? You can simply add links, preferably as <a href="../../../i/n/l/Wikipedia%7EInline_citation_3e13.html" title="Wikipedia:Inline citation">inline citations</a>, or see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITET_7f44.html" title="WP:CITET">citation templates</a> for different citation methods.

<dd>Tnx. If you used any of those sites as references, please include them in a 'References' section. 'See also' are for related articles on Wikipedia, while 'external links' are for related sites off-Wiki, which were NOT used as references (just like 'Further reading' is for offline sources that may be relevant but were not used by article creators). It may be confusing at first, but should become clear after you try it a few times. Tnx again, --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 21:37, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You'll notice I reverted your edit. Firstly, Ukraine was simply a part of Russia in T's day, not a separate nation as it is now. So even if he had strong Ukrainian links (which I hotly dispute), he would still have been considered Russian. But I've never read anything to suggest that T had any knowledge of the Ukrainian language, culture or people. Some of his forbears may have come from that part of Russia - although his father certainly didn't and his mother was of French extraction - but he was born in Russia, as a Russian, speaking Russian, identifying as Russian in all respects. That makes him Russian and nothing but Russian, in my book. It may be OK to state that he had some Ukrainian ancestors, and French (d'Assier), and German (Keiser), but to assert that he was, even in part, <b>a Ukrainian composer</b> is just wrong. I'll stand corrected if you can produce some documentary evidence for your claim. Cheers and Merry Xmas. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 05:16, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I've noticed that you are in the process of verifying residents of this list and posting your findings on the talk page. That is laudable, but it would be even better if you could add footnotes and references for inventors that you have proven to deserve inclusion on the list. It is essential to have proven verification for every person on the list, otherwise new editors will essentially repeat the steps you are already taking. It will also act as a guide for future contributors. Thanks very much. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Antidote. Thanks for the comment.</p>
<p>I hate lists generally. I think that they are particularly bad when on a controversial topic, and I for one think that <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">jew</a> is a controversial topic, not only because of their persecution over such things as the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> and then with such hugely controversial things as the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>-<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> conflict, but also because of their definition of what is a Jew, which includes <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural.html" title="Cultural">cultural</a> issues. Its just too controversial. African American is much the same. It is not remotely clearly defined, and I think that there's too much hostility with these lists.</p>
<p>That being said, I don't care too much about it, so I don't really want to edit these things anymore. I am getting stalked in relation to this stuff, so that's about all that I want to do with it. My only interest in this was to right an injustice and to give advice to help newbies in trouble. That's enough for me. I am sorry, but I don't want to get involved with it anymore. Its just too distressing for me. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:18, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. I would not vote. I am sorry. I was very reluctant to get involved in this to begin with. I think that everyone involved should work towards working together, not apart. But I am not convinced that this is possible over such a controversial topic. If its clearly defined, make it a category, which would be much less controversial because then the issue is with individual articles, and we can handle it case by case. If its not clearly defined, then no list. But look I really don't want to get involved. Sorry. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:24, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The vast majority of lists I've seen in AFDs have been deleted. The prevailing attitude is that they shouldn't exist. "listcruft" is often used.

<p>Hi. Yes, there has been much controversy over Jewish lists because a group of users were having problems with <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and listmania with them. I've been attempting to reform them and found myself with accusations such as those presented there which have usually been misinterpreted (sometimes purposely so) to make it seem as vandalism etc. I have asked that no other people on Wikipedia I know vote in any of my afds to resolve possible accusation of double voting. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 09:39, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK. Ironically, that seemed to have happened with <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">user:RachelBrown</a> as well. Incidents like that highlight the problems with using only the IP address as evidence in a dispute. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 09:55, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I'll renomominate it, to settle this matter once and for all. Now the list is completely redundant. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 10:02, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list actually was a list of Jewish heads of universities, which was even more scary. And only Jewish heads of prominent universities. I spotted it on newpages patrol, and marked it for deletion straight away. It didn't exist for long ... <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 10:33, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is with the obsession with lists of Jews? According to the definitions of Jews listed on wikipedia, it would make just as much sense to have a list of Australian musicians of third-generation Italian descent. <a href="../../../b/e/a/Wp%7Ebeans.html" title="Wp:beans">Wp:beans</a> seems to apply here though. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 10:47, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! I finished my translation of the article about Alas from Serbian Wikipedia. Now you could go through it, and fix the grammar. When you read the article, you may find that it lacks data about his scientific work. While I was translating the article, I talked over IRC with the guy who wrote it (he is a collegue of mine from the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade). We agreed that for the foreign reader, this info (scientific work) would be more interesting, than his extensive biography, that existed in Serbian language article. Serbian article is written in this fashion because Alas is well known in Serbia, not only as a mathematician, but as prominent public figure as well, and most Serbian readers are more interested in reading about his life, than about differential equations&#160;:]. We agreed, however, that this article needs to be expanded with more info about Alas's work. When we find time, someone of us will do some research, and add this info. -- <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 02:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the list of artists is too long, I agree. We can have some other list, not of painters. Maybe sculptors or a more general list of artists. I can select them as soon as I stop waisting time on the fruitless discussions about people who are not Poles by any streach. As to the Germans. How about a compromise? People like Farenheit whose parents simply immigrated to Poland because for many reasons they considered living in Poland better than in Germany, will stay on the list. It was their own decision to move here. People whose parents moved to Poland when it was occupied, means they moved here thinking of the towns as of new German territory, can be listed on a list Germans born on German occupied Polish territory.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 19:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We may write that Farenheit had German parents. No problem. As well as we may write that Hevelius's parents were Czech if I remember correctly. As to the list of artists, that's exactly what I though. Maybe I wasn't clear. The list of painters is ok. The general list of Poles should include only the most famous people. In all the cathegories artists included.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 21:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello, Antidoe, I'm sorry for having protected the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ukrainians_8b3f.html" title="List of Ukrainians">list of Ukrainians</a> in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">the wrong version</a> twice. I know that this must be very annoying for you, even if you are acting in good faith and I believe you are (despite what has been said about you). I still think that you should make the duplicate article - those who oppose it will have little reason to feel disgruntled and will just have to explain their reasons for doing so. If they can't (or won't), then I will unprotect the page ASAP. I would revert the page to your version, except I am not allowed to: <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol</a>. Let's hope that Pecher co-operates, and if he doesn't, then I'd recommend and RfC on the subject. I'm sure that Pecher is acting out of good faith, but these disputes always create bitter feelings on both sides. We're hoping something can be worked out.

<dd>It makes a very big difference because if Sylwia's version of the introduction stays, then those with Polish family names get deleted. So you want to stay neutral?

<li>Hi, Antidote. You can see Alas photo (1905. year, public domain) on commons. Name of picture is Mihailo_Petrovic.jpg. If you wish, in future I can write somethig about other serbian mathematics (for example Bogdan Gavrilović, Đuro Kurepa, Dragoslav Mitrinović, Nikolaj Saltikov, Anton Bilimović etc.) in Serbian, and Goran can translate it in english. In this time we have nice biography of Dimitrije Nešić (<a href="../../../../sr/%D0%B4/%D0%B8/%D0%BC/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_%D0%9D%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%9B_bc17.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Димитрије_Нешић">sr:Димитрије Нешић</a>) in serbian.

<p>i find it appauling that you would revert my work on statistics for the scottish people page...first of all...the figures you reverted back to have no statistical merit whatsoever....how there be 5 million people in Scotland and another 5 million in the United Kingdom when there are no sources that ever showed that...the Census didn't even show a figure close to that...granted there may be many in the rest of the UK (england, wales etc) that may have Scottish roots but this has not been shown in the census...second Australia have not declared itself to have 5 million Aussies of Scottish descent...according to the Census of 2001, the largest reported ancestries were Australia 6.4 million, English 6.4 million and Irish 1.9 million...Scottish came hovering around the 0.5 million mark (500,000)....don't believe me...check the Australian Bureau of Statistics...and look under Census Ancestry results...there have been no reports to suggest that there are 1 million people in Brazil of Scottish background....actually most of that was copied from an earlier version of the Irish people page...and I was told to have them removed if I can not give sources....give wikipedia some more credibility and for now stick to using sources and less estimation from thin air70.30.71.252 01:19, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

The main problem is that both Croatian and Serbian factions claim him, and his detaled heritage comes only from Serbian nationalist sources. I don't see that Elephantus' personal opinions are relevant enough to remove him from the picture, as the discussion was held at his talk page; and confirmed his Serbian identity at <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoy_6ed4.html" title="User talk:Joy">User_talk:Joy</a> long ago.

<p>I think you got the list wrong in the photo grouping. You currently have it as Amundsen, Bjerknes, Ingstad, St. Olav. I think you actually have two pictures of Amundsen in there unless the first one is Ingstad. I know for sure the third one is Amundsen and obviously the last one is St. Olav.

<p>Hi, someone pointed this image out to me because it's somewhat "dodgy" fair use. Just to sum up the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's tagged as {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBookcover_74f4.html" title="Template:Bookcover">bookcover</a>}}, but it doesn't say from what book. The source given is not much help because it doesn't show the image used in any context and it doesn't give any info on who actualy own the copyright.</li>
<li>One of the key points of the fair use doctrine (as we apply it) is to use <b>low-resolution</b> images. While this image is fairly big (yeah I know "low resolution" is relative, but 1846x2049 is a tad over your average "web resolution").</li>
<li>Asuming it <i>is</i> a bookcover we are only supposed to use it to ilustrate the book in question (says so right on the tag).</li>
</ul>
<p>So to sum up. If it is a bookcover it can't rely be used in the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> article, not unless there is at least some commentary on the book itself in the article. If it's just a painting that happened to be included in a book somewhere it can be used a bit more freely (but still only for "critical commentary", and not merely decoration), but then it should use the {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|Slavic peoples}} tag (and a fair use rationale). However it will need some source info (as in how painted it, just pointing to a file in a directory listing isn't rely all that helpfull). And in either case the image should probably be reduced somewhat in size. I won't claim to be an expert on this, but this is my understanding on how fair use (is supposed to) work, if you have any spesific questions <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a> might be a good place to ask. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 14:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I apologize for revising the established images for <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainians.html" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>. I felt that John Paul II would be a nice addition to the Polish compilation since many consider him a famous Pole. I didn't mean to make a political statement or anything by swapping Sergey Korolyov with Yushchenko. I only added him because of how well he is recognized here in the West. I didn't mean to offend anyone. I restored the Ukrainian image (I meant to do it once, but I accidentally did it twice).

<p>I don't think it is feesable to include only proven figures from census in the template. In some cases no such figures are available.

<dd>Hi Antidote. I'm sorry I didn't consult anyone. I didn't think anyone would mind. I deleted the red links for several reasons. I was working on the German Americans page for 3 days straight adding the occupations and what people were famous for next to their red link names for oganization. I didn't want to delete them for the specific purpose that you mentioned. Many people came to the agreement on that page that it would be in our best interest if we deleted the red links to shorten the page. Therefore I didn't think anyone would mind on Czech and Poles to do the same thing considering its a low traffic page. Also I feel the red links make the articles excruciatingly long. That is why I waited a week or two before I did it. I noticed people werent filling up the red links so I just went along and did it. Also the people usually with red links are not as influential as people with full pages otherwise they would have had a page. I feel that a lot of time it's just names on the page which make the article super long and end up turning people away. For sports there seem to be ten thousand red link baseball players without pages. Even with the removal of all the red links the list is still pretty big. I don't know if it's necessary to name every single Polish professional baseball player. Do you see what I mean? Also a few red links I didn't delete. For inventions I left all the red links because if they invented something I figured time would fill those guys in along with others like "Olympic gold metalist" etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it would be beneficial to keep the most influential people on the lists. Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Quote:<b>However, once the red links are filled up, it is absolutely necessary to prune the lists to only include the most famous representatives.</b> End quote</p>
<p>Yeah I agree with everything you said. I just think it would be beneficial to delete the less famous people first to save time for everyone. I was monitoring the czech and poles pages for a while and noticed that not many people have been filling up the red links. I like your idea of moving all the red links together at the bottom of the page. I dont think people would mind even if it is against wiki policy. That may be an incentive for people to get them filled up. Up to you though I think we should still prune it a bit to make life easier around here. Also by deleting the links I would hope for it to encourage people to make a page for the individual immediately when they decide to add them on wiki. Anyways you have my support.</p>

<li>I would say the deletion on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Czechs_bbc2.html" title="List of Czechs">List of Czechs</a> was quite stop on. Most of the names are not much known and the list is not list of everyone.

<dd>All the people on the list should be real and at least bit known - the list is watched over. The times when the list was short and every new biography was automatically added here (I did it too) are over, though. I am in favor of radical cleanup and adding links to relevant categories to the end of each sublist to replace the deleted names. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 02:23, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would do the cleanup myself but I am too short on time. I tried to engage others but apparently they are not better in this regard.

<dd>Well, you you will prune the list down, more power to you.

<p>Привет! Я немного понимаю по русский - плохо говорю. ... just realized how you got to read cyrillic... If you're interested in that, just few short notes that will make it a lot easier for you:</p>
<p>Serbian does not have "dual sound" letters such as Я, Е, Ю, and Ё - all have exactly one sound. No мяакий/твёрдий знак either. Мяакий got fused with the letters it applies to. For example, НЬ is Њ and ЛЬ is Љ. Serbian "Е" does not have the "Й" at the beginning of a russian one - just the second half of it. Simple map of differences:</p>
<p>Vowels and Ј:</p>
<ul>
<li>О - always pronouced as "О", never as "А"</li>
<li>Е - does not have the "Й" at the beginning</li>
<li>И - does not have the "Й" at the beginning, as "ee" in English</li>
<li>Ј - Russian "Й"</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Fusion of мяакий знак&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Љ - ЛЬ</li>
<li>Њ - НЬ</li>
<li>Ћ - ЧЬ</li>
<li>Ђ - ДЬ</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Џ - ДЖ pronounced as a single sound, like "G" in "George" but harder.</li>
<li>Х - Serbian sound is slightly softer than Russian</li>
<li>Serbian does not exactly have Щ, Ы, ТЬ and other softened letters although we can pronounce it. This is why russian generally seems almost as "soft, nice, gentle, baby talk spoken strongly" to Serbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 11% for major edits and 34% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 88 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<dd>About Austrians/Jews/Germans: I do not agree. The list should contain people who had made significant cultural contribution to the Czech lands, regardless of ethnicity associated to them today. The term "Czech" had different meanings over time. The current meaning - a person speaking Slavic language - had crystallized some 150 years ago, before it was term used for all inhabitants of Czech Kingdom. The term Czech Germans (or Bohemian Germans) was commonly used until 1920s-30s.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I my pruning I remove only people who didn't spend time in Czech lands or didn't have much of influence there (some post-WWII emigrants are exception). Defining by ethicity is somehow reliable only during 20th century, before it was usually unknown issue. Classifying someone as Jew is also questionable - before WWII they often defined themselves in terms of German culture, those surviving accomodated Czech culture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Question of ethnicity is quite complex in the area of Czech lands. Geographical criterium is clear and beyond disputes and IMHO most useful. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:52, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The were not Austrians/Germans in current sense. They (like Mendel) were born in Czech Kingdom which had two nations (Czech Germans/Cesti Nemci/Boemische Deutsche + Czechs/Cesi/Tschechische) and two official languages (after half of 18th century). Mendel spend his life in Moravia, Freud did not and until 1920s is was not much known here.

<dd>American-born Czech is rather strange creature - the relation to Czech lands/language dissapears in first or second generation of emigrants into US. Currently, there are only few small and dying organisations of people in the US who regard themselves as Czechs (or American-Czechs). I do not consider nostalgic searching for ancestor's roots as reason for "czechness" (and I do consider neither Czech sounding name). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 00:36, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 1.2 million of US Czechs is taken out of blue sky. Unlike, say Poles, the pre-war and post-war emigrants had little or no connection with Czechoslovakia (also because of disinterest or outright hostility from Czechoslovakian side) and felt no need to care about the "old fatherland". From time to time, journals here in the Czech Republic write about a gathering of Czechs in the US and it is something <i>so</i> exotic, almost unbelievable to exist. My guesstimate is that the number is much, much smaller and if it is 100,000 I would open my mouth wide.</dd>

Is there another meaning of <i>postcards</i> that should be mentioned on that disambig page that this reference should then point to? I changed a number of wikilinks last night from postcards to postcard where they used a lower-case 'p'. As several were from artist pages, it is quite possible I do not understand an art-world meaning of "postcards" that is not appropriate to change to "postcard".

It says:</p>
<ul>
<li>In US statistics from 1990 1,3 mil claim to be of Czech ancestry, 300,000 of <i>Czechoslovakian</i> ancestry.</li>
<li>Most of them don't know Czech language.</li>
<li>There are 166 organisations of "Czechs" in the US, most of them small and not connected with each other. In New York state with 80,000 people of Czech ancestry around 2,500 are somehow active.</li>
<li>Czech Republic occasionally gives a grants to some of these organisations, typically in $10,000 - $30,000 range, so their activities look rather limited.</li>

<p>The text mentions few names, of people who feels as Czechs (second and next generations), none has article in Wiki.</p>

Communities in Brazil and Argentina had dissapeared (I read about these people meeting regularly during 1950s, nothing about them later). There are smaller groups in South Africa and Western Europe but Czechs generally quickly assimilate (in language and culture), as did happen in say Austria - Vienna once hosted hundreths of thousands of Czech workers and was de-facto the largest "Czech" city (gone but few). Groups in former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia and Romania are either very small or moved back to the Czech Republic. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 02:04, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Yid. You've made some constructive contributions in category making, but as stated above categories like <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_and_songwriters_45eb.html" title="Category:Jewish composers and songwriters">Category:Jewish composers and songwriters</a> are slightly redundant (not to mention bulking up the subject article pages). My suggestion would be to move all composers into <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> and all songwriters/mainstream musicians into <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_musicians_e9d3.html" title="Category:Jewish musicians">Category:Jewish musicians</a>, then have <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_and_songwriters_45eb.html" title="Category:Jewish composers and songwriters">Category:Jewish composers and songwriters</a> either be speedily deleted or renamed into something else.

<dd>That's fine with me. I'm sorry for all the mess. However, most of the names are either on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> or <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_musicians_e9d3.html" title="Category:Jewish musicians">Category:Jewish musicians</a>. So I'll just look through each name, if it's not in the other category and remove it from Jewish composers and songwriters, and if it is just remove it from Jewish composers and songwriters. <a href="../../../y/i/d/User%7EYid613_c34c.html" title="User:Yid613">Yid613</a> 20:20, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Come to think of it, since the Jewish composers and songwriters will be deleted anyway, I'll just go through the list and add Category:Jewish classical musicians and Category:Jewish musicians to those who don't have it already, and tell you when I'm done. Will save a lot of work. Thanks. <a href="../../../y/i/d/User%7EYid613_c34c.html" title="User:Yid613">Yid613</a> 20:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nooo don't do that. The problem is that people who were really mainly songwriters or composers are also listed in the Classical musicians category. The solution is just to remove the songwriters and composers from the musicians category unless they really were also well known as a classical musician. Arniep 20:33, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't done anything, only looking through the category entries right now. But I think the three of us should work out what consensus solution we want before we do anything. <a href="../../../y/i/d/User%7EYid613_c34c.html" title="User:Yid613">Yid613</a> 20:50, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Idea A) Make a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_640e.html" title="Category:Jewish composers">Category:Jewish composers</a> and simply put all the composers in there. Then change the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> into only including classical musicians (violinists etc). As for songwriters...isn't a songwriter a musician? That would just go into <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_musicians_e9d3.html" title="Category:Jewish musicians">Category:Jewish musicians</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_and_songwriters_45eb.html" title="Category:Jewish composers and songwriters">Category:Jewish composers and songwriters</a> is a weird combination. Technically both Neil Diamond and Arnold Schoenberg belong in that category. How about just renaming <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_and_songwriters_45eb.html" title="Category:Jewish composers and songwriters">Category:Jewish composers and songwriters</a> to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_640e.html" title="Category:Jewish composers">Category:Jewish composers</a>???

<dd>Hey, sorry for the delay. I more or less agree with the proposal above. On one hand, the reason why I created the composers and songwriters category was because I saw that composers and performers were grouped together in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> and that there was a need to be more specific. On the other hand, it makes sense to say that people should not be in more than one of these categories but only the one to which they are most noted for or worked the most as. Since this is in encyclopedia, every subject that is worthy of an article has to have a certain level of significance, and for people such as musicians it means they have a certain level of accomplishment (feel free to correct this sentence if it is wrong). Therefore, a composer may have played an instrument, but if he is not known for that but rather for his work as a composer, there is no real reason to include him in both a composer category and a classical musicians category. I admit that the composer/songwriter combination is wierd. Granted, there are some people, such as George Gershwin, Kurt Weill, and Jerome Kern, who could be called both. But I have no problem with the above proposal to change the category to "Jewish composers" and have "Jewish classical musicians" have only performers. Thank you both for your patience on this. <a href="../../../y/i/d/User%7EYid613_c34c.html" title="User:Yid613">Yid613</a> 03:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi! Thanks for the source. I wouldn't say he was unimportant. I guess Czechs were particularly proud of his plays during the National Revival era, when there were very few plays and books in Czech. But from today's point of view, his position is the Czech literature is much lower. That's why I changed your sentence in the article into "a significant playwright (...) of the National Revival era," which is undoubtedly true. Anyway, thanks for the new article!

<p>Hi, I don't really understand your suggestion to merge these two as many many classical musicians are not composers or songwriters (although many songwriters and composers are known as musicians in their own right). Arniep 20:21, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not the one who created the template, but I've just searched for some reference in Czech sources. This is an example of what I've found:</dd>

<dd>Dear Antidote; There is no encylopaedic justification for calling these composers 'The Great Four'. The citation you give seems to be a 'one-off'(in English, certainly, but this is English Wikipedia). No musical dictionaries or journal seem to use this term. (It is not thus like the 'Kuchka', or 'Mighty Handful' used to describe the group of Russian composers including <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modest_Mussorgsky_fa84.html" title="Modest Mussorgsky">Modest Mussorgsky</a>). Moreover the use of this box without any explanation or justification in various articles gives the term a specious validation to which it is not entitled. Beacuse it serves no purpose, and because I am not the only one who feels so (see discussion page at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonin_Dvorak_ef64.html" title="Antonin Dvorak">Antonin Dvorak</a>), I have deleted it from the articles where it was posted. There is already a <a href="../../../c/z/e/Category%7ECzech_composers_dc8c.html" title="Category:Czech composers">Category:Czech composers</a>.--<a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmerus_1e2d.html" title="User:Smerus">Smerus</a> 08:04, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is ridiculous... so you'd leave him out of any painters and writers categorizing just because you don't want him in three different nationality categories? Initially he was only categorized as a Bulgarian (a clear one) and Serb (he also referred to 'our Serbian motherland'), but Bomac added him to the Macedonian categories due to his place of birth. What's wrong with him being in all three if he considered them a single one and worked for a united South Slavic culture, and he is also thought of as 'theirs' by all three peoples? He's shared by those nationalities as I see it, just like <a href="../../../g/o/c/Goce_Delchev_886c.html" title="Goce Delchev">Goce Delchev</a> is categorized as both a Bulgarian and a Macedonian revolutionary (although he never considered himself Macedonian in an ethnic sense, but <i>is regarded as one</i> in the Republic of Macedonia). <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 21:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not about making the decision, but presenting only the facts — deciding on his nationality when it's somewhat vague may be biased. Of course, it is unlikely he was an ethnic Serb; he was most likely Bulgarian in an ethnic sense and Macedonian in a regional sense. Not sure about putting him in the Macedonian categories, though — seems a bit anachronistic to call him a nationality that didn't exist, and almost certainly wrong when he's never ever referred to himself as a Macedonian. That means only the Bulgarian categories should stay, but I'd like to hear some other opinions since I may be biased (or accused of being biased).</dd>

<p>first of all, I asked for a reference, not a web url. Secondly, I grant you that many Austrians may have considered themselves "German" prior to WWII (not the Swiss though, for them, you'd have to go back to before 1500). That's irrelevant, because these infoboxes refer to the <i>present</i>, and not to some point in history. If you read the discussion, you will find that I (and others) question the utility of these ethno-infoboxes. I thus do not feel compelled to answer in which infobox the Swiss 'should be' included. I suppose in a <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_people.html" title="Swiss people">Swiss people</a> article? Of course Swiss German and French speakers form subgroups of those. Who says we need an infobox on every subgroup? Do we have an article on West Midlanders as an ethnic group? As that may be, I am still waiting for a <i>reference</i> categorizing Austrians (let alone Swiss or Dutch) as "Germans". "Germanic", or "West Germanic", yes. "German"? I don't think so. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:55, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would you please stop adding unreferenced nationalism to the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a> article. You are welcome to edit, but in case of the edits you're making references are required. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 17:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>you are welcome to propose a straw poll on talk. That would certainly be better than stubborn edit-warring. However, I am afraid we cannot vote on inserting <i>unsourced</i> information. Until you provide the source we've been asking you for, you do not have a case. Present a source, and we'll talk about how to present it. Re "revisionism", revisionism of <i>what</i>? Revisionism of 1930s German foreign policy? You'll be interested to learn that this has indeed been revised over the past 60 years. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, we can't let ourselves be thrown off historical accuracy. I will find refs which support the truthful, non-revisionist version of the article- then a vote wont be needed. Cheers. <a href="../../../u/l/r/User%7EUlritz_35ed.html" title="User:Ulritz">Ulritz</a> 15:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>great. I wish it wouldn't usually take weeks to impress the utility of citing references on your kind of editor, but I am glad we have reached the stage where you consider consulting a work of reference. Let us know how your research is going. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
