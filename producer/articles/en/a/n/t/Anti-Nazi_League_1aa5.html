<p>The <b>Anti-Nazi League</b> (ANL) was an organisation set up on the initiative of the Socialist Workers' Party with some sponsorship (and a few small financial donations) from some trade unions and the endorsement of a list of prominent people in 1977 to oppose the rise of what they deemed to be far-right groups in Britain. It was at its height between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. The initial sponsors included <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Hain_45c1.html" title="Peter Hain">Peter Hain</a> (a former Young Liberal leader; then the communications officer of the postal workers' union UCW, more recently <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Northern_Ireland_e940.html" title="Secretary of State for Northern Ireland">Secretary of State for Northern Ireland</a>), <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Roberts_d644.html" title="Ernie Roberts">Ernie Roberts</a> (deputy general secretary of the engineering union AUEW) and Paul Holborow (of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a> (SWP)).</p>
<p>Most of the ANL's activities in the 1970s were in opposition to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Front_%28UK%29_1189.html" title="National Front (UK)">National Front</a>, an organisation led by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyndall_%28politician%29_8d7b.html" title="John Tyndall (politician)">John Tyndall</a> who had a long history of involvement with openly fascist and Nazi groups. The ANL also campaigned against the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Movement_9c8c.html" title="British Movement">British Movement</a> which was a more openly Hitlerite grouping. The ANL was allowed to run down in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The organisation was revived in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> its main efforts have been to oppose the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a>, which denies that it is a Nazi Party (while retaining many of the policies and members from the fascist National Front plus newer far right ideologies such the "third position" adopted by many Italian fascists - with whom the BNP maintain regular contact). The organization was also critical of the government of Italian Prime Minister <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvio_Berlusconi_f762.html" title="Silvio Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>, which was an alliance of centre-right and far right political parties. It was merged into <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unite_Against_Fascism_c354.html" title="Unite Against Fascism">Unite Against Fascism</a> (another organisation which is essentially a vehicle for the Socialist Workers' Party) in 2004.</p>

<p>The ANL carried out leafleting and other campaigns against Far Right groups which it claimed were not just racist but fascist; see <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">BNP</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Front_1140.html" title="British National Front">British National Front</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>In its first period, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, the Anti-Nazi League was supposedly run by an elected committee nationally and similar committees throughout the country (although in practice many local and National ANL initiatives were launched directly by the SWP. Many <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> sponsored it as did the Indian Workers Association (then a large organisation), and many members of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> and MPs such as <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Kinnock_6f58.html" title="Neil Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a>.</p>
<p>The Anti-Nazi League was best known for the two giant Rock Against Racism carnivals of 1978: involving bands such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clash_8395.html" title="The Clash">The Clash</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stiff_Little_Fingers_3d7e.html" title="Stiff Little Fingers">Stiff Little Fingers</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_Pulse_57ad.html" title="Steel Pulse">Steel Pulse</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misty_in_Roots_e819.html" title="Misty in Roots">Misty in Roots</a>, <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-Ray_Specs_a7ba.html" title="X-Ray Specs">X-Ray Specs</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Robinson_6c38.html" title="Tom Robinson">Tom Robinson</a>, they saw 80,000 and then 100,000 people come mainly for the music.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> with the eclipse of the National Front and collapse of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Movement_9c8c.html" title="British Movement">British Movement</a> the initial incarnation of the ANL was wound up.</p>
<p>Some elements within the ANL opposed the winding up of the organisation especially those described by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a> as <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadists.html" title="Squadists">Squadists</a>. After being expelled from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a> some of these elements formed <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Action_a02b.html" title="Red Action">Red Action</a> and with others organised <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Fascist_Action_b419.html" title="Anti-Fascist Action">Anti-Fascist Action</a>, who had a much more open view to using violence to intimidate groups and individuals they subjectively deemed 'fascist.'</p>

<p>In 2004 the ANL affiliated with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unite_Against_Fascism_c354.html" title="Unite Against Fascism">Unite Against Fascism</a> group alongside other groups such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Assembly_Against_Racism_d1a1.html" title="National Assembly Against Racism">National Assembly Against Racism</a>.</p>

<p>In April <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, an ANL member, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_Peach_714d.html" title="Blair Peach">Blair Peach</a>, was killed following a demonstration at Southall against a National Front election meeting.</p>
<p>As the ANL counter-demonstration was dissolving, members of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Police_13e1.html" title="Metropolitan Police">Metropolitan Police</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Patrol_Group_2e83.html" title="Special Patrol Group">Special Patrol Group</a> charged a section of the protestors leaving the area, among them Blair Peach, who received a blow to the head. The Anti-Nazi League alleged that this was from a police truncheon but this has never been proved. During the investigation into Peach's death, various illegal articles were found in the lockers of the SPG unit concerned, including weighted truncheons.</p>
<p>An <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquest.html" title="Inquest">inquest</a> <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury.html" title="Jury">jury</a> later returned a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdict.html" title="Verdict">verdict</a> of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misadventure.html" title="Misadventure">misadventure</a>, and Blair Peach remains a symbolic figurehead for the ANL.

<p>Dozens of <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> MPs are members of the ANL and many like <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Hain_45c1.html" title="Peter Hain">Peter Hain</a> have been members for many years.

<p>The ANL has latterly faced four main challenges to its campaigning: the attempts of the far-right to ditch their image of fascist or racist politics; criticism of its demands for the suppression or censorship of far-right groups; criticisms of its populist or popular front orientation; and criticisms of its relationship with the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Edit section: Denials of Fascism and Racism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Denials of Fascism and Racism</span></h3>
<p>When the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Front_1140.html" title="British National Front">National Front</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> were led by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyndall_%28politician%29_8d7b.html" title="John Tyndall (politician)">John Tyndall</a>, his record of involvement in openly Neo-Nazi groups made it far easier to assert that the National Front and BNP were <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazi</a> in nature. Similarly, his convictions for violence and incitement to racial hatred provide ample grounds for claiming both organisations were <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a>.</p>
<p>Latterly, with the death of Tyndall, and the decline of the National Front, the BNP has sought to claim that it is neither fascist nor racist, and that it opposes Government policy on issues such as immigration and multiculturalism, rather than members of ethnic minorities themselves. This has been part of a broader attempt by the Far-right to cultivate an image of moderation and respectability, so that it is harder for anti-fascists to charge them with racism, and the BNP has gone as far as to claim support from within the black and Asian communities, and to seek to select an Asian candidate for the 2005 local elections.</p>
<p>The ANL and other anti fascists argue that the BNP remains a Nazi party irrespective of the fact that it has adopted what the ANL describes as the 'Dual Strategy' of cultivating respectability in the media while retaining a cadre of committed fascists. This position is countered by BNP members who claim that their party has is increasingly democratic in its nature. Recent journalistic investigation by the left-wing Guardian newspaper has however sought to support the ANL's view that the BNP remains a racist party<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,,1977445,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,,1977445,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Edit section: Freedom of speech">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Freedom of speech</span></h3>
<p>Critics of the ANL (including people opposed to the far right) claim that its "No Platform for Nazis" policy and call for far right parties to be "shut down" amounts to denying the democratic rights to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_association.html" title="Freedom of association">freedom of association</a>. For some, this reflects the fact that freedom of speech is either universal or non-existent; others take the more nuanced position that this reflects the greater protection to be accorded to those sub-sets of freedom of speech and association which deliver 'democracy' (so political speech would attract greater protection than forms of speech, such as pornography, which do not contribute to democracy). This view point accords with those anti-fascists who believe that the best way to defeat the far right is by debate rather than censorship, which they say is both ineffective and hypocritical. Relatedly, the ANL has been subject to the more pragmatic criticism that its constant calls for groups like the BNP to be banned will allow the far right to portray themselves as victims of censorship, and the anti-fascist movement as intolerant and undemocratic.</p>
<p>The ANL response to this criticism derives from the argument that, because fascist groups ultimately seek to curtail democracy and suppress democratic rights (even if they initially seek to obtain power through democratic means), the curtailment of their democratic rights can be justified as a means of protecting those of the broader <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenry.html" title="Citizenry">citizenry</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant_anti-fascism.html" title="Militant anti-fascism">Militant anti-fascists</a>, however, have criticised the ANL for relying on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_state.html" title="The state">the state</a> to prosecute or censor fascism, rather than promoting <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> by citizens. Also this whole argument depends on the contention that the BNP is in fact a 'fascist' party, which is highly debatable.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Edit section: A popular front against fascism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A popular front against fascism</span></h3>
<p>Advocates of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant_anti-fascism.html" title="Militant anti-fascism">militant anti-fascism</a>, such as those associated with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Fascist_Action_b419.html" title="Anti-Fascist Action">Anti-Fascist Action</a> see the ANL (and its successor <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unite_Against_Fascism_c354.html" title="Unite Against Fascism">Unite Against Fascism</a>) as a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_anti-fascism.html" title="Liberal anti-fascism">liberal anti-fascist</a> organisation - that is, one that essentially defends the status quo against fascism, using the language and strategies of mainstream <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democratic</a> politics. For example, the use of the word <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> rather than <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a> draws on the same <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotic.html" title="Patriotic">patriotic</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> or even <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobic.html" title="Xenophobic">xenophobic</a> sentiment that arguably feeds fascism - the word's history is tied up with <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and Britain's war with <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>'s <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and connotes foreign-ness.</p>
<p>More broadly, the ANL is seen as a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_front.html" title="Popular front">popular front</a> organisation - a form of anti-fascism that seeks out alliance with <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourgeois.html" title="Bourgeois">bourgeois</a>, non-<a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> and even <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">reactionary</a> organisations, rather than base itself in a radical critique of fascism. Socialist historian Dave Renton<a href="http://www.dkrenton.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dkrenton.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, for example, in his book <i>Fascism: Theory and Practice</i><a href="http://www.dkrenton.co.uk/books/theory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dkrenton.co.uk/books/theory.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, describes the ANL as “an orthodox <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_front.html" title="United front">united front</a>” based on a “strategy of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> unity”, as advocated by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Trotsky_11f4.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. However, critics of the ANL, such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Fascist_Action_b419.html" title="Anti-Fascist Action">Anti-Fascist Action</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> argue that the ANL’s co-operation with “bourgeois” groups who work closely with the state, such as <i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Searchlight_%28magazine%29.html" title="Searchlight (magazine)">Searchlight</a></i> magazine and the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, rule out this description, making it a classic <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_front.html" title="Popular front">popular front</a>. Another criticism is that terms like 'popular front' and 'united front' are in fact rooted in the politics of the 1930s with their mass mobilization of labour, something that the ANL and Unite Against Fascism, with a few hundred active members at most, can herdly claim.</p>

<p>The ANL has been accused of being a '<a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_organisation.html" title="Front organisation">front</a>' for the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a>; that is, of being controlled by the SWP and having the agenda of recruiting members to that organisation, while giving the impression of being independent. This criticism is generally made by left-wingers who are not associated with the SWP (see for example <a href="http://www.blackstarreview.com/rev-0050.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackstarreview.com/rev-0050.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>).</p>
