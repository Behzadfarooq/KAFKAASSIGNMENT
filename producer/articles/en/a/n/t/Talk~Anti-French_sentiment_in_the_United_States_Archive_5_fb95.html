<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Toasts of Freedom"</span></h2>
<p>I wanted to point out something that needs focus within the article. I heard a program on NPR some months ago where they explained that the anti-French sentiment in the US is not designed to annoy the French. It is designed to annoy the American Left. They tend to be agreeable towards France, and despise nationalism, jingoism, and ethnic pejoratives generally. France is an acceptable target, because they are white, and because of the long tradition of anti-French jokes going back to pre-American England. Of course the French find it all rather silly, particularly the names of food, but we also would find it silly if we knew more about French attempts to remove English terms like "O.K." from their language. There is the obvious example of this article itself, where the overwhelming majority of those shocked, offended and concerned were native-English speakers, whereas the French largely understood it for what it was, nationalistic foolishness and jokes. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 02:19, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting point of view. I suspect that all this agitation had two targets: one of them France, and another was, as often when political leadership has trouble justifying its policies, to portray those who do not approve of government's action as anti-patriotic, friends of foreign countries.</dd>
<dd>"but we also would find it silly if we knew more about French attempts to remove English terms like "O.K." from their language." Which attempts? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 23:33, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't speak to that in depth, but the program I heard mentioned in passing some attempts in France to purify the language, particularly of trendy english words and phrases, in favor of the French equivelent. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 23:50, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's fair to compare the preservation of a language with the renaming of French fries to freedom fries. The first practice is hardly unique to France. The <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise.html" title="Académie française">Académie française</a> is just one of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_language_regulators.html" title="List of language regulators">many language regulators</a>, and it isn't the strictest. The <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic_language.html" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic language</a> in particular is much more linguistically pure than French. And in any case, the Académie's attempts at language preservation have been ongoing and are not tied to any petty political sniping. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowDragon_e098.html" title="User:ShadowDragon">ShadowDragon</a> 09:48, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At least to an American, an attempt at "language preservation" sounds like an act of haughtiness, especially given the history of English and French. English has been absorbing French words since William the Conqueror. To openly snub the return favor, in favor of "pure" French, untained by American words, comes across as rude. I am quite sure if the US started a language academy, and required that all the billboards in America be in English (and a lot of them, especially in the Southwest, are in Spanish) that there would be a lot of negative comment from around the world. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 02:40, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think this can be fairly compared. The "Freedom Fries" thing was a deliberate punctual political action meant to annoy the French (and possibly some left-wing Americans). What you're alluding to is: 1/ the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise.html" title="Académie française">Académie française</a> (which has had the role of standardizing French since the 17th century, so we cannot say that it operates in a view to annoying the Americans) 2/ the terminology commissions of various ministries (which only deal with governmental messages) 3/ the "Toubon law".</dd>
<dd>1/ is hardly relevant: nobody cares what the Académie says, including the government; the Académie is just kept for tradition and folklore and has no enforcement powers. 2/ is needed because governmental has a constitutional duty to convey information about its activities to the people (and the official language is French, so government should publish information in French, primarily). 3/ was a bit of gesticulation, but not entirely: it mandates that advertisements should be translated (which surely protects customers).</dd>
<dd>When you say "France wants this, France wants that", it's a good idea to be more specific about which agency wants this or that. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 09:57, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I may add my opinion to "French attempts to remove English terms like "O.K." from their language":</dd>
<dd>there is a law (loi Toubon, called "loi Allgood" by jokes, "all good" = "tout bon") that obliges to translate the foreign words (not only english) on the advertisements (you have the english words written big on the wall, and the translation written very small besides); it is <i>not</i> forbidden to use English, it just <i>must</i> be translated somewhere (and this may be seen as a promotion to learn English (-:)<br />
The loi Toubon also forbid the use of foreign word in <i>official</i> documents, this includes laws, administrative papers... well, this is just good sense, you do not have to learn a foreign language inside your own country...</dd>
<dd>Personally, I strongly believe that in a language, all synonyms are not equal (this is why they exist), a word does not only have a meaning, but also implications; this is all the difficulty in translation, you might know the italian word <i>tradutore, traditore</i> "translator = traitor".<br />
The english words, once imported into french, do not have the same implication than their french equivalent, and sometimes do not have the same meaning as in english! I always remember the movie <i>Riff-Raff</i> from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Loach_9ba5.html" title="Ken Loach">Ken Loach</a>, a man says "We had an agreement"; the subtitle was "On avait un <i>deal</i>" --- in french, the word <i>deal</i> has an implication (low-level suburbs language, associated to the expression "drug dealer") that is does not have in english. But such things are very informal and difficult to touch, this is the reason why I personnaly try, when I write my web pages in French, to use only french word --- just to be sure to be best understood.</dd>
<dd>So, I think that it has difinetely <i>nothing</i> to do with the renaming of food or such things. -- <a href="../../../c/d/a/User%7ECdang_4713.html" title="User:Cdang">Cdang</a> 13:56, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Well , i dont really understand the french removing english words, it's stupid to quote all times the conservative anti euro anti french anglo saxons medias, they bring distortion of news and ares biased! i mean that 60% that i'm writing now is french words or words from french roots, it's alway strange to listening english speaking guys getting arrogant positions about "english is world language, french no", english speakers don't have the needed culture to know they speak more french than any in the world! it's as stupid as 'anti french' blah blah, and "refusing to let invasion of iraq" was the reasons to "block" Bush, all that ares biased and very conservatives medias money bag, first France Never block something, and all was about WMD and not war in iraq, or removing saddam, the french was just asking proofs about WMD, and to keep guys there to check out, Chirac was the first ready to attack irak if WMD was clearly "objective", all lies, plagias and distorsions of medias and hawks was far from international inteligences agencies serious repports about the so called "WMD", France took the right decision, wait and see, about priorities in fighting islamists terrorist, France was far ahead everyones, being attacked and in "WAR" against them for years, a War the france won, and without invading London where all terrorists was plotting their attacks, so now that france was right no only about WMD, but dealing after invasion chaos, and issues about Bush fearing medias policies on his own peoples, they never vetoed something, and kept the door open, proving not only they wasn't lackeys, but that 90% of world peoples was backing them, i don't include USA lobbied poor countries govs, that played under pressure of Bush gov to say shy "yes" to bush policy, i just talking about rationals peoples around the planet that takes eash days responsabilities on thier own life, not Medias empire conservative's world! and to be a world leading economy isn't the justification of being the rightfull worl leader of the freedom!</p>

<dd>"France, more strongly than any other nation, sees the European Union as a method of counter-balancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade." Those are not facts but judgments. I also doubt the explanation "France was accused of particularly ferocious criticism, because it was seen as opposing not because of a disagreement over what to do about the situation, but as a way of opposing the United States for the sake of decreasing the diplomatic power of the United States and building an opposing power movement." and that "fears that expansion of the European Union would be used by the US to keep Europe politically divided" were "long-extant". "Keep politically divided" also implies that Europe had been politically divided before, which is too general, and another judgment, not a fact. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 23:14, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a "single journalist". I've seen this bullshit repeated by profs of political science, journalists and politicians. It's generally used as an argument to dismiss any criticism from France about American judicial procedures (see for instance the controversies around the extradition of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Ira_Einhorn_7fbc.html" title="Ira Einhorn">Ira Einhorn</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 09:04, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IIRC, France operates under the Napoleanic Code, which has a presumption of guilt that must be disproved,
<dl>
<dd>No. The <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Code_cf15.html" title="Napoleonic Code">Napoleonic Code</a>, properly said, is a code of civil law (property rights...) and does not deal with criminal procedure. The Code of Criminal Procedure has been rewritten a number of times since Napoleon. Even so, I strongly doubt that even in Napoleon's days, there was de jure presumption of guilt. (However, I think that the rights of the defense were inferior to what they are today, but I think that can be said of most Western countries including the US.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>while the English common law (basis of the American judicial system) presumes "innocent until proven guilty." This was taught to me in school, but not as an especial criticism of France, just a difference in legal codes.
<dl>
<dd>Well, possibly your school system engages in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> (actually, I think that the US school system and media tends to be biased towards self-promotion of the United States; you're not the first person to tell me utter bullshit based on disparaging stuff he learnt at school about foreign countries). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 09:04, 30 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's another thing about many nations (not just French): they argue against the US, taking a specific and making it a broad generality. The information I heard in school spoke about the Napoleanic Code as it was supposed to be practiced in Louisiana in an understanding of a reference in the play <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>. There was no comment at all using this as a present-day indictment of France. But you instantly extended that, not to say "well, what you learned is wrong; what you learned is not up to date," but "possibly your school system engages in propoganda" and "I think that the US school system and media tends to be biased towards self-promotion of the United States." Well, excuse my bigoted American ass. How much did the French school system give you a completely balanced portayal of the US and of France? Did you learn about collaboration. Were you told it was just isolated? Did they tell you about willing deportation of French Jews? Did you learn or not the the British evacuation at Dunkirque was a 'betrayal' of the French. And to talk about "overblown," the <i>shocked</i> complaints that the Congress renamed "French Fries" to "Freedom Fries." That's an act of pique and a joke. You won't go to your local US McDonald's or other restaurant and see "Freedom Fries." In the same sentiment, the US Army has "Army Bean Soup," on their messhall menus, instead of "Navy Bean Soup," but there are no inter-branch complaints about it. Recognize here, that on the English Wikipedia, where a huge number of the posters are in the US (if not a clear majority), people feel free to insult Americans in articles like "Anti-Americanism," free to insult Americans in articles about American's feelings toward others, and even have that peculiarly European habit of telling Americans what they should call themselves—"U.S." instead of "Americans." The next time you see a poster saying "Down with America," don't forget to ask them whether they mean the United States or Uruguay. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 19:26, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Your comparison between Navy and Army soup and French vs. Freedom Fries is inappropriate given that the Freedom Frie decision was willingly taken by elected politicians in a populist attempt to defame the French. I agree that concluding from your misinformation that US citizens in general were badly informed is biased. However, I guess he did not base his judgment on this sole incident. The findings of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Society_03a9.html" title="National Geographic Society">National Geographic Society</a> about the lack of education in the US compared to some European countries should make you think. <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geosurvey/highlights.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geosurvey/highlights.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> And your "retaliation" by ranting about French collaboration is out of place as well. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 00:03, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Believe me, "freedom fries" is the mildest possible rebuke, and most Americans considered it funny. If the French are genuinely insulted by that, perhaps they are a bit too sensitive. I agree that US education has sadly lagged behind, sometimes <i>way</i> behind, much European education, but some of us (and they're not Democrats, who tend to be in bed with the teachers' unions and others who have eviscerated education) have worked hard to change that, and it's taking effect. However, a poorer education (and I went to school <i>before</i> the worst of it) is not the same as a biased education. My point about French collaboration was made not to criticism the fact of it, <i>per se</i>, but to ask whether French education is so unbiased when teaching about France's embarassments. And I will restate my overall point that the world feels free to criticize anything pertaining to the US in the broadest terms where it is often a case of "the pot calling the kettle black." I think the Germans are fairly unique in making a real effort to come to terms with the darker parts of the past. But countries that collaborated with Germany in WWII seem to shrug off any responsibility of any kind. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 02:49, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cannot say that in general education in the U.S. were bad. The PISA study seemed to show differently. Although many Germans go to the U.S. in grade eleven and they <b>always</b> come back telling that they did not have to work at all. I do not know if you have a silly system like we have where students who are bad in some subjects have to go to a school together with others who have problems and so they cannot be properly challenged in areas where they are stronger. Anyways, some U.S. universities are extremely good, and the students who succeed there must have gotten a proper education before. Although once they are in they often have a hard time if they want to go for a mark worse than B. In Germany we do not have such elitist universities, on the other hand some U.S. universities could not even compete with German "Fachhochschulen", which are institutions for higher education specialized in certain areas and focussing more on practical issues than on science. Whatever, if the U.S. education were not so bad on average but as National Geographic shows there is an extreme gap to Europeans when knowledge about foreign countries is concerned you may interpret that as a bias. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 12:22, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I doubt most Americans are even aware of this, no less hold it as a point of prejudice against France. I should comment that "innocent until proven guilty" is a shorthand phrase not in the US Constitution. It is not fully accurate. If an accused person were truly "presumed innocent" he would not be detained before trial or have to appear at trial, but would be notified of the results when the trial was over. Obviously, this is not the case. It would be more accurate to say that a US defendant's guilt must be <i>proven</i> and that he is not adjudged guilty unless and until that guilt is proven. IOW, the burden is on the prosecution. Before trial, a person is not supposed to be detained unless the nature of the crime and/or the background of the person causes the court to deem it necessary. Also, the conditions of a person's confinement before trial is supposed to be no more onerous than necessary. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 04:27, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>David, I think most countries, including France, have a tendency to see themselves in a more positive light than they are seen from outside. Up to now it seems to me that this "presumption of guilt" is utter nonsense, as Cecropia rightly describes a defendant's guilt must be <i>proven</i> and that he is not adjudged guilty unless and until that guilt is proven, that holds for the the US and any other western country, apart from US-run prisons like in Guantanamo. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 16:09, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's exactly the point. My perception is that the US media and education system instills in Americans wrong notions of exceptionality (see <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_exceptionalism.html" title="American exceptionalism">American exceptionalism</a>) about their country, as well as disparaging and false claims about other countries.</dd>
<dd>This tendency of countries of seeing themselves in a better light is, I think, quite commonplace (except for people who are disgusted by their country and think the grass is greener elsewhere). However, I think that the US (and to some extent the UK) push it to high levels by Western standards, and this is an important factor in the clash with other countries ("why don't they like us?").</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jokes, prejudices, accusations</span></h2>
<p>The chapter <i>Popular anti-French insults and allegations</i> mixes accusations (ungratefulness, anti-semitism, bad economy), "clichés" used in political jokes and insults (weakness, arrogance, lazyness) and unused "clichés" (food, flamboyance). Very common clichés used in popular jokes are missing (notably sexuality and hygiene). This chapter should be complete and make clear what cliché/prejudice/accusation is used for what. For instance it should be clear that anti-semitism is used in accusations, while weakness is used in jokes. In particular, the chapter introduction is first about "jokes", then "argumentation", then "accusations". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Mongenet_1ce6.html" title="User:Marc Mongenet">Marc Mongenet</a> 21:03, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am quite disturbed by extreme American francophobia, of course (like all similar extreme movements directed against another nationality). Also, nations can have legitimate minor conflicts. I do think that the <i>f*ck France</i> attitude is a part of the <i>Anti-French sentiment in the United States</i> and links to such webpages probably should not be censored. If you are against such ideas, giving ways to people of seeing the irrationality you perceive in their arguments can be relatively positive. With this point of view, if we only give links to the more moderate side of the movement, people might not see the most <i>harmful</i> part of the movement as a whole. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 11:13, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

No, I would stand against posting and keeping links to such sites because these pages would be *part* of an act of direct harm on a human being and part of a criminal act. If it were a page only of writings speaking of less legislation on the matter, without directly inciting anything criminal, even if I find such a thing ludicrous and offensive, I might, might have a different stance, depending on the content of the said page.</dd>

<dd>I have not read everything on f***france.com; if someone were to bring before us a quote constituting a criminal act (a direct invitation to physical harm, for example) or a clear proof of the site causing a true threat of harm, I would stand against its inclusion. Right now, the most offensive thing of the site I see is the title. This is indeed a question of where censorship should begin, of where freedom of speech should end... If we decide to ommit such a site because we do not agree with its content, that might be against the neutral ideal of an encyclopedia. In no way whatsoever I would include this in a subjective work that I'd have something to do with.</dd>

This site actually does quite often suggest things like massive nuclear strikes on very much anything, but I do not think it constitutes a serious menace. I actually linked to it because of the way information which is to be discussed is selected, and because of the kind of comments (typically, the number of posts which have no other purpose than to express full agreement with the author, with no information or comment whatsoever). I tend to consider it sociologically interesting, and also an interesting example of the way information can be presented.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vive le Québec libre</span></h2>
<p><i>Some believed that de Gaulle's support for <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> independence was more a bid to aggravate the United States than to actually foster Quebec independence.</i> (This refers to his 1967 speech at the balcony of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> city hall.

<p>I am moving this comment here, for now, because I'm wondering... Who said that anyway? If pundits indeed stated such an analysis, they were wrong, I must say. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Gaulle_62f6.html" title="Charles de Gaulle">Général de Gaulle</a> had cultivated his reflexion of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_Sovereignism_2033.html" title="Quebec Sovereignism">Quebec question</a> since the Liberation and beyond that, since his earlier days. The only link that could be made to the United States is that, for him, Quebec's search for autonomy was a struggle against the negative aspects of a perceived North American and British anglo-saxon <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegemony.html" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a>, like the struggle of France from his point of view. It was, most of all, a display of his belief in the necessity of national sovereignty, like in the case of France, but also of Algeria, to which he finally contributed to granting it independence. If this comment is to go back, clarification should be made. I assure you that de Gaulle did not put the relations of his country with the Canadian <i>world power</i> and knowingly created an international coup and controversy to simply and indirectly bicker with the USA. Sometimes, events *do* happen in the world without having the US as a primarily intended target. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 11:13, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put the information back in in modified form to demonstrate what the anger was actually about. Remember that this is an article about anti-French sentiment in the U.S., not deGaulle's motivations. Since you mention Algeria, I well remember that the French at the time regarded at least the northern part of Algeria as being in the French "Metropoltain," i.e., an integral part of the French nation. Though this position was ultimately untenable politically, the U.S. didn't oppose France despite America's general support for an end of colonies in Africa. If the U.S. president had travelled to Algeria to make a speech in favor of Algerian independence, it would have been considered a very hostile act by a French ally, whatever the U.S. motives. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 17:33, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll admit that the comment is now better, more neutral. It gives less the impression that interferring with the US was actually, and positively, the main intention of de Gaulle. Could you provide references and/or quotes to American politicians speaking of de Gaulle's speech in such a way? It does seem quite <i>Americano-centrist</i>. It can feel a bit curious (not to say <i>neo-imperialistic</i>) that the US claim such virtual <i>ownership</i> of the whole continent. It is consistent with the principles of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monroe_Doctrine_0067.html" title="Monroe Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a>, however. About Algeria, the difference is that Algeria belonged to France... Quebec did not belong to the States. Benedict Arnold did try to invade Quebec, but that didn't go far. Luckily, old Benedict certainly redeemed himself after that.&#160;:P Hmm...</dd>

<dd>Hi Liberlogos. Of course this article is "Americano-centric" in the same sense that the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> article is fairly Eurocentric, since this article deals with U.S. attitudes. I understand the concept that France "owned" Algeria (though the locals had different ideas) and the U.S. doesn't own Quebec. However, there is an issue in both cases of spheres of influence and support for a close ally. People in the U.S. consider Canada more than an ally, as an historically friendly nation, In that sense, <i>Americanos</i> do not distinguish between Quebec and other Canadian provinces, in terms of nationhood (as opposed to culture). Anything that threatens the unity of a close ally implicitly threatens the U.S., especially when a European nation comes down on the divisive side of the issue. If deGaulle had been more seeming to be celebrating culture instead of talking in terms of "liberation" (remember this was in the middle of an era of revolutionary talk and action in Latin America) I think it would not have been received so negatively.</dd>

<dd>I will try to reword that last paragraph so it is a little more understandable. It is a little problem to get quotes, since the issue predates internet archiving, but give me a little time. It is something I lived through. BTW, I have been in Montreal a few times, once during the "oui" and "non" debate in about 1980(?). I found the people generally warm and friendly and wish I could have visited more restaurants. My lack of French language only seemed to attract slight negative attention, but it seemed to help when people knew I was from New York instead of Ontario.&#160;;-) I sadly have not been back in awhile, but I very much want to see Quebec City.

<dd>It is not the topic of this discussion, but I insist on clarifying that <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> is by no means "Eurocentric". While an overwhelming majority of Europeans strongly oppose the politics of the current US government, a general tendency to oppose everything American is by far more widespread in Latin America and Arab countries. Europe neither saw <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinochet.html" title="Pinochet">Pinochet</a> nor was it directly involved in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Contra_Affair_3376.html" title="Iran-Contra Affair">Iran-Contra Affair</a>, and the war crime of bombing innocent civilians here happened so long ago and is so overshadowed by even more evil events of the time that people now do not feel strongly about it.</dd>
