<p>Antoine de Sartine was born in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/2/1729.html" title="1729">1729</a>, the son of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Sartine_8ba3.html" title="Antoine Sartine">Antoine Sartine</a>, a French-born financier who arrived in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> with the troops of King <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_V_of_Spain_2f3b.html" title="Philip V of Spain">Philip V of Spain</a> and served as <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intendente.html" title="Intendente">intendente</a></i> (i.e. governor) of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> from <a href="../../../1/7/2/1726.html" title="1726">1726</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/4/1744.html" title="1744">1744</a>. His mother was Catherine Wilts, Countess of Alby.</p>
<p><a name="First_years_in_France" id="First_years_in_France"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_de_Sartine_9948.html" title="Edit section: First years in France">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First years in France</span></h2>
<p>After the death of his mother, Antoine de Sartine was sent to France and put under the guidance of Charles Colabeau, businessman and friend of his father. He studied law in Paris. In <a href="../../../1/7/5/1752.html" title="1752">1752</a> he was granted letters of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalization.html" title="Naturalization">naturalization</a>. The same year, at the age of 23, he became Councilor (i.e. judge) at the <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2telet.html" title="Châtelet">Châtelet</a> of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, the city's civil and criminal court. In <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755.html" title="1755">1755</a> he bought the office of Criminal Lieutenant, i.e. head, or chief judge, of the Châtelet's criminal branch. As a result of buying this office, he was <a href="../../../e/n/n/Ennoblement.html" title="Ennoblement">ennobled</a> and entered the prestigious <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_nobility.html" title="French nobility">aristocracy</a>. Eventually, in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1759.html" title="1759">1759</a>, he married Marie-Anne Hardy du Plessis, the grand-daughter of Charles Colabeau.</p>
<p>By then, he was in favor at the court of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Versailles_6916.html" title="Palace of Versailles">Versailles</a>, and so on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1759.html" title="1759">1759</a> he was appointed <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefecture_of_Police_705d.html#List_of_lieutenant_generals_and_prefects_of_police" title="Prefecture of Police">Lieutenant General of Police</a> of Paris (i.e. head of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefecture_of_Police_705d.html" title="Prefecture of Police">Paris Police</a>). He entered office in December of that year after buying the office of Lieutenant General of Police from his predecessor Bertin for the sum of 175,000 <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Livres.html" title="Livres">livres</a></i> (approx. US$850,000 in 2006), which his friend <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillaume-Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Lamoignon_de_Malesherbes_fe12.html" title="Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes">Malesherbes</a> advanced him.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_de_Sartine_9948.html" title="Edit section: Lieutenant General of Police of Paris">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lieutenant General of Police of Paris</span></h2>
<p>As Lieutenant General of Police, Antoine de Sartine was the real administrator of Paris for 15 years, invested with more powers than the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mayors_of_Paris_15cb.html" title="List of mayors of Paris">Provost of the Merchants</a> (head of the Paris municipality). Like his predecessors, he was in charge not only of public order, but also of street cleaning and maintenance, food supply, and public health and hygiene.</p>
<p>A skilled administrator, he improved the city's food supply. Along with the Provost of the Merchants de Viarmes, he commissioned the building of a new grain market, the <i>Halle au blé</i>, built between <a href="../../../1/7/6/1765.html" title="1765">1765</a> and <a href="../../../1/7/6/1768.html" title="1768">1768</a>, a modern and airy building much admired at the time which is still standing by <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Halles_3510.html" title="Les Halles">Les Halles</a> today and currently known as the <i>Bourse du Commerce</i>.</p>
<p>Street cleaning and lighting were also improved. He set up a brigade of street sweepers and had the first public toilets installed in the streets of Paris. In <a href="../../../1/7/6/1766.html" title="1766">1766</a>, after launching an invention contest, he improved street lighting by installing new <i>réverbère</i> lanterns. These were oil lamps with reflectors which were hung above the center of streets and produced a more abundant and stable light than the candle lanterns that had been used for centuries before.</p>
<p>The same year, he founded the Royal Free Drawing School (now the National School of Decorative Arts) which taught drawing skills, free-of-charge, to the sons of families from the lowest classes of society. The aim was both to train artisans and artists so as to improve the quality of the Parisian luxury goods industries and handicrafts, but also to teach poor youths a trade and keep them from roaming the streets and disturbing public order.</p>
<p>For the first time in history, he conducted a survey of the quarries beneath the city, many of which threatened the foundations of buildings. He also ordered fourteen public fountains restored and organized drowning assistance services.</p>
<p>Under his tenure, public order was well maintained in the French capital. He took great care in the recruitment of police commissioners (<i>commissaires de police</i>) to assist him. He is said to have fulfilled his office with justice, humanity, firmness, and vigilance, and was highly respected by everyone.</p>
<p>Among other measures, he subjected the night watchmen to military discipline; he put an end to the abuse of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claque.html" title="Claque">claque</a> in theatres; he banned gatherings of horn blowers in pubs. In order to suppress underground gambling dives in the city, he opened official gambling houses watched over by his agents and taxed by the Treasury.</p>
<p>His services, in particular <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_police.html" title="Secret police">secret police</a>, were the best informed in Europe and served as a model in other countries. All the governments of Europe, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_II_of_Russia_52bd.html" title="Catherine II of Russia">Catherine II of Russia</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Theresa_of_Austria_c27a.html" title="Maria Theresa of Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a>, the Pope, consulted him on the best way to organize police services in their states. He had agents and spies everywhere in the city and abroad, including as far away as in America and in India. Such was his reputation that foreign governments often required his help in searching for fugitives. Once, a minister of Maria Theresa wrote to Sartine asking him to arrest a famous thief who was thought to be hiding in Paris. Sartine replied to the minister that the thief was actually in Vienna, and gave the minister the street address where the thief was hiding, as well as a description of the thief's disguise.</p>
<p>Sartine personally analyzed an enormous correspondence and received his subordinates and commissioners of police anytime of day and night. He was the first to use repentant thieves and reprieved convicts as informants and agents. To courtiers who found this shocking, he used to say: "Pray tell me the name of honest people who would like to do such a job." Sartine was also a man of action, with great presence of mind. On one occasion, having to quell a riot on the <i>Place Maubert</i>, he met the crowd at the head of a company of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musketeer.html" title="Musketeer">musketeers</a> and had an officer respectfully remove his hat and tell the crowd: "Gentlemen, we come here in the name of the King, but our orders are to shoot at the scoundrels only. I therefore pray the honest people to leave the square." The crowd disbanded without a gunshot.</p>
<p>Although admired by his contemporaries, he was also criticized for using his highly efficient secret police to spy not only on criminals but also on ordinary citizens. His services opened private letters sent through the mail, which was a frequent practice in Europe at the time, and spied on families. Sartine was thus aware of all sorts of scandals in the city, notably sexual scandals, and he sent daily reports to the king containing saucy and intimate details about courtiers, clerics, and private citizens, which were said to amuse the king and relieve him from the boredom of court life. Furthermore, his political police was known for its efficiency in detecting agitators, dissenters, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-clericalism.html" title="Anti-clericalism">anticlerical</a> propagandists, and other people perceived as trouble makers, who were imprisoned without trial through the <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Lettre_de_cachet.html" title="Lettre de cachet">lettres de cachet</a></i>. Some sources say that there were never more political prisoners at the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastille.html" title="Bastille">Bastille</a> and at the fortress of <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Vincennes_8d8f.html" title="Château de Vincennes">Vincennes</a> than under his tenure.</p>
<p>In parallel with his career as Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, Antoine de Sartine became <i><a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/Ma%C3%AEtre_des_requ%C3%AAtes.html" title="Maître des requêtes">maître des requêtes</a></i> in December <a href="../../../1/7/5/1759.html" title="1759">1759</a> and <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conseiller_d%27%C3%89tat_2743.html" title="Conseiller d'État">conseiller d'État</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1767.html" title="1767">1767</a>. He was the director of the Library from <a href="../../../1/7/6/1763.html" title="1763">1763</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/7/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a>, succeeding his friend <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillaume-Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Lamoignon_de_Malesherbes_fe12.html" title="Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes">Malesherbes</a>. As such, he was not only in charge of managing the Royal Library (now the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France_0ab3.html" title="Bibliothèque nationale de France">National Library of France</a>), but he was also the chief censor in the kingdom, responsible for controlling the book trade and the press. Like his friend Malesherbes, he was a liberal and supported the philosophers of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">The Enlightenment</a>, in particular <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Diderot_b378.html" title="Denis Diderot">Diderot</a> and his <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A9die.html" title="Encyclopédie">Encyclopédie</a></i>, which he protected against the attacks of the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiology.html" title="Ecclesiology">ecclesiastical</a> party.</p>
<p>Antoine de Sartine was close to the party of the minister <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/i/%C3%89tienne_Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_duc_de_Choiseul_1586.html" title="Étienne François, duc de Choiseul">Choiseul</a>, who had been disgraced by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XV_of_France_ef82.html" title="Louis XV of France">Louis XV</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770.html" title="1770">1770</a> and ordered to retire to his estate. After the king's death in May <a href="../../../1/7/7/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a>, Choiseul was allowed to return to Paris and his party regained favor at court. Thus, on August 24 of the same year, Sartine was appointed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Naval_Ministers_of_France_ad6f.html" title="List of Naval Ministers of France">Secretary of State for the Navy</a> (with the honorific rank of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_State_f967.html" title="Minister of State">Minister of State</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>) and left his office of Lieutenant General of Police to his protégé Lenoir.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_de_Sartine_9948.html" title="Edit section: Secretary of State for the Navy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Secretary of State for the Navy</span></h2>
<p>Antoine de Sartine inherited a strong <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Navy_91df.html" title="French Navy">French Navy</a>, resurrected by <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/i/%C3%89tienne_Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_duc_de_Choiseul_1586.html" title="Étienne François, duc de Choiseul">Choiseul</a> after the disasters of the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Years%27_War_9fe6.html" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a> when France lost <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada%2C_New_France_5ed2.html" title="Canada, New France">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_%28New_France%29_278c.html" title="Louisiana (New France)">Louisiana</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_India_abb7.html" title="French India">India</a>, and which would later defeat the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">British Navy</a> in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War_3677.html" title="France in the American Revolutionary War">War of American Independence</a>. In the ministry, Sartine surrounded himself with able men, such as the comte de Fleurieu. He modernized and rationalized the French Navy. By seven decrees (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_27.html" title="September 27">September 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1776.html" title="1776">1776</a>), he gave naval officers the high hand over French ports and naval dockyards, which were put under the direction of the comte de Fleurieu. He also reorganized the corps of <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_artillery.html" title="Naval artillery">naval artillery</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_corps.html" title="Marine corps">marine infantry</a>. In <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>, after the aborted attempt by his predecessor to create a Royal Marine School in <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Havre_3181.html" title="Le Havre">Le Havre</a>, he re-established the Companies of Marine Guards, naval schools training officers and whose access was strictly limited to children of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_nobility.html" title="French nobility">aristocracy</a>.</p>
<p>As conflict with England was looming on the horizon, he increased shipbuilding budgets fourfold, enabling large scale shipbuilding when France entered the American War of Independence in the beginning of <a href="../../../1/7/7/1778.html" title="1778">1778</a>. In the space of only one year, nine <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleships</a> were built in the French shipyards. Sartine also initiated the building of the long <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakwater_%28structure%29.html" title="Breakwater (structure)">breakwater</a> which protects the port of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherbourg.html" title="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> and commissioned the construction of <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_dock.html" title="Dry dock">dry docks</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest%2C_France_092f.html" title="Brest, France">Brest</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochefort.html" title="Rochefort">Rochefort</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorient.html" title="Lorient">Lorient</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulon.html" title="Toulon">Toulon</a>. Particularly interested in <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundry.html" title="Foundry">foundries</a>, he created the naval foundry of Indret near <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> (now a unit of <a href="../../../d/c/n/DCN_b733.html" title="DCN">DCN</a> specialized in conventional and <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_propulsion.html" title="Nuclear propulsion">nuclear propulsion</a>). In these critical times, he fought successfully against <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insubordination.html" title="Insubordination">insubordination</a> in the Navy, notably by publishing a regulation in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a> dealing with hygiene onboard the vessels of the fleet and with marine crew health issues. Drawing from his police experience, he also used his spy network in the fight against England.</p>
<p>The budget deficit, which was aggravated by France's participation in the War of American Independence, led to conflict between the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Finance_Ministers_of_France_f251.html" title="List of Finance Ministers of France">finance minister</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Necker_aac9.html" title="Jacques Necker">Necker</a>, who sought to limit expenditures, and Sartine, who wanted to expand the French Navy even further. Necker accused Sartine of exceeding the budget allocated to the Navy by 20 million <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Livres.html" title="Livres">livres</a></i> (approx. US$100 million in 2006). Necker complained sharply to King <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI</a> that this overrun threatened an already almost bankrupt State. Eventually, the king dismissed Sartine on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a> and replaced him with the marquis de Castries. Sartine, however, was dismissed with honors: he received a reward of 150,000 <i>livres</i> (approx. US$700,000) for his services and he was granted a 70,000 <i>livres</i> yearly pension.</p>
<p>Antoine de Sartine tried to justify his actions as minister in a vitriolic pamphlet against Necker, whom he accused of having sold himself to the English, but he didn't win over the public and was the victim of numerous puns and epigrams such as this one:</p>

<p>Sartine lived in retirement in Paris until the start of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Hated by the revolutionary crowds for his tenure as Lieutenant General of Police and his use of the <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Lettre_de_cachet.html" title="Lettre de cachet">lettres de cachet</a></i> to imprison people without trial, attacked by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Pierre_Manuel_0d10.html" title="Louis Pierre Manuel">Manuel</a> in his <i>La Police de Paris dévoilée</i> ("The Paris Police Uncovered"), he decided to leave France shortly after the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storming_of_the_Bastille_91db.html" title="Storming of the Bastille">Storming of the Bastille</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a>, which probably saved his life. His son Charles Marie Antoine de Sartine, born in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1760.html" title="1760">1760</a>, who was <i><a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/Ma%C3%AEtre_des_requ%C3%AAtes.html" title="Maître des requêtes">maître des requêtes</a></i> from the age of 20 until <a href="../../../1/7/9/1791.html" title="1791">1791</a> and chose to stay in France, was arrested in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1794.html" title="1794">1794</a>, sentenced to death by the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Tribunal_ed3b.html" title="Revolutionary Tribunal">Revolutionary Tribunal</a>, and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillotined.html" title="Guillotined">guillotined</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a> of that year along with his 19-year-old wife and his mother-in-law the comtesse de Sainte-Amaranthe.</p>
<p>Sartine took refuge in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, where he had spent his childhood. There, he was active among <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89migr%C3%A9.html" title="Émigré">émigré</a> circles. Around <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a> he retired to <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarragona.html" title="Tarragona">Tarragona</a>, where he was a member of the enlightened circle of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Tarragona_00df.html#Archbishops_of_Tarragona_.28since_1118.29" title="Archdiocese of Tarragona">Archbishop</a> Francisco Armañá y Font (Francesc Armanyà i Font). He died in Tarragona in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a> at the age of 72 without having returned to France.</p>
