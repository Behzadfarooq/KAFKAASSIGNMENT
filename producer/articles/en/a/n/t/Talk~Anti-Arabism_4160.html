<p>Some Arab publicists advocate the use of the term "Anti-Semitism" for Arabs as well as Jews; they claim that both Arabs and Jews are Semitic peoples. The proposed use of this term has largely been rejected for a number of reasons. The first is that there is no such thing as a Semitic ethnicity; rather, the term "semitic" refers only to language groups, and not to ethnicities or nationalities. Secondly, this usage distracts attention from genuine Anti-Arab prejudice. Thirdly, the term "anti-Semitic" was invented to specifically and solely refer to hatred of Jews, and has always been used as such.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why was this article redirected? The new title fails the Google test. The previous title ("Anti-Arab") is somewhat common, returning over 22,000 hits, but this new title (Anti-Arabism) isn't used much at all, returning less than 500 hits. When we title an article, we should generally use the most common terminology, unless there is some compelling reason to do otherwise. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 19:28 21 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can understand why someone disliked "Anti-Arab" as a title, because most Wikipedia titles are nouns. "Anti-Arab" isn't a noun, unless it names an entity like the "Antichrist" or an "Anti-pope", which I doubt. The question is, how do you make the title into a noun? "Anti-Arabism" is the most obvious guess, except that it hardly exists as a phrase. The alternatives, like "Anti-Arab sentiment" and "Anti-Arab prejudice", sound a bit woolly, but are closer to what we are trying to describe. -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a></dd>

<p>regarding: "I think these people [Arabs and Muslims] need to be forcibly converted to Christianity ... It's the only thing that can probably turn them into human beings." [05/12/03] --(<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Savage_%28commentator%29_ffb1.html" title="Michael Savage (commentator)">Michael Savage</a> on his radio show The Savage Nation)</p>
<p>Savage never said "Arabs and Muslims." One's opionion should not be displayed as fact on wikipedia. He was referring to terrorists that beheaded <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Berg_20f3.html" title="Nick Berg">Nick Berg</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Marshall_Johnson%2C_Jr._a80e.html" title="Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.">Paul Johnson</a>. In fact, Savage often states that Islam is a peaceful religion except for a very small, but very violent minority.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I still don't see your point. So is he saying that terrorists need to be forcibly converted to Christianity? That terrorist being a Christian will automatically make him non-violent? It doesn't make it any less offensive. The quote should stay.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:13, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Offensive or not, the quote has nothing to do with the subject of this article, Anti-Arab. The only way you can make a connection is if you stereotype and believe all Arabs are terrorists, and all terrorists are Arabs. This quote would belong under a section called anti-terrorist, or perhaps even a list of (subjectively) offensive quotes, but not an anti-arab article. <a href="../../../j/m/5/User%7EJm51_0ae0.html" title="User:Jm51">Jm51</a> 05:49, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>What Savage said in the past or following this quote is irrelevant. The section illustrates things people have said which can be construed as perpetuating negative Arab stereotypes. It was a poor thing for him to say, and it is, as with the other quotes, not entirely in context, but the fact remains that he said it. Further, I suspect that nobody is going to be swayed for or against Savage based on the inclusion of this quote. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunjk_5c39.html" title="User:Junjk">Junjk</a> 00:16, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, I think we need to set all stereotypes aside here. Not all Arabs are terrorists, and not all terrorists are Arabs. Once we free ourselves from that mentatility, we will realize the quote is completely unrelated and irrelevant to this article about Anti-Arabism. It would belong in a list of (subjectively) poor things for people to say. Furthermore, whether people will be swayed for or against Savage based on the inclusion of this quote is irrelevant. The motive of removing the quote is not to protect savage's name, but to follow wikipedia's guidelines for factual, npov, relevant articles. <a href="../../../j/m/5/User%7EJm51_0ae0.html" title="User:Jm51">Jm51</a> 05:49, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If we're removing quotes based on unclear context, I imagine a few others (most notably Yosef's) should go also. That said, now that I think about it, shouldn't this quote be moved to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> anyway? If it's talking about conversion to Christianity, it can't possibly be an anti-Arab quote contextually. It seems to me that since Savage didn't specifically refer to Arabs we ought not to assume that he was making the factual error that there are no Arab Christians. It seems that, whether he was talking about terrorists in particular or a group as a whole, the group he was talking about were most likely Muslims. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunjk_5c39.html" title="User:Junjk">Junjk</a> 06:30, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The context of Yosef's is clear. Read the reference. The quote was taken from a sermon calling for the annihilation of Arabs. Savage's quote, however, was taken out of context from his talk radio show. Savage was condemning terrorists and terrorism, which he does every day (if you have ever listened to his show), not Arabs and Muslims. Savage was only denouncing the extremist terrorist Muslims/Arabs, who are responsible for widespread pain, suffering and death, not the ordinary peaceful Muslims. Again, if you listened to his show, this would be clear. <a href="../../../j/m/5/User%7EJm51_0ae0.html" title="User:Jm51">Jm51</a> 18:05, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have indeed read the article, and it seems to me that in delicate situations such as these we ought to take the word of the speaker. Surely, having read the BBC article yourself, you know that Yosef was, at least supposedly, referring to Arab terrorists. Further, I have listened to Savage's show on multiple occasions. I won't pretend to have any fondness for the man, but just as he rails constantly against terrorism, he has also been known to occasionally slip and refer to Muslims in a similar fashion, as have a great many conservative talk show hosts. It seems to me that the most reasonable courses of action would be to move the quote to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and/or provide a disclaimer, either for Savage's quote alone or for the entire quotation section, that often statements such as these are taken out of context or do not reflect the speaker's usual viewpoint. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunjk_5c39.html" title="User:Junjk">Junjk</a> 23:04, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree, it should be moved to Islamophobia. Savage's dehumanization of Muslims is disconcerting. Regardless of whether he's referring to terrorists or not, he's still implying that only by converting to Christianity will they become human again. I think we're all pretty sure that converting a mass-murderer to Christianity won't change their ways.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:19, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can't find a single quote where Savage dehumanizations Muslims. I can find plenty of quotes where he dehumanizations terrorists. And yes, he is saying that the only way to to make terrorists human again, would be a conversion to chrisitiantiy. Again, there is no Anti-Arabism, or Islamophobia in that belief - only anti-terrorism/terrorism-ophobia/pro-chrisitian. We need to move past stereotypes. Just because a "great many of conservative talk show hosts" slip and are anti-arabic, does not mean Savage is the same. Again, we need to move beyond stereotypes to see the issue at hand clearly and not have our political affilations sway our judgement. <a href="../../../j/m/5/User%7EJm51_0ae0.html" title="User:Jm51">Jm51</a> 00:56, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>each of the anti arabic quotes are attributed to Jews. this is hardly a proportional representation of those involved with anti-arabism. what about the media pundits, the american religous leaders, and international politicians who have made such statements? this needs to be changed or the quotes should be removed. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonasaurus_b492.html" title="User:Jonasaurus">jonasaurus</a> 02:42, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In editing this article, I removed unsourced claimes, such as anti-Arab feeling rising after the oil embargo and the perception that some Arabs felt they were treated less well than Jews. The quotes section I removed in its entirety, as all the quotes were from Jews (lack of NPOV) and many of them were in fact irrelevant to the discussion, being more anti-Palestinian than anything else (among other things). I also removed some comments about the JDL that appeared only in the edit section and not the article itself and which were incomprehensible. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 23:11, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I reverted this article back to my original edit (with apologies to Jayjg for erasing his request for citations). Yuber, a couple of points: I need to know what it was you disagree with in my editing in order to know if it was justified. For example, some of my editing was for clarity. Did you find that my edit made every section less clear? Please let me know if you did and why you did.

<dd>Thanks for not reverting back entirely. It makes it so much easier to discuss and edit things. My feeling is this, and I would very much welcome input from others: so far everyone but you who has weighed in on this page thinks that the quotes page is inappropriate at best, and antisemitic at worst. I would argue that it is at the very least un-encyclopedia-like. I'll leave it as is for now and wait for other people to express opinions. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 00:56, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quotes section has been here a long time, and it is not "anti-semitic". Humus sapiens removed a totally valid image from this article showing anti-arabism because he felt it was too offensive to the JDL. I feel that because of this totally unilateral removal of his he should not interfere with the quotes section as he has already pushed POV on this article. Instead of solely focusing on the quotes, please improve the article in other ways (as you claim your true intentions are). <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 01:58, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Humus here. I went to the site the pic came from, and found it to be uniformly anti-Israel (which doesn't necessarily mean the picture isn't real), and also their photo gallery suspicious at best (the handwriting was similar in most of the pictures, the sentiments expressed were in English, rather than Hebrew and Arabic, as would more likely be the case), and I believe the JDL signature likely to be a forgery. Also, I was unable to find any other websites with ant-Arab graffiti in English in Israel/West Bank/Gaza. And again, this picture in combination with the inflammatory, one-sided quotes section raises serious NPOV issues. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 04:22, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Couple of points. First off, everyone who's weighing in here, with the exception of one editor, seems to think the quotes are inappropriate. I'm thinking the quotes should be deleted, and will do so soon unless there is strong objection. I have stated (and others have as well) numerous objections to the quotes. I have one more, and it may be a sign of my own bias, but here goes: I think that an article on anti-arab prejudice is important (although I agree the locution "anti-arabism" is odd and clumsy-sounding). But I believe that the placement of content in the article that is borderline (if not over the line) antisemitic weakens the whole article, and makes it seem as though anyone who is sympathetic to arabs or sensitive to prejudice against arabs is an antisemite. I don't believe this is the case, but the quotes (and picture, now deleted) make it seem as though it is. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 20:57, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Everyone that's "weighing in here" has a very strong POV, you included. Wikipedia is not a democracy and therefore you should not delete the quotes section. Also, you keep deleting the picture so the quotes should stay, unless you want the quotes incorporated into a separate paragraph entitled "Israeli anti-Arabism". <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:59, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The way to fix unbalanced but accurate material is to edit it so it's balanced, not delete it outright. The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Lack_of_neutrality_as_an_excuse_to_delete" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a> specifically addresses this approach, in fact.</p>
<p>Currently it seems to me that the section of quotations does indeed give disproportionate attention to anti-Arab racism in Israel; however, simply deleting it outright strikes me as an attempt to sweep the phenomenon (the expression of blatant bigotry by well-known public figures) under the rug. More informative would be an exposition of the reaction, if any, to Yehiel Hazan's statement. (For comparison, consider how expressing even a hint of racist views affected <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent_Lott_dcd8.html" title="Trent Lott">Trent Lott</a>'s political career.)</p>
<p>Likewise, the preponderance of material on Israel elsewhere in the article strikes me as unbalanced; there is certainly no shortage of material on anti-Arab prejudice elsewhere (a short sampler: <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_2002_Spring-Summer/ai_95571887" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_2002_Spring-Summer/ai_95571887" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR030022002?open&amp;of=ENG-2U3" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR030022002?open&amp;of=ENG-2U3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://gbgm-umc.org/programs/antihate/muslimsandarabs.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://gbgm-umc.org/programs/antihate/muslimsandarabs.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=1140" class="external autonumber" title="http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=1140" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Apr05/ElAmine0429.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Apr05/ElAmine0429.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://arabworld.nitle.org/texts.php?module_id=9&amp;reading_id=33&amp;sequence=5" class="external autonumber" title="http://arabworld.nitle.org/texts.php?module_id=9&amp;reading_id=33&amp;sequence=5" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.habiba.org/discrim.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.habiba.org/discrim.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.alumni.umn.edu/Arab_In_America.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alumni.umn.edu/Arab_In_America.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://www.arabworldbooks.com/arab/cohen.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabworldbooks.com/arab/cohen.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://www.youthcomm.org/NYC%20Features/WTC/NYC-1993-04-11a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youthcomm.org/NYC%20Features/WTC/NYC-1993-04-11a.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~ayah/MediaTheories/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.media.mit.edu/~ayah/MediaTheories/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> is especially good, <a href="http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/Research/S&amp;Ps/1991-Sp/S&amp;P_V-3/disappearing_iraqis.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/Research/S&amp;Ps/1991-Sp/S&amp;P_V-3/disappearing_iraqis.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/Arabs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/Arabs.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/shj01/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/shj01/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>).

<p>Regarding the image, it (and the <a href="http://www.cpt.org/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=album03" class="external text" title="http://www.cpt.org/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=album03" rel="nofollow">others like it</a>) illustrate the phenomenon, and vague suspicions that it might not be genuine are not, in themselves, sufficient reason to delete it.

Using it as the sole image in the article does show only a small part of the picture, but again, the best solution is to add more and different images, not to delete this one. <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~ayah/MediaTheories/" class="external text" title="http://web.media.mit.edu/~ayah/MediaTheories/" rel="nofollow">This site</a> has a number of old cartoons that would serve to illustrate various stereotypes—which are <a href="http://stupidonymous.blogspot.com/ArabCartoon.jpg" class="external text" title="http://stupidonymous.blogspot.com/ArabCartoon.jpg" rel="nofollow">still in use</a>, by the way. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 03:09, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm with Charles P on this 100% on this. That the article is unbalanced can easily be rectified by the inclusion of some quotes from non-Israeli sources (cue the pro-Israel guys putting in 2,000,000,000 other quotes not to make a point I guess... followed by an escalation by the anti's looking to put in 2,000,000,001 -&gt; please dont).

<dd>The more I think about it, the fact that the quotes in question are anti-Israel is obscuring the larger problem: why are there quotes at all? I began to think of Yuber's suggestion of collecting more quotes: after all, American anti-Arab sentiment is very different from French, which is different from Persian, etc. So what does that mean in practice? It means someone has to troll the internet looking for juicy quotes from every nationality that has a large amount of anti-Arab (or Muslim) prejudice. But then the article stops looking like an encyclopdia entry and more like notes for a term paper. I would encourage people reading this thread to look at the article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>. There are few quotes there, and the ones that exist are from scholars discussing the issue, which is admittedly not as sexy as quotes from Evil Jews. And as I look at the quotes section and the section above it again, it seems mainly to be pointing to the fact that some Israelis may harbor hatred of Palestinians, which is not in and of itself anti-Arab, any more than Palestinians who are angry at Israelis are necessarily antisemitic. So leaving a bunch of quotes that are meant to malign Israelis while we "wait" for someone to do some original research and dig up more quotes seems wrong to me on many levels -- wrong because what kind of article is mainly a list of quotes (which this would turn out to be), and wrong because quotes themselves only indicate that someone, somewhere, doesn't like Arabs. Let's have scholarly, accredited input, not inflammatory quotes from nutbags. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 03:26, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was asked by an editor on this article to take a look and share my thoughts:
<ul>
<li>I have no reason to believe that the graffiti picture is fake, as similar photos are documented in the (not necessarily English) media and, of course, personal experience. However, for an encyclopedia and when disputed, it is appropriate to request a good source.</li>
<li>The quotes section should be treaded carefully, as adding lists of quotes here would also set a precedent in regard to other articles, such as <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_history_denial_a513.html#Palestinian_denial_of_Jewish_history" title="Israeli-Palestinian history denial">here</a>. As Jayjg said, is there a source that suggests that such quotes are examples of whatever they are supposed to be an example of? Or are editors themselves making such determinations (and therefore doing <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>)? These are all contentious articles, so it is important that whatever viewpoints expressed take into account that they may be setting a precedent on other equally contentious articles.</li>
<li>Having said the above, this article is an example of a propaganda article (of the sort I generally try to avoid, other examples being <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_terrorism.html" title="Palestinian terrorism">Palestinian terrorism</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_terrorism.html" title="Zionist terrorism">Zionist terrorism</a>, etc.) In this case, the article would more suitably be named "Jewish animosity towards Arabs" or something equally un-encyclopedic. When seeing a title such as anti-Arabism, things like discrimination in Europe, Hollywood movies (e.g. Delta Force or The Siege), the Patriot Act, or even MacDonalds' invasion of Arab cities come to mind. To have an article that is entitled "Anti-Arabism" focus almost entirely on Jewish quotes against Arabs or Palestinians is pretty close to defamation (as are articles that are the other way around). Like I said, I've personally focused on more constructive or neutral articles rather than destructive ones, but I'll help out on some aspects of this one if I'm asked to. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:06, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, Ramallite, since you've put the problems of this article more succinctly and fairly than any of the rest of us, I am officially asking you to make an edit of it. As for the picture, my main objection is the "JDL" signature. It is unverified and, really, unverifiable. A press release from the JDL advocating the gassing of Arabs would still be problematic in my mind, but better. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 23:30, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's start with the intro and try to make it more encyclopedic:</p>

<li><i><b>Anti-Arab prejudice</b> is hostility or violence</i>... -- Prejudice is violence?</li>
<li><i>...and, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_American_3e21.html" title="Arab American">Arab Americans</a></i> -- and in Turkey? and in France? Why single out any particluar country in the very first line?</li>
<li><i>clichéd notions about <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> culture.</i> -- I don't find this very compelling. The same may be said about Japanese/Vietnamese/Turkish/Iranian/Russian, etc. cultures.

<dd>I agree with the above. Some cleaning up would be a good idea. I wonder, too, whether the issue of anti-Muslim prejudice clouds the issue of anti-Arab prejudice, that is, is there specifically in the U.S. (just to take an example) a prejudice that extends to Arabs but not to Muslims in general? Would your average Arab-hater make a distinction between an Egyptian Muslim, an Iranian Muslim, and an Afghan Muslim, as only the Egyptian is likely to be Arab? Are people who are "Anti-Arab" therefore by definition anti-Arab Christian as well? <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 00:54, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like Ramallite's version, let's see what others say. As for the quotes, I'm going to revert their addition. For those who insist that the quotes belong: they need to illustrate some point. What is the point here: that Judaism is anti-Arab religion and Israel is anti-Arab state? Yawn. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 08:43, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Arabism_4160.html" title="Edit section: Consensus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consensus</span></h2>
<p>I have just made some minor-ish changes to the first graf, removed some POV there, and removed the POV later in the article. I think it's fair to say at this point that a number of people have commented on the POV of this article, or lack thereof. As I review the comments (and please, if I mischaracterize anyone's position, let me know), I see comments for deletion of Israeli anti-Palestinian or anti-Arab quotes, comments for keeping them, and comments for keeping them but adding more balance to them. Here's how it looks to me:</p>
<p>Delete the quotes: IronDuke, jonasaurus, Humus Sapiens, Ramallite</p>
<p>The quotes page is unbalanced, balance it: Charles P., Unbehagen</p>
<p>Keep it just like it is: Yuber</p>
<p>So, as I make it, there are six people who think the article is biased and one who doesn't. Of the six, two think that the quotes could stay but need to be supplemented by more quotes. In any case, I think what's clear is that there is a consensus that the article cannot remain the way Yuber would like it to remain. To that end, I have made the changes you see.</p>
<p>To add a few more thoughts, I just looked at the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a> article for the first time, and I think it's a wonderful template for this article. There are no quotes there from Arabs demanding the deaths of Jews, nor need there be. The article is balanced, well-written, and scholarly in tone. This article, in some of its iterations, is shrill and unconvincing. But if people are really, really keen on quotes, I won't object as long as it's balanced. But honestly, can't somebody find more quotes from professionals telling us how much anti-Arabism is out there, and why? That kind of quote would be a lot better than quoting anti-Arab rants. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 16:23, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's because all the quotes from Arabs are in article of its own entitled "Arabs and anti-Semitism". I request that you cease from deleting the anti-Arab incidents because you feel that it is imbalanced, instead, make it more balance by quoting non-Jewish anti-Arab personalities.</dd>

<dd><i>More than 75% of Arab Americans are in fact Christian, while terrorism is an international phenomenon.</i> This sentence doesn't make sense to me in this context. What is it telling us? That people who are anti-arab and anti-Muslim aren't very bright? And what does international have to do with anything? <i>The vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists, and victims of terrorist attacks worldwide count many Arabs and Muslims.</i> The vast majority of every ethnicity aren't terrorists. The sentence is pleading with the reader not to hate Arabs. I agree entirely with this sentiment, but not with an emotional appeal in a WP article. And what difference does it make if Arabs or Muslims are victims of terrorism? That people are therefore silly for conflating Arab and terrorist? They may well be, but again, this article should not be about making an argument against ant-Arab prejudice, merely explaining what it is and where it came from. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 16:43, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's not put the quotes back at all until balance has been achieved. Adding one quote from Fallaci isn't balance. But Yuber, since you seem to be very interested in making this article better, can you not locate a quote from a reputable scholar saying why it is that anti-Arabism exists, when it began, etc., a quote that does not blame the Jews for all persecution of Arabs? That would make the article better. Quotes meant to paint Jews as anti-Arab and no one else is, at best, borderline antisemitic. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 18:26, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with IronDuke.

I find the quotes section degrading for the rest of the article and pointless, at least without some supporting text - and unless you believe that vile Jews are out to get you. Instead, what is missing is the history section. Did AA appear in the 20th century? Knowing a little bit about historical racial/ethnic/religious tensions, I'd be surprised if there were no anti-Arab notions present in the medieval Europe, in the British Empire (I remember seeing racist anti-Turk caricatures), Asia, etc. The text should not incite hatred or vie for victimhood status, but provide encyclopedic knowledge so these things won't happen again - or whatever else notable scholars say. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 00:59, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone needs to edit that section immediately. Or, I will do some research and try to write an unbiased opinion. But I do know for a fact that there is a strong nazi-like anti-Arab sentiment among some Iraninians (and Kurds) that should be included in the article.</p>

<p>I think it is best that we merge the anti-Arab article with the article on Islamophobia because the two are tied together. If not, then I think we should complete this article.</p>
<p>On the subject of Anti-Arab in Iran, It seems that hatred against Arabs seem to be very strong in Iranian secularists and nationalists that oppose the "Islamic" regime in Iran, and these haters usually live in Western countries. I have no clue as to whether or not anti-Arabim exists in Iran and to what extent. The only information I have come up thus far is that Arabs in Iran in the past have suffered discrimination:</p>
<p>"The Iranian Arabs' major grievances were discrimination in jobs, under-representation in government posts, and the poverty of the Arab community." -- Collier's Year Book 1979 article: I don't know if that is the present situation, and if this would be considered "anti-Arabism". Also, I like to note that MOST Arabs are totally oblivious to the fact thatsome Iranians have an intense hatred for them and that these Iranians are holding a grudge over an event that occurred over more than 1300 years ago. The event I'm referring to is the Arab conquest of the already deteriorating Sassanid empire. Author Richard Foltz in his article "Internationalization of Islam" states "Even today, many Iranians perceive the Arab destruction of the Sassanid empire as the single greatest tragedy in Iran’s long history."</p>
<p>Also, some Iranians feel that Iran had been Arabized by the "barbaric Arabs" and that Iranians should purge themselves of the "Arab subculture". See <a href="http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/article_11026.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/article_11026.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/article_11026.shtml</a></p>
<p>All this information should be included in the section anti-Arab and Iranians. Furthermore, there has been denounciation of this type of hatred by Iranians even among secularist and nationalists, saying that their beef is with the Islamic regime and theocracy and not with Arabs or the majority of Arabs. Here is denounciation by an Iranian Muslim on the forum of the aforementioned web site: <a href="http://www.iranian.ws/iran_forum/viewtopic.php?t=19" class="external free" title="http://www.iranian.ws/iran_forum/viewtopic.php?t=19" rel="nofollow">http://www.iranian.ws/iran_forum/viewtopic.php?t=19</a> see second post.</p>
<p>Thank God that there is no anti-Persianism among Arabs (as far as I know) phew! That is all for now. --69.85.172.146 04:34, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are we sure that the prejudices among some Hindus are not directed towards Muslims as a whole rather than Arabs in particular? I don't think there is any evidence that Hindutva is anti-Arab, although there is evidence of anti-Islamic attitudes. Arabs and Muslims are not the same. There are many Arab Christians, for instance.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 09:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This statement under the Hindu section, <i>Although not as prevalent as with Iranians ...</i> needs a source to back it up. You have polls conducted in the United States to come up with some idea of how prevalent anti-Arab sentiment in the U.S. But none have been provided as regards Iranian attitudes (in Iran, of course) towards Arabs. Unsourced, the statement is POV. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 02:19, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anti-Arabism among Hindus has to be defined. Is it as basic as negative perceptions of Arabs among common Hindus, or is it as serious as federal anti-Arab policies? This has to be noted. Furthermore, the section just lists events and situations rather than reflect the impact of what these situations has had on Hindus. This could be easily corrected, but it must be cited from a notable source--<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 07:36, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have removed two sentences relating to workers' rights in the UAE as this is unrelated to anti-Arabism. Unless someone can come up with a good reason as to why South Asians in the Middle East have anything to do with alleged anti-Arabism among Hindus, then this should be left out. I am still uncomfortable about the anti-Arabism among Hindus section as I do not believe the case is substantiated enough. Yes, there is anti-Muslim sentiment in India (as the Gujarat massacre shows), but it is far more directed towards Pakistan and Indian Muslims than towards Arabs. I have visited India many times and have not seen any evidence of anti-Arabism. In fact, India has long been supportive of the Palestinian struggle. I think that unless we can come up with a definition that shows specific anti-Arab hatred as a phenomenon among Hindus, then the section should be removed entirely.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 17:34, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, if you read up on Hindutva propaganda, they are virulently anti-Arab and anti-Muslim. They are also pro-Zionist and anti-Palestinian. But that's Hindutva - I don't know whether their ideas are popular amongst most Hindus, but I don't think its likely considering how fringe their views often are. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 20:41, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Amartya Sen reference is good. However, consider:</dd>
<dd>1. Hindutva is a socio-political ideology and not religious.</dd>
<dd>2. Not all Hindus either support it or believe in its ideology.</dd>
<dd>3. Even, support for the BJP, the so-called Hindu Nationalist party, does not automatically translate in support for Hindutva. Support might be due to its economic policies, non-support for Congress (the other major political party in India), local factors, host of any number of reasons etc.</dd>
<dd>I have no problems with the article as such, only with this section, and specifically with that sentence. It claims <i>many</i> without any basis, and clearly falls into the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a> category. I agree with your racial/religious argument. My suggestion is to either delete the section or to change <i>Hindus</i> to <i>Hindutva Supporters</i> or some such title.<a href="../../../b/e/s/User%7EBesidesamiracle_de76.html" title="User:Besidesamiracle">gunslotsofguns</a> 11:12, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that not all Hindus support Hindutva. But also among those who do not support Hindutva, there are strong anti-Muslim sentiments - few Hindus would allow their sons or daughters to marry a Muslim, for instance. Whether this transfers to an anti-Arab sentiment is another matter, for anti-Muslim and anti-Arab are quite difference matters. In some sense, Hindutva makes more arguments against Arabs as a malign and alien influence that brought Islam to India. They want Muslims to either convert to Hinduism or become more "Indian". This goes beyond simple prejudice against a religion and interprets Arab as oppositional to Hindu or Indian (which are often conflated by Hindutva "intellectuals"). So, I don't know how you would title the section, since anti-Arab sentiments are not exclusive to Hindutva but the level of anti-Arab sentiment among Hindus is hard to quantify particularly when it is not articulated as such. Perhaps "anti-Arabism in India" could be a better title.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 11:39, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The marriage issue is a South Asian thing, and affects not only inter-faith marriages, but inter-community, inter-lingual, inter-ethnic, inter-regional and what have you. That does not necessarily mean they are all anti-all the other communities. Moreover like you said this has no connection to anti-arabism. So this section should not contain the word <i>Hindus</i> in the first place. Also Hindutva is not confined to India, so that would be correct title either. Hindutva is a fringe movement within the greater right-wing ideology which might have leanings towards anti-arabism and the title should reflect that.--<a href="../../../b/e/s/User%7EBesidesamiracle_de76.html" title="User:Besidesamiracle">gunslotsofguns</a> 12:04, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding marriage, I was attempting to distinguish between general prejudice and the politicisation of prejudice, which in my mind is what Hindutva represents. I do not believe that Hindutva is a fringe movement at all. It is central to the Sangh Parivar, which includes the BJP (the second largest party in India), the RSS (one of the biggest mass organisations in India) and the VHP (an evangelical Hindu organisation). It also includes organisations outside the Sangh Parivar, such as Shiv Sena. Hindutva as a political movement involves Indians, including those who are non-resident. But you can hardly say that Hindutva extends to non-Indians (even in the context of Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand). I think only "Anti-Arabism among Indians" or "Anti-Arabism in India" should be applicable. If Hindus elsewhere are anti-Arab, then we can have Anti-Arabism in Guyana or Fiji, although I don't think religion has been politicised in these countries.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 12:11, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Further it contains just one line dealing with the topic which is grammatically wrong and contains <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>.

I have no problem deleting it but you removed it without a valid reason, so I returned it. Also, Malkin is very controversial, Ann Coulter-controversial. I don't know why we should have special consideration for Malkin's opinion. However, her perspective could be added if it is prevalent, i.e. shared by a number of notable (not controversial) people and organizations.

<dd>Ann Coulter's comments on anti-Arabism and on anti-Arab organizations are not in the article (if there are any), but some of her anti-Arab comments are -- as examples of anti-Arabism. Anyway, to include Malkin comments into the article, you should make it clear to the reader that Malkin tends to hold a controversial position on some issues, e.g. she defends the internment of Japanese Americans during the World War II and she is also accused for making unfounded accusations and poorly researched arguments <a href="http://www.campusprogress.org/tools/141/know-your-right-wing-speakers-michelle-malkin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campusprogress.org/tools/141/know-your-right-wing-speakers-michelle-malkin" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. And many feel that she is critical of Islam. But it is best we don't include her opinion at all as she lacks credibility. However, if a credible organization holds this opinion then it could be mentioned, but not in this article, i.e. an accusation should be mentioned in the entries on either the accuser or the accused, perhaps both. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 03:24, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, she is controversial since she tends to hold (what are preceived to be) controversial opinions. For example, many from all political sides have criticized her justification of the internment of Japanese Americans and she has also been criticized for claiming that some of John Kerry's injuries in the Vietnam War were self-inflicted. And if you have read my previous postings, you would know that I have cited sources that criticize Malkin for her tactics. Also, read the Wikipedian article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Malkin_6e09.html" title="Michelle Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a>, which has a section on her controversies. And must I mention that columnist Bronwyn Lance Chester states that Malkin "habitually mistakes shrill for thought provoking and substitutes screaming for discussion… She's the worst of what's wrong with punditry today. She adds absolutely nothing to genuine political discourse." Furthermore, she accuses ADC of exaggeration, I don't know why this would be in this particular article since this article deals with anti-Arabism and not with organizations that report anti-Arabism. Concerning the blog, it was not listed under sources, it's listed under external links. I have reviewed the policy on External links as I have stated, and there is nothing against placing relevant blogs in external links, did you read the policy?--<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 06:50, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are being purposefully obtuse. "Racism against Arabs" (which is what the Sydney Race riots clearly were) and "anti-Arabism" are one and the same.

<dd>Pecher: So, let me get this straight. If a Nigerian is set upon by a gang of white skinheads in London and a politician says it is a racist attacks, you would contend that the politician is not clear about what kind of racism it referred to and would refute the suggestion that it they were referring to anti-black racism and could mean anti-Nigerian racism? And if a Russian Jew was knifed in the street and the attack was called racist, would you argue that he was killed because he was Russian rather than Jewish? I just want to understand your logic and what you think racism is.--210.211.238.138 14:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this context, obviously not. Perhaps you should read the report. It states that the riots were started by white racists. Quotes from the article:</dd>

<dd>"NSW Police Minister Carl Scully said "white supremacists" were among those who took part in the riots."</dd>

<dd>"A white nationalist group said the violence could spread to Melbourne. The Patriotic Youth League, whose members distributed "Aussies Fighting Back" pamphlets at Cronulla on Sunday, said it had been inundated with callers wanting to riot in Melbourne."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty said federal and state police forces would investigate whether there was any evidence that white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups were organising themselves nationally."</dd>

<dd>Thank you. And to Pecher: there may or may not have been racism on both sides, but that doesn't change the fact that the riots have been widely described as racist, and one side was Arab (Lebanese) and faced racist violence. Hence, anti-Arab racism. Feel free to also argue that the race riots were an anti-White racist incident on the anti-Whitism page.

<li>Asserting that extreme views expressed in an editorial on "The Persian Journal" or Iranian.ws, a personal/political website based outside Iran, represents the views of a significant number of Iranians, by labeling the obscure website a "popular Iranian media outlet".</li>

<dd>So nice to see you engage in dialogue for a change!</dd>
<dd>1. Anti-Arabism among Iranians does not refer to all Iranians, as made clear in that section, with reference to an objection to The Persian Journal - so your concerns are groundless</dd>
<dd>2. The citation is just before the sentence. I will move it to the end of the sentence, just so it is clearer to you.</dd>
<dd>3. I will take that sentence out for you.</dd>
<dd>4. I will take out the word "popular".</dd>
<dd>5. It can hardly be called "original research" if it uses secondary sources.</dd>
<dd>For your information, I have put forward in the article the common claim that Shamkhani is proof of social mobility of Iranian Arabs. If you want that taken out because there is no citation, I can do that. I have, however, cited a source to show that some Iranians believe Arabs were loyal to Iran in the Iran-Iraq War. Do you disagree with that as well? The Amnesty International report is fairly clear about discrimination against Arabs under the present political system.

<dd>If "Anti-Arabism among Iranians" does not refer to all Iranians, then you are admitting that the title is misleading and should be changed. Also, taking out the word "popular" from the description of Iranian.ws, simply won't do it.

<dd>It is not a personal website. The article makes no mention of a "significant" portion of Iranian society holding these views marginal. The article cannot state it is "marginal" as that would be a POV, no? In fact, I linked to a complaint by an Iranian published on the same website stating that the views are racist and marginal, which should put it into perspective from a neutral observer's position.</dd>

Hence, Anti-Arabism among the Iranians, Americans, French. There is no suggestion that all Iranians, Americans and French are anti-Arab. In fact, I have tried to show that not all Iranians hate Arabs and not all Iranians think their Arab community is traitorous. Look at the citations I used. So, I have made no conclusions about Iranians, just showed that some hold anti-Arab views, just as some Arabs hold anti-Jewish views.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 20:12, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, debate on the wording of the section you are disputing. You are saying you will impose your editing on the article after the block is lifted. If the matter is disputed, then perhaps it would be better to reach consensus before hand. Judging by what you have said, it should be a simple matter of changing the wording, e.g. "some", "many", etc. But the section itself looks like it is attempting NPOV and is well sourced. More sources are used in that section than many articles on Wikipedia. If you have more sources, then it is a case of "the more, the merrier". Again, how does the article cast aspersion on Shamkhani? It states that his appointment is used as proof of Arab social mobility in Iran. I can't see how this is "anti-Iranian propaganda cooked up by the Bush team advocates", but perhaps you can enlighten us all.--<a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.110.92.95.html" title="User:88.110.92.95">88.110.92.95</a> 17:40, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some and many are subjective words. Some could mean 12 people, or it could mean 12000 people. Besides, the second sentence is misleading anyway. Arab Iranians are "Iranians". And secondly, they did play a significant role in defending the land. It doesnt need to be stressed by anyone. saying: "However, many Iranians have stressed the role Iran's Arab population played in defending Iran during" basically implies the possibility that the Arabs necessarily didnt play a significant role.

The view point you are presenting as fact is only substantiated by <i>one</i> subjective British reporter. The truth as he sees it. I dont see any evidence showing otherwise. And besides, you still havent defined what "some" means. 2 people? 200000 people? Or just 2 wishful thinkers? Furthermore, I am the one, not you, calling for diversification and inclusion of "all views"; The article as it stands is only from the minority perspective of the separatist advocate.</dd>

<p>paragraph 4 talks of an Amnesty claim about "Gozinesh" discrimination without mentioning the fact that a similar plight is experienced by other minorities of Iran, women of Iran, students of Iran, and even Persians of Iran. The majority of the political prisoners of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evin_prison.html" title="Evin prison">Evin prison</a> are in fact Persian. And notice the word "Gozinesh" on the placard held by the student protester (protesting student gozinesh laws): <a href="http://www.isna.ir/Main/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-722014-1&amp;Lang=P" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isna.ir/Main/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-722014-1&amp;Lang=P" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></p>
<p>I'd like to know which area of Iran is experiencing a booming economy where Khuzestan is not. Iran is kept alive only because of its subsidized economy.

<p>Furthermore, the Amnesty link, like always is false in claiming that: "schools are <i>reportedly</i> not allowed to teach through the medium of Arabic". I have already proven the <b>fallacy</b> of this statement before. Not only is modern Arabic <b>mandatory</b> for all Iranians, teaching via the Arabic medium is in fact allowed thru "gheyr e entefa'i" schools, as guaranteed by Article 15 of Iran's constitution.</p>
<p>Being an Arab is encouraged by Ahmadinejad's govt. Being a Persian is what is frowned upon. Up until a few years ago, non-Arabic names like "Zhila" were not even allowed for naming newborns by the govt. But they always encourage Arabic names like salih, meqdad, ehsan, meitham, ...</p>
<p>The article makes no mention of any of this.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 23:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article propagates inaccuracy by concealing relevant information. The article is quick to point out poverty in the province. Yet it makes no mention at all of any of the industrial and economic projects (whose money is coming from other provinces) <a href="http://branch.isna.ir/mainkhouzestan/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-40262-1" class="external text" title="http://branch.isna.ir/mainkhouzestan/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-40262-1" rel="nofollow">(e.g. The Razi Petrochemical plant that comes online this year</a>, investment in local universities by the govt <a href="http://branch.isna.ir/mainkhouzestan/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-40158-2" class="external text" title="http://branch.isna.ir/mainkhouzestan/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-40158-2" rel="nofollow">(seen here e.g. is a Robotics competition in Ahvaz University)</a>, or other national projects <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4498932.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4498932.stm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></p>
<p>The artcile makes it sound like the "policies" of depriving Khuzestan are ethnically driven, whereas in fact in reality they are only results of an incredibly corrupted and highly inefficient state controlled economy.</p>
<p>Why doesnt the article make no mention that provincs like <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohkiluyeh_and_Buyer_Ahmad_Province_869c.html" title="Kohkiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad Province">Kohkiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad Province</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistan_and_Baluchistan_Province_2314.html" title="Sistan and Baluchistan Province">Sistan and Baluchistan Province</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/a/Ilam_Province_e590.html" title="Ilam Province">Ilam Province</a>, and a few others are even more destitute than Khuzestan?</p>
<p>Is it not merely to provoke an emotional response against Irana and Iranians?</p>
<p>That's why this article is a sham. When there are thousands of people in the heart of the capital of Iran selling their kidneys to bring bread to the table <a href="http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=7282&amp;NewsKind=Current+Affairs&amp;ArchiveNews=Yes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=7282&amp;NewsKind=Current+Affairs&amp;ArchiveNews=Yes" rel="nofollow">[29]</a><a href="http://www.iranian.com/News/1999/June/kidney.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranian.com/News/1999/June/kidney.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, articles like these talking of "poverty in Khuzestan" just reek with anti-Iranian racist drivel.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 23:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>If the world's leading human rights organisation devotes an entire section of a report on Iran to the discrimination of Arabs, then does it not deserve a mention in an article on Anti-Arabism?

<dd>Is there any evidence that I broke Wikipedia rules? No, none at all. I was editing using an anon IP because some editors go crazy whenever they see the spelling "Ahwaz". It was an attempt to stop racist abuse, baseless accusations and stalking so I could get on with editing other articles, many completely unrelated to Iran or the Middle East. This is regarded as a legitimate use of sockpuppets.

<p>How would people feel about moving this page to "Anti-Arab racism" and keeping "Anti-Arabism" as a redirect to "Anti-Arab racism"?</p>
<p>The reason I'm suggesting this is because the page <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> has become bogged down with arguments about the <i>term</i> "Islamophobia" rather than the <i>meaning</i> and <i>extent</i> of Islamophobia and a secondary page <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Muslim_sentiment_ce28.html" title="Anti-Muslim sentiment">Anti-Muslim sentiment</a> has had to be created as a storehouse for things which don't qualify the rigid definition of Islamophobia that some are insisting upon.</p>
<p>Also, anti-Arab racism is more commonly used than anti-Arabism according to Google - (76,000 vs 16,000).</p>
<p>So far this page hasn't become bogged down with arguments about the term anti-Arabism, but it may be in the future. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> 02:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe the cartoon is a political one. The cartoonist made sure to let the word "Saudis" and not "Arabs" appear on the robe. What i am wondering about is this... Liftarn link got a very important point! It is easy and smart for anti-Arabist cartoonists to add a country name on the cartoon so to avoid controversy. Compare the two cartoons at the link provided by Liftarn above. According to some apologists, one is 'purely anti-semitic' while the other is just 'anti-Arafat/Mahmoud' and not even 'anti-Palestinian'.

<p>There's nothing currently in the article saying that arabs are the targets of cartoons. Shouldn't there be well-written, well-cited prose first, and then the addition of pictures? Preferably cartoons that have been criticised by notable sources, rather than ones chosen by wikipedians using google. Or maybe use a movie screenshot (chosen by a notable source) rather than a cartoon, if movies are the main source of anti-arabism. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 13:54, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, Islamophobia is nothing but a ridicules concept that has been created in order to allege that those that dare to critizise the totalitarian Islamic ideology is somehow insane. To claim that "Islamophobia" actually exist or is anything but an Islamic propaganda concept, is very biased. Your original research comparison between anti-Arabism, which in some cases is a kind of racism, and concept of "Islamophobia" is as biased as it gets.</dd>

<dd>"Exactly what I expect, you're trying to enforce your biased POV in the article. Just because YOU think that Islamophobia is a ridiculous propaganda concept, doesn't mean we should treat it as such." There are many notable scholars that has critizised it for being nothing more than a Islamic tool to silence criticism of Islam, and to choose a side and allege that it isn't, is what is biased and against the neutral point of view that Wikipedia should be written according to. The content you want to include imply that the concept is real, and that is biased.</dd>
<dd>"All I can do right now or in the near future as a solution is to attribute the comparison to a reliable organization." Hmm.. Such as CAIR or Runnymede Trust I guess? LOL!</dd>

<dd>The concept of Islamophobia is real, a description was provided by several organizations, and the term is widely used, whether you think the concept is ridiculous or insane doesn't matter. It is a concept just like any other, and every concept has its critics as well as its proponents (that is, they support that this concept is legitimate). Don't try to attempt to turn the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> into a polemic criticizing the concept.

<dd>I already addressed this point, it's original research to assume it says anything about anyone beyond saudis. If a Jordanian made a similar poster about a Saudi, would that be called anti-Arab? No, of course not. It's a criticism of a country, not an ethnicity.
