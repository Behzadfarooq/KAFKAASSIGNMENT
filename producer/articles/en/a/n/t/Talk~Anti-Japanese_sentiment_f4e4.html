<p>Piccolo66.68.34.174 02:55, 2 May 2005 (UTC) \\this article was waaaaay more neutral than I expected it to be; but THis is actually a bad article. Whether to attribute it to bias or mere idiocy is just wrong, because Ive realized that wikipedia actually does do a pristine job with regard to the facts. SOme edits will take care of this though. It contains some common misconceptions, and uses the "high end" of statistics only with regards to how much damage japan did in WW2</p>
<p>I've glimpsed through the article. I don't really think it was biased one way or another. Sense this is such a emotional subject I hope people are careful of what they write.-Usni</p>
<p>Poo-T, are you sure about what you know about Korean history and the facts in the past? Do you think that you are unbiased to edit any articles relating to Korean history? I might see Japan the same way as you do about Korea. (a Korean student)</p>
<p>I know I'm not a God&#160;:P) Then, could you write the reason to write to the top of the talk, not related to the other discussions, without logging in, without a timestamp. And I'm not a God, so I can't understand what you want with me. If you want to change the text I wrote, please specify the part. Is this the page you want to change? What we can do is discuss with resources. As you know, there are many records about Korea in Japan, so discussing between Koreans and Japanese would make a better description. --<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoo-T_c85f.html" title="User:Poo-T">Poo-T</a> 6 Nov 2004</p>

<p>This article needs to have something way back, more comprehensive, like the 1895 war with Japan and World War II. Anti-Japanese sentiment wasnt a product of the 1990s economic gap. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareware_de22.html" title="User:Wareware">Wareware</a> 08:33, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>That, of course goes in the history section, which is not written yet. Also, it isn't explicitly stated but the current "China" section does not refer to Republic of China, but instead to People's Republic of China. Thus it wouldn't make sense to include them under the "China" section. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 03:17, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This piece is at most parts badly written, and its overall tone is racist. In my humble opinion, it should be deleted or fully rewritten.</p>
<p>Whenever anything about racism involving the Japanese is written, someone comes out claiming "racism" with no facts to back up their claims. Would you care to back them up with facts instead of "feeling" or maybe contribute about how the Japanese were discriminated against in your country? On the Asian Cup 2004, I have pictures, beside links already attached, that proves what I wrote. In fact, I have yet to write on many facts, like "A good Jap is a dead Jap" that an American general said, similar to "A good Indian is a dead Indian" or renaming of "Jap Street" in Texas. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 12:53, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Parts of "I am a Japanese" section are near incoherent. Should minor (and seemingly unsubstantiated) instances of vaguely anti-Japanese feelings be included? The general tone of that section, and to a lesser extent the entire article, is rather hostile. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriedBunny_c0d1.html" title="User:FriedBunny">FriedBunny</a> 10:17, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The author alleges that Jiang Zemin, Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zedong <i>et al</i> have slandered Japan and sought to improve their political standing by spreading anti-Japanese sentiment, without any scrap of proof. He seems convinced that they are trying to cover up their wrongdoings by demonizing the Jpanaese.</p>
<p>The article also lacks a consideration for the the hard facts of the matter; that Japan <b>did</b> behave in a barbaric matter, as the <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanjing_Massacre_c0d3.html" title="Nanjing Massacre">Nanjing Massacre</a>, and the Three All Campaign (Kill All, Burn All, Destroy All) in the later part of the Sino-Japanese War, not to mention the biological warfare experiments (such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_731.html" title="Unit 731">Unit 731</a>) on Chinese POWs.</p>
<p>The author further alleges that a New York Times writer has spread inflammatory comments about Japan without even providing concrete evidence, or naming said writer.</p>
<p>If the author has evidence for the alleged denial of services to the Japanese National Team in the Asian Cup 2004, please post them. An external link or a (Credited) picture would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Finally, the author seems to think that every Chinese, every Korean of both factions, behave in an anti-Japanese manner. This is not true at all! Racism is not unversal; not all chinese or Koreans or Americans behave in this manner.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, Mao Zedong nor Deng Xiaoping are not credited with using anti-Japanese sentiments. In fact, they are credited for not turning to anti-Japanese sentiments as an easy way out. Only Jiang Zemin is credited, but as his move to consolidate his power. You never even read the article.</dd>

<dd><i>Three All Campaign</i> (三光作戦) is not a Japanese plan. It is Republic of China's plan against PRoC forces. Funny thing is, the Chnese character "光" has meaning "to completely" only in Chinese but it is used on a Japanese plan. In Japanese, by the way, this would be called "a war of extermination" (殲滅戦). Much like the Vietnam War, communist forces used small villages to base their operations unlike the RoC army that used cities as their bases. Increasingly becoming paranoid of inflitrations, RoC commenced <i>Three All Campaign</i> to try to destroy the support communist troops were getting. The biggest proof that this is not a Japanese plan is the claim of <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanjing_Massacre_c0d3.html" title="Nanjing Massacre">Nanjing Massacre</a> itself. Was the city burned and destroyed like <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Uprising_14d1.html" title="Warsaw Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> or like even an average siege? No, only deaths are recorded and even those claim that massacre occured pointed out that people were marched out to an open ground before shot.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_731.html" title="Unit 731">Unit 731</a> is in dispute, and that makes it a POV article. Also, even if it is true, the member of Unit 731 behaved barbaric and that does not mean Japan was barbaric. You can't claim that Japan was barbaric. Does the genocide of Jewish make German and Austrian as well as occupied area or even French barbaric? Does barbaric behaviors in battles on the Eastern front make German and Russian barbaric? Does the Italy's use of nerve gases against Ethiopian troops make them barbaric? Does the torture of Iraqi prisoner make American barbaric? Why does only against Japan does someone comes out saying "Japan is barbaric!"? This is precisely the anti-Japanese sentiment this article will and should address.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If you look at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_731.html" title="Unit 731">Unit 731</a>, "In August 2002, the Tokyo District Court acknowledged the existence of Unit 731 and its biological warfare activities, but ruled that all compensation issues were settled by the Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China of September 29, 1972." So, if the source is trustworthy, the past existence of Unit 731 is no longer in disupte. But, in response to your question, what matters to me is that people apologize for their mistakes. Japan alone, of all the countries and their associated atrocities that you've listed, has remained silent about and even defensive of their past actions. Many people like me believe that Japan is practicing mainstream abuse of historical revisionism, and in all outward appearances Japan seems proud of its past "achievements." Has there been an investigation by the Japanese government into its past crimes? Has it every officially apologized for its history? Their mistakes? These are the things I would like to see before I ever look on Japan as a nation that regrets what it did. Japan never admitted its mistakes. In fact, the existence of such a thing like Yasukuni Shrine, where convicted, dead war criminals are enshrined, and the fact that the prime minister visits it to pay respect to those who have done the human race evil... It's an outrage: consider if Germany did that with Hitler, supposing that they found the body, or if Russia did that with Stalin. What is Japan's rationale for this stupendously, surrealistically bizarre tribute? -<a href="../../../d/o/e/User%7EDoesPHalt_072b.html" title="User:DoesPHalt">doesPHalt</a> 12 Nov 2004</dd>

<dd>Your sentence doesn't make sense. If your are saying there are some racists in every culture, that's precisely the point. If you read <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentrism.html" title="Ethnocentrism">Ethnocentrism</a>, you should realize that "Racism has to be universal". For example, food customs can be different from one country to another. In Japan and China, one can hold a rice bowl in their hand while eating. In Korea, this is called "the eating habit of slaves" and a bad habit. When a Korean sees Chinese or Japanese holding a rice bowl, he cannot help sneer that these men are behaving like a slave. This is from an upbringing in Korean customs and he probably doesn't realize that his attitude is wrong. It is not his fault that he is behaving like a racist, but the fault of society that doesn't teach torelance. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 17:17, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excuse me for interrupting, but I do not understand why you think that Koreans "sneer" at Chinese and Japanese for eating from a hand-held rice bowl. I'm a Korean (or at least half-Korean), and I've seen a lot of East Asians eat like that, and not once did I have a negative impression about them. In fact, even Koreans, when in a hurry, eat rice while holding their bowl. What, is this another stereotype Japanese racists have created to humiliate their Koreans neighbors or this a random guess? In my personal opinion, it's probably both.</p>
<p>P.S. "It is not his fault that he is behaving like a racist, but the fault of society that doesn't teach torelance." Where do you get your obviously biased views? I'm sure the Japanese society is not one renowned for admission of guilt or telling the truth, as one can see when viewing a whitewashed Japanese history textbook.</p>
<p>Tolerance?!! The Japanese don't even know the meaning of that word. Look how many instances of ethnic discrimination occur when Japanese (and racist) employers decline to employ a <b>naturalized</b> citizen of foreign ethnicity. At least Korean employers hire naturalized citizens. Not only that, even prime ministers in Japan speak publicly about the "pureness" of their people and scorn etnic minorities. And now, they want to talk about "tolerance in other countries". Now, that's what I call BS. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonhart_1a99.html" title="User:Leonhart">Leonhart</a></p>

中華 (zhonghua) is just the name for China, coming from 中國 (<i>lit: "middle country"</i>), a long-used name for China and 華夏, the valley that Chinese civilization grew out of. I doubt that Chinese who say zhonghua really think that they're in the "center of the rich", anymore than any Japanese think that 日本 (Japan) is the source of the rising sun. Neither do Chinese think that Americans (美國) are all beautiful, or that English (英國) are all heroes. Sheesh!

<p>易性革命 does not mean that current government's need to mudsling past government in order to justify its existance. It means that when a government fails to play its role in the stability of the country, a new government is justified to wage a conflict and replace the previous government.

<p>Now this is getting really really stupid. Some of you people really over-emphasize japanese influence in Chinese politics. You wrote that Deng and company resorted to teaching the greatness of CCP and China and bashing Japan for their own political gain. Where on earth did you get that from? In fact, Deng did quite the opposite by abandoning socialism and moving towards capitalist reforms. And at no point did his government ever try to justify the killings in the Cultural Revolution by diverting it to japanese brutality. He even sort of denounced Mao by saying that it was a mistake that the Chinese people paid dearly for it. The movement of anti-japanese sentiment didnt begin in earnest until the late 70s to 80s when the issue of Daoyutai was brought to the spotlight and many Chinese (both taiwan ROC and china PRC) overseas engaged in passionate protests in "保釣運動". And why the hell would Jiang Zemin use this sentiment to consolidate his power? What's the connection and practical application of it? It seems that whoever wrote it just put down whatever spurious reason that came to his thick skull. The recent surge in anti-japanese sentiment is trigged not by the government's diversions or whatever, but by the nationalist feelings in many Chinese students. These students are different from the generation of the Tiannmen protests in that they are very natiionalistic and have confidence in their country. In the fifteen years after the protests, China grew politically and economically with stability and that provided the Chinese with a nationalistic feeling, that China is going to reclaim its status as a great regional power again, something that's eluded it for the past 150 years of war, foreign invasion and internal strife. That's where anti-japanese sentiments come from, not from government-directed pretexts for presumed internal weakness, but from a genuine sense of Chinese nationalism, stability, and bright prospects that the Chinese look forward to. This is why I deleted the whole dumbass and incoherent paragraph regarding the CCP's role in anti-japanese sentiment. The numbnut who wrote it really needs a reality check. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareware_de22.html" title="User:Wareware">Wareware</a> 06:34, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's almost a year since the above was written and Wareware (who sounds like a Japanese but is actually a Taiwanese -- ethnic Chinese, presumably -- studying in the US) deleted the entire section, unchallenged. . It's hard to see what basis he has for dismissing the claims above and deleting this material.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, it is perfectly possible that China would resort to anti-Japanese sentiment in order to divert attention from problems at home, especially during a period of rapid economic development when all kinds of frustrations are going to emerge. Of course they are not going to say straight out, 'Look, don't bother about the killings in the Cultural Revolution, just look at Japanese brutality instead.' But the effect is the same.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The view of the development anti-Japanese sentiment expressed in the deleted section is widely believed in Japan. Whether you disagree with it or not, it should be noted. As it reads now, the whole issue of anti-Japanese sentiment reads like it is a 'natural outcome' of all the vicious things the Japanese did during the war. This is not the case. These young people are not fresh out of the Nanjing Massacre, they never experienced any brutality at the hands of the Japanese. They are fresh out of the highly biassed Chinese education system. There is a history of anti-Japanese sentiment, and how it has been manipulated, that needs to be addressed. Simply noting Japanese wartime atrocities 60 years ago is not enough.</dd>

<dd>This section is quite true: 'The recent surge in anti-japanese sentiment is trigged not by the government's diversions or whatever, but by the nationalist feelings in many Chinese students. These students are different from the generation of the Tiannmen protests in that they are very natiionalistic and have confidence in their country.'

<p>I wrote a major revision on the US section because the previous version is just too damn stupid and uninformative. None of the examples fit with so-called anti-Japanese sentiment, because these things can be said just about any country and there's no specific evidence that it's "anti-Japan." They are more or less focused on the reporter's ignorance instead of observations of a national trend. They add nothing to the article and just look like a bunch of random ramblings by somebody who just scour the net to find whatever article as remotely related as possible. That's why I did a major revision focusing on the cause, rogression, and concrete examples that are definitely anti-Japanese, instead of lousy stuff that's patched up to fill up space. I think we should restructure the article into the history and examples for each particular country (certainly China and the US have their own reasons) instead of skimming the root causes and then coming up with spurious and random incidences and pointing the blame on victim countries. . <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareware_de22.html" title="User:Wareware">Wareware</a> 08:50, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

Outsourcing is when a business process (tire and wheel assembly) is moved to a company outside of the parent coporation (could be a foreign company or not).

EVen that article isnt perfect; or instance, 300,000 is the statistic touted by the CCP; everywhere else the estimate is a low of 40,000 and a hight of 200,000 (statistics in the china was are very imprecise). I know statistics are never accurate but communist sympathizers can get a lot done by "trimming" every here and there. Yeah, i guess more anti-communist bias from me, but my bias is at least based on fact.</p>

<p>About the Asian Cup 2004 Final, this article only mentioned the "mbassador's car was severely damaged", but does not have a word about he cause, which is the Japanese team scored a goal in the match by hand!</p>
<p>+This article appears to me to be rather disparate, badly constructed and totally unquotable (mostly due to its lack of competent editorship). But I find little that suggests anything blatantly biased or uninformed. As someone had said in the above section, it would really be desirable if some international body would intervene, just to clarify the facts from the disputed facts. Anyway, from my own experience, --although I have no academic experience in Japan-- it has been difficult to acquire reliable sources in the Japanese language (the reasons for this is complex and not entirely out of convenience for the right-wing, atrocity-denying faction of the Japanese--which has always been minute). However, the task is not made a whole lot easier by searching in the English language either.</p>
<p>It would be ideal for the integrity of the article to focus primarily on the anti-Japanese sentiments and their "reasons," rather than anything claiming that the Japanese (government) had done this and that to "compensate," as such; I think moving that to a new article dealing with the post-war Japanese acts regarding wartime atrocities, would be most beneficial. (or even included in the history of modern Japan) I think the move to post a new article concerning the problematic Japanese textbooks has been entirely successful.</p>
<p>All in all, this is an article of acceptable neutrality. But it is in dire need of some definitive editorship. <a href="../../../r/u/i/User%7ERuiinaba_ec4f.html" title="User:Ruiinaba">RuiInaba</a> 14:09, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

I have partly rewritten the section on anti-Japanese sentiment in China. I do not regard this as a perfect edit and people should feel free to rewrite it. I will be frank and admit that it does not make any appeal to objective sources. The main focus of changes is:</p>
<ul>
<li>To cut out some of the detailed enumerations of Japanese atrocities in WWII. These atrocities should be covered in articles specifically devoted to them; we don't need the full litany repeated here. (Rehashing them here is more an <i>expression</i> of anti-Japanese sentiment than an explanation of why such sentiment exists.) I also cut out some of the rather clumsy and obvious counter-arguments inserted by Japanese contributors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To remedy in a very small way the charge that the article is 'rather disparate, badly constructed and totally unquotable', I've inserted a few sentences on Japanese apologies, Yasukuni, textbooks, etc. The emphasis is on how Japan is perceived by the Chinese. I've also added a note on Japanese ODA and why it doesn't seem to have helped calm down anti-Japanese sentiment. This section is probably more impressionistic than it should be, although I've tried to be reasonably even-handed. If someone can do a better job (or create a totally new entry dealing with issues in detail), please feel free to go ahead!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've slightly rewritten the section on anti-Japanese demonstrations. I do not regard these riots as having 'broken out'. They were organized by certain elements; I personally received SMs calling for participation in the demonstrations. The government appears to have initially condoned the demonstations before eventually coming out and directing the populace not to hold any more. Writing a full account of these demonstrations requires a lot more access to and appraisal of information from many sources.</li>

<p>Were the Boxers "invaders" or anything that can be compared to the Japanese imperialists? Though I understand that Boxers may fit into the context of the topics regarding "anti-[some particular people]", but we must keep in mind that western imperialists, including the Japanese, had already invaded China and took over large parts of it BEFORE the Boxer rebellion.

<p>I have added a section on the political manipulation of anti-Japanese sentiment. I have done so because there is a need to address the common perception that everything that happens in China is orchestrated by that 'Commie dictatorship', which is surprisingly prevalent in some parts of the West. This section should be regarded as a draft. I have been unable to avoid being 'weaselly'. <b>If you disagree with it or feel that what is said does not have sufficient basis, please edit accordingly</b>.</p>

<p>The following statement is incorrect. I will remove it within one week unless somebody provides references for it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In Europe, some people in countries like United Kingdom and Netherlands express anti-Japanese sentiment as a result of the Europeans powers' loss of their Asian colonies, following World War II."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Dutch generally did not blame the Japanese for their loss of colonies but they blamed the Indonesians "insurgents" like Sukarno who collaborated with the Japanese, in a similar vein as the Dutch traitors who colloborated with the Germans during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>There was/is anti-Japanese sentiment in the Netherlands for two different reasons</p>
<ol>
<li>due to Japanese competition in the 1980s, very similar to the anti-Japanese sentiment in the USA e.g. competion of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philips.html" title="Philips">Philips</a> electronics</li>
<li>treatment of the Dutch people in camps during WWII by the Japanese.</li>

<p>I was curious what 續日本紀 reads as. It's certainly not Kojiki or Nihonshoki, and I cannot seem to find any English-language sites that refer to it, or even Japanese sites that give the yomikata. I think it would be nice, if we're going to include kanji in the article, to include the pronunciation as well. Besides, if it were, for example, Kojiki, it would be much more useful to simply write "Kojiki" than "Chonicle of Japan" or "Chronicle of Ancient Matters", don't you think?

<p>As a Sinologist, I find the "sinocentric" theory to be an excellent example of bad scholarship. I admit it's probably a theory that some subscribe to, but it's worth adding in the reasons why it's such a bad mischaracterization of China during the medieval times. The current section almost makes it sound like this laughable concept actually has some truth to it, which is very far from reality. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 04:47, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some time ago I made some changes to the Sinocentrism section as rewritten by Xuanwu. The reason was that the section had turned into a detailed presentation and refutation of Sinocentrism, almost like a mini-debate. This is not the place to do this. All that is needed is to note that some Japanese regard Chinese anti-Japanese sentiment as a reflection of Sinocentrism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is actually a Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinocentrism.html" title="Sinocentrism">Sinocentrism</a>, although it is still far from satisfactory. I moved the detailed refutations of Sinocentrism to the Sinocentrism article itself as they seem to belong there, not in the article on anti-Japanese sentiment. (Personally I don't feel that the points made are very effective because it is possible to be Sinocentric, or Eurocentric, or U.S.-centric, while giving credit to others for having attained your level, as it were).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've also played down the point, made several times in the rewrite, that Sinocentrism as a concept is suspect. It needs to be made only once. The section detailing Japan's debt to China is also rather long and appears to have been inserted in an attempt to show that Sinocentric thought is not simply an unfounded and arrogant mindset (as the original section seemed to imply) but actually reflects the realities of historical cultural interchange in East Asia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I made these changes without comment because I felt that they didn't detract from the point that was being made in the context of the article. Just in case someone has the wrong idea, I am not pushing POV here. On the contrary, the problem seems to be that one POV struggling against another results not in NPOV, but in a sprawling article that lurches from side to side.</dd>

<dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From the point of view of the whole section, it might be better mentioning this later in the section, in refutation of the statement "Some Japanese now view anti-Japanese sentiment in China as a continuation of Chinese cultural chauvinism." That might help make the section easier to follow.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am certainly not opposed to casting doubt on the theory of Sinocentrism. (In fact, I originally rewrote this section sometime last year to indicate that this was a view taken by many Japanese, which wasn't clear in the previous version).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I do want to do is clean up articles where someone has written a section, and someone else who disagrees with it has come along and inserted a sentence right in the middle to say that "many people disagree with this" or to give reasons why the statement is not true. This kind of writing is often justified by appeal to NPOV. But when such insertions are made without regard to the flow or logic of the original section, you get a poorly-written incoherent section that reads like someone has inserted a nitpick after every second sentence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if Sinocentrism really is baseless as an analysis of anti-Japanese sentiment, it would be better to simply rewrite the whole section on the alleged Sinocentrism factor. All that is needed is a couple of simple sentences noting that many Japanese feel that Chinese anti-Japanese sentiment is a continuation of Sinocentrism, but that many historians are sceptical of Sinocentrism as a theory. In fact, it may be better to get rid of Sinocentrism as a section and incorporate these points earlier in the article.</dd>

<p>The section on Sinocentrism seems to be causing persistent problems. The current article is about anti-Japanese sentiment. "Sinocentrism" on the part of the Chinese is cited by some (mainly Japanese) people as a reason for this. This article needs to note this perception, while at the same time stepping back to say that this is an "alleged" factor that some people believe in. There is no real need to go into detail as to whether Sinocentrism existed or not. That is a much more complex issue and there is no need to play it out on this page.</p>
<p>That is why I deleted the paragraph that was pasted in by User Bandaparte, which cited two quite flawed "counterarguments" from the Sinocentrism article itself. Adding these counterarguments and can only lead to further counterarguments, ad infinitim.</p>
<p>I feel that it would be more constructive to look at the Sinocentrism section of this article, which could bear some rewriting to change the present emphasis -- but not by adding "counterarguments" or adding further notes that "many consider this to have no real basis". When I say rewriting, I am referring to the various background notes on Sinocentrism in the section, which seem to have been inserted by someone to either justify charges of Sinocentrism or to show that there is an objective basis for Sinocentric thought -- it's not quite clear which. Some of that could be left out without compromising the section.</p>
<p>At any rate, I feel that toing and froing on Sinocentrism belongs in the Sinocentrism article itself, not here. In fact, if you read the article on Sinocentrism itself, you'll find some paragraphs on the Japanese body of thought that has grown up in opposition to perceived Sinocentrism which is much more interesting than the feeble counterarguments that were pasted in.</p>

<p>"Japan-bashing" was a term coined by a paid Washington lobbyist for the Japanese government named Robert Angel. It was popular during the 80's when there was rising criticism of Japan's protectionist trade policies and takeover of American businesses and real estate.</p>
<p>While working at the Japan Economic Institute, Angel coined the term "Japan-bashing" as a way to stifle debate, even legitimate debate, on relations with Japan. Here is the text from: <a href="http://archives.cjr.org/year/92/6/trade.asp" class="external free" title="http://archives.cjr.org/year/92/6/trade.asp" rel="nofollow">http://archives.cjr.org/year/92/6/trade.asp</a></p>
<p>Angel, who is now a political scientist at the University of South Carolina, wanted to counter the mounting public criticism of Japan's trade policies. "I looked around for a phrase to use to discredit Japan's critics, and I hoped to beable to discredit those most effective critics by lumping them together with the people who weren't informed and who as critics were an embarrassment to everybody else," Angel says.</p>
<p>Angel's goal was to discredit opposition to Japan's trade practices by insinuating that it was based on racism and xenophobia. His model was the pro-Israel lobby's use of the term anti-Semitism to stigmatize opponents of Israel's policies. he first tried out the term "anti-Japanism" in speeches and interviews but it didn't stick. Then, inspired by the British term "Paki-bashing," he tried "Japan bashing" -- and it worked. "The first people to pick up on it were the Japanese press," Angel says. "However, within a year the American press began to use the term." The term became a weapon in the public relations war being waged in Washington over trade policy and U.S.-Japanese economic relations.</p>
<p>Angel is now embarrassed by his triumph. "I view that modest public relations success with some shame and disappointment," he says. <b>"Those people who use [the term] have the distinction of being my intellectual dupes."</b></p>

<p>Japan sends the most foreign aid to China... which amounts to about $300,000? Whoever wrote that must realize that 300,000 dollars is NOTHING in terms of running a country. That section makes it sound like Japan is investing billions in the Chinese economy. Either the $300,000 figure is wrong, or the section must be rewritten to actually sound PLAUSIBLE. Why would Japan invest in China anyways? I don't believe that Japan gives China more money than all other countries combined. 71.105.75.207 05:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This really needs to be rewritten in general - it needs editing. However, specifically the bit about certain critic's "perceptions" that japan is whitewashing their textbooks needs to be corrected as Japan (very arguably) IS whitewashing their textbooks. The introductory paragraph seems... victimized. That should be corrected.</p>

<dd>"Today, anti-Japanese sentiment is mostly attributed to Japanese military aggression in the early 20th century and the atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. While passions have settled somewhat since Japan's defeat, tempers continue to flare on occasion over the perception, on the part of some critics, that the Japanese government has made insufficient penance for the Pacific War, or has <i>sought to whitewash the history of these events</i>."</dd>

<p>We can not trust sources from South(and North) Korea. Why? You'll see if you read a histry book published in Korea. I've read a histry book used in Korean school.</p>
<p>Korean history books claim: 1. Korea has a 5000 yeas of history (longer than the history of China! wow). 2. Hangul has been used for centuries but, it's been banned by Japanese government. (Not true. The use of Hangul was banned by Korean King. Yangban strongly opposed the use of Hangul. Hanja had been officially used in Korea. Hangul became popular after 1910.) 3. Japan took away everything Korea had. (Not true. Japanese goverment built 5000 schools throughout Korea and taught Hangul. Japanese built rail roads, factories, hospitals, and a dam etc. Japan introduced modern medicine. The Korean population tripled in 36 years. etc etc) 4. Korea had been independent until 1910. (Not true. She gained independence after Treaty_of_Shimonoseki and built Independence_Gate) 5. Korea declared a war against Japan and Korean army faught against Japan and won the independence from Japan with some help of the atomic bombs. (Not true. There are no recod of any Korean army.. except a few soldiers who worked as an translator with US army) and list goes on and on...</p>
<p>Now, Korean people insists all the history taught in the US, China, Japan, and Russia are all wrong. [쿠키뉴스 2006-08-08 18:07] (Korean news article) <a href="http://news.naver.com/news/read.php?mode=LSD&amp;office_id=143&amp;article_id=0000035259" class="external free" title="http://news.naver.com/news/read.php?mode=LSD&amp;office_id=143&amp;article_id=0000035259" rel="nofollow">http://news.naver.com/news/read.php?mode=LSD&amp;office_id=143&amp;article_id=0000035259</a></p>

<p>Please pardon poor English.</p>
<p>I might not be able to consent.</p>
<p>I think a lot of sentences of the cause to be being written though this article is the one of the anti-Japanese sentiment. If it is the one for this article to expose a past evil doing of Japan, and to make the anti-Japanese sentiment recognized the right one, I apologize for an impolite remark. However, I would like you to teach why sentences that contain a lot of matters that seem to have created it have been approved otherwise by me.For instance, I want to know whether the description "Japan also killed the Queen of Korea at that time, Queen Min, and and raped and burned her body" has come out from material where.</p>
<p>-- "Japan also killed the Queen of Korea at that time, Queen Min, and and raped and burned her body" has come out from material where". Citations have been provided by someone. It is a well known event (not sure about the rape part though) witnessed by a number of Europeans. 66.171.76.176 00:28, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Due to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comfort_women.html" title="Comfort women">comfort women</a> incident(s) during WW2, as well of (invasions) and (massacres, eg nanjing) Anti-Japanese sentiment is common among the elderly in China (PRC), Korea (DPRK), Vietnam and Indonesia.

(admittion and compensation of comfort women) (...massacres) (...human testing in bioweapons tests in Manchuria). (sorry my english is bad, I need someone to complete my sentences, these are only basic ideas before adding them to main article). Middle age and youth in (mainland) China are Anti-Japanese due to the mass media and "passive propaganda" (eg in cartoons) encouraging hatred towaRDS THE Japanese.</p>

<p>Please do not contribute if you are unable to write in english in an understandable way. especially the Korea-Japan relations make no sense in english. I understand wanting to make a contribution but you must understand that your translating is horrible.

<p>The article provides a detailed account of Japanese ODA to China, but failed to account for the amount of reparation China forgave Japan. Even though accurate estimation of Japanese damage to China has been given, one can look into comparable cases.</p>
<p>1) Germany has paid $61.8 billion by 1998 for approximately 6 million Jews murdured and property damage with no end in sight. <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v17/v17n6p19_reparations.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v17/v17n6p19_reparations.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>2) The US government paid $20,000 for every Japanese American being sent to internment.</p>
<p>Chinese casualty during Japanese invasion is estimated at 35 million. All major Chinese cities were heavily bombarded and razed to the ground, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu, Chongqi, Wuhan, Hongzhou, etc... So a rough estimate by German standard the reparation should be around $350 billion, by American standard the sum should be $700 billion.</p>
<p>Japanese ODA to China is around $30 billion, of which 90% is low interest loans China has to repay; only less than $3 billion is actual aid. Japanese ODA to China has been widely reported by Japanese media. There were complains about China not showing graditude to Japan. In 1998, Chinese PM, while on a visit to Japan, publicly thanked Japanese for ODA. ODA is also used by Japanese government to pressure China's policy directions. When was the last time Isaerel's foreign policy choice became a condition for Germany reparation? When was the last time a Japanese PM expressed graditude for China's forgiveness, <b>ever</b>?

Dozens Chinese civilians still get injuried and killed every year to this day. In Aug, 2005 two children was killed by Japanese chemical weapons in China. Due to Japanese lack of funding, the process of removing chemical weapons has been long delay. Chinese government has long urged Japan to take responsibility in clear up its chemical weapons.
