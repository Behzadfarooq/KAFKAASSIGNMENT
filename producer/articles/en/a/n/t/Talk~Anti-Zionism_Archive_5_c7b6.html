<p>"The anti-Zionism of Left-leaning movements and parties, from Bolsheviks of 1917 to present days Greens, Feminists, Gay movements and Libertarians doesn't have official explanation and often contradicts general positions of these parties. From late 1990s anti-Zionism is a mandatory requirement for a supporter of gay rights, abortions, emission control, public education, artistic freedom, gender equality etc, despite Israel's clear progress in this areas over its neighbours. Bolsheviks claim that Zionism removes Jews from participation in revolutionary activity in their countries of birth may be still valid." This is clearly biased. The writer is clearly using arguments against left-wing anti-zionism instead of just stating facts. After that the phrase "Bolsheviks claim that Zionism removes Jews from participation in revolutionary activity in their countries of birth may be still valid." is used to ridicule the movement.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"American anti-Zionism is confined to the far left"</span></h2>
<p>An utterly ridiculous statement, on so many levels. Whoever wrote that should be ashamed. Pat Buchanan, Justin Raimondo, Louis Farrakhan, etc. are "far left"? Are anti-Zionist liberals, conservatives, and libertarians "far left"? Yeah right. The article also claims that the "far left" (which is never defined) is marginal and isolated within American society. Yet the author contradicts zirself in the same sentence with the claim that the "far left" is highly influential in academia and media. This article is a joke. It needs severe editing, but I'm sure the hyper-POV author responsible for the garbage will simply reinstate it.</p>
<p>Since Zionism entails a state based upon "racial"/ethnic discrimination and displacement of native peoples, one can be anti-Zionist by virtue of consistently applied anti-racism. Is all consistent anti-racism in America on the "far left"?</p>

<dd>Zionism does not entail a state based upon "racial"/ethnic discrimination and displacement of native peoples, therefore one cannot be anti-Zionist by virtue of consistently applied anti-racism. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:37, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course Zionism entails those things. Zionism calls for a specifically *Jewish* state, which necessitates at minimum a *Jewish* majority. In order to keep that majority, there must be systematic discrimination against non-Jews. So with Israel, once you strip away the facile rhetoric about "democracy," what you have is another racist European colonial state. A Jew from Brooklyn is given the "right to return," even if he (or his ancestors) has never set foot in Palestine. By contrast, an Arab whose family was driven out of Palestine by Jewish settlers enjoys no corresponding "right." This is racial/ethnic discrimination, and one need not be a "far leftist" to realize it. --Platypussy</dd>

<dd>Your conclusions are false; a Jewish majority doesn't necessitate systematic discrimination against non-Jews, the majority of Israeli Jews are non-European, Jews do not have a "right of return" but rather a "Law of return" (similar to many other countries), and Jews are not "race" so racism is inapplicable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:52, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A perpetual Jewish majority *must* necessitate systematic discrimination against non-Jews, especially in the area of immigration policy. In order to keep a Jewish majority, Israel *must* show discriminatory preference for Jewish immigrants over Arab immigrants (and even native Palestinians in exile). Were there a "law of return" allowing "whites" but not anyone else to instantly immigrate to America, would that not be racist? Of course it would. Replace "white" with the more specific "Jew" and you have Israel's racist policy. While there is scientifically no "Jewish race," the same is true for the "white race." Yet "Jewish racism" exists just as surely as the broader, ideologically related "white racism." --Platypussy</dd>

<dd>Nearly half of the Jews in Israel are not white. They come from Arab countries, India, and Africa. Where do they figure in the racist master plan of the jews? it is discriminatory to falsely attribute a certain skin color to a certain faith or ideology, because it deprives people with other hues from joining it if they wish. And Judaism is not only hereditary, but can also be joined by complete Gentiles with black and green stripes--UnlessImWrong</dd>

<p>Platypussy is quite correct. The "Law of Return" is about as clear-cut a case of ethnic discrimination as one could ask for, especially considering that Jews whose ancestors hadn't been there for 2000 years are allowed by it to "return" while non-Jews who were born there are not. However, that is irrelevant to the narrower point, which is that Platypussy is also right about the ridiculousness of "American anti-Zionism is confined to the far left". <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a>, if nothing else, should illustrate the folly of that statement. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 22:27, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Platypussy made far-reaching claims and hand-waving arguments about "Jewish majorities necessitating systematic discrimination", not a narrow argument about the Law of Return. Is the claim of a "Right of Return" by Palestinians (the vast majority of whom have never lived in Israel) also a case of "ethnic discrimination"? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 00:45, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, and as retorts go, "Jews are not "race" so racism is inapplicable" is awfully reminiscent of "Arabs can't be anti-Semitic, because Arabs are Semites".

<dd>Pat Buchanan is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to American anti-Zionism not on the far left. On www.antiwar.com, for example, you'll see varied American commentators including liberals, libertarians, conservatives, anarcho-capitalists, etc. who are anti-Zionists. The Green Party of America is a "soft left" (i.e. for a kinder, gentler capitalism), not "far left," party, yet it's replete with anti-Zionists. Like I said, the claim that American anti-Zionism is limited to the "far left" is so stupid that I can barely believe I read it. So far as the "Jews are not a 'race' so racism is inapplicable" nonsense, by that logic I guess "racism" is *never* applicable. The Nazis and Klan can breathe a sign of relief. After all, most scientists hold that the traditional concept of "race" is not valid. That includes the "white race." By Jayjg's logic, David Duke is not a racist.--Platypussy</dd>
</dl>
<p>in reference to all that is written above: essentially, the whole lot of writers has neglected to understand (or refuse to understand) is that anything anti-zionist, or anti-semetic (in these cases) is completely lost in rhetoric. the fact is that when a group of people of any distinct belief system gather in any one place, another distinct group of people will undouptedly rise against it. the simple matter is, despite what some old text or tome may say.. when you force your beliefs onto others, they will begin to hate you. this horrible truth becomes a wave of sentiment that will only grow with time. the reality is this: isreal is not a real country... merely an idea that is supported by a specific group of people and opposed by another. had the 'homeland' of isreal not been created from the oppressive powers that gathered to form it, none of this would even be talked about. mumble on all you want... if someone forced their way into your backyard and only had some random piece of paper as 'proof' that they had a 'right' to do so is ridiculous and the opposite of everything that is right and just. put that in your pipe and smoke it..... Zod</p>
<p>Interesting point Zod. Doubtless it would suck to be on the receiving end of such a note. However, it is important to note that, historically, there is no such parallel to a note. The Jews of what would eventually become Israel moved into what was then "Palestine" by peaceful means, buying land, often at exorbitant prices, from mostly Arab landlords. Following the Holocaust, it became clear to many, both in power and not, that there was some validity to the idea that the collective "Jews" would never be truly safe until they had a land of their own in which to decide their own destiny. Thus there began to be something done about the Balfore Declaration, only accelerated by the fact that many of the Jews who had been displaced by the Nazis (many, like my grandparents, the only survivors of their entire families and towns), wished to emigrate to what was then Palestine. This of course presented a problem to the British rulers of the area, who were under strong pressure by the ruling powers in the Arab world to block any such immigration (if your interested in the result, look up the internment camps in Cyprus following World War II; again an experience my grandparents underwent). Such a mass Jewish emigration into Palestine was naturally a threat to the control of Palestine by Arabs. Soon Israel was declared a nation in the UN, a declaration that included a land partition based on population densities, where areas that were majority Jewish to be under Jewish rule, and areas that were majority Arab to be under Arab rule (there were of course instances of compromise for the sake of territorial continuity, such as appropriating Haifa, a split city, to the Jews, or Hebron, another split city, to the Arabs). This partition resulted in only about half of what is currently Israel being placed under Jewish rule, with the other portion to be made into the Arab state of Palestine, including the city of Jerusalem placed under International rule. It has been argued that the reason the ruling powers among the Arabs pressured the British to arrest post-holocaust Jewish immigration into Palestine was due to their foresight of such a solution. Either way, the common desire among Arabs to see no Jewish state established (perhaps because of the frequent encouragement of anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist sentiments in Arab populations by Arab rulers, such as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem), predisposed them to reject this proposition, as they did. Thus, even as the leaders of the nascent state of Israel were convening to sign its Declaration of Independence, Egypt had already launched bomber aircraft to raid Tel-Aviv (a Jewish city). It was under such auspices that the Israeli war of Independence began. There has been much talk of the Jewish expulsion of local Arab population during this war. For the most part, these accusations appear to be historically false, although certainly with some exceptions. Especially in the countryside and villages of Palestine, Arab populations were encouraged (or scared to, either by threats or propaganda about the Jewish intentions) by those in charge of Arab forces to vacate the region as to expedite the advance of the Arab armies on Jewish positions. These populations were told that they merely had to leave for a short while, during which the Arab armies would complete their mission of "pushing the Jews into the sea" (if you don't believe me that this was a major slogan of the Arab armies during the Israeli war of independence, feel free to look up declarations from individuals such as the General in charge of the Arab armies, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and the Saudi prince ruling at the time). When this mission did not proceed as planned the Arabs who had once lived in Palestine were, needless to say, left out in the cold. However, though this from of emigration apparently accounted for the majority (by capita and land area) of the reduction of the Arab population of Palestine during the War of Independence, it would be false of me to claim it accounted for all. There were instances were Israeli forces expelled the local Arab populations of a given area, such as in Haifa (I think it was Haifa...). Even these occasions, however, must be considered in light of historical circumstance and military necessity. Many of the local Arab populations in these areas had aiding the Arab armies, either with intelligence or logistics. Thus, though it was certainly not the most pleasant decision, there was some objective validity to the decision of Jewish commanders to evict the residents of a city or hillside where they knew they would soon be fighting. To the benefit of the Jewish forces, following the war they did in many occasions allow the populations which they had themselves evicted to return. There are, however, a handful of darker incidences which demand mentioning; these are major black marks on the otherwise humane behavior of the Jewish forces. The most famous of these, is the massacre of a certain Arab village by the Lechi. Lechi, or the Stern gang as they are more often called, where essentially Jewish terrorists, which the mainstream Jewish defense movement had tolerated mostly (according to memoirs of the leadership) to prevent civil war within the Jewish population. The Stern gang believed in doing absolutely anything to assure Jewish independence, including acts of terrorist bombing, which they did against the British forces in the pre-Independence period with little regard for the lives of civilians. During the warm this Stern gang, comprising of under 300 individuals, was given a single village to garrison. It is unclear why, but following a paranoid episode by their commander, they proceeded to massacre almost all the inhabitants of the village they were garrisoning. As soon as the mainstream Jewish leadership found out about this, their unit was recalled, and its leadership tried and imprisoned. There can be no excuse for the actions of these individuals, and their terrible atrocity will forever be a burden of shame that the Jews of Israel must bear. For their behavior, I can offer no mitigation. I only ask those reading this to remember that their actions were not that of the mainstream Jewish forces nor corresponded to the beliefs of the vast majority of Jews. Overall, I hope what I've written helps clarify the myth that the Jews, or the British, "kicked out" the Arabs living in Palestine. I'm always up for more discussion though. --Almonator</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of Anti-Zionism</span></h2>
<p>Anti-Zionism is the denial that Israel has a right to exist, and that the Jewish people have a right to an independent nation in Israel, and is therefore not fundamentally different from anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionism is just another way for anti-Semites to critize Jews, while hiding under the pretext that they are not anti-Semetic. It is not a coincedence that most anit-Zionists critize Israel for ficticious violations of human rights, while deliberatley ignoring countries like Saudi Arabia, who violate almost all human rights laws know to man, and Darfur, where non-Arabs are currently being ethnicaly cleansed. --Stu</p>

If <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephant</a>-rights activists want to call themselves anti-Zionists, they can define anti-Zionism as such (and, moreover, they can claim that it can mean nothing else)? (I'm taking this <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_logic.html" title="Circular logic">circular logic</a> to it's absurd logical conclusion). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 7 July 2005 18:21 (UTC)</dd>

Since the two groups (pro-Zionists and anti-Zionists) view Zionism very differently it makes sense to include both views. I would prefer an unbiased description, but since that obviously isn't possible the second best is to include both views. If you feel you can combine the two views feel free to do so, but until then I must insist that the most neutral is to include both views.

<dd>I don't think I can make this any clearer: Whatever the dictionary defines as racism - anti-racism is ideological opposition to it, in some form. Any form. This doesn't require deliberation. Whatever Zionism is defined as in the dictionary, anti-Zionism is ideological opposition to it, in some form. Any form. Therefore, anti-Zionism is defined quite broadly, and one form is not to be singled out as the only form. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 7 July 2005 22:00 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, now I see what you're getting at. You feel that stating "the Jewish People is entitled to a national homeland" is a positive definition ("<i>glowing praise</i>") and that saying "Zionism is racism" is a counterbalancing negative one. Allow me to calrify: Stating that "the Jewish People is entitled to a national homeland," is a statement of ideology without a characterization of that ideology, and there can be no POV involved. Saying that "Zionism is racism" is merely a negative characterization that provides no new information. The second statement is not a definition, but a subjective categorization dependent entirely on the first one (and however broadly you want to define racism). Now, this is a prime example of one's point of view (POV), don't you think? However, since stating the POV of notable entities is appropriate, the <i>inherent</i> POV of stating that "Zionism is racism" is a non-issue. However, eclipsing all other forms of anti-Zionism with a particular manifestation thereof is certainly a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Furthermore: If someone is opposed to any of the fundamentals of Zionist ideology, he is technically an anti-Zionist. If someone is not opposed to any of those fundamentals, no matter how many state policies he disagrees with, he is not technically an anti-Zionist. Therefore, if one's opposition to Israel is entirely based upon its policies, and he only considers the government policies racist (for example), he isn't an anti-Zionist, at all. (P.S. I just noticed that you wrote above that Zionism "aims to create an ethnically cleansed homeland for Jews," by definition. Now, I believe this would fall into <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, as well, given that this is not stated Zionist ideology, merely <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">suspicion of a conspiracy</a>). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 8 July 2005 15:04 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, I'm an anti-Zionist, inasmuch as I loathe most of the ideology that drove the likes of Herzl and Ben-Gurion. On the other hand, I'm pro-Zionist in that I support the existence of Israel as a Jewish state. The slur about Zionism being racist because of Israel's Law of Return is just that, a slur. Israel's Law of Return does not bar non-Jews from immigrating, all it does is grant <b>automatic <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship.html" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a></b> to Jews and to any non-Jew with at least one Jewish grandparent. Nothing about it is "racist", it's ethnocentric, perhaps, but then again so is the immigration of every other country in the world. Critics of Israel who point to the "evil" of their mischaracterization of the Law of Return often do so hypocritically, never bothering to mention that Jews cannot be citizens of Jordan and Saudi Arabia (in the case of Saudi Arabia, <i>no</i> non-Muslim can be a citizen, in fact). They also neglect to whine and complain about Germany's citizenship policy that grants automatic citizenship to anyone with <i>any</i> German ancestry, but refuses to grant full citizenship to people without German ancestry. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 7, 2005 19:20 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Also"? What part of Israel's citizenship policy is "racistic"? Israel permits non-Jews to become citizens, regardless of whether or not they they have a Jewish grandparent. That it offers <i>immediate</i> citizenship to non-criminal Jews doesn't make it "racistic", it simply means that certain people have to jump through fewer hoops. Go to any US customs in the world, and you'll see all the Americans waving their blue passports and being waved through, while everyone else is standing in 3-hour-long lines. That's not "racistic", it's a recognition of citizenship. Part of Israel's charter, as "the Jewish State" grants citizenship in 1948, to all Jews who claim it.

<dd>The racistic part in both citezenship procedurures is that one ethnic group (or race) is singled out and given citezenship right of while other have to jump trough hoops. Go to any EU customs in the world, and you'll see all the EU citizens waving their burgundy passports and being waved through, while everyone else is standing in 3-hour-long lines. That's not racistic, it's a recognition of citizenship. If however everybody with European ethnicity would be waved trough then that would be racism (it's ofcourse being done and called <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_profiling.html" title="Racial profiling">racial profiling</a>). Anyway, citizenship is one thing and ethnicity is another thing. There are other ways to grant citizenship than based on ethnicity/race. When Latvia became independent they used the rule that anyone living in Latvia in 1940 and theire decendants were given an express citizenship, others were allowed to become citizens the normal way by applying. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<p>This is Adam's remark on his most recent edit: "since most Israelis think that anti-Zionism is just another word for anti-Semitism, it cannot be classed as an "extremist" view - this is always a subjective term anyway." When I essentially suggested something similar, ie that many Israeli politicians and right-wing groups have promoted such views, I started being labelled an "anti-Semite" by RK and was harassed at various points for "anti-Semitic views" or making "straw man attacks on Jews." Can the non-Zionophobes (Zionophobes being Adam's euphemism for people who lean towards disapproval of Israeli actions in disputed territory) get their act together and decide who or what is an extremist, and who or what is an anti-Semite for expressing commonly acknowledged views, before making arbitrary judgements on article contents and contributors? -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 05:10, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you really that dense or are you just pretending? That "anti-zionism" + "anti-semitism" scored so high does not prove what you say it does. Far from it. A page with the sentence "Anti-Zionism is NOT anti-Semitism" would fit in that category! Your "survey" proves nothing other than your own cluelessness. As a supporter of the racist ideology of Zionism, are you consistent enough to also support Zionism for Germans (National Socialism) and Zionism for Whites (White Nationalism)? It should be easy, considering the well-documented collaboration between Nazis and Zionists, and Israel's staunch support for apartheid South Africa. --Platypussy</dd>

<p>This is a very silly argument. The view that anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism is a completely mainstream view among Israeli Jews, probably the majority view, and is also common among Jews outside Israel. Most of the Jews I know, even those who dislike Sharon and think Israel should withdraw from all the territories, hold this view. It therefore cannot be classed as "extremist." The word "extremist" is in any case a very subjective term and should only be used when there is clear agreement that a person or opinion is "extreme". That is not the case here. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:21, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's difficult to think of a way that the word "extremist" would be used that would be NPOV. As for anti-Zionism (at least some forms of it) being anti-Semitism, I think it is held by the majority of Jews worldwide, not just in Israel. And, as we have recently seen, it also appears to be a position of the Catholic Church. Even if one could come to an agreement about the meaning of the word "extremist", I don't see how it would apply in this case. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 16:56, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Please do not make edits on this topic until we've discussed it more first.</b></p>
<p>I didn't mean to incite an edit war, and I'm sorry. I should probably explain why I picked out this section in particular. I think that many people hold the opinion that anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism, and that they'll be looking for this POV to be represented in the article (and will consider it biased if they don't find it). Therefore, I think the comparison should be <i>visibly</i> made near the beginning of the article, with appropriate links to distract them and hopefully get them off the page and looking elsewhere (probably at the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> article). I made a similar point recently regarding the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> article and how it should <i>visibly</i> mention the controversy surrounding Zionism (and provide a link to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a> to draw off the attention of people who'd otherwise complain about <i>that</i> article). (Thanks to Adam, by the way, for coming up with a very good new intro that accomplishes this goal.)</p>
<p>That said, I think these sentences still need work:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many Jews (and some non-Jews) argue that anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism: hatred of Jews as Jews. While the support and defense of Israel has become a central focus of Jewish life in all countries since 1948, it is widely seen as reprehensible that Jews should see attacks on the existence of Israel as inherently anti-Semitic. Moreover, some anti-Semites use the term "Zionist" interchangeably with Jew, leading to a further blurring of the distinction.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I find "reprehensible" too harsh a word, and I think that point could be made more effectively if the (overly long) sentence were restructured and rephrased. There are two distinct points being made, regarding anti-Semitism:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people consider anti-Zionism to be anti-Semitic because <i>any</i> attack on Israel is anti-Semitism.</li>
<li>Some people consider anti-Zionism to be anti-Semitic because "Zionist" is sometimes used as a synonym for "Jew".</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this distinction should be made as clear as possible, since only the first point could really be considered reprehensible. Also, I think perhaps the information on anti-Semitism <i>should</i> be in its own section, with "Anti-Semitism" displayed prominently in the title, so that it will catch the eye of those looking for such comparisons and draw their attention to that section (and away from the rest of the article).</p>
<p>I'd suggest we come up with some proposals for changes here on the talk page, come to some sort of agreement, and <i>then</i> make the agreed-upon changes to the article itself. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 05:41, 2004 Jul 23 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think your points are correct. As I see it, the two main issues are really as follows:
<ol>
<li>Some people consider certain kinds of attack on Israel/Zionism to be anti-Semitic because they are uniquely applied to Israel, and because they mirror similar anti-Semitic attacks historically made on Jews.</li>
<li>Some people consider attacks on Israel/Zionism to be anti-Semitic because anti-Semites are now often masking their anti-Jewish efforts as (or chanelling their anti-Jewish efforts towards) anti-Zionism, which they perceive as more socially acceptable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>This becomes even more confusing because of a third point, that some anti-Semites (and, to be frank, some Islamists as well) use the term "Jew" and "Zionist" interchangably. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:07, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's actually terrible, because <i>no Zionists or Israel supporters</i> have said that <i>any attacks on Israel are inherently anti-Semitic</i>. In fact, as I've shown in earlier Talk: pages, this is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">Strawman</a> argument, and one which is never used by Zionists (and in, fact, which has been specifically and clearly repudiated by many Zionists). As for your other statments, Sam, they show a profound misunderstanding of Jews and the arguments being made here. Most Jews are in fact Zionists. Regarding your claim that "your average person is pretty well pissed of at Israel", this may reflect your own POV, but has nothing to do with the issue of whether some forms of anti-Zionism are anti-Semitic. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:13, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you have misunderstood what both people are saying. In fact, Dershowitz has specifically said "Show me a single instance where a major Jewish leader or Israeli leader has ever said that criticizing a particular policy of Israeli government is anti-Semitic. That's just something made up by Israel's enemies." And Sacks has said "I see three distinct positions: legitimate criticism of Israel, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionism can certainly become a form of anti-semitism when it becomes an attack on the collective right of the Jewish people to defensible space. If any people in history have earned the right to defensible space it is the Jewish people. But anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are different things. We're hearing more voices in Britain now who are denying Israel's right to exist and I have to fight that - but I don't confuse that with an assault on me as the bearer of a religious tradition." (it's in this article). Clearly they view the idea that Jews do not have a right to their own state as anti-Semitic; but unless you define anti-Zionism as "the belief that Jews should not have a state of their own" (and this article certainly doesn't), then they are not saying all anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. And they clearly do not think any attack on Israel is anti-Semitism (they make this point explicitly). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 18:59, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Jayjg, is your problem more with the term "<i>inherently</i>" than the rest? Even among those who seem to profess the view that attacks on Israel are anti-Semitism, the underlying argument isn't that such attacks are <i>inherently</i> anti-Semitic, but rather that they <i>happen to be</i> anti-Semitic. There's a fine line there, and as the article on The Nation points out, it's not entirely clear where everyone stands on the issue.

<dd>Some anti-Zionists are themselves Jews, e.g. some kinds of Hasidim, and also, Palestinian/Arab critics are Semitic themselves. In fact, some have called anti-Arab fervor in the US, the "new anti-Semitism". It's perfectly accurate since the Arabs have always been native speakers of a Semitic language... which is not true of non-traditional/westernised Jews outside Israel.
<dl>
<dd>I haven't been involved in this article elsewhere, but honestly, this is just muddying the waters. For various reasons, anti-semitic has come to mean "anti-jewish". You are correct in that this is not the precise definition you would expect it to have given the root words. Nevertheless, that's the definition it has come to possess. Saying that people who hold prejudiced anti-arab views are "anti-semitic" is nonsensical. It's like saying anybody who is "wanton and profligate" is "nice", because that's what Shakespeare used "nice" to mean <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nice" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nice" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, things would be more sensible and less confusing if people just used "anti-jewish" instead of "anti-semitic", since that's what everybody always means, but sensibility has never gotten in the way of the oddities of languages. If it did, we'd all be speaking <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>. In the meantime, it's much better to just use and take words for what they are commonly understood to mean than to confuse things by trying to redefine them. This especially applies when said attempts at redefinition are deliberate attempts to misdirect the debate, as is often the case. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModargo_00ca.html" title="User:Modargo">modargo</a> 22:43, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

   :::I agree, except the point is to confuse things.  The Arabs are the Jews of today (and who were the jews before there were jews?), Arafat is like Washington, and the murderer becomes the victim with a change of context.  To create the momentum and will for action, especially for action that under an honest light would be morally reprehensible, people redefine situations.  With the acceptance of new definitions or associations, nazis become heros saving the german people from the infiltration of the jewish malaise. There is no interest in the truth here, only achieving a particular objective, creating the will for action, or at least stilling objection to actions.  It is interresting that those who are often vilifying the state of israel are outraged at being vilified.  Is vilification a one way street? What makes them, the vilifier immume from their own practices.  This tactic is an effective way to criticise ones opponent for criticizing you.  There is so much information and mis information intentionally created for the sole purpose of re-aligning the argument in a manner more favorable to victory that any discussion dissembles into broad generalizations that turn serious issues into straw men.  Like being anti-zionist is the same as anti-racist.  And please don't turn this into an opportunity to try and reassociate one point of view with another.  Arafat was not like George Washington.  Arafat was Arafat and Washington was Washington and each has to stand on the merits of their paricular actions.   Any attempt to compare is to try to inject negative or positive associations from the one onto the other, irregardless of the particular actions of the individuals.  Anti racists are anti racists and anti zionists are anti zionists.  Being anti racist is about being against the discrimination of any particular group and being anti zionist is discriminating against a particular group, in this case the Israelis, though it has been historically used as a cover for descrimination against jews as well, like it or not.  I understand the desire to try and keep things truthful, factual and rhetorically honest, and I lament the fact that we are dealing with those who do not. But let us understand that this is a tool used by everyone for il or for good, either way its deception. Myp

<p>Americans usurped their country from native americans, in fact, the English were second in line to 'dicover' it. So should all you yanks be third in line for right to be there? Australia, was homeland to aboriginies - English criminals were deported there next... So the Zionisms ideology states that it should simply be the aboriginies.. next in line, the British, who have any rights to the country. The Romans moved in on Britain and took it over from the Celts.. anyone in Britain, without Celtic blood line - should have lesser rights. This is the ideology of Zionism applied to other countries. Sound fair? I am Jewish, and anti-zionist, they are two seperate things and the fool who claims any anti-zionist is hiding behind the title for exemption from what they really are - anti-semitic, should come see me. ___________</p>
<p>I feel very frustrated at this sentence under the definition of anti-Semitism. It is clearly non-anti-Semitic anti-Zionist attitude: <i>Denying the Jewish people right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor</i>.</p>
<p>Argumentation: I have nothing against Jews but I deny the right of colonists (of any origin) to determine the fate of Palestine. It is dificult to think how other ethnicities that are dispersed and lack a national territory, like the Roma can self-determinate in the usual manner (forming a state and separating from the occupying power).</p>

<dd>Sorry, I'm new but Adam is 100% right with his point. The claim that "most Jews aren't Zionists" usually goes along with the claims that "Jews aren't a race, ergo you can't be racist against Jews" and other politically motivated and racist attacks on Jews. It is part of a set of outright lies that is peddled in "information packs" along with extracts from the protocols. I have a collection of such material that I have personally collected. Any Jew will be able to tell you that of those of Jews he/she knows all or very nearly all are Zionists. I personally know of 1 (and only 1) anti-zionist Jew in my aquantance. I know 4 Zionist Christians and 2 Zionist Muslims. You may as well say all Muslims are Zionists as say all Jews are anti-Zionists.

<p>I am not sure why 209.etc (aka <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELance6Wins_9e95.html" title="User:Lance6Wins">Lance6Wins</a>) continues to insert this material; the statement is not nearly as important as he makes it out to be, and the quotation he gives is different to that in the official declaration. First, the declaration was not a solemn doctrine or an <i>ex cathedra</i> pronouncement (i.e. not a required article of Catholic belief), but a statement by the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian-Jewish_reconciliation_402e.html" title="Christian-Jewish reconciliation">Christian-Jewish reconciliation</a>), which does not have the authority to define, promulgate, or enforce <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">dogma</a>. What the committee said is just its considered opinion, and the article already says that both Jews and non-Jews (the committee includes both) equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism; so why does this instance deserve highlighting? Second, the exact wording (as published on <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/relations-jews-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20040708_declaration-buenos-aires_en.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/relations-jews-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20040708_declaration-buenos-aires_en.html" rel="nofollow">the Vatican's website</a>), in context, is this (emphasis mine):</p>

<dd>As we approach the 40th anniversary of <i>Nostra Aetate</i> - the ground-breaking declaration of the Second Vatican Council which repudiated the deicide charge against Jews, reaffirmed the Jewish roots of Christianity and rejected anti-Semitism - we take note of the many positive changes within the Catholic Church with respect to her relationship with the Jewish People. These past forty years of our fraternal dialogue stand in stark contrast to almost two millennia of a "teaching of contempt" and all its painful consequences. <b>We draw encouragement from the fruits of our collective strivings which include the recognition of the unique and unbroken covenantal relationship between God and the Jewish People and the total rejection of anti-Semitism in all its forms, including anti-Zionism as a more recent manifestation of anti-Semitism.</b></dd>

<p>I find this formulation propagandistic: "Palestinian leadership formally recognised Israel as part of the 1993 Oslo Accords, although that recognition has been rendered inoperative in practice since the beginning of the second Intifada in 2000." This is some editor's POV masquerading as scholarly analysis. Also, I think it is propagandistic to say that "Other Arab governments such as Saudi Arabia and Syria may still desire the destruction of Israel but no longer say so openly," since the Saudis put forward a rather reasonable peace proposal that involved recognition of Israel, but the proposal was never taken up. I think that was in 2002. --<a href="../../../c/_/c/User%7EC_Colden_136f.html" title="User:C Colden">C Colden</a> 12:06, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

Since 2000 the Palestinians have reverted to the position that a settlement must include the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_of_Return_5cb5.html" title="Right of Return">Right of Return</a>, which amounts to a repudiation of the 1993 recognition of Israel, since the "return" of 5 to 8 million Palestinians would effectively destroy Israel. The second statement may or may not be true, and it may be that the Saudis would be prepared to recognise Israel under certain circumstances, but it is not "propagandistic."

<p>This section should be little more than a definition from a "legitimate source" of anti-Zionism post 1948 and some accurate way of describing jewish resistance to the idea in prior to and after the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Statements like "Many Jews (and some non-Jews) argue that some forms of anti-Zionism are also forms of anti-Semitism." need to be rigorously backed up by some serious authorities in the field, such a linguists and anthropologists. A columnist for some publication simply wont suffice.</p>

Does Emanuele Ottolenghi have any credientals to speak on the issue? Your second point point accurately defines anti-Semitism and Zionism, goes on to infer a definition for anti-Zionism, and declares the two connected. Lets try: "according to the World Union of Jewish Students, anti-Zionism can be defined as anti-Semitism", people need to know where these statements are comming from. Number three says right on the front page "Anti-Semitic views can be easily distinguished from legitimate criticism of Israel." and "...though the two concepts are not always identical.". As for number four, another search engine? Again this needs to be backed with some statistics. A number is a fact, many == maybe--<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 01:39, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Second, some Jews are anti-Zionists. Jewish anti-Zionism exists mainly among socialist or radical Jewish intellectuals outside Israel. There is also a minority among Orthodox Jews, both inside and outside Israel, who reject Zionism as contrary to the will of God." Thats totally unbacked. Someone needs to dig up some statistics on these remarks, or at the very least a poll carried out by an organization which specializes in that field. Again, some author for a news paper or organization news letter does not cut it.</p>

Therefore it is unfair to say that Jews opressed to Zionism represent a minority, when you have accounted only for a very slim fraction. If you could say, for example, that 70% of Jews around the world support Zionism in one way or another, AND back it with proof, you could then say a minority of Jews oppose Zionism.

<p>I wanted, among other things, some names of "many jews (and some non jews)" who supported the theory that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism . It should be noted that some of these people are, too, political activists (Martin Luther King). I also question their abilities to make the claim beyond their personal feelings, since it requires detailed analysis of the definitions and uses of the terms. There are so many of them, I'll drop the point, since there is a link now in the article readers can easily examine the source and draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>After clicking the links I am going to reiterate a previous statement: What is not a scientific study is digging up some anti-Semetic hate rant and saying "look look that anti-Semite blamed zionists". To argue "some anti-semites" demands a list, ideally by someone with the authority in the field (ie a Psychologist). Judging by the content, it looks as though the author was using the term Zionist interchangably with the term Facist, but thats purely my POV. Again, be very careful whom you cite on this since someone could just as easily take a list of controversial sites (as you just did) and point and say "see see anti-Ziomism == anti-Semitism". --<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 13:58, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Some_definitions_of_anti-Zionism" id="Some_definitions_of_anti-Zionism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some definitions of anti-Zionism</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews, You are talking anti-Semitism". Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a speech at Harvard University shortly before his assassination in 1968, from "The Socialism of Fools" The Left, the Jews and Israel by Seymour Martin Lipset; in Encounter, (December 1969), p. 24.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The older type of anti-Semitism, based on outright racial prejudice, is unfashionable today, and the modern anti-Zionist, whether by calculation or because he is a product of his times, tends to avoid it. He has therefore invented a neo-anti-Semitism, the logical inconsistencies of which are to some extent masked by ambiguity. Jacques Givet, "The Anti-Zionist Complex"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Today the boundary between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is often indistinct. It is clear, too, that the anti-Semitism proclaimed by a good many Arab governments is a veil designed to hide the negligence and corruption of the governing classes, and to divert attention from poverty and unemployment by focusing it on an external foe. G. Chaliand, The Palestinian Resistance, Penguin, London, 1972</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Zionism, even as a code word, is the litmus test with respect to anti-Semitism throughout the world, even in America. The facile rhetorical linkage of Zionism with imperialism and racism is little more than an admission that Jews are uniquely not entitled to be like everyone else and live as citizens as part of a majority in a nation, for better or for worse. Zionism, as mirrored in the State of Israel, has proven the point that Jews are in fact just human. Israel has displayed a full range of human achievement and weakness and of decency and its absence common to all nations. Comparatively speaking, one can make the case that Israel has behaved better, given its circumstances. The anti-Zionist, like the anti-Semite a century ago, does not allow the Jew the privilege of normalcy. Leon Botstein, The New Republic, September 8, 1997</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looking back now over nearly 50 years, I have to say - regretfully - that I believe history has proved me right. The establishment of the State of Israel has merely provided a more "politically correct" name "Anti-Zionism" in place of "Anti-Semitism." If anything,the virulence has increased. Derek Prince, Canadian Friends of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In short, "anti-Israeli" sentiment at the UN is often a surrogate for two other predilections: anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism. John R. Bolton, Senior Vice President, American Enterprise Institute, July 14, 1999</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the 1970's, an especially blatant and vulgar brand of anti-Semitism became a unifying global ideology of the totalitarian Left. Couched in the language of opposition to Zionism, this anti-Semitism became the preferred vehicle of the Soviet Union and its clients in international forums for political assaults against democratic nations - most obviously Israel, but ultimately all the West, and especially the United States. Ambassador/Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no difference whatever between anti-Semitism and the denial of Israel's statehood. Classical anti-Semitism denies the equal right of Jews as citizens within society. Anti-Zionism denies the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations. The common principle in the two cases is discrimination. Abba Eban, New York Times, November 3, 1975</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our disappointment is not in Zionism, but in anti-Zionism, the adjustment that anti-Semitism made when the Jews moved into modern statehood. Ruth R. Wisse, The New Republic, September 8, 1997</li>
</ul>

<dd>If Chomsky had published that statement (it's not a definition by any means) in, say, the <i>Cambridge Journal of Linguistics</i>, rather than a political magazine like ZMag, this argument might hold some water. Since he didn't, it's rather disingenuous to quote this as the opinion of a professional linguist, rather than that of a political activist. Chomsky is both; if we were quoting his published opinions on <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generative_grammar.html" title="Generative grammar">generative grammar</a>, it would be appropriate to quote his opinions as a linguist; here it is more appropriate to quote him as a political activist. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv"> <i>Jones</i></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 03:44, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is akin to arguing that if a Judge says that abortion is wrong, they are not speaking as a judge, but as an anti-abortionist. You're right, Chomsky is both, and that should be reflected. When the traffic settles I'll include a link to political activist. You can not deny, however, that any statement made by the man is that of a linguist, since, he is exactly that.</p>
<p>You're right of course, its not a definition, but it is an opinion from a qualified individual. I am yet to find a dictionary which defines anti-Zionism, by the way.

<dd>If a judge writes from the bench that abortion is wrong, then his opinion is that of a judge. If he writes in <i>National Right to Life News</i> that abortion is wrong, then his opinion is that of an anti-abortion activist.

<p>It doesn't matter where the comment is published, if an expert in a certain field makes a statement, it has to have been made in their capacity in that field. Furthermore, the comment was part of the response to the question: "You sometimes say in talks and interviews that you used to be called a 'Zionist', and now you're called an anti-Zionist'..." and thus deals with Zionism and anti-Zionism, not Israel, Palestine or any other related issue.

<dd>There is a difference in a comment made in one's professional capacity, and a polotical opinion.

<p>"The most devastating articles in the Anti-Chomsky Reader are not those that expose the ideological prejudices, factual misrepresentations, and distorted logic of his political writings but the two at the end of the book that tear up his reputation as one of the towering intellects of our time. Two essays about linguistics reveal Chomsky’s output in that field to be not the work of a rare, great mind but the product of a very familiar kind of academic hack. His reputation turns out not to have been earned by any significant contribution to human understanding but to be the product of a combination of self-promotion, abuse of detractors, and the fudging of his findings." <a href="http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/23/sept04/keith.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/23/sept04/keith.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:57, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's respected by nonlinguists.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A vision for the future of this article.</span></h2>
<p>I have two very different propsals for the future of this article, which should put an end to the NPOV dispute. I like to think of it as a roadmap to peace.</p>
<p>The first is to totally disband the page, moving the content to the appropriate realated articles. For example, anti-Zionism as a form of anti-Semitism could be covered as a section in anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionism in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be covered as a subsection of that article. Historic opposition to Zionism (especially pre-Holocaust) could be covered in the main Zionism article. This article could then be used as a disambiguation page. I think it is a good idea because it would let readers consider the concept of anti-Zionism in the larger context of the related articles.</p>
<hr />
<p>I favour the first solution but expect massive opposition to it, and as such have a second proposal. It can be broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>massive footnoting: back every statement that is attributed to "some, many, few, most, etc" with some sort of reliable example of the demographic. The list of people who consider anti-Zionism as anti-Semitism is an excellent example of this</li>
<li>removal of unsubstantiated claims: anything that could not be backed up with someone elses research should then be removed, under the terms of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.</li>
<li>balancing of points of view: once we have established sources for the many points of view we can work towards including oppoising points of view, so long as they are also appropriately backed.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the first phase of this process it would be best to not add any new information or points of view. Take what we have and document it. During the second phase, resorting to edit wars is likely. I propose that before anything is removed, the idea be discussed in the talk page. Finally, the third phase is also likely to incur angry talk pages and edit wars. It is important to remember that even if you disagree with a point of view, so long as it comes from a reliable source it deserves inclusion.</p>
<p>I think this is a good idea because as long as the statement is nonspecific enough to fit withing the context of its supporting material, it can ultimately be left up to the reader to decide if the statement is specific enough and the source reliable enough for their intellectual needs. This should hopefully put an end to neutrality and factuality disputes, since a source for the point will be included inline.</p>
<p>I would appriciate any comments on these proposals, or alternatives. Constructive work is almost impossible with endless editwars, so lets prove it, all of it, and go from there.</p>

<p>A new section was created by <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenj_0e45.html" title="User:Menj">user:Menj</a> called "Islamic response to Zionism", but it went on to discuss what I would call an Islamist response, not an Islamic one. I moved a paragraph about the "Islamist narrative" out of "Arab anti-Zionism" and put it instead in the new "Islamic response" category, but there should be some discussion about what is an Islamic response and what is an Islamist one. I'm also not sure this could be called "anti-Zionism" when there's reference to it being a "disease" (making it sound to me like anti-Semitism). I'm also unsure about Menj inserting the photograph of a book cover, when the book was written by someone calling for the destruction of Israel. Does that look like a Wikipedia endorsement? I'm hesitant to delete this section because I'm not familiar with the book or the author. If he's regarded as a legitimate Islamic scholar then his views shouldn't be deleted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anti-Zionism as a form of Anti-Racism</span></h2>
<p>This article is missing a viewpoint that I have heard expressed many times, and I was wondering whether anyone else noticed the discrepancy.</p>
<p>The viewpoint I am referring to, which is definitely anti-zionist, is that the existence of the state of Israel as a Jewish (racewise) state is a racist ideology. For balance, if an English politician ever said that England was a country for those with English blood first and foremost, that politician would be eviscerated by the press. The politician's statement implies that people who are racially English are more valid citizens than immigrants to England of other races. Without a doubt, this policy is racist in the simplest sense-- it discriminates based on race. I have heard many similar criticisms of what is perceived as Israeli racist policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>many palestinians born in what is now israel are not israeli, but someone who is racially jewish however far removed from Israel is entitled to citizenship of Israel.</li>
<li>although 2 million out of 7 million israelis are arabs, none are allowed in the military.</li>
<li>emigration to Israel is much easier for those who have converted to Judaism (not racist, but unfair religious discrimination)-- imagine if Christians had an easier time becoming American.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fairness to me, these aren't my arguments. I would like to name-drop some authors, but my attribution is bound to be wrong. Regardless, I strongly feel that these arguments belong in this article, and would begin to fill a glaring hole. Ultimately these arguments charge that Anti-Zionism is part of being anti-racist, which is something I have heard many times, but cannot find (anymore) on wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm sure that someone is bound to be offended, so I say peace to you now, brother or sister... :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Those should be mentioned in the section</li>
<li>The nature of Israel's "Right of Return" law discriminates based on heridity i.e. it treats jews as a race. My point about conversion to the religion of Judaism had to do its effect on the facilitation of immigration to Israel. I was making two separate points, and I guess I wasn't clear that one is race discrimination and the other religious.</li>
<li>ok</li>
<li>I think that this point is clearly a criticism of Zionism, and while it may be a part of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I feel that it is better placed in this article</li>

<ul>
<li>I believe they are mentioned in the relevant articles.</li>
<li>Your two points are contradictory; you claim Israel is discriminatory based on race, then you claim that it doesn't discriminate based on race, but on something else entirely.</li>

<p>I did some more article-reading, and I found the content on "Zionism and racism". So now I agree with you that we shouldn't duplicate content. However, I still think that this should more prominently linked to in this article, rather than just a vague link at the bottom of this page. Perhaps a section with a "main article" link.</p>
<p>Regarding "my two points". I think they're complimentary-- Two forms of (possibly) unfair discrimination: Religious and racist. Not contradictory at all. :)</p>

<dd>Hmm. Jews are racist because they give priviliges only to the Jewish "race", and they are discriminatory because they let anyone join the Jewish "race" and get those same privileges.

I must be miscommunicating :)</p>
<p>Israel only offers the so-called "right of return" to people who are, in their eyes, racially jewish, which means part of ancient or modern jewish colony, etc. etc. This right of return is not, for example, offerred to Arab Palestinians regardless of whether they marry an Israeli or convert to Judaism or do anything else differently. This "right of return" is not granted regardless of race. Clearly, it is a racist policy.</p>
<p>From my understanding, it is much easier to immigrate to Israel if you practice Judaism. This is religious discrimination. Here I am talking about the immigration policy.</p>

<p>In the utopia that exists in my head, race is really only useful for things like description of people by sight, etc. Culture, I think, makes a much better group identifier in most of the cases for which we use race.</p>
<p>With this in mind, my interest in anti-zionism shouldn't be taken to be anger over the israeli-palestine conflict. Even if this conflict was non-existant, I would still believe that having a country that exists for a particular race of people is a denial of the universal truth that we are all equal souls. This denial is what I feel is implied by Zionism and that is what I find offensive about it.</p>

<dd>How do you reconcile that view with the fact that Israel is by far the most multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious country in the region? While the surrounding countries have been and are rapidly ridding themselves of their non-Arab, non-Muslim citizens, in Israel the Arab, Christian, Muslim, and all other minorities are growing. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:24, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>America is also multi-cultural and multi-religious, but that does not imply that it is a bastion of non-discrimination; surely, there is still inequity. Just as there is inequity (in my eyes) in the ideology of some fanatical Muslims that seek to convert some middle-eastern countries into Muslim states. Nevertheless, all of this inequity can be methodically exposed within doctrine-- and this is my point... as above :)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All countries have inequities, as a result of basic human nature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe that basic human nature ensures the existence of inequity. I have more faith in mankind :) Just as one man (or woman) can act justly for a second, he can do so for an hour, for a day, forever-- and as it can be one person, it can be two... it can be all of us. Just as it is human nature to be evil, it is also human nature to find the divine, to find peace and justice, and that second impetus will eventually drown the first.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">References to Ethiopian Jews</span></h2>
<p>I would like to know, the people who removed my references to the Ethiopian Jews, are they disputing the facts or their mentioning in this article? since the accusation of Zionism as racist gets a fair mention here, it is imperative to mention some totally neutral facts in relation to it- that the Jews are not only white, there are also black Jews and Oriental Jews who are closer racially to the Palestinians than to Europeans. Any opposing view has to explain itself. If Zionism is racism, which race is it, and which races does it oppose? the accusers seldom mention this. Are the jews a race? are the palestinians a race? <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/524662.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/524662.stm" rel="nofollow">Jews from Ethiopia</a> I mean I would understand it if such an accuser believed that there are only white (Aryan...;) Jews, then such an accusation is at least not logically problematic. But to agree that peoples from the same race can be racist against each other, how can that be? if you are so sure of yourself, aren't you supposed to be only too eager to explain? <a href="../../../u/n/l/User%7EUnlessimwrong_f9f0.html" title="User:Unlessimwrong">User:Unlessimwrong</a></p>

<p><a name="Conceptual_and_other_errors_in_this_article" id="Conceptual_and_other_errors_in_this_article"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Conceptual and other errors in this article</span></h2>
<p>This article includes a number of logical and factual errors: A. "The defining characteristic of anti-Zionism is therefore opposition to the existence of the State of Israel (or at least opposition to the legitimization of its existence on the basis that the Jews had "the right to return to their homeland"), a state which was created as a result of the activities of the Zionism movement between 1897 and 1948."</p>
<p>The state of Israel came into being in 1948. The Zionist movement did not formally contemplate a state until the Biltmore declaration of 1942. Anti-Zionism had existed in one or another form since the 19th century and certainly since 1902. Anti-Zionism before 1948 could not possibly have been against the existence of the state of Israel, because the state of Israel didn't exist and nobody was thinking of making such a state before 1942. Anti-Zionists believe at least one of the following two propositions:</p>
<p>1- The Jews are not a people. 2- If the Jews are a people, they should not establish their own national home (not necessarily a state) until the Messiah comes (ultraorthodox Jewish anti-Zionism).</p>
<p>Anti-Zionist opposition to the existence of the state of Israel stems from the above two propositions, or from anti-Semitism, or from Arab self-interest.</p>
<p>B.- "Before the 1930s the majority of the world's Jews who were in a position to express an opinion could loosely be considered anti-Zionist, in the sense that they did not actively support the Zionist project for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine or elsewhere. Nevertheless, the use of the expression "anti-Zionism" to describe their attitudes needs to be heavily qualified."</p>
<p>Actually, the statement is rubbish. Most Jews were not Zionists in the 1920s, but they were not "anti-Zionists." The Jewish Agency formed in 1929 included both Zionist and non-Zionist organizations.</p>
<p>C.- " But Reform Jews did not reject the right of Jews to move to Palestine and reconstitute a Jewish nation within its borders. Rather, they rejected the view that they themselves had an obligation to do so."</p>
<p>The above is misleading. The Reform Jewish movement explicitly rejected the idea that the Jews were a people. In the Pittsburgh Platform of 1885 they stated: " We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of wany of the laws concerning the Jewish State."</p>

<dd>In regards to point (C) I don't see the contradiction. The early Reform Jews denied that Jews were a people, and they rejected the call for them to move en masse back to the land of Israel. But they never denied the right of Jews to move to the land of Israel if they so wished. In fact, they soon recanted their position that Jews were not a people. As a movement, early Reform Judaism was not anti-Zionist <i>in the same sense</i> that the other Anti-Zionist groups in this article were. The point of this section is to note that the term "Anti-Zionism" is so loosely defined that it covers many totally distinct groups. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 16:58, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi, Reform Judaism had its roots in the German enlightenment/assimiliationist movement, and it has a complex history that extends well before the Pittsburgh declaration and well before ZIonism. An excellent book on the subject is "The Pity of it all" by Amos Elon, Henry Holt, 2002 (or in Hebrew "German Requiem" 2004). They did not object to Zionism per se, because Zionism per se did not really exist - only the sense of Jewish national identification, which was an issue for German Jews.</p>
<p>Your statement "As a movement, early Reform Judaism was not anti-Zionist <i>in the same sense</i> that the other Anti-Zionist groups in this article were." is misleading and besides the point, because no two groups were ever "Anti-Zionist" in "the same sense." Your point "The point of this section is to note that the term "Anti-Zionism" is so loosely defined that it covers many totally distinct groups" indicates the problem with the definition of anti-Zionism in this article, which apparently includes also non-Zionists, Jews who were sympathetic but didn't want to move to Palestine immediately etc. It is a bad definition, and therefore it is a bad article. The assimilationists in Germany did not lose their objection to Jewish peoplehood or to Zionism as far as I know. I believe Walther Rathenau defended the 'non-people' issue very strongly with the backing of most of the enlightened Jewish community. He insisted that he is a German and that the Jews are part of the German Volk. Eventually he committed suicide after the Nazis came to power I believe, but that doesn't prevent others from taking up the same ideas today. In the USA, the Reform Movement gradually became non-assimilitionist and non-anti-Zionist as well, but that happened mostly after WW I.</p>
<p>You wrote: "But they never denied the right of Jews to move to the land of Israel if they so wished."</p>
<p>As far as I know, NO anti-Zionist movement _ever_ denied the right of (Individual) Jewish people to move to the land of Israel. Arab anti-Zionists object to mass immigration because they fear it will displace them, but most Palestinian anti-Zionists tell us they were quite happy with the situation as it was in the 19th century. Jews could come to the land then and some did.</p>
<p>Many of the Neturei Karteh live in Israel. Anti-Zionists of every stripe are quite happy with the idea that there will be a Jewish minority living in Israel under Arab rule, as long as those Jews do not try to set up a state or national home in any sense. In other words, as long as Palestine or the Vilayet of Al-Quds or whatever it might be called is no different from the USA or Britain or Germany or Iraq with regard to national rights of Jews.</p>
<p>Anti-Zionism of the Jewish-Marxist and the Jewish-assimilationist varieties objects to Zionism because it objects to the idea that the Jews are a people. Individuals of the "Mosaic faith" can live wherever they want, including Palestine, but cannot claim separate nationhood. In particular, German and British assimilationists were very upset by the idea that Jewish peoplehood would cause them to be suspected of dual loyalty. They objected to Zionism long before there was a state and long before the state was an official aim of the Zionist movement.</p>
<p>Anti-Zionism of the Jewish ultra-orthodox kind has to allow that the Jews are a people - "am Yisrael" - the people of Israel. However, they believe that this "chosen" people must not do anything practical regarding Jewish national rights, because these will be asserted by the Messiah, who will strike down the evil gentiles and initiate the rule of God's Chosen People. It is amusing to see that doctrinaire leftists and pro-Palestinians champion these medieval racist ideas with the same enthusiasm that right-wing Zionist Jewish fanatics welcome the support of Evangelical Christians.</p>
<p>Of course, the different groups that often quote each other and may link to each other on the Web each may have very different reasons for opposing Zionism, ranging from idealist anti-nationalism to Palestinian land claims to racism of different types, and with all stops in between. However, they all agree that there must not be a national home for the Jews. This was characteristic of these groups BEFORE there was a state of Israel and also when having a state was not a goal of ZIonism. Therefore, opposition to the existence of the State of Israel is a characteristic of anti-Zionism, but not the defining characteristic. [Ami I.]</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the pics - NPoV</span></h2>
<p>I think the choice of illustration for the parts "Arab anti-Zionism" and "Soviet anti-Zionism" doesn't respect the NPoV. These two images are linked to an antisemitic wing of anti-Zionism. The anti-Zionism in arab countries gathers an important number of points of view, so I think it's not neutral to illustrate the Arab anti-Zionism only by arab antisemitic propaganda. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoo_dd31.html" title="User:Marcoo">Marcoo</a> 13:11, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, sorry for my english.</p>
<p>I answer your question : Of course, for example Azmi Bishara, a politic leader coming from the arab minority in Israel, is against the idea of a Jewish State, therefore he is anti-Zionist (he asks for a State of Israel not defined with criteria of origin). I don't think that Bishara is anti-semitic. Many people like him share this point of view, for many years, in the Soviet and in others countries.</p>

<p>What about the opposite, did you explain why these pictures would represent the main aspect of anti-Zionist thought ?

If images must be removed merely "because they are a way to take position", we'd have to clean up <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">Propaganda</a> and many other articles. Human history is full of uncomfortable events, and a serious encyclopedia must cover them in neutral encyclopedic way, not hide or embellish them. If we remove some vital evidence relevant to a particular circumstance, the next editor will come along and insist that there is no evidence, therefore the text is all wrong. As a matter of fact, this happens everyday.</li>
<li>"Many people ... share this point of view, for many years" - but does it matter in a totalitarian society? The Soviet Union, many Arab countries, Maoist China, Nazi Germany, etc. were totalitarian societies. Their populations' humanistic views (if any - this still requires proof) didn't matter much.</li>
<li>What does "represent the main aspect of Anti-Zionism thought" in your opinion?

<p>"<i>What does "represent the main aspect of Anti-Zionism thought" in your opinion</i>" : -&gt; I have no answer for that. This question is complex because of the meaning of "main".

<p>Such Anti-Zionist caricatures are typically considered Anti-Semitic partly because they use Anti-Semitic <i>motifs</i>, not necessarily because they slander Jews in general (although this distinction is slim and not necessarily intended by the publisher). In other words, while borrowing motifs from traditional Anti-Semitism (and perhaps doing so intentionally out of genuine Anti-Semitism), these caricatures are usually (at least at the superficial level) aimed at Zionists, not Jews in general. The Soviet caricature in the article demonstrates this, where the spider has "Zionism" written on its back, not "Jews". The Arabic caricature, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be making this distinction. Anti-Semitic motifs are typical of Anti-Zionist propaganda, and the editors of this article are correct in illustrating it. I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the Arabic caricature with one that is clearly Anti-Zionist - the one in the article makes no distinction between Zionists and non-Zionists Jews. I'm sure you can come up with an alternative out of the plethora of Arabic Anti-Zionist caricatures.</li>
<li>The caricatures illustrate the Anti-Semitic motifs used in Anti-Zionist propaganda, not that Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitic. Make it clear in the captions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to make sure I'm not misunderstood - I am not claiming that these caricatures are not Anti-Semitic, I am claiming that they merely illustrate the use of Anti-Semitic motifs.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 07:09, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"<i>I am not claiming that these caricatures are not Anti-Semitic, I am claiming that they merely illustrate the use of Anti-Semitic motifs.</i>" -&gt; I agree with that point.</p>
<p>The point I disagree is "<i>Anti-Semitic motifs are typical of Anti-Zionist propaganda</i>". I think you're talking about the propaganda you've heard of. I lived in Arab countries and from my view point the Anti-Semitic motifs are a very rare aspect of Anti-Zionist propaganda, even in pictures or cartoons. And it alos depend of the arab country you are (more in Egypt for example). In palestinian territories or in Israel, the Arab use of Anti-Semitic motifs is almost inexistent. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoo_dd31.html" title="User:Marcoo">Marcoo</a> 08:47, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, your claim is that Anti-Semitic motifs are rare in Arabic Anti-Zionist propaganda. My understanding was that it was quite common, especially in past decades, and this understanding appears to be prevalent. I don't live in an Arab country, and I may be brainwashed, so why don't you help us by providing examples of Anti-Zionist propaganda that are not Anti-Semitic? Surely there should be plenty of examples if your claim is true.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 11:52, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I alreeady answered this question above, but I do it again. For example a large part of the Arab Anti-Zionist mouvement in Israel, with for exemple the leader Azmi Bishara, is against the idea of a Jewish State, therefore they're anti-Zionist (they ask for a State of Israel not defined with criteria of origin), and for more than 99 % they don't used any Anti-Semitic motifs for their propaganda. Many Arab people like them share this point of view, for many years, in the Soviet and in others countries. In the US, many Arab intellectuals are or were sometimes anti-Zionist, like Edward Said, but they're not Anti-Semitic. In Jordan, in palestinian cities, in Lebanon, in North Africa, many politic leaders have expressed Anti-Zionist positions, but never used Anti-Semitic motifs.</p>
<p>"<i>Anti-Semitic motifs are typical of Anti-Zionist propaganda</i>" is a typical example of PoV. That's why these pictures should be removed to respect a NPoV.</p>

<p>"<i>The Soviet cartoon is very typical and is far from the worst.</i>" -&gt; The fact "it's far from the worst" is true, it's a <b>fact</b>, you or I can prove it, a fact on which there is no serious dispute. Ok. But about if it's typical or not, it can only be a point of view. When you say that something is typical of something or not, it's always a appreciation. I re-read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> : "By "fact," we mean "a piece of information about which there is no serious dispute." .

<dd>I think it is safe to say that Anti-Semitic motifs are much less common in Anti-Zionist rhetorics in Israel and the West, so Bishara and Said are poor examples. Marcoo, there is an overwhelming amount of Arabic propaganda with Anti-Semitic motifs (a fact) and volumes have been written about this.

<dd>Your claim that it is a hate site, based on one tasteless article out of hundreds of articles posted there, is at best a stretch; the articles on that site are from generally reputable sources. As well, your suggesting that it is equivalent with the KKK is ludicrous. In addition, adding rampant POV to link descriptions is entirely inappropriate. However, the real issue with the site is that it is far too generous; if someone wants to find the actual "Anti-Zionism" related articles on the site and link to them, that would be more appropriate. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:16, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes I claim that it is a hate site. It advioocates special treatment of members of a racial group purely on the grounds of membership of that group. If we took that "tasteless article" and substituted "jew" for "muslim" throughout you and the JDL would have a fit - and I'd be none too happy either - it would be wrong. Or are you saying that it would be acceptable to advocate giving all jews a hard time because of the actions of some of them?</p>

<p>By all measures, even that article is not tastless. Hate sites usually have low standards, and if this is as "offensive" as the site gets ( in my perticular view it actually has a valid point that it is putting forward through satire) than there is no reason to remove it. There is nothing racist about that article. Islam is not a race and it is not demonizing Islam.</p>

<p>Look, I perfectly understand when people object to pov terms, but this is a clearcut case. Anti Zionism can be a <i>situational</i> Jewish theological position, and it is for Satmar, but Satmar objects to the secularism of the state of Israel and not that it exists, Neturei Karta is universally condemned by everyone as holding heretical theological positions with regards to Israel. When it comes to theology, you cannot argue, pov, you can argue the facts. The facts state that Satmar, the largest Anti Zionist Jewish group has condemned Neturei Karta and their affiliates as heretics. They are on the fringe of Jewish life. Here is the letter of condemnation<a href="http://www.jewishmediaresources.com/ncarticle/432/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishmediaresources.com/ncarticle/432/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>I don't understand the comparison. To qualify as Orthodox you have to fulfill certain religious qualifications. All the Orthodox sects have condemned Neturei Karta as heretical. "Fringe" is already giving it more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>

<p>Honestly guys - you will never meet anyone who cares less about doctrinal disputes within the Jewish Faith (I'm athiest) but "Fringe" just sounds like an attempt to marginalise these groups - and to some extent depricate their sincerely held point of view. That's just not policy. Personally I think you visit their site and it's pretty obvious they're 2 sandwiches short of a picnic - but we shouldn't be editorialising this in the main article. 62.253.64.14 6 July 2005 21:15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To begin with, some of these groups historically opposed Zionism but don't now. More importantly, many of these very groups were the ones that condemned Neturei Karta. Neturei Karta is a fringe group for precisely that reason; even anti-Zionist Haredi groups are against Neturei Karta. By the way, the site is deceptive; most of these "anti-Zionist" groups oppose Zionism as a <b>secular</b> movement, but they would be all for setting up Israel as a theocratic Jewish state. Neturei Karta, on the other hand, opposes any sort of Jewish state in Israel. That is what sets them apart. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 6 July 2005 23:51 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could very happily live with no descriptions - or at least having minimalist ones. I suspect that some of the "anti anti zionist" links probably belong to nutcases and "the fringe" as well (most of the Isaerli citizens I know are the same sort of middle of the road rasonable guy I like to think I am) - I doubt they are mainstream. I just really object to having descriptions which colour the first interaction with the site. If you allow "fringe" then you end up with everyone describing sites they disagree with as "marginal", "extremeist" etc. 62.253.64.14 7 July 2005 00:17 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is that caricature about?</span></h2>
<p>Mizrahi, please explain how a clearly anti-semitic caricature is "specifically" anti Zionist? According to this article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The defining characteristic of anti-Zionism is therefore opposition to the existence of the State of Israel (or at least opposition to the legitimization of its existence on the basis that the Jews had "the right to return to their homeland"), a state which was created as a result of the activities of the Zionism movement between 1897 and 1948."</dd>
</dl>
<p>How is this caricature related to anything but vile hatred towards Jews in general regardless of Zionism and Israel? Also, how can you say that it is "not necessarily anti-semitist? Hell yes it is anti-semitic. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:24, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wants to display <b>Jewish</b> world domination, and therefore is anti-semitic because of its vile nature. It does not indicate "Zionist" world domination. It looks like this image was drawn even before Zionism became a major force. This article is not about hating Jews, it is about opposition to the right to a Jewish homeland or to the State of Israel. Hatred of Jews is one reason for this, but not the only reason, so this image is not appropriate here, because there are many people who oppose Zionism who do not hate Jews, and some are Jewish themselves. Since this image clearly illustrates hatred of Jews as Jews, it belongs in anti-semitism, not here. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 04:17, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">accuracy</span></h2>
<p>Anti-zionism is not the same as anti-semitism! Anti-zionism is merely a manifestation of anti-semitism!</p>
<p>The 20th Century saw the destruction of empires and the creation of many new countries in their wake. This, of course, resulted in a myriad of disputes and wars - many a lot more bloody, unjust and barbaric than anything involving Israel - yet some people specifically target Israel and campaign against its very existence. This denial of the legitimacy of Israel's existence is what separates Anti-zionists from ordinary critics (although extreme unreasonable criticism is also rooted in anti-semitism).</p>
<p>Leaving aside peripheral arguments about social policy, Anti-Zionists often justify their unique objection to Israel's creation and existence on the grounds that:</p>
<p>A. the creation of Israel involved the destruction of Palestine.</p>
<p>However, there has never been a country called "Palestine". Until the modern State of Israel was formed, the land had been occupied by successive foreign empires since the destruction of the previous Jewish homeland.</p>
<p>Do these people oppose the creation of other states that have been freed from colonial occupation (for example Tunisia, the USA, Indonesia etc.)? If not, why are they biased against the JEWISH state?</p>
<p>B. the creation of Israel involved the Palestinian Arabs losing land and property. The same could be said in countless circumstances throughout history and across the world. The previous Kingdom of Israel was destroyed after the Romans threw out most of its Jews and changed its name to Palaestina.</p>
<p>The creation of Pakistan involved the dispossession of Indian Hindus. Serbs lost land &amp; property in Bosnia. How many anti-zionists are equally opposed to the existence of Pakistan &amp; Bosnia?</p>
<p>The bulk of British Mandate Palestine (and about a third of Ottoman Palestine) is now part of Jordan. Jordan annexed the West Bank and kicked out all the Jews. Are anti-zionists are equally opposed to the existence of Jordan? If not, why are they biased against the JEWISH state?</p>
<p>C. The Jews were 20th Century immigrants to the area. What about Arab immigration? At the beginning of the century, the census shows the Arab population was around 400,000. By mid century it had swollen to 1.3 million. Arabs from Lebanon, Syria &amp; Egypt emigrated there because of the development brought be returning Jews.</p>
<p>D. Zionism and the subsequent creation of Israel came about on the grounds of a religious doctrine that places Jews above non-Jews.</p>
<p>It is true that, aside from a miniscule minority of extremists, most religious Jews feel that God gave their people the State of Israel. Many Christians share this view and even the Koran states:</p>
<p>"And thereafter We (Allah) said to the People of the Book (the Jews): 'Dwell securely in the Promised Land. And when the last warning will come to pass, we will gather you together in a mingled crowd.'" (5) (Koran 17:104)</p>
<p>Italy's Imam Palazzi states:</p>
<p><b>"Using Islam as a basis for preventing Arabs from recognizing any sovereign right of Jews over the Land of Israel is new. Such beliefs are not found in classical Islamic sources. Concluding that anti-Zionism is the logical outgrowth of Islamic faith is wrong. This conclusion represents the false transformation of Islam from a religion into a secularized ideology."</b></p>
<p>Israel is of course, secular, liberal and pluralistic. There are much more obvious examples of theocracies in this world, but do anti-zionists also campaign against their existence?</p>
<p>Jews are more than just Judaism. Indeed, some Jews are atheists.</p>
<p>Take out the religion and there is still Jewish culture, identity, cooking, humour - even possibly some DNA - linking them. Some call the Jews a "people", some call them a "race", some call them an "ethnicity", but they started off as a Canaanite tribe in the land that eventually became Israel.</p>
<p>Even without the doctrinal aspects, the historical link of the Jewish people to their homeland is as valid as any other.</p>
<p>Do anti-zionists also oppose the territorial claims of Native Americans? Do they object to the homeland of the Irish? the French? What about the Palestinians????</p>
<p>Even in its most "sensitive" form, anti-Zionism hinges on double standards. Vehemently denying the right of Israel to exist on grounds that are ignored in the many more extreme examples across the world.</p>
<p>The question is - why are anti-zionists biased against Israel. What is unique about "The *JEWISH* State"?</p>
<p>Is it the cooking? Is it the design of the flag? Is it the (admittedly atrocious) pop music?</p>
<p>No, it can only be down to prejudice.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Although I can't quote a source on this, I'm sure you've heard of this view before. The fact is that Egypt and Jordan have formally accepted the existance of Israel, and almost all Arab and Muslim countries have sought contact with Israel one way or another at some time, which means their opposition to Israel, especially nowadays, is motivated by solidarity with the Palestinians. While Egypt and Jordan may have had other agendas in 1948, nowadays they no longer have territorial aspirations in Palestine and thus no direct conflict with Zionism. Pretty much all Arab and Muslim countries that do not recognize Israel and/or have no diplomatic relationship with Israel have stated that a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would pave the way to full relationship, with the notable exception of Syria, which has its own territorial dispute with Israel.</dd>
<dd>I think it would be better to rephrase this paragraph to reflect that this is a point of view. It certainly is not original research, and I think this view should be mentioned.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 07:58, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is, this opinion (no matter how popular) was stated as a fact. I won't mind if we have it sourced, but I am sure it is easy to find a sourced claim refuting it: if the Arab League states really cared about Palestinians, why would they let them rot in refugee camps for generations, expel them at will (like Quwait), or bomb them (like King Husayn)... The phrases like "solidarity with the Palestinians", "inaliable rights", "just settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict", etc. coming from that corner usually mean one thing: destruction of Israel, and they don't even hide it.

<dd>Why are reverts becoming more common than edits? I agree with your first point (I often mistakenly read "anti-Semitism" instead of "anti-Zionism", and the fact that many of the old Bolsheviks were Jewish eliminated the possibility of anti-Semitism <i>per se</i> - though they could, and did, oppose traditional Jewish culture). Your second point, however, seems highly unusual. Are you implying that official Soviet anti-Zionism did <i>not</i> reach a peak during the last years of Stalin's rule? What about "rootless cosmopolitans", the Doctors' plot, and so on and so forth? Clearly Stalin initiated a particularly strong anti-Zionist campaign during his last years in power.

<dd>Niko, please don't take it personally. As I tried to explain it, the text you kept inserting was factually wrong. Please assume good faith (I am not saying you have not!) and rather than making big changes, let's discuss one-by-one.</dd>
<dd>In Stalin times, the Sov. policies towards Zionism were more self-contradictory than both before and after him, see <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_and_the_Arab-Israeli_conflict_f10d.html#Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel" title="Soviet Union and the Arab-Israeli conflict">Soviet Union and the Arab-Israeli conflict#Establishment of the State of Israel</a> (an article to be expanded). From what I know, Stalin was not a towering figure of anti-Zionism such as Brezhnev. Internal Sov. anti-Semitism is not the same, although it is indirectly related. Your latest changes are better than your earlier ones (I fail to see the point of making them but I don't own the WP) but still need fixing.</dd>
<dd>This new wording is worse than before: <i><u>During the last years of Stalin's rule, roughly <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a></u>, official Soviet anti-Zionism was intensified. This included a campaign against so-called "<a href="../../../r/o/o/Rootless_cosmopolitan.html" title="Rootless cosmopolitan">rootless cosmopolitans</a>," the fabrication of the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctors%27_plot.html" title="Doctors' plot">Doctors' plot</a>, the <u>rise of "<a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionology.html" title="Zionology">Zionology</a>" and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionist_committee_of_the_Soviet_public_1ebb.html" title="Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public">Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public</a>.</u></i> -- But Zionology appeared only in the 1960s (mostly after Six-Day War) and AKCO was created in 1983.

<dd>Well, I'm a self-admitted nitpick. In this particular case, I'm bothered by the fact that the previous text of the <i>Soviet anti-Zionism</i> section did not follow chronological order. First should come the pre-WW2 period, then the last years of Stalin's rule, then the rest of the Cold War (if we had a longer section, we could divide that further into pre-1967 and post-1967, but as it stands now we have a 3-paragraph summary - which is not necessarily bad in itself, as long as we have a longer main article). Soviet history is one of my main interests, though I know little about official anti-Zionism and relations with Israel, hence the reason why my edits consist of mere restructuring of information and sometimes need to be corrected.

<p>Good idea. Otherwise anti-zionism as a form of anti-racism become misrepresented. Or perhaps it would be an idea to define anti-zionism rather then zionism. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<p>Since nobody objected to using bulletpoints or came up with a better alternative I guess it's OK... But I'll have a go at it. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry to say this, I feel that debulleting made it much worse: IMHO, "may for instance be" is a bad way to introduce a concept; Zionism has nothing to do with <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_as_a_chosen_people.html" title="Jews as a chosen people">Jews as a chosen people</a>, etc. I'm planning to revert because the previous intro was a result of long disputes and edit wars. What is exactly wrong with it? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 02:56, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The introduction fails to make an introduction to Anti-Zionism. Instead it presents Zionism. It would make so much more sense to write about the subject of the article. The "may for instance be" is because Anti-Zionism may be almost anything from racism to anti-racism. "Zionism is based heavily upon religious tradition linking the Jewish people to the Land of Israel"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, but OK "choosen people" is perhaps the wrong words. Would "historical right" be better? I'll give it a try. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>"may be many different things like" is hardly encyclopedic. Also you reverted a spelling correction by Rbarreira. I'll try to "make an introduction", but please note that the next section is Defining anti-Zionism. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 01:37, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are still defining Zionism, not Anti-Zionism. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No I am not. I think these two lines sum up the subject better than "may be many different things", "or just the opposition to a text book definition of Zionism", especially considering that the next section is "Defining anti-Zionism". ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 08:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, what about cuting it out entierly? (And adding a section on "Anti-Racist Anti-Zionsim") // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

</dl>
<p>Yes, either that or "Anti-Zionism and Anti-Racism". All the headings have the form of "NNN anti-Zionism" or "Anti-Zionism and NNN". What would you suggest? // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>For political movements, all the titles are in the format "NNN and MMM". The title "Anti-Racist Anti-Zionsim" would imply that WP takes this position. This would be a POV. Just in case you don't know, the "anti-racism" label was a part of Soviet official ideology, and during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> the USSR tried to connect <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism_and_racism.html" title="Zionism and racism">Zionism and racism</a>. These efforts gloriously failed (even in unreformed UN), together with the USSR itself, in 1991. Why duplicate that failed allegation here? Also, you still did not make it clear what do you think is wrong with the current intro. Why do you want to remove it? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 00:31, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current into failes to define Anti-Zionism and instead define Zionism (and we have an entier article for that). I have tried to reword it to instead define Anti-Zionism, but it keeps getting reverted. Unless it manages to define Anti-Zionism it has to go. Ok, so your're cool with "Anti-Zionism and Anti-Racism"? I think "Anti-Racist Anti-Zionsim" sounds better since that type of Anti-Zionism oposes Zionism on the basis that they consider it a form of racism. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course the text such as "may be many different things", "or just the opposition to a text book definition of Zionism" (which text book?) should not belong in a serious encyclopedia. If the current text fails to define the term, please offer a better definition. Why would we want a section "Anti-Zionism and Anti-Racism" here if there is entire long article <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism_and_racism.html" title="Zionism and racism">Zionism and racism</a>? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 01:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would deal specificly with anti-racist Anti-Zionism rather than the general claim, but yes, it would probably refer to that article for more in depth information. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<dd>After some thinking, I agree with your suggestion to remove the bullet list from the intro. The following sections attempt to define the term better.
