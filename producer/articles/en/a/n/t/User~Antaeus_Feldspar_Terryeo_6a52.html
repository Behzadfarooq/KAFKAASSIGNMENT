<p>Terryeo has already been warned about including disputed claims with no warning that they are disputed, and yet adds this passage to the introduction of an article: "For example, a man with bad knees undergoes Dianetics and he can walk again. Controversy erupts on this point. How can thought have any effect on the man's ability to walk?"</p>

<p>Terryeo frequently presents bizarre interpretations of various policies and guidelines in order to justify some edit that he wishes to make, or in order to justify reverting an edit by some other editor and subjecting that editor to harsh criticism for supposedly "violating" the rules. This happens so very frequently, and Terryeo's interpretations are sometimes so bizarre, that it becomes impossible to believe that they are what Terryeo <i>really</i> believes the intent of the rules to be.</p>

<p>Terryeo once more repeats the false claim that Wikipedia guidelines somewhere state that the only proper form for an article's introduction is "Term, Topic, Context" meaning "1. Term. 2. Topic, 3. Context." This is phrased with disrespect for his fellow editors as "Why is it necessary with <b>you people</b> to point out that simple, straightforeward statemetns like: "Term, Topic, Context" mean 1. Term. 2. Topic, 3. Context." (emphasis added).</p>

<p>After it has been explained to him several times what "forking" is, Terryeo uses it completely inappropriately at <a href="../../../e/n/g/Talk%7EEngram_e980.html" title="Talk:Engram">Talk:Engram</a> to describe either the creation of a disambiguation page or the addition of a dictionary definition to a disambiguation page.

<p>Asked to either use the word correctly, or if he cannot, to stop using it, Terryeo responds forcefully and rudely that "I'll use the word "fork" anytime I choose to." and "I'll use "fork" when I wish and speak the word to whom I wish when I wish to. Do you get it?"</p>

<p>Terryeo is quick enough to verbally abuse other editors for not meeting his standards, and almost always to accuse them of bad faith, of trying to "prevent Dianetics from being communicated." (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health&amp;diff=36045409&amp;oldid=36042735" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health&amp;diff=36045409&amp;oldid=36042735" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, for a single edit in which Terryeo makes at least four separate accusations that editors are "preventing the subject from being understood" and at least two accusations to specified people that they are doing so deliberately.) However, it is far from clear whether Terryeo actually <i>has</i> an objective set of standards in mind which he follows himself and thinks others should as well; instances of Terryeo actually spelling out what would meet his standards are quite rare -- far outnumbered by Terryeo simply blasting editors for <i>not</i> having met his standards. <i>Also</i> making it hard to believe that Terryeo actually ever intends to let anything other editors do meet his "standards" is the fact that Terryeo has violated some of the very same standards he accused other editors of <i>not</i> meeting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Newspaper sources were added to verify the Xenu story.</li>
<li>Terryeo also changes the wording in the paragraph to read that "<b>A</b> newspaper report and <b>a</b> critic of Scientology" claim that there is a volcano/cover connection. This is five days after Terryeo has been presented with trial testimony in which Warren McShane testifies to the cover connection.</li>
<li>Terryeo is wrong about either article not making the volcano/cover connection:

</ul>
<p>At this point, Terryeo clearly knows that <i>many</i> critics share and state the belief that the volcano on the cover refers to the Xenu story, whether one is named and cited or a dozen, and he clearly knows that it is not just newspapers and critics, in any number, but also Scientology's own witness Warren McShane. Is it possible that one could seriously argue that this level of rigidity -- surpressing information <i>known</i> to be true, simply because no citation <i>yet</i> exists in the article -- is an appropriate one for Wikipedia? It is <i>theoretically</i> possible, though one would have to ask why this individual is trying to degrade the text to match the citations, rather than trying to improve the citations. But such an argument can <b>only</b> be believed sincere coming from someone who is applying the same standard of rigidity to his or her <i>own</i> edits -- which we will see Terryeo does <i>not</i>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Applied_Scholastics&amp;diff=36955323&amp;oldid=36952171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Applied_Scholastics&amp;diff=36955323&amp;oldid=36952171" rel="nofollow">15:59, 27 January 2006</a> Terryeo's edit summary: "The link to a "smear site" doesn't have a word in it about Applied Scholastics. Removed it." Terryeo's edit doesn't just remove a link, it removes all the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Hubbard's] only academic qualification was a PhD from <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequoia_University_484a.html" title="Sequoia University">Sequoia University</a>, a now defunct diploma mill, although he occasionally claimed to have degrees in engineering or nuclear physics. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/Media/Ybor/flyer-2005-aug.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/Media/Ybor/flyer-2005-aug.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>[Hubbard's] teaching experience in a secular context was limited to teaching English for a month in <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guam.html" title="Guam">Guam</a> while his father was stationed there.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The "Study Technology" has never been the subject of a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer reviewed</a> study. As such, most non-Scientologist educators dismiss it outright.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if Terryeo's reasons for removing the link were valid, it wouldn't justify removing everything else he removed. However, not even his link removal is valid: The link may not mention Applied Scholastics, but it verifies that even today the Church of Scientology is still incorrectly claiming that Hubbard was a Ph.D, and a nuclear physicist.
