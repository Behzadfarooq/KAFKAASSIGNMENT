While it is true that some IP edits have been needlesome, they are manageable because the article is closely watched by a global audience. Reverts have been made by many editors, including some with IP addresses. Blatant vandalism is usually corrected within minutes and at all hours of the day. I have been an active contributor to the article since September 2006.

I really need to ask you about Wiki Meeting. Is there always Wiki Meeting in Same Place in every one year? In my opinion, Wiki Meeting is always openning in everywhere. For Example, I live in Los Angeles area, but you live in Santa Barbara which is next to Solvang, and Ventura(Oxnard). I remerber that I enjoyed in Santa Barbara about before 3 years ago when I came to America from my own country. Is Wiki Meeting's location always different even in Los Angeles Area? Is Wiki Meeting in Los Angeles always be in Los Angeles? or Santa Barbara? Because we are California Wikipedian. Have you ever participated in Wiki Meeting with Jimbo Wales? Just want to know about Wiki Meeting in Los Angeles. So Could you reply this in my talk page?

However, I don't have experience contributing to wikipedia, and I do think that both the "Baroque vs Renaissance style" and "Baroque vs Classical style" session are not necessary, since the former will be explained in the "Early baroque" part, and the latter will be discussed in the "transition to the Classical era". My question is: should I announce those ideas in the discussion page and wait for approval, or should I just go ahead and make the changes (and explain them in the discussion page)? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarazadd_3e13.html" title="User:Narazadd">Narazadd</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENarazadd_d579.html" title="User talk:Narazadd">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Narazadd_f6f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Narazadd">contribs</a>) 19:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC).</small></font></p>

<p><font color="black">H Antandrus. I noticed you reverted a users insertion of linkspam into the Saddam Hussein Article. I was checking this guy's contributions and I noticed two unusual things. One, he has only made three edits. One, a vandalism edit about 6 months ago. The linkspam he added to the Saddam Hussein page, and finally he created his userpage, but all it has on it are the linkspam he added to the Saddam page. I clicked through to the link and it goes to a video he has uploaaded on Youtube (same username), so obviously he is trying to do this to ratchet up the views and attract traffic to his youtube and google video page. I didnt want to just go in and blank his userpage, so I thought I'd ask someone who probably knows more about this area than me...namely you. As this account appears to have been used only for vandalism and linkspam, (both on article and userpages) what should be done? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 03:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Hello,</font></p>
<p><font color="black">I have just checked the page I set up HAYDN - Nobody Knows Me to discover that you have deleted it due to the fact that there was only one source for the information and product. Please, can you give me some tips on how to get around this? I spent time and care to get this page correct even obtaining permission from the publisher of the book and from the author so I could use his picture and place his book on here. I thought this was a public arena to share things of interest with other? I thought a true story of a boys struggle would be of extreme interest to people and I wanted to share it. What information would I have to obtain to be permitted to use this apparent elitist site? Can only the author or publisher place books or entertainment on here? I am being to think this site is a little strict.</font></p>

This user, who has something over 200 sockpuppets, who get blocked (of course) as soon as they appear, appears to have infinite access to the project.

Or, if it is a University or similar establishment, contact the powers-that-be on-site and work with them to eradicate his activity? Or am I being naiive and stupid?

<p><font color="black">Good morning! I just discovered that a search for "Muti" does not send you to "Riccardo Muti" but rather to some discussion of traditional African medicine, and there's no indication that there might be other things "Muti" could refer to.

<p>Hi, Antandrus! Happy New Year!</p>
<p>On January 12th I posted a message at the Help Desk. Curiously, it received ZERO response. So yesterday I posted it on the VP/Technical page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28technical%29#Subject_.2F_headlines_on_Talk_Pages_.28or_the_lack_thereof.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28technical%29#Subject_.2F_headlines_on_Talk_Pages_.28or_the_lack_thereof.29" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> This time it DID receive a detailed response, but it's WAY beyond my level of understanding. Can you advise or direct me to the proper folks? Thanks! ~~Newbie <a href="../../../m/p/w/User%7EMpwrmnt_03dc.html" title="User:Mpwrmnt">Mpwrmnt</a> 08:34, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me. I didn't realise the person already had to be established. I feel a bit stupid because I received a message from HAYDN himself and he also said the same as you that this page is not to be used as a career launching platform. I didn't mean any offence I just wanted to make people aware of a really good book. HAYDN told me to wait and see if he does well first. He uses this place alot and seems to know the rules better than I.</p>
<p>Have a good day<br />

<p>Just wanted to commend your swift action on the vandalism of User:35.11.229.96. I'd reverted his changes on <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucifer.html" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, and by the time I'd gotten to double-check which subst's to use on vandals' talk pages, I found out that:</p>
<p>(a) he'd already vandalized again, (b) you'd already reverted it, and (c) you'd already managed to warn him on his talk page.</p>
<p>By now, it looks like he's realized that he can't make any permanent changes to the encyclopedia, and stopped.</p>

I have noticed that you (&amp; others) have a way of marking your reversions with a stock identifier, something like "reverting edits by XXX..." How do you do that? I just keep putting "rv" into the comment box, but yours seems so much more official. Merci! --<a href="../../../w/s/p/User%7EWspencer11_8aca.html" title="User:Wspencer11">Wspencer11</a> <a href="../../../w/s/p/User_talk%7EWspencer11_b16d.html" title="User talk:Wspencer11">(talk to me...)</a> 01:15, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Antandrus, I've noticed that you've made some recent edits to the page on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism_%28music%29.html" title="Nationalism (music)">Musical nationalism</a> and would like to propose collaborating on the article in order to turn it from a mere list of composers into a more comprehensive overview of the trend.

<li>Hi. Immediately upon his band being lifted he wrote a message supposedly from me on his talk page (the Wikipedia nerd bit). I haven't even looked yet to see what other vandaism he's done. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 10:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, other than the attack I see no vandalism yet. He did however falsify 1 message from you (before the block), 3 from me, and removed a warning from another editor. Jeeze, some people get blocked for disagreeing a little too impolitely and this fellow is hell bent on harassment and vandalism. We can't do any better than 24 hr block?

<dd>Yes--he had moved it into the mainspace, which is inappropriate since the encyclopedia is only for people who are notable by the community's standards, and only for biographies which can be sourced reliably using multiple independent published sources.
