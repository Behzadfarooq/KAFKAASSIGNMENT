It ranges from <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hoc.html" title="Ad hoc">ad hoc</a> antagonism towards Jews on an individual level to the institutionalized prejudice once prevalent in European societies, of which the highly explicit ideology of <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>'s <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">National Socialism</a> was perhaps the most extreme form.</p>
<p>Many partisans bitterly dispute whether the various forms of hostility are justified or not, and there are numerous disputes over what sort of adverse speech, attitudes or actions ought to be labelled "anti-Semitic".</p>
<p>This article will describe attitudes and action that are often referred to as anti-Semitism, ranging from mild individual criticism on up through theological disagreements; <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a>; the so-called <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>; <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>; opposition to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> and modern attitudes toward <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>.</p>

<p>The political writer <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Marr_ca70.html" title="Wilhelm Marr">Wilhelm Marr</a> is credited with <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_coinage.html" title="Word coinage">coining</a> the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> word <i>Antisemitismus</i> in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, at a time when <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_science.html" title="Racial science">racial science</a> was fashionable in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> but <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> prejudice was not. This term was offered as an alternative to the older German word <i>Judenhass</i>, meaning <i>Jew-hating</i>, but did nothing to lessen Marr's reputation as an anti-Semite. (See also the coinage of the term <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a> by Germans to refer to the nation or people known as <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, as distinct from the religion of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>.)</p>
<p>So far as can be ascertained, the word was first printed in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>. In that year Marr published "Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte," and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Scherer_607e.html" title="Wilhelm Scherer">Wilhelm Scherer</a> used the term "Antisemiten" in the "Neue Freie Presse" of January. The related word <i><a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitism.html" title="Semitism">semitism</a></i> was coined around <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, the term referred to prejudice towards Jews alone, and not to people who speak semitic languages as a whole (e.g., Arabs). For nearly a century this has been the only use of this word. In recent decades, however, some people have argued that the term anti-Semitism should be extended to include prejudice against Arabs, since Arabic is a semitic language but this usage has not been widely adopted. The unhyphenated term <i>antisemitism</i> is favored by some to represent anti-Jewish beliefs or behavior.</p>
<p>N.B.: The terms <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> and "anti-Semitic" are not antonyms, despite the use of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefix.html" title="Prefix">prefix</a> "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti.html" title="Anti">anti</a>."</p>

<p>Anti-semitism is often defined as ranging from ad hoc antagonism towards Jews on an individual level to the institutionalized prejudice once prevalent in European societies, of which the highly explicit ideology of <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>'s <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">National Socialism</a> was perhaps the most extreme form.</p>
<p><br />
Some Jews traditionally see the world as a dichotomy: non-Jews either show sympathy and are philo-Semites or they show antipathy and are Anti-Semites. This broader definition sometimes causes some confusion as it is only a political label and has no connotations of passing moral judgement.</p>

<p>The concept of anti-Semitism as a sociopolitical theory belongs to the 20th century. However, political and cultural anti-Semitism can be traced back to the ancient world and anticipates the rise of anti-Semitism in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Judaic traditions extend at least a thousand years <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">BCE</a> (before the common era), and are the historical predecessor for the religions of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, both of whom hold some Judaic traditions and texts as sacred, though differ in aspects that are central to each distinct branch of religion.</p>
<p>Hence Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, each took different course in terms of beliefs, as well as traditional customs; each creating a separate and distinct culture, from the parent Judaism. Those who held to traditional Judaic belief were considered "deniers" of the newer beliefs and traditions, in much the same way that every religion considers people of other religions to be denying the truth.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Semitism_Draft_629e.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Judaism in the New Testament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Judaism in the New Testament</span></h4>
<p>Christian theological anti-Semitism was stimulated by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>'s replacement theology, or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersessionism.html" title="Supersessionism">supersessionism</a>, which taught that with the coming of Jesus a new covenant has rendered obsolete and has superseded the religion of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. It was believed that "the wicked Jews", as a people, were responsible for the death of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. A number of Christian preachers, particularly in the Middle Ages and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, additionally taught that religious Jews <i>choose to follow a faith that they actually know is false</i> out of a desire to offend God.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> is alleged by many anti-Catholics to have followed the "theology" until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. While there were many Catholics who were anti-semitic, this attitude toward the Jews was repeatedly condemned by the official Magisterium of the Church, was never a doctrine of the Catholic Church in which all the faithful were bound to believe. The Catechism of the Council of Trent (XVI century), states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the cross, those who plunge themselves into disorders and crimes crucify the Son of God anew in their hearts (for he is in them) and hold him up to contempt. And it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater in us (Christians) than in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the Apostle, "None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." We, however, profess to know him. And when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way seem to lay violent hands on him</i>. (Roman Catechism I, 5, 11)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rather, as part of <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_II_09ad.html" title="Vatican II">Vatican II</a>, which was a pastoral council and not a dogmatic council (it taught no new doctrine), the official condemnations of the deicide charge were reiterated. A small number of Protestant sects still teach it, however.</p>
<p>Some examples of anti-Semitism in the New Testament are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jesus said to them [i.e., the "Jews"], "You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. . . . He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is you are not of God." (John 8:44-47)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it. (Acts 13:46-48)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie -- behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you. (Rev. 3:9).</dd>

<p>Prejudice against Jews can be traced back to the Graeco-Roman period and the rise of Hellenistic culture. Most Jews rejected efforts to assimilate themselves into the dominant <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycenaean_civilization.html" title="Mycenaean civilization">Greek</a> (and later <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a>) culture, and their religious practices, which conflicted with established norms, were perceived as being backward and primitive. <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Cornelius_Tacitus_1cb9.html" title="Gaius Cornelius Tacitus">Gaius Cornelius Tacitus</a>, for example, writes disparagingly of many real and imagined practices of the Jews, while there are numerous accounts of <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> being described as barbarous.</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaspora.html" title="Diaspora">Diaspora</a>, Jews tended to live in separate communities, in which they could practice their religion. This led to charges of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">elitism</a>, as appear in the writings of <a href="../../../c/i/c/Cicero.html" title="Cicero">Cicero</a>. As an ethnic minority, Jews were also dependent on the goodwill of the authorities, though this was considered irksome to the indigenous population, which regarded any vestiges of autonomy among the local Jewish communities as reminders of their subject status to a foreign empire. Nevertheless, this did not always mean that opposition to Jewish involvement in local affairs was anti-Semitic. In 411 BCE, an Egyptian mob destroyed the Jewish temple at Elephantine in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, but many historians argue that this was provoked by anti-<a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> sentiment, rather than by anti-Semitism per se -- the Jews, who were protected by the imperial power, were perceived as being its representatives.</p>
<p>The enormous and influential Jewish community in the ancient Egyptian port city of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria%2C_Egypt_dda4.html" title="Alexandria, Egypt">Alexandria</a> saw manifestations of an unusual brand of anti-Semitism in which the local pagan populace rejected the biblical narrative of the <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> as being anti-Egyptian. In response, a number of works were produced to provide an "Egyptian version" of what "really happened": the Jews were a group of sickly lepers that was expelled from Egypt. This was also used to account for Jewish practices -- they were so sickly that they could not even wander in the desert for more than six days at a time, requiring a seventh day to rest, hence the origin of the Sabbath. It was these charges that led to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo.html" title="Philo">Philo</a>'s apologetic account of Judaism and Jewish history, which was so influential in the development of early church doctrine.</p>
<p>Prejudice against Jews in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> was formalized in <a href="../../../3/9/1/391.html" title="391">391</a>, when the Edict of Theodosius established Christianity as the only legal religion in the Roman Empire, although already as early as 305, in Elvira, a Spanish town in Andalusia near Granada, the first known laws of any church council against Jews appeared. Christian women were forbidden to marry Jews unless the Jew first converted to Christianity. Jews were forbidden to extend hospitality to Christians. Jews could not keep Christian concubines and were forbidden to bless the fields of Christians. In <a href="../../../5/8/9/589.html" title="589">589</a>, in Christian Spain, the Third Council of Toledo ordered that children born of marriage between Jews and Christians be baptized by force. A policy of forced conversion of all Jews was initiated. Thousands fled, and thousands of others converted.

<p>In <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> the main source of prejudice against Jews is believed by some to be <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a>; according to teachings of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, Jews were collectively and permanently responsible for killing <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> (see <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deicide.html" title="Deicide">Deicide</a>). Others however argue that this was never a formal position of the Catholic Church; it cannot be found in any official magesterial teaching of any pope, and in fact, was repeatedly taught against by numerous popes.</p>
<p>In an addition to prejudice based on religious grounds, there were also socio-economic factors. Local authorities, rulers, and some church officials closed many occupations to the Jews, leaving them to be local tax collectors and lenders These restrictions varied from one locale to another and one time period to another. Jews were also discriminated against because of their participation in the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_trade.html" title="Slave trade">slave trade</a> (especially between Slavic countries and the Muslim empire).</p>
<p>In consequence of their alien status, Jews were often excluded socially and politically from the societies in which they lived, or alternately, were forced to enter professions that were considered socially inferior (tax- and rent-collectors, money-lenders, and so on) which provided a basis for claims that the Jews engaged in <a href="../../../u/s/u/Usury.html" title="Usury">usury</a>. Over time, these professions engendered animosity among the people who came into contact with Jews -- peasants, who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could personify Jews as the people taking their earnings, while remaining loyal to the lords on whose behalf the Jews worked.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, the most visible forms of anti-Semitism were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racist</a> anti-Semitism, a kind of xenophobia. Some people perceive Jews as people of a racially distinct origin from other peoples, and claim that discrimination on the basis of such distinctness is valid.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">Religious</a> anti-Judaism. Like other religions, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> has faced discrimination and violence from people of competing faiths and in countries that practice <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_atheism.html" title="State atheism">state atheism</a>. Unlike anti-Semitism in general, this form of prejudice is directed at the religion itself, and so does not affect those of Jewish ancestry who have converted to another religion. Nevertheless, there have been instances, such as in Spain during the Inquisition, in which Jews who had converted were suspected of practicing Judaism in secret.</li>
<li>Socio-Economic anti-semitism rooted in the disproportionate success, relative to their numbers within the general population, that individuals Jews have achieved in a variety of occupations, including academic, legal, medical, scientific, financial and most rarely political.</li>
</ul>
<p>From around the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> through the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th</a> there were Christians who believed that some (or all) Jews possessed magical powers; some believed that they had gained these magical powers from making a deal with the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">devil</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Semitism_Draft_629e.html" title="Edit section: The blood libel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The blood libel</span></h3>
<p>On many occasions, Jews were accused of a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>, the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. According to the authors of these blood libels, the "procedure" for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty, was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The boy would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied; he would eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the boy would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised and the blood dripping from the boy's wounds, would be caught in bowls or glasses. Finally, the boy would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. His dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.</p>
<p>The story of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Norwich_7191.html" title="William of Norwich">William of Norwich</a> (d. 1144) is the first known case of ritual murder being alleged by a Christian monk. It does not mention the collection of William's blood for any purpose. The story of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Saint_Hugh_of_Lincoln_3e9a.html" title="Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln">Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln</a> (d. 1255) said that after the boy was dead, his body was removed from the cross and laid on a table. His belly was cut open and his entrails removed for some occult purpose, such as a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haruspex.html" title="Haruspex">divination ritual</a>. The story of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_of_Trent_c456.html" title="Simon of Trent">Simon of Trent</a> (d. 1475) highly stressed how the boy was held on a large bowl so all his blood could be collected.</p>
<p>Many blood libel accusations and trials of Jews took place during 1250 CE to 1840 CE. A famous example was one in England, 1255, the case of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Saint_Hugh_of_Lincoln_3e9a.html" title="Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln">Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln</a> resulted in the execution of 19 Jews. In Englan, 1475, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_of_Trent_c456.html" title="Simon of Trent">Simon of Trent</a>, aged two, disappeared, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Sixtus_V_b671.html" title="Pope Sixtus V">Pope Sixtus V</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/8/1588.html" title="1588">1588</a>. His status as a saint was removed in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_VI_4529.html" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a>, though his murder is still promoted as a fact by a handful of extremists. In Kiev, Russia, 1911, a Jewish factory manager, Mendel Bailis, was accused of murdering a Christian child and using his blood in matzos. He was acquitted by an all-Christian jury after a sensational trial in 1913. Int he 20th century, blood libel stories have appeared a number of times in the state-sponsored media of a number of Arab nations, in Arab television shows, and on websites.</p>

<p>Host desecration is an anti-Semitic myth similar to the blood libel myth. It started in late 13th century England and France (a century after Christians started making blood libel accusations against Jews), where people claimed that Jews would steal consecrated host wafers and torture them. According to the theory of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transubstantiation.html" title="Transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a>, a consecrated host wafer became the flesh of Jesus, so it was believed that Jews would steal and torture these wafers to reenact Jesus's crucifixion. This myth portrayed Jews in an even worse light than the blood libels: rather than killing a mere human, the Jews allegedly tortured what they believed to be the Messiah and the son of God.</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> Clement VIII (1536-1605) helped promulgate classical anti-Semitism in the Catholic community. In his words, "All the world suffers from the usury of the Jews, their monopolies and deceit. They have brought many unfortunate people into a state of poverty, especially the farmers, working class people and the very poor. Then, as now, Jews have to be reminded intermittently that they were enjoying rights in any country since they left Palestine and the Arabian desert, and subsequently their ethical and moral doctrines as well as their deeds rightly deserve to be exposed to criticism in whatever country they happen to live."</p>

<p>The <b><a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusades</a></b> were a series of several military campaigns sanctioned by the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papacy.html" title="Papacy">Papacy</a> that took place during the <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_century.html" title="11th century">11th</a> through <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th centuries</a>.

<p>The mobs accompanying the first three Crusades attacked the Jewish community in Germany, France, and England, and put many of them to death; this left behind for centuries strong feelings of ill will on both sides. The social position of the Jews in western Europe was distinctly worsened by the Crusades, and legal restrictions became frequent during and after them. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of Pope Innocent III., and formed the turning-point in the medieval history of the Jews.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pale_of_Settlement_42c9.html" title="Pale of Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a> was the border region of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> in which Jews were allowed to live.

<p><a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky_651d.html" title="Bohdan Khmelnytsky">Bohdan Khmelnytsky</a> (that being his <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_language.html" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian</a> name; he was known in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_language.html" title="Polish language">Polish</a> as <b>Bohdan Zenobi Chmielnicki</b>, and in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> as <b>Bogdan Khmelnitsky</b>) was the leader of what came to be known as the Khmelnytsky massacres. Khmelnytsky (<i>c.</i> <a href="../../../1/5/9/1595.html" title="1595">1595</a> - <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/5/1657.html" title="1657">1657</a>) was a Polish (arguably) noble, leader of the Zaporozhian <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cossacks.html" title="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, hetman of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, noted for his revolt against <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Poland</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a> - <a href="../../../1/6/5/1654.html" title="1654">1654</a>), and a <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Pereyaslav_6e2c.html" title="Treaty of Pereyaslav">Treaty of Pereyaslav</a> which led to annexing <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> by the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>For centuries after creation of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth the people of <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a> had felt oppressed by the nobles and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> traders. Although Ruthenian nobility enjoyed full rights, they quickly polonised and therefore were alienated from common people; the advent of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Reformation_17e4.html" title="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> meant troubles in relationship between orthodox and catholic faith. Unwilling to attend to the details of administration themselves, Polish magnates made the Jewish citizens a go-between in the transactions with the peasants of Ukraine. They sold and leased certain privileges to Jews for a lump sum, and, while enjoying themself at the court, left it to Jewish leaseholders and collectors to become the embodiment of hatred to the oppressed and long-suffering peasant. Although Chmielnicki's personal resentment influenced his decision to rid the Ukraine of Polish and Ruthenian magnates and Jews, it seems that it was his ambition to become the ruler of Ukraine which was the main motive that led him to instigate the uprising of the <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenians.html" title="Ruthenians">Ruthenian people</a> against the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnate.html" title="Magnate">magnates</a> and the Jews.</p>
<p>Khmelnytsky told the people that the Poles had sold them as slaves "into the hands of the accursed Jews." With this as their battle-cry, the Cossacks massacred a huge number of Jews during the years of 1648-1649. The precise number of victims may never be known, but estimates range from a minimum of 10,000 to well over 100,000 Jews murdered.

Dreyfus was, in fact, innocent: the conviction rested on false documents, and when high-ranking officers realised this they attempted to cover up the mistakes. The writer <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Zola_78bb.html" title="Emile Zola">Emile Zola</a> exposed the affair to the general public in the literary newspaper <i>L'Aurore</i> (The Dawn) in a famous open letter to the <i>President of France|Président de la République</i> <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/l/F%C3%A9lix_Faure_6e88.html" title="Félix Faure">Félix Faure</a>, titled <i>J'accuse!</i> (I Accuse!) on January 13, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>.</p>
<p>The Dreyfus Affair split France between the <b>dreyfusards</b> (those supporting Alfred Dreyfus) and the <b>antidreyfusards</b> (those against him). The quarrel was especially violent since it involved many issues then highly <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversial.html" title="Controversial">controversial</a> in a heated political climate.</p>
<p>Dreyfus was pardoned in 1899, readmitted into the army, and made a knight in the <a href="../../../l/%C3%A9/g/L%C3%A9gion_d%27Honneur_51ff.html" title="Légion d'Honneur">Legion of Honour</a>.

<p><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a> is a term that has been used to describe several very different political and religious points of view (both historically and in current debates) all expressing some form of opposition to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>. A large variety of commentators - politicians, journalists, academics and others - believe that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and attribute this to anti-Semitism. In turn, critics of this view believe that associating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism is intended to stifle debate, deflect attention from valid criticism, and taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.</p>
