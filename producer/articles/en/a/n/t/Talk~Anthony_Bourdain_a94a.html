<p>Les Halles is a classic French <i>Brasserie</i>, not a <i>Bistro</i>. This should be changed in the text.</p>
<p>"The term brasserie comes from brasseur, or brewer. Originally, these were France ’s answer to the British pub, serving up a similar fare of cheeses, stews, boiled items, cabbage, etc and specifically catering to the working man. Naturally, the rest of France loved the idea, but was appalled at the idea of quaffing a vintage Neuf-du-Pape with a side of sauerkraut, so the food became a little more chi-chi as a result.</p>
<p>The term bistro (according to urban myth) came about when the Russians swarmed Paris after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Smart (and hungry) Slavs that they were, they wisely decided to stay for a bite, and “bystro, bystro” (meaning quickly) was on everyone’s lips. The name came to mean that cheerful stop where gourmet fast food could be served and eaten, while still enjoying a bottle of the owner’s great-uncle’s special two-hundred-year-old Chablis."

<p>I don't know whether this is really relevant enough to add to the article or not but apparently Bourdain was filming a new episode of No Reservations in Beirut when the conflict over there started. As of today the crew is still there, but safe, and looking to evacuate. --<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.179.119.138.html" title="User:70.179.119.138">70.179.119.138</a> 04:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright I'll add a little something though I'm fairly new at this so I welcome anyone to fix it up or add links as deemed necessary. Also I am not sure how to add citations on here but if anyone feels a source is necessary it can be found on the No Reservations message board at the Travel Channel website. I can link directly on here if its needed. --<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.179.119.138.html" title="User:70.179.119.138">70.179.119.138</a> 01:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recommend sourcing this section of the article, particularly considering the bit about "expressing regret at the situation the Lebanese people were in ...".

<p>Again, hate to make any changes to non-vandalism unless others agree, but I'm not really sure if the part about him disliking Abba is worth putting in here, especially since it has its own little paragraph. Also not sure it really needs a complete run down of every drug hes used. --<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.179.119.138.html" title="User:70.179.119.138">70.179.119.138</a> 22:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I recall correctly, "Kitchen Confidential" was fairly in-depth about the prevalence of drug use and abouse in the culinary industry, and Bourdain's been pretty unflinching about his own experiences with hard drugs. However, you have a good point -- perhaps we can clean this up by referring to "hard and soft drugs" rather than the laundry-list.&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 13:19, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am trying to translate this article into French, but I don't know what to make of one little part.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of this article includes this sentence: "His work has appeared in the New York Times, The Times, the Observer, Scotland on Sunday, the Face, Limb by Limb, Black Book, and the Independent, and he is a contributing authority for Food Arts magazine."</p>
<p>1. What does his "work" mean? His columns? His novels? His workS?</p>
<p>2. Has anybody checked the pages to which some of the words (e.g. Face, Black Book) link to? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I don't think "the Face" actually refers to the front of the head, nor can I see why Bourdain would ever publish anything in a book documenting anti-Jewish crimes (the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Book_9a49.html" title="Black Book">Black Book</a>). I am planning to get rid of such links (there are no Wikipedia articles to journals/periodicals of those names). Does anyone object to this, and if so, why?</p>
<p>3. Is there any source for the above-mentioned information? (I haven't checked the external links yet.)</p>

<dl>
<dd>His "work" means his writing. This is a pretty standard usage in English and I don't think it needs to be changed. (I'm not sure if you were suggesting that or just asking for clarification.) You are clearly right about the Face and Black Book links, but these are also the names of real publications. Their websites are facemag.com (which appears to be down at the moment) and blackbookmag.com. The links definitely need to go since there are no wikipedia articles for these magazines. Christopher M 15:55, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I removed those links. Christopher M 20:03, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thank you so much, Christopher M! I wasn't sure whether "work" needed to be changed or not. Mainly, I was asking for clarification, because I wasn't sure how to translate "work" into French. (Somehow the words "Son travail a apparu..." seem like an odd translation of "His work has appeared..."!). I think I'll translate it as "ses oeuvres" (his workS), because it seems to convey the idea.</p>
<p>Now, if someone (maybe you?) could point me to the evidence supporting the previously mentioned quote, that would be really nice&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuaichik_94fe.html" title="User:Kuaichik">Kuaichik</a> 01:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, it's definitely "work" in the sense of "oeuvre" as opposed to "travail," but I guess it's just a usage difference between languages that requires it to be plural in this context in French. Anyway, as for the evidence, it's mentioned in what appears to be his standard blurb bio, which appears on a bunch of different (Googlable) sites, but for example <a href="http://www.canongate.net/AnthonyBourdain" class="external text" title="http://www.canongate.net/AnthonyBourdain" rel="nofollow">here</a>. More authoritatively, the copyright page of his book <i>The Nasty Bits</i> (a collection of essays, which I happen to own) says that "Most of these essays originally appeared...in" a list of publications that includes BlackBook and Face. (I'm too new to Wikipedia-editing to know what, if anything, should be changed in terms of citations, but there are the facts -- have at it!) Christopher M 21:20, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I see...thank you very much once again! I'm fairly new here myself, but I don't think anything should be changed in terms of citations. <i>The Nasty Bits</i> is already listed as further reading...Anyway, I'll look into adding a sentence into the French article (which I created and edited singlehandedly&#160;:-P). --<a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuaichik_94fe.html" title="User:Kuaichik">Kuaichik</a> 23:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, I've implemented your changes to the French article now! (Your French, as I noted on that page, is pretty good!). --<a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuaichik_94fe.html" title="User:Kuaichik">Kuaichik</a> 04:05, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's the deal with Tony's current status?</p>
<p>The intro lists him as 'former executive chef of Brasserie Les Halles' while the Background says 'He is currently the executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles'</p>

<p>His website (the link is on the bottom of the Wiki article) reads: "He is currently the executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles and lives in Manhattan." ~ AV</p>
<p><br />
Yeah, but he is not anymore the Ex. Chef. I ate there last year, he stops by now and again, they sell his books, but he doesn't spend time in the kitchen. BTW...Les Halles is a great place for breakfast...they make everything fresh, have wireless internet (really) and coffee from French style personal push-through coffee pots. He spends 10 months a year traveling doing his show, writing, etc.</p>
