<p>"Banderas' voice role as Puss in Boots in Shrek 2 made the character popular on the family film circuit," - i highly doubt that it was Banderas' voice that made Shrek 2 'popular on the family film circuit' - can someone provide a citation?He likes lemon.</p>
<p>It wasn´t Shrek 2 what was made popular by his voice but the character of Puss in Boots.</p>
<p><br />
<i>if Banderas wishes to expand on Spanish-speaking parts representing Central and South American character roles he will have to learn to lose the particular Castilian sound that differentiates Castilian from the spoken Spanish of the overwhelming majority of Spanish speakers worldwide.</i></p>

<dd>IMHO, this is a subjective analysis and inappropriate for an encyclopedia entry. Is this a wide-spread criticism that can be sourced? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 07:03, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is that sound?. I don´t think there is any sound that differentiates Castilian Spanish from the rest. Every country has a particular sound. Even Castilian Spanish differs if you hear Central or Northern Spanish and later you hear somebody from Seville or Malaga.</p>

<p>I have tried to insert info on Banderas' early career being tied to openly gay director Pedro Almodovar, but user JackO'Lantern consistently refuses to allow the word "gay" to appear. Is he homophobic?</p>
<dl>
<dd>What's the point of saying he is a "Gay director"? How is that detail relevant here? You can just as easily say he is a "gay Spanish 1960-born 6'3 <i>Italian-speaking director". His sexual orientation, much like those other details, is not relevant to Banderas' article, although it is relevant to Almedovar's article. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 22:14, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>I personally think it's a point of interest that Banderas was basically an in-house actor for a gay director for 8 years and played numerous roles, both gay &amp; straight. It shows his open-mindedness and flexibility, if nothing else. It doesn't imply that Banderas himself is gay. Americans who only know of Banderas from his Hollywood work would have no idea of this facet of his life, and you apparently want to keep it that way. As a gay man myself, I know that if I read that Banderas had played explicit gay roles, such as in "Law of Desire", I'd be more inclined to see the film. I think Wikipedia should provide as much information as possible, not just a sanitized, Hollywood press release version of reality.
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying Almedovar's entry shouldn't say that he's gay, it certainly should. But I can't see how it's relevant to Banderas' entry that Almedovar is gay. Banderas starring in these sex-filled films is relevant and is noted as far as I can tell, but Almedovar is "a lot of things" besides being gay, do you really want to start listing them all here? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 03:08, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The TYPES of roles an actor has played is certainly germane to an article about said actor. Your point is apparently that gay sex &amp; straight sex are both just sex, and therefore there doesn't need to be any differentiation between the two. That's a very "liberal" view, but unfortunately it doesn't correspond with reality. People still do care about a person's orientation. Would you say that an article about Jake Gyllenhaal, for example, should just say that he played a "cowboy" in "Brokeback Mountain", not a "gay cowboy", even though the gay aspect is what brought the film to everyone's notice and what was mentioned in every review? The fact that Gyllenhaal &amp; Ledger would take gay roles was heralded as "brave" and "risk-taking". Yet, you want to give Banderas no such credit, or even make it known. The fact that Banderas worked exclusively for a gay director for 8 years and was willing to take all kinds of roles (explicit gay roles included) certainly should be mentioned, because without mentioning it, the vast majority of readers who stumble upon this article and know him only from his work in Hollywood would have no idea about Banderas' early career. One thing I use Wikipedia for is to discover facts about people and things that might not be mentioned in a mainstream article. People who edit-out pertinent information lessen the usefulness of Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>There's no problem with saying that Banderas played gay characters early in his career. Go ahead. But there's no point in saying that Almedovar is gay in this article, because it's completely irrelevant to Banderas himself. It has no effect on either Banderas' life or career that the guy who directed a few of his movies is gay. You wouldn't say that Banderas starred in movies by "straight director Robert Rodriguez". <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack O'Lantern</a> 03:53, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Believe him. He is not a Catholic but still he lead processions. It is something that is absolutely normal in Andalusia and specially in cities like Seville, Granada or Malaga. Processions are not exclusively for religious people in Andalusia, it is a question of tradition and of feeelings towards your city and the brotherhood you have grown up with.</p>

<p>That sentence is inaccurate because there's no such person as a 'policeman in the civil guard' in Spain.</p>
<p>In Spain there are two kinds of state security: Police (formerly known as Policia nacional) and Civil Guard (Known as caribineros before Franco). Civil Guards are in charge of rural areas, coasts and ports and airports, roads and highways. You can't be both or 'one police in the civil guard'. That makes no sense. As far as I know, Bandera's father, now retired was a policeman and his mother a teacher.</p>
<p><br />
Another kind, the police in Catalonia (Mossos) and the Basque Country (Ertzaintza) depend on the autonomous governments.</p>

<p>Since he's married to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Griffith_b3b8.html" title="Melanie Griffith">Melanie Griffith</a>, doesn't that make him an American citizen?

<p>Simply being married to a U.S. citizen does not qualify a person for citizenship. It qualifies the person as a legal alien. In order to be a U.S., one must have a parent with citizenship, be born in the U.S., or become a citizen through the government (this is the option that requires taking a test about the U.S.).</p>

<p>I'm watching Evita right now. Came to Wikipedia for further info. I was shocked to find out his superb role is not even mentioned. I don't do filmographic studies or anything, so I'm not the person to add this element to this article, but surely it deserves mention?</p>
<p>Thanks. --JTallmon 22:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
