<dd>Well, the main page describing citations is <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>, but it's kind of geared towards experienced users. You certainly don't need to insert footnotes into <a href="../../../z/o/n/Zone_of_immunity.html" title="Zone of immunity">Zone of immunity</a>. In practice, you can just replace the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag at the bottom with a description of your source, and don't worry about getting the formatting right! I can always help with the cosmetics. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 18:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've replied on my own talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 00:39, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Dad, sorry to be dim. I thought this might be the only way to leave messages, but it seemed rather rude somehow! Have you seen the page on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Fisher_ea69.html" title="Jackie Fisher">Jackie Fisher</a>? looks rather sparse on the details of the great man. Perhaps you'd like to have a go? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidelit_5049.html" title="User:Davidelit">Davidelit</a> 16:05, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. I've replied on my talk page - I wasn't sure if this was the appropriate place. <a href="../../../s/c/y/User%7EScyrene_917a.html" title="User:Scyrene">Scyrene</a> 19:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, it looks like my response has been pre-empted, as most of those pages have been deleted. It's a shame nobody else was as thoughtful as you, since noone else asked why I created them. Such speed! <a href="../../../s/c/y/User%7EScyrene_917a.html" title="User:Scyrene">Scyrene</a> 19:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. Thanks very much for your messages. I was rather upset about the roads thing, so I decided to cool off and not log-in for a while. I don't know whether the articles were worthy or not, but appreciate the fresh perspective all the comments gave me. I was too close to the project to really be objective. Anyway, I will continue to contribute - but in slightly less controversial, and more complete ways! <a href="../../../s/c/y/User%7EScyrene_917a.html" title="User:Scyrene">Scyrene</a> 19:41, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for clearing up that rule of spelling variations for me. I was unaware that such a rule existed. However, I'm now curious as to why you changed "favor" to "favour" in the first place if, as you explained to me, such a change was unneeded. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamc714_32a4.html" title="User:Adamc714">Adamc714</a> 17:32, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't mean to give the impression that I wanted to fight over such a small and insignificant thing - I was merely curious. Sorry for the confusion.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamc714_32a4.html" title="User:Adamc714">Adamc714</a> 20:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course - feel free. Stub articles are only placeholders anyway, I feel; "here is a couple of lines summarising the article that will eventually replace it". Good luck! (Incidentally, I note you created <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_Class_f424.html" title="Defence Class">Defence Class</a>; the standard form for naming these is <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_class_battleship.html" title="Defence class battleship">Defence class battleship</a>, and I've moved the article.

<li>I've given it a copyedit; some explanations. You don't need to link to the article itself inside the article; this just gets confusing for editors. The introduction should be in a broadly standard form ("X" is/was a "Y" of "Z"), before moving onto the history. Ship names should be, if possible, italicised - you can do this with links like [[HMS Whatever|HMS ''Whatever'']].

<p>Hello, Tony!</p>
<p>Having chanced upon your recent post on <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohann_Wolfgang_5e38.html" title="User:Johann Wolfgang">Johann Wolfgang's</a> talk page, I thought you might appreciate being informed of the existence of the <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Swiftsure_%281870%29_956a.html" title="HMS Swiftsure (1870)">HMS Swiftsure (1870)</a> stub. This item has a curious history; when I came across it a few weeks ago, I discovered that the ship described in it was an entirely different vessel of the same name, lanched in 1903. I therefore created a new article and copied the existing text across. From what you told Johann Wolfgang, the 1870 ship should be right up your street.</p>
<p>Can I also take the opportunity to thank you for taking up the baton for ironclads and "pre-Dreadnoughts". Coverage of these fascinating ships is sparse in Wikipedia (I would like to work on them, but I don't have the expertise). I have added this page to my watchlist.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this is useful.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony! You commented on the link that I removed from the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici_309c.html" title="Lorenzo de' Medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</a> page. Yes, I still think it served no purpose. Even if the English translator decided to mention Lorenzo's name in the title of the book, of course the book is not really about him but the city. If Machiavelli's views on the Medici are important, one could instead expand the article itself and summarize them in a few words. In fact I could do this myself. But it should be noted that Machiavelli's views on Lorenzo may tell us more about Machiavelli than they tell us about Lorenzo.</p>
<p>However, if you think that the link ought to be restored, I think that at the very least it should be changed to point to the chapter of the book in which Machiavelli actually talks about Lorenzo. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimo_Laine_7278.html" title="User:Timo Laine">timo</a> 08:24, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For metric/imperial - <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Units_of_measurement" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Units of measurement</a> boils down to "using either is no big deal". Whilst the numbers were never used in the period, it is more useful to many readers (especially Europeans) to give a size in metres - it should be given as a converted figure, in brackets, since it's not the original source, but there's no harm in leaving it in if it's not excessive.</p>
<p>(This makes more sense when you consider, say, articles on classical antiquity - our articles would be very confusing for the reader if we avoided putting (X miles) after saying that something was however many stadia long.)</p>
<p>Unless the converted figures are wrong or just oddly misleading (like putting a kg weight after "24-lb gun"), it's probably considered rude to revert. Might be best to check they're not spuriously accurate, too (like giving a two-decimal-point conversion of a rounded figure). <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 20:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anthony, I've just been enjoying some of your recent articles. I see your are mostly working from the two standard sources, Conway’s and Parkes . Can I recommend a couple of other useful books to back them up?</p>
<ul>
<li>DK Brown “Warrior to Dreadnought: Warship Development 1860-1905”. Caxton Editions 2003. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-84067-5292</a>. An excellent study by the world’s expert, with a huge amount of previously unpublished information.</li>
<li>EHH Archibald <i>The Fighting Ship in the Royal Navy 1897-1984</i> (Blandford, 1984), <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-71371-3488</a>. Although not 100% reliable this remains a rich source of information and an excellent read. Its best feature are the hull profiles, which show the underwater hull; absurdly, the Conway’s drawings are cut off at the waterline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these books appear to be out of print, but you should be able to get them from Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713713488/qid=1149607668/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_1_6/203-8124749-5800753#product-details" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713713488/qid=1149607668/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_1_6/203-8124749-5800753#product-details" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1840675292/103-5776253-1079855?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1840675292/103-5776253-1079855?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">here</a> (if these links don’t work, a Google search should do the trick).</p>

<dd>John: thank you for your suggestion, which I shall follow through on. As I get to ships of a later period, I shall also start quoting Jane, but he does not quite go back far enough.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 22:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anthony: You may already be aware of this, but Jane's should be used with caution. The editors were largely dependent on information released at the time by the navies which owned the ships, and this was sometimes misleading (often deliberately). For example, no navy would willingly advertise the fact that its ships were breaking treaty limits! In addition, some navies (especially Japan and the USSR) were secretive as a matter of course. Figures for speeds are particularly suspect; in many navies (notably Italy), prodigious speeds were obtained on trials by such expedients as pre-cleaning the coal, embarking only enough fuel to complete the trial and disembarking the ammunition! For factual accuracy, Conway's will be more reliable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, the very fact that Jane's presents a contemporary view, without hindsight, gives it a value of its own (editions prior to 1941 famously say of <i>Hood</i> that "her protection is extremely comprehensive").</dd>

<p>John: I did, of course know that Jane was dependent on data provided by the naval services of the period; as witness <i>Bismark</i> at 35,000 tons, <i>Graf Spee</i> at 10,000 tons, etc. Possibly there was more honesty in the 19th century; in any case, one tries to use as many sources as possible and separate fact fron fiction.</p>

I've got some books at home, and when I get there, I'll be sure to add some on ships. My question about the Cerebus class and the Monitor is the story of how the RN managed to get these secrets from the USN. Given the lukewarm support that the UK had given towards the Confederacy and the Fenian Uprising in Canada, I doubt the US govt. and HM Government were on speaking terms.

<p>Yes, the articles are indeed simmilar, since all the proteins are in the same family. There are eight such proteins. One of the goals of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_47d3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology">Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology</a> is to classify all proteins and serve as a portal to the wealth of information the web. The articles that I'm creating are just stubs. With the hope for future expansion. I will create a single article describing the family of proteins and their general functions. However, the individual protein pages are necessary since they all have different functions and (though some of them simmilar) all have different sets of links. When the articles are completed hopefully that will be expanded on. A single article, including all the proteins would probably be too big (larger than the recommended size for wikipedia article) and would not be consistent with the goals of the project. Much of the varying information can be found in the protein boxes. The general text of the article is just an introduction (as is required to make a stub) and that explains the similarity. In addition, wikipedia, does not allow redirects to specific sections in an article. A person looking up information on a particle SMAD would most like likely search for <a href="../../../s/m/a/SMAD5_5f2d.html" title="SMAD5">SMAD5</a> for example (rather than "<a href="../../../m/o/t/Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_5.html" title="Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 5">Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 5</a>"). The person would have to sift through a large article just to find the information they are looking for.</p>
<p>My particular interest is in developmentally important molecules and I do believe that there is a wealth of information about many of these proteins that will eventually show up with user contributions.</p>
<p>I have just created a new page, but I did not notice that I had incorrect capitalization on the surname. How might I change that? <a href="../../../h/m/i/User%7EHmiimd_cf62.html" title="User:Hmiimd">hmiimd</a> 12:43, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Decapentaplegic</i>, is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transforming_growth_factor_beta.html" title="Transforming growth factor beta">transforming growth factor beta</a> protein involved in dorsal ventral polarity specification (determination of front and back) in the <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit_fly.html" title="Fruit fly">fruit fly</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drosophila.html" title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>. Mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD) another protein in drosophilla was discovered, that when mutated, opposes decapentaplegic in the embryo. During that time period, there was no systematic method for naming proteins, consequently, researchers named proteins in clever, or silly or cute ways. They name <i>MAD</i> "Mothers against decapentaplegic" to describe its action - (oppose decapentaplegic by the mother) and to play on the commonly known <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mothers_Against_Drunk_Driving_bdf6.html" title="Mothers Against Drunk Driving">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</a>. The <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homolog.html" title="Homolog">homolog</a> of the drosophila protein was later discovered in humans and was named systematically as "Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog X". There are 8 such homologs in humans so X represents the number of the homolog. I hope that sheds some light on the origin of the name. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask. --<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGAThrawn22_073d.html" title="User:GAThrawn22">GAThrawn22</a> 23:10, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I didn't create the article - I was the admin who deleted it! And unregistered people can't create new articles any more... I think it changed about 3 months ago. It's not a policy to inform people, and don't bother if it's obviously vandalism, but it's good form if they honestly intended to create a real article, and didn't understand what is and isn't suitable.

<p>Hi, I stubbed the article because it only had two words. Even though it may be under construction it can still be classed as a stub until any content is added. If you want to create new articles before actually adding them to the encylopedia as nearly empty pages you can create new pages under your user page, e.g. User:Anthony.bradbury/Ajax_class_battleship then create the article and copy and paste the content when your done.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypandy.UK_6e9d.html" title="User:Andypandy.UK"><font style="background:white">Andeh</font></a> 19:49, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On my talk page you mentioned not being sure of how to use images on wikipedia. I suggest you review <a href="../../../u/p/l/Wikipedia%7EUploading_images_aa69.html" title="Wikipedia:Uploading images">Wikipedia:Uploading images</a> as well as <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_tutorial_cbf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture tutorial">Wikipedia:Picture tutorial</a>. Basically you just have to upload the images first to the wikipedia server before they can be displayed on the site, hence you cannot display an image that is hosted off the wikimedia servers on wikipedia. Now the two major things to remember when uploading: 1) always give the source of your material and 2) be sure that you use the correct license for the image, most of which can be found at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. Failure to cite a source, or use the correct tag, might result in that image being deleted. Please let me know if I can answer any specific questions that you might have. Oh and don't worry about my userboxes, they seem fine now, it might just be a server issue. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(tlk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malo_4444.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malo">(cntrbtns)</a></small> 15:46, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking back at the article, I cannot imagine why you feel that {{<a href="../../../b/a/n/Template%7EBand_a4e9.html" title="Template:Band">band</a>}} is not appropriate. It still seems so to me.

<dd>I'm not an admin, but just b/c someone is an admin (or even a bureaucrat) doesn't mean their interpretations of policy are necessarily authoritative. In any case, CSD A7 (which db-band seems to stem from) is for things with no <i>assertion</i> to notability. GSW has two albums by Mercury and other indendent albums and has been on nation-wide tours. And so it seems to meet WP:MUSIC, the relevant notability guideline. If you still want to take it to AfD or slap a notability tag on the page, feel free.

<p>The most common reason to know the name of an image is because you <a href="../../../u/p/l/Wikipedia%7EUploading_images_aa69.html" title="Wikipedia:Uploading images">uploaded it yourself</a> under that name, or because you've found it in another page and checked the title.

<p>Images on Commons can be used normally, in the same way as Wikipedia images - ie, [[Image:Name.jpg|thumb|right|Description]] - so you can make full use of them. Images on there also tend to be sorted by topic, if a bit patchily; try having a look through <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Royal_Navy_ships" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Royal_Navy_ships">commons:Category:Royal Navy ships</a> and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Naval_ships_of_the_United_Kingdom" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Naval_ships_of_the_United_Kingdom">commons:Category:Naval ships of the United Kingdom</a> to see if you can use anything there.</p>

<p>Thanks for the note, by the way, but I gotta mention a couple of problems with the Prodding of the above article:</p>
<p>1) Answers.com is a Wikipedia mirror, meaning that its content comes from Wikipedia (legally), so it's not a copyvio.</p>
<p>2) Copyvios are dealt with using two different processes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>a) If the violation occurs within 48 hours and comes from a "commercial content provider" (a definition I notice that some admins stretch a bit), then it's a speedy deletion -- {{db-copyvio|URL}} is the tag.</dd>
<dd>b) If the violation is older than that, you're supposed to go through <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> and follow its steps.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So I'm afraid I'm going to modify the tag and change its reason. I'd remove it and save the option of tagging it as such later (depending on whether the article creator actually coughs up some reliable sources, which I highly doubt), but some editors are a sticklers for process and would likely remove a second applicatopon of the tag. Just so you know what I'm doing. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 13:14, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I randomly copied about ten words from the article and entered it into Google, resulting in the link that I placed on the page (that didn't show up, arg). It's not so much that it's a copyright violation - I think the page could stand to be deleted on various accounts - nonsense being one of them, or if speedy fails, prod or afd for "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball/how-to manual" reason. I'll go edit the tag to a more suitable one.

<p>Hi Tony, It's only worth linking date like entities in a very few contexts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the date is itself important - so that there is value in following the link - decreasingly often as WP grows.</li>
<li>When the text is about the entity e.g. a link to 2000 or 2001 in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Millennium_6ffc.html" title="The Millennium">The Millennium</a>.</li>
<li>When a date <b>includes a day and month</b>, which means formatting preferences will be invoked by linking it, e.g. <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">10 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>.</li>
<li>There is also the process of linking to "[Year] [month] in &lt;subject&gt;" via a piped link, e.g. 1999 in television as <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_television.html" title="1999 in television">1999</a> - this eventually can suffer the same problem as the first point, and is seen by some as an undesireable <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_egg.html" title="Easter egg">Easter egg</a> - i.e. taking the user to a difernt place than expected.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>See <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> for details, and the talk page for 48 archived pages of wrangling over the exact meaning of "links valuable in context" and "the correct use of the non-breaking space" or "the endash".</i></p>

<p>in response to your comment An article containing simply the single word "hello" may be regarded as vandalism. Please write sensible articles or write nothing.--Anthony.bradbury 14:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was demonstrating the process of entering an article to our PR staff. I was explaining how wikipedia works. Was rapidly re-edited</p>
<p>History- of the edits on this page. I used our organizations boilerplate description of the Library. But wikipedia uses some automated process to verify the content versus the web. Since the library and university use the same boiler plate text on their web site.</p>
<p>The site was marked for rapid deletion for copyright problems. I commented that I essentially owned the copy right. Still pulled down article.</p>
<p>The word "hello" appeared for only enough time to indicate that the article could be edited. Since the PR staff has the same boilerplate text, they wrote it. We could not use their text as it would be deleted again. So I simply added a link to the library home page.</p>
<p>My co-worker stated you should get a job. If you have the time to sit and monitor wikipedia articles and post a comment instantly you must not have anything more important.</p>
<p>I however realize there must be some automated process to capture this type of event. You simply responded to prompt.</p>
<p>The article is being rewritten now. Your comment arrived after the edit(removing 'hello') was already done. rdegler</p>

<p>Hello, your tag for <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">WP:SPEEDY</a> on this article gave the reason as a lack of importance. This was clearly not the case. The author asserted in the first sentence and in the edit summary reasons for significance. So the page obviously does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion under the reasons you specified, and thus the tag needed to be removed. I didn't have to wait for an admin to do so because I did not create the page. The page does require sources, and I added a tag requesting them, and a cleanup. I also agree edit wars are silly. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 00:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You also make a fair point. I have not removed your proposal for deletion for lack of sourcing because I think you are correct. I also agree that just becasue importance is claimed does not make it important. But I doubt very much that either one of us knows anything about the history of igloos. The author deserves the chance to prove their claims, hopefully they can provide sources they did not create.

The reqimage template has been deprecated and replace with the reqphoto template.

Also remember that the argument used in the dispute SGGM - If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it and Only public domain resources can be copied without permission—this does not include the vast majority of web pages or images - pertains to all articles. Take a look at this article <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. The wiki community has moved to a lot of inline citations and referencing to get an article to feature article status. Most of the articles you have contributed on are good articles. I can not nominate it for a good article review until it has images and citations. Length of article does not matter but it is one step at a time. Thats why I put tags on articles that I think are worthy so that other editors, along with the orginal editors, work to improve the article - if I work the article I can not give an assessment due to the appearance of impartiality.

<p>I am surprised that you have put the message that this article SGGS on Meat is "Evangelical text; not encyclopedic" Any encyclopaedia is a reference database and the text put on this page is in support of a very important subject for many millions of <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikhs</a> and forms the reference material for the various other pages which are being created to refer to this page.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> is the holy script of the <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikhs</a> and reference to this text from this script is very important. A true copy of the text has to be produced for any meaningful value and reference</p>
<p>This page has been linked to another page where the different points of views (POVs) are stated. So this page forms part of a group of articles which form the material that is important to users and students in this field. I believe that you have only looked at this page in isolation while in reality, this page is going to be a hub for many other articles.</p>
<p>I hope you will agree with me when you look at this page with all the links installed in the next few days, and I hope you will appreciate the importance of this very valuable reference material. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 15:16, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am afraid that I do not agree with you. Any article promoting any specific religious faith or doctrine must, by definition, be POV and hence non-encyclopedic. I would take the same line with a tract putting forward the tenets of any other faith, including my own. But I am not an admin, and I will abide by the decision ultimately arrived at by the powers that be. Pleasae note that I did not mark it with a speedy tag, although as a POV article it would have qualified for one, to allow time and space for debate.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 20:13, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well as suggested by you, I have listed below articles on Christianity which refer to original text from the holy Bible – I would like you to look at these article and do the same as you did to the article on <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>. Please have these texts removed as well as they support a POV and hence are "non-encyclopedic" as you say. I would like you to do the same with these articles as they are creating the same violation? Do you agree or not? Or do you have a different excuse here?</p>
