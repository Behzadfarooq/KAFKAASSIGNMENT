<p>Ok, thanks for the heads-up on that; there was actually a bit of debate a few weeks ago on the scifi/speculative fiction difference (actually it was whether or not speculative ficiton deserved its own stub category), and they seemed to come to the same thing you did, and apparently what most wikipedians do; that speculative fiction IS science fiction; even though technically, speculative fiction encompasses a much wider subset, including science fiction, most horror, and alternative history novels. Seeing as how I seem to be in the minority in this view, I guess I will concede it; but I still thank you for the info on the policy, I was not aware that they actually had any pertaining to this specific topic, but I guess I shouldnt be all that surprised. -- <a href="../../../g/i/z/User%7EGizzakk_8751.html" title="User:Gizzakk">Gizzakk</a> 20:50, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I think there may be a misunderstanding here: I'm <i>not</i> saying that "speculative fiction IS science fiction", I'm saying that <i>because</i> "science fiction" is a subset of "speculative fiction", and thus "science fiction novels" is a subset of "speculative fiction novels", that it isn't <i>necessary</i> to say "this article falls into the category of "<a href="../../../s/p/e/Category%7ESpeculative_fiction_novels_e148.html" title="Category:Speculative fiction novels">speculative fiction novels</a>" -- because if you've already said "it falls into the category of "<a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_fiction_novels_3772.html" title="Category:Science fiction novels">science fiction novels</a>", it goes without saying. To give another example: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> is in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELandmarks_in_New_York_City_0b7e.html" title="Category:Landmarks in New York City">Category:Landmarks in New York City</a>; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELandmarks_in_New_York_City_0b7e.html" title="Category:Landmarks in New York City">Category:Landmarks in New York City</a> is a sub-category of Category:New York landmarks&#160;; therefore <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> doesn't need to be in Category:New York landmarks as well. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:22, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I do think you're wrong, on two counts: you're wrong to think that it's acceptable to call other Wikipedia editors "deeply retarded" or "a pervert of some kind" based on the phrasing of a single sentence; even calling it "bullshit wording" is a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Secondly, it is particularly bizarre to think such a strong reaction is somehow justified by the difference between "She began to suffer from what we now know as <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_nervosa.html" title="Anorexia nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>." and "She began to suffer from <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_nervosa.html" title="Anorexia nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>." Both are perfectly acceptable wordings and neither justifies the attacks on the wording, much less the attacks on the editor. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:08, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversions without discussion</span></h2>
<p>Hi Feldspar. Up to your old "reversions without discussion" again I see at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thetan.html" title="Thetan">Thetan</a> where you have ignored a great deal of talk page discussion. My efforts have been to leave the paragraph in the article for about a week. BTW, it is ChrisO's offensively cited paragraph, written in a narrative style which beguiles the reader into thinking that Hubbard actually stated what Atack says he stated, i.e. "Hubbard said ....". That is just a very poor citation. It seems to quote Hubbard whom, I beleive, never said what Atack says he said <b>BUT</b> it is perfectly okay with me if Atack's book says that Hubbard said that as long as the attribution is appropriately made so a reader can know that it is Jon Atack who is saying that Hubbard said .... So. After a week's of discussion you revert with no discussion. Typical. I have clearly laid out the problem, I have clearly attempted to get that paragraph appropriately cited. I have even helped to cite the previous paragraph. This is another one of ChrisO's very very poor citations. I plan to revert that paragraph once a day until it either has a good citation or is gone forever from the article. It is directly contrary to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and in particular it is contrary to "burden on the person making the citation".

<dd>Terryeo, someone who didn't know you might think you actually meant what you said about wanting things to be "appropriately cited". But the fact is that you have been known to request citations and then, once you receive them, <i>remove</i> them -- on more than one occasion. That is, in fact, just a small sample of the kind of behavior that has led to the current RfC on you. Please don't insult us both by pretending that you actually just want the paragraph "appropriately cited". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:07, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Terryeo, among the material you dishonestly removed citations to the 1957 Martin Gardner book <i>Fads and Fallacies In the Name of Science</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dianetics&amp;diff=49378861&amp;oldid=49378030" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dianetics&amp;diff=49378861&amp;oldid=49378030" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I have a hard copy of that book resting on my right thigh right now as I type these words. Your presumption that <i>any citation to the book</i> can be removed because the chapter on Dianetics happens to be available online, and I <i>might</i> have been working from that copy of the text, and that copy of the text <i>might</i> contain a transcription error, and that transcription error <i>might</i> potentially alter the meaning of what's cited, is quite frankly <b>idiotic</b>.</dd>
<dd>If you actually read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> instead of cherry-picking out little bits and pieces you can misapply to waste people's time with, you'd realize that WP:RS allows editors to do <i>their own</i> transcriptions when the original is available for the transcription to be checked. If Andreas Heldal-Lund were to come to Wikipedia himself, he could transcribe relevant material from a copy of <i>Fads and Fallacies</i> into an article, and that would in no way contravene <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Are you <i>still</i> going to nonsensically assert that because Heldal-Lund did his transcription onto his own website instead of directly onto Wikipedia, that any citation which comes from that book must be removed because <i>one</i> of the sources from which the person inserting the citation could have gotten the text <i>might have been</i> Heldal-Lund's transcription stored on a "personal website"?

<dd>You raise a valid issue when it comes to citing sources for published works. The only lasting good I've done on here is to get "personal websites" and particularly Xenu before the arbitrators whom are voting on its use in Wikipedia articles. The rule is, as you know, <b>no personal websites may be used as secondary sources</b>. You raise a valid issue because your original research which rested on your thigh when you posted, tells you how accurate that particular article is. But I'm not longer a person of consequence in your arguement that Xenu.net may be used as a source of any information within any article.

<dd>"your original research which rested on your thigh" -- you know, at this point, I really can't blame you if you're trying to create the impression that you're a complete incompetent who has <i>no idea in hell</i> what he's doing. That is, after all, the only other possible explanation for your behavior besides "a completely untrustworthy liar." However, at this point, you <i>really</i> should comprehend what "original research" actually is and why <i>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science</i> really pretty utterly fails to meet that description. If you actually <i>don't</i> comprehend it by now, it should give pause to anyone who thinks Dianetics does <i>good</i> things for your IQ. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, that's the situation. I'm banned from editing in the articles for a while. However, the issue which has long driven the difficulties in the articles is also being confronted and will be voted on by the administrators. Fahrenheit451 attempted to modify <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> to suit his fancy, placed a racial slur on an experienced editor's page whom was communicating with him on that talk page and Vivaldi has engaged to modify <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as well. The issue, "are personal pages allowed as secondary sources in Scientology articles" is at last being confronted. The administrators can argue it out, we've spent months with it. By the Way, Feldspar, I deleted your post form my page because you used invective language. And let stand what was real communication. This isn't an uncommon practice on here and I'm not the only one who does it. One more point, BRfromLA's idea of simply ignoring what isn't liked, so that 2 sides become more and more enbrittled isn't going to be a fruitful idea. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 19:23, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The correct information about Dianetics</span></h2>
<p>Your edit summary states: "Antaeus Feldspar (Talk | contribs) (no, auditing is purported to treat the actual conditions -- the fact that Dianetics considers colds, arthritis, radiation sickness etc. to be nothing more than "mental stress" does not make it so)" in the Dianetics article and that has been a very very big point of contention with the medical community and Dianetics since 1950. The Church of Scientology gave it up, they found it to be an impossible arguement to state that Dianetics treats the human body's conditions. It might or might not happen, but Dianetics and the Church aren't going to argue whether it does or not. If placed as a historical presentation of Dianetics to the public, then that might be accurate. But not for a long time, maybe it was 1955 or something when they gave up stating that they treat medical conditions, or implying they treat medical conditions.

<dd>Sorry, but you're incorrect. The Church of Scientology still publishes Hubbard's claims that auditing will cure physical conditions, and <i>not</i> as a historical curiosity, but as a current claim of "this is what Dianetics can do for you". If you want to verify it, you can find it the same way I did, on the first page of Google results for "Dianetics" and "arthritis". You can even find video of Scientologists making the claim if you like: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5192158350575456637&amp;pl=true" class="external autonumber" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5192158350575456637&amp;pl=true" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:43, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

Miscaviage stated his allergies were treated, there have been many personal attestations. But Dianetics doesn't treat medical conditions.

<dd>My intention is to "maximize disruption?" That verges on a personal attack, Feldspar. Apparently you still consider that it is perfectly okay to go to a personal website and quote a book, document or paper, insert it into an article and provide the link to the personal website it is on. That procedure puts Wikipedia into a less reputable situation than to quote and cite the same information from a website which is not either a personal website, nor a blog, nor a newsgroup. You notice, the procedure which I mentions would cause Wikipedia to be more stable, secure, its links more well established, the articles on such sites more dependable, etc. etc. rather than the "disruption" which you state is my intent and which sounds very much like a personal attack, it assuming bad faith. But, that one, for now, I'll let it go without initiating a personal attack procedure.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 02:13, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">your last edit of Scientology medical claims</span></h2>
<p>That was a pretty good edit. I do suggest you change the line 1 to omit the statement that the e-meter "treats" the reactive mind. Each e-meter bears a legend that "By itself, this meter does nothing. It is solely for the guide of Ministers of the Church in Confessionals and pastoral counseling." So the article needs to refer to the auditor's <i>use</i> of the e-meter. I don't agree with your use of the term "body thetan" since it is used nowhere in the Church's websites or literature, but I understand that the "Xenu fans" insist on including that reference, no matter how inaccurate.</p>
<p>But, would you agree that the e-meter is to <i>assist</i> the auditor? dcottle561</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I thank you for your compliment and your polite approach. I looked at the introduction and didn't see a need for the E-meter to be mentioned in the summary, so I removed it. I agree that it is <i>technically</i> correct to say that Scientologists don't claim the E-meter <i>itself</i> can diagnose any medical condition or apply any treatment. I also think that it is highly misleading to stress that particular point. The Church of Scientology is still publishing Hubbard's claims that coronary disease, arthritis, high blood pressure, the common cold and other ailments are really just problems created by the reactive mind. The Church is still claiming that problems caused by the reactive mind can be cured by auditing. The Church freely admits that the E-meter is an assist to the process of auditing. The Church insisting that the E-meter 'doesn't treat anything' is like a builder insisting that his carpenter's level doesn't build any buildings. Stating that the level itself doesn't build anything is accurate. Implying that it isn't used in the process is not.</dd>

<dd>As for the issue of body thetans, why are you so sure that <i>you</i> have the accurate information on them? That's an honest question: unless you are on the other side of the Bridge already, you <i>know</i> that your religion still has secrets that you won't be allowed to learn until you've done more auditing and are ready. Why are you so sure that this isn't among them? Even if you decide that you don't believe all the former Scientologists who have said "Yes, I went through the OT III levels, and yes, they do talk about X--- and Teegeeack and body thetans", then why don't you believe the testimony that Warren McShane provided in court <i>as Scientology's witness</i>, not only confirming the story of X--- and the volcanoes and the body thetans but claiming that it had <i>never</i> been secret? Please, if you can explain to me, I'd love to know: why are you <i>so sure</i> that references to body thetans are "inaccurate" when you <i>don't know</i> whether they're accurate or not? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:00, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I did not intend to imply that your insertion of "body thetans" was inaccurate. Whether that is, or is not, a part of any Scientology secrets was not my issue. I merely noted that none of the Church of Scientology's websites or publications that I am aware of mention them. By the way, who is Warren McShane? Do you have a reference for his testimony? I'd love to read it.<a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcottle561_aa8b.html" title="User:Dcottle561">dcottle561</a> 19 May 2006</p>

<dd>Oh, I'm sorry. That's what I thought you were trying to imply when you added "no matter how inaccurate" to the end of your sentence. As for the question "who is Warren McShane?" -- well, at the time he testified in Civil Action No. 95B2143 [Sep 1995], Religious Technology Center, Plaintiff, vs. F.A.C.T.NET, INC., et al., Defendants, he was Deputy Inspector General of Legal Affairs for the Religious Technology Center. Up to about September 2005, he was Deputy Inspector General of External Affairs. After about September 2005, however, his name, along with that of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Rathbun_8c5c.html" title="Marty Rathbun">Marty Rathbun</a>, started being removed from official Scientology sites as if the two had never held such high-ranking positions. If you go to <a href="http://faq.scientology.org/page18a.htm" class="external free" title="http://faq.scientology.org/page18a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://faq.scientology.org/page18a.htm</a> you'll see Miscavige and Rathbun and McShane, listed as the RTC Board of Directors. Then try to find any mention of McShane on the RTC website or any acknowledgement he was ever there. Then try this search on Google: 'site:rtc.org "Deputy Inspector General"' It looks like not only McShane but even the position he held have just ... disappeared.</dd>

<dd>McShane was with the Church since 1973 -- more than three decades. He's been a <i>major executive</i> of the Church since 1983 -- more than two decades. Now he's been written out of the Church's version of history. After over twenty years of service, he's been disappeared with barely a trace left here and there. Maybe you can explain for me, because I honestly am curious: how do you deal with knowing your Church will do things like that? Do you just say, "Well, they must have done it to him because he was secretly an SP all those decades, and they'd never do anything like that to <i>me</i> because I'm not Suppressive"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:14, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
