	    <p><b>Anthony Brady</b> is a fictional character on the soap opera <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_City_3aed.html" title="Fair City">Fair City</a>.</p>
<p>Anthony is TJ's biologinal father. When Mags Kelly first met him on the streets of Carrigstown, he was a homeless man and an alcoholic. Mags felt sorry for Anthony and gave him money to use for accommodation. At first, he wasted the money in McCoys, but he eventually decided to give up the booze and begin a new chapter in his life. Although Mags' husband, Charlie, didn't tolerate Anthony, he helped get a flat. When Terry and TJ returned to Carrigstown, it soon became apparent that Terry didn't want Anthony hanging around the house. She revealed that he was an old friend of hers, but she was reluctant to say any more details.</p>
<p>It transpired that Terry had an affair with Anthony 10 years ago just before TJ was born, so there was a chance that TJ could be his son. Anthony soon discovered Terry's secret and was immediately overcome by happiness. Vowing to never drink alcohol again, Anthony began presenting himself as the perfect partner for Terry. His wish to have a family of his own had apparently come true, but Terry had other ideas. Terry told Charlie about the affair and convinced him that TJ is his grandson. Charlie warned Anthony to stay away from Terry and TJ, but Anthony shrugged the warning off. Terry demanded that Anthony leave Carrigstown, but Anthony refused to listen, maintaining that she and TJ will soon be his family.</p>
<p>When Mags returned from her holiday in Canada, Charlie decided not to mention Terry's secret to her. This proved to be his undoing, as Mags invited Anthony to Christmas dinner. A frustrated Terry told Anthony to leave her and TJ alone, as he was now following them everywhere. Terry eventually told Mags about her secret and tried to convince her that TJ is her grandson, but Mags refused to be manipulated and suggested that a paternity test be done to determine who is TJ's bologincal father.</p>
<p>Dr. Brendan arrived in the Kelly household and took DNA samples. The results of the paternity test proved that Anthony is TJ's father. Mags and Charlie were devastated by this, but to hear this information from Anthony made them feel even worse. On Christmas Day, Anthony thanked Mags and Charlie for their kindness towards him, but the couple accused him of being a hyprocite. Anthony's only concern was about living with his new family, but Terry had no intention of letting this happen. She and TJ subsequently left Carrigstown to escape from Anthony. Anthony, convinced that Charlie and Mags helped them escape, demanded to given information on their whereabouts, but the couple knew nothing.</p>
<p>A few days later, Terry and TJ returned to Carrigstown. TJ learned that Anthony was his biologonical father. Anthony tried to develop a friendship with his son, but TJ is disgusted that he had an affair with his mother. Whether Anthony succeeds in having a strong bond with TJ remains to be seen, but Terry has sworn that such a bond will never happen.</p>
