<p>Hora is a traditional Romanian dance and is not a gypsy one!!! --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacodava_0e5c.html" title="User:Dacodava">Dacodava</a></p>
<p><br />
Hora is the name for the large circle dance and is the most widespread dance in Romania, partly because any number of participants of both men and women, of any ability or age, can join in. The term Hora is also used for the Sunday village dance, even where the Hora dance does not form part of the dance cycle. In southern Romania and Moldavia Hora is the introductory dance to the dance cycle.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacodava_0e5c.html" title="User:Dacodava">Dacodava</a></p>
<p>Yes, for once Dacodava and I agree. Nothing particularly Gypsy about the hora. It's pretty much the Romanian national dance, at least outside of Transylvania. Pretty much the same thing as the Ashkenazi Jewish dance of the same name that a lot of people think of a folkloric Israeli dance. Your basic big circle dance, with relatively simple steps (certainly simpler than, for example, a Catalan sardana). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:55, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
Antandrus:</p>
<p>My name is Gary Matsumoto. I am the author of the Science article to which Wikipedia refers in its erroneuous entry on the 2001 anthrax letter attacks. I have been trying without success to delete my entry for several reasons. First, because it is incorrect. The Science article I wrote did not suggest that the source of the Senate attack material was a "hidden U.S. government anthrax program." I did not write that in the Science article or in any other report that I have written or broadcast. Second, I wish to be deleted because I object to being the only journalist on a list of Internet conspiracy theorists who have advanced their theories on unregulated, unedited websites. I am a staff reporter and producer for a major U.S. news organization. I do not have a website. Everything I have written on the subject has been for the so-called MSM (ABC News, Washington Post, Science). I gathered most of my information this subject while working on staff at ABC News, specifically with the ABC News Investigative Unit. Yet, there are no other MSM journalists on this list. Judith Miller, Bill Broad of the New York Times have written far more about the attacks, but they are not listed. Joby Warrick and Marilyn Thompson of the Washington Post have written extensively about them (Thompson even wrote a book about it); yet they're not on it; neither is Guy Gugliotta, my co-author of the Washington Post article that ran on the front page, above-the-fold in October 2002. Mark Hosenball of Newsweek is not on this list; Brian Ross of ABC News isn't either. So what gives? I do not wish to be listed in this Wikipedia rogues gallery of anthrax Internet theorists, especially not with patently incorrect information attributed to me, about my work. Please get me off this list; and try to get your facts straight. Providing information is a public service; disseminating false information is a disservice, not just to me, but to everyone. If you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to contact me at witzend@nyct.net. Sincerely, Gary Matsumoto</p>

<dd>Reviewing the case--i.e. looking at the article you mention--I reverted an edit from you because it looked like vandalism (we get a LOT of vandals who just drop by an article and delete a random section). As the article currently stands, you are the last editor, and the section remains deleted, so I'll leave it that way. All the best, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:53, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I incorporated Gary's changes (minus the inappropriate boosterism), which should satisfy his factual accuracy objection. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 16:54, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>MIRROR VAX:</b> I have deleted my revised entry, again. In all fairness, I am, as far as I can tell, the only journalist on this list. I object to you making me an exception. I did <i>not</i> propogate a theory, as did everyone else on your list. I reported facts that had been, my <i>Science</i> magazine article, reviewed by scientists as well as editors. This specific article was also supported by footnotes and a bioliography. That is lot more than I can say for all the journalists who <i>did</i> propagate theories, but have been spared the ignominy of being on your list. For example, Nicholas Kristof of the New York <i>Times</i> wrote several high profile columns in America's newspaper of record, accusing "Dr. Z"/Dr. Steven Hatfill of being the most likely anthrax mailer. Marilyn Thompson did the same in the Washington <i>Post</i> Magazine; NYT's Judith Miller implied as much in a front page piece she wrote on Hatfill's work in constructing mock BW labs on wheels. Brian Ross of ABC News said Hatfill's arrest as the anthrax mailer "was imminent." These are bona fide journalists who not only advanced theories on how the anthrax was made, they advanced theories on who mailed it ... all without providing verifiable physical evidence or testimony to link Hatfill to the crime. All the individuals that I listed above have more in common (Hatfill) with Don Foster and Barbara Hatch Rosenberg than I do. Yet I am on your list. Scott Shane of the Baltimore Sun broke the story that a U.S. Army lab was actually making weaponized anthrax, but he is not on the list.</p>
<p>So I object to Wikipedia's inaccuracy; its inconsistency and the arbitrariness in its choices. Putting me on this list equates my work with anti-Semites, with Internet conspiracy-mongers and with people whose work is now the subject of litigation. As I pointed out in my previous message, I have no website advancing a theory behind this crime. My <i>Science</i> article was reviewed by a half dozen Ph.D.s and vetted by nearly as many senior editors at one the most highly regarded science journals in the world. My <i>Science</i> article is cited in formal papers published in peer-reviewed science journals and is also cited in Ph.D. dissertations written by scientists working for U.S. government laboratories doing biodefense research.</p>
<p>Your entry for Gary Matsumoto was, for many months, grosssly inaccurate. Now, the revised copy - an alleged sop to a disgruntled subject - fails to provide context that would enable a reader to distinguish me from individuals whose work has been discredited as inaccurate and defamatory (and is the subject of litigation), or from individuals whose work <i>should</i> be discredited for its substandard quality. Inclusion on your list is a dishonor. Kindly leave me off it, or in fairness, add to it every journalist who has written or broadcast about the 2001 anthrax attacks. <b>Sincerely, Gary Matsumoto</b></p>

I would like to express my thanks to all the people who took part in my (failed) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Halibutt_3f65.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Halibutt">RfA voting</a>.

That's what Wiki community is about and I'm really pleased to see that it works.<br />
As my RfA voting failed with 71% support, I don't plan to reapply for adminship any more. However, I hope I might still be of some help to the community.

<p>Hello again! I have a few more music history questions. Since the Baroque period is said to have begun in 1600, were there musicians composing in the Baroque style before Monteverdi? And can <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach_36ba.html" title="Wilhelm Friedemann Bach">Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</a>, son of Johann Sebastian Bach, be considered a composer of the Classical style and period as well as the Baroque? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a> 23:46, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, you remember me? You blocked my account because someone from my IP adress was vandalizing articles? Well, I found out who it is that's doing it. It's my little twerp of a brother. I guess he was snooping around and found a copy of my book and thought it would be incredibly witty to wreak havoc under a false identity. I'm sorry for the trouble he caused.

<p>Hi. Our paths haven't crossed much, though I see you've been here a couple of years. It seems like a lot of people go off to do more admin-style jobs when they get fed up with the actual editing.

<p>I've been searching for a Gita edition myself, but can't seem to find a good one. I rely upon the Mahabharata book written by a British Hindu, Krishna Dharma for the Gita Updesh.</p>
<p>An English-Sanskrit text back-to-back is ideal. May I enquire of the name of the author, publisher and exact name of the Ramayana you've got?</p>
<p>Even though I'm fluent in Hindi, its tough to learn Sanskrit. Virtually nobody in India speaks it, and only an extremely small fragment know the ancient language. Even back then it was too complicated, so other languages like Prakrit arose.</p>
<p>I'm trying to learn Sanskrit myself. Good luck to you, and you better get coaching, for doing it yourself will take an awful lot of time.</p>

<p>One of my main projects at this time is an article about <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaguar.html" title="Jaguar">Jaguars</a>(animal). An unregistered user has continued to falsely edit the article declaring the jaguar as the most powerful of all the big cats. I have been deleting his edits but he comes back every couple of days to change the article. He did so again yesterday and added 5 references that he believed justified his point. I took the time to look at all of them, 3 sites did not mention the jaguar as being the strongest cat, 1 site did but was an ordinary dot-com cited created by a novice that displayed many erroneous facts along with some truths, the last site was somewhat credible, one I actually visted before it was referenced here, but its a website about a cat sanctuary and some of the statistics on this page are erroneous as well. I have done research personally on both the web and from my substantial library of big cat books, and the books and credible sites I have obtained state that the tiger is the most powerful cat. I would like to cite one of my animal encyclopedias as a reference for the tiger's strength on the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger.html" title="Tiger">tiger</a> page. My question for you is, is this appropriate, how would I go about doing this, and finally after I have done so what can I do to deter this individual from misleading wikipedia users. I have great faith in this cite but I have a very low tolerance for false information, misinformation, and especially vandalism. Thank you so much for any help you can provide me. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalix_0748.html" title="User:Malix">Malix</a> 1:12 EST December 8, 2005</p>

<dd>It's hard for me to trust you when you've vandalized us thousands of times. Do you seriously expect me to fact-check every edit you make, when the vast majority of your edits have been vandalism? Are you going to "go straight" now and stop vandalising?

<p>Hi! This user <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_801greg_d911.html" title="Special:Contributions/801greg">801greg</a> keeps reverting my reverts to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Valli_6b0f.html" title="Frankie Valli">Frankie Valli</a>'s correct birthdate, 1937, when there is enough evidence that he was born in 1937 (i.e. The Internet Movie Database and The World Almanac). And Wikipedia is supposed to be devoted to displaying the most accurate and relevant information. I don't always want to be the one reverting his changes, so please help me. Also, I have a few more questions for you. Would you consider the entire works of Heinrich Schutz to belong to the Baroque period? And I now consider Beethoven's Symphonies 1 &amp; 2 to be late Classical and his Symphonies 3-9 to be early Romantic.

<p>Thank you for correcting the categorization of <a href="../../../u/n/_/Un_ballo_in_maschera.html" title="Un ballo in maschera">Un ballo in maschera</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the entries on the WikiProject Opera were posted many moons ago. I didn't realize this at first. It's confusing seeing a section called "Recent Work" and then seeing it was written in April. Would it be possible for me to clean up the page, not by deleting anything, but by moving entries to a section marked "April/May 2005" or whatever? (I have already done this with one stray 2004 item).</p>
<p>You are evidently a senior Wikipedian so doubtless you will know how to deal with this. Regards.</p>

<p>I have added a list of 680 operas to the Talk page to show presence/absence on Wikipedia. I am wondering whether I should put this on the main project page. You have more of structural sense about this than I have as a newbie. Do you have an opinion?</p>
<p>I am also wondering whether I can develop some of the sections on the main page. Is there any etiquette to follow? I'd prefer not to offend any of the old hands in the process!</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 14:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for setting up the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Opera_Operas_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Opera/Operas">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Opera/Operas</a>. That's splendid.</p>
<p>The list was originally compiled for a different purpose (I have an online opera magazine) so I have edited it to be more useful for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It is performance rather than history oriented. Almost the composers are still performed (but not all the works) so it might be an idea to add more historical stuff. It would be great if you could add Baroque works. The list is probably rather weak in that area. (Perhaps we could gradually up the total number cited as we do this?)</p>
<p>My only concern is about the accessibility of the page. I may try to make it more prominent. Please let me know if I do something which is 'un-Wikipedian'. My background is in publishing but I'm new here.</p>
<p>One further point. I have been listing the complete works on the {jacques Offenbach]] page. There are about 100. However I will only list the major ones on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Opera_Operas_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Opera/Operas">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Opera/Operas</a>. Does that seem reasonable?</p>

<p>Thanks for your message. Glad you are using the New Grove. Is that Music and Musicians? I am using the 4 volume New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Presumably Macmillan used the same house style for both, which should help consistency over the whole classical music/opera field.</p>

<p>I noticed you remove a link I posted on the Jesus page; it is called "Jesus, a historical reconstruction". First let me tell you I spent seven years developping this website.</p>
<p>It is:</p>
<p>- not commercial in any way</p>
<p>- presented only as A reconstuction</p>
<p>- fully researched and utterly documented</p>
<p>- the size of a small book</p>
<p>- covering many related topics affecting our understanding of Jesus</p>
<p>- posted on about 20 websites, some Christian, others not</p>
<p>- strictly about Jesus, the one credited to start Christianity</p>
<p>- under "historical Jesus", on the top 10 on Yahoo! and Google</p>
<p>- without hate against anyone</p>
<p>- warmly recommended among some of my readers (see below), including a few scholars (from different sides).</p>
<p>I also noted on the link list a posted website called the "Jesus puzzle", which is highly controversial, and against the existence of Jesus. So I am very perplexed about your standard of rejection or acceptance.</p>
<p>It does not matter if myself or somebody else posts my website, you or Izehar removes it. I sent Izehar emails requesting some answers, but I did not get any so far.</p>
<p>Excerpts of comments from my readers (complete texts in "my best review" and "... readers' comments" pages)</p>
<p>"Congratulations! ... easily the best documented &amp; most objective piece of Jesus research that I have found on the internet in almost a year of surfing. ... independent evaluation of the historical evidence that you demonstrate so well. ... such historical clarity ..."</p>
<p>"I really appreciate your efforts to your homepage. It's great and informative."</p>
<p>"I am fascinated and impressed ... This is a fantastic effort."</p>
<p>"You have done a very thorough job researching your material."</p>
<p>"You are to be commended on your extensive study of these matters."</p>
<p>"I have just stumbled across your work, and have spent a few hours reading it. Most impressive!"</p>
<p>"I was researching some information ... and sifted through 10 or 20 documents before finding yours. The others were not helpful in the slightest, and your site was clearly and concisely organized and had the information I needed."</p>
<p>"I have visited your website on the historical reconstruction of Jesus and I have found it very interesting. You have done an excellent work on it ... Your website has helped me understand a great deal of Jesus and life of early Christians."</p>
<p>"Your work is impressive, and valuable to those like myself ... but have immense difficulty accepting all the add-ons ... Again, thanks for your work, and for sharing it with others who care to explore the truth of religious matters."</p>
<p>"This is where your rational approach is most helpful ... by using historical research and factual information. It really takes a careful eye to spot these things, some of which are buried under layers of "over-familiarity". This is not a criticism, rather more a compliment, but I do want to say that your site is demanding careful attention."</p>
<p>"Good Work. I have been reading your account of the life of Jesus, and I find it very insightful."</p>
<p>"I have just finished reading Jesus a historical reconstruction ... What I found in your online book is something very believable ... Thank you very much for your dedication to these matters."</p>
<p>"You have an excellent site. It's obvious you have put a lot of work/thought/effort into its construction."</p>
<p>"Bernard D. Muller provides a beautifully presented picture of the historical Jesus ... he brings to the table, mostly, a lot of common sense. It's a deep site, with a lot to think about and ponder over. Highly recommended ..."</p>
<p>"Your history of Jesus is fascinating! Very thorough and impressive. I was just surfing through the net and came upon your site, and I must say, I spent a lot of time going through everything you wrote ... Again, congratulations on your work!"</p>
<p>"The author clearly writes with a great deal of knowledge ... Furthermore, Bernard does not break any academic rules ... The amount of valuable resources available at the site is exceptional and should not be ignored ... this website should not be overlooked in any study on Jesus."</p>
<p>"I recently found your site and I am very impressed, you did a lot of work! I never read about the events at Cesarea before and I can see how they could inspire John the Baptist and Jesus to do what they did. ... I find your reconstruction very believable ..."</p>
<p>"... the eloquent cases you make for a later (and real) 'Q', 'Thomas' and the like have given me pause over taking John Crossan's opinions as the last word ... I really think you are closer to disentangling the NT mess than most."</p>
<p>"I just read your website about "The epistles of Ignatius: are they all forgeries?". I was absolutely impressed. Zwingende Argumente! Great work! Will this be published in a "Fachzeitschrift"? ... I appreciate good scholarship - as you call it: "highly inquisitive" ..."</p>
<p>"... what I found most refreshing about your work is its objectivity and impartiality. I've been searching for some time for someone who could help fill in the gaps and mostly have found Jesus bashers full of the same sort of hate and prejudice I see in the world religions. These people are no better than those they criticize. Thank you for bringing me closer to the truth without inciting bad emotions. And thank you for providing such a gold mine of information. Your site is at the top of my bookmarks! ... Keep up the good work."</p>
<p>"Here he does a good job of logically reconstructing the life and ministry of Jesus. It's a fascinating read whether you are a Christian or non-believer."</p>
<p>I want to believe in wikipedia, but you must understand my feelings now are mixed. At times, I even think I am considered a p.... of sh.., to be blunt. If this problem is solved, I might even contribute.</p>
<p>PS: I am a lover of classical music, more so violin pieces, such as in sonatas, quartets and concertos. I am very fond of Spohr (I know, he is ONLY the best of the minor German composers, but I do not care). Of course, I am not a multi-talented genius like you. But I was greatly influenced by existentialism (and Sartre) from my days in France and I think my research on Jesus reflects that in its "down to earth" and human approach.</p>
<p>Best regards, Bernard</p>

<dd>Did you intentionally blank my entire talk page? I'll assume good faith and presume it was an accident.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Our community has developed over several years by consensus decisions of its members, and the model of editors, along with another echelon of users with slightly greater powers (administrators), has served reasonably well for those several years, without any heavily-supported movements for change. In other words, the community seems to be OK with it as is; it ain't broke, it don't need fixin'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your question more philosophically, whenever people gather themselves into large groups, hierarchical structures emerge naturally. I haven't studied this myself except informally, and to note that it indeed does happen; it may be a default characteristic of human nature. Some community members in any large group tend to be seen as "elders" and become leaders of the community; and in some cases there is a single leader over them all (we have such a model, though our leader minimises his day-to-day involvement). The number of levels of the hierarchy, not its existence, is usually the most contentious point, as is of course the occurrence of, and nature of, promotions from one level to the other.</dd>

<p>Hora is a traditional Romanian dance and is not a gypsy one!!! --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacodava_0e5c.html" title="User:Dacodava">Dacodava</a></p>
<p><br />
Hora is the name for the large circle dance and is the most widespread dance in Romania, partly because any number of participants of both men and women, of any ability or age, can join in. The term Hora is also used for the Sunday village dance, even where the Hora dance does not form part of the dance cycle. In southern Romania and Moldavia Hora is the introductory dance to the dance cycle.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacodava_0e5c.html" title="User:Dacodava">Dacodava</a></p>
<p>Yes, for once Dacodava and I agree. Nothing particularly Gypsy about the hora. It's pretty much the Romanian national dance, at least outside of Transylvania. Pretty much the same thing as the Ashkenazi Jewish dance of the same name that a lot of people think of a folkloric Israeli dance. Your basic big circle dance, with relatively simple steps (certainly simpler than, for example, a Catalan sardana). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:55, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Antandrus:</p>
<p>My name is Gary Matsumoto. I am the author of the Science article to which Wikipedia refers in its erroneuous entry on the 2001 anthrax letter attacks. I have been trying without success to delete my entry for several reasons. First, because it is incorrect. The Science article I wrote did not suggest that the source of the Senate attack material was a "hidden U.S. government anthrax program." I did not write that in the Science article or in any other report that I have written or broadcast. Second, I wish to be deleted because I object to being the only journalist on a list of Internet conspiracy theorists who have advanced their theories on unregulated, unedited websites. I am a staff reporter and producer for a major U.S. news organization. I do not have a website. Everything I have written on the subject has been for the so-called MSM (ABC News, Washington Post, Science). I gathered most of my information this subject while working on staff at ABC News, specifically with the ABC News Investigative Unit. Yet, there are no other MSM journalists on this list. Judith Miller, Bill Broad of the New York Times have written far more about the attacks, but they are not listed. Joby Warrick and Marilyn Thompson of the Washington Post have written extensively about them (Thompson even wrote a book about it); yet they're not on it; neither is Guy Gugliotta, my co-author of the Washington Post article that ran on the front page, above-the-fold in October 2002. Mark Hosenball of Newsweek is not on this list; Brian Ross of ABC News isn't either. So what gives? I do not wish to be listed in this Wikipedia rogues gallery of anthrax Internet theorists, especially not with patently incorrect information attributed to me, about my work. Please get me off this list; and try to get your facts straight. Providing information is a public service; disseminating false information is a disservice, not just to me, but to everyone. If you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to contact me at witzend@nyct.net. Sincerely, Gary Matsumoto</p>

<dd>Reviewing the case--i.e. looking at the article you mention--I reverted an edit from you because it looked like vandalism (we get a LOT of vandals who just drop by an article and delete a random section). As the article currently stands, you are the last editor, and the section remains deleted, so I'll leave it that way. All the best, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:53, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I incorporated Gary's changes (minus the inappropriate boosterism), which should satisfy his factual accuracy objection. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 16:54, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>MIRROR VAX:</b> I have deleted my revised entry, again. In all fairness, I am, as far as I can tell, the only journalist on this list. I object to you making me an exception. I did <i>not</i> propogate a theory, as did everyone else on your list. I reported facts that had been, my <i>Science</i> magazine article, reviewed by scientists as well as editors. This specific article was also supported by footnotes and a bioliography. That is lot more than I can say for all the journalists who <i>did</i> propagate theories, but have been spared the ignominy of being on your list. For example, Nicholas Kristof of the New York <i>Times</i> wrote several high profile columns in America's newspaper of record, accusing "Dr. Z"/Dr. Steven Hatfill of being the most likely anthrax mailer. Marilyn Thompson did the same in the Washington <i>Post</i> Magazine; NYT's Judith Miller implied as much in a front page piece she wrote on Hatfill's work in constructing mock BW labs on wheels. Brian Ross of ABC News said Hatfill's arrest as the anthrax mailer "was imminent." These are bona fide journalists who not only advanced theories on how the anthrax was made, they advanced theories on who mailed it ... all without providing verifiable physical evidence or testimony to link Hatfill to the crime. All the individuals that I listed above have more in common (Hatfill) with Don Foster and Barbara Hatch Rosenberg than I do. Yet I am on your list. Scott Shane of the Baltimore Sun broke the story that a U.S. Army lab was actually making weaponized anthrax, but he is not on the list.</p>
<p>So I object to Wikipedia's inaccuracy; its inconsistency and the arbitrariness in its choices. Putting me on this list equates my work with anti-Semites, with Internet conspiracy-mongers and with people whose work is now the subject of litigation. As I pointed out in my previous message, I have no website advancing a theory behind this crime. My <i>Science</i> article was reviewed by a half dozen Ph.D.s and vetted by nearly as many senior editors at one the most highly regarded science journals in the world. My <i>Science</i> article is cited in formal papers published in peer-reviewed science journals and is also cited in Ph.D. dissertations written by scientists working for U.S. government laboratories doing biodefense research.</p>
<p>Your entry for Gary Matsumoto was, for many months, grosssly inaccurate. Now, the revised copy - an alleged sop to a disgruntled subject - fails to provide context that would enable a reader to distinguish me from individuals whose work has been discredited as inaccurate and defamatory (and is the subject of litigation), or from individuals whose work <i>should</i> be discredited for its substandard quality. Inclusion on your list is a dishonor. Kindly leave me off it, or in fairness, add to it every journalist who has written or broadcast about the 2001 anthrax attacks. <b>Sincerely, Gary Matsumoto</b></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been searching for a Gita edition myself, but can't seem to find a good one. I rely upon the Mahabharata book written by a British Hindu, Krishna Dharma for the Gita Updesh.</p>
<p>An English-Sanskrit text back-to-back is ideal. May I enquire of the name of the author, publisher and exact name of the Ramayana you've got?</p>
<p>Even though I'm fluent in Hindi, its tough to learn Sanskrit. Virtually nobody in India speaks it, and only an extremely small fragment know the ancient language. Even back then it was too complicated, so other languages like Prakrit arose.</p>
<p>I'm trying to learn Sanskrit myself. Good luck to you, and you better get coaching, for doing it yourself will take an awful lot of time.</p>
<p>Jai Sri Rama! <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 04:21, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of my main projects at this time is an article about <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaguar.html" title="Jaguar">Jaguars</a>(animal). An unregistered user has continued to falsely edit the article declaring the jaguar as the most powerful of all the big cats. I have been deleting his edits but he comes back every couple of days to change the article. He did so again yesterday and added 5 references that he believed justified his point. I took the time to look at all of them, 3 sites did not mention the jaguar as being the strongest cat, 1 site did but was an ordinary dot-com cited created by a novice that displayed many erroneous facts along with some truths, the last site was somewhat credible, one I actually visted before it was referenced here, but its a website about a cat sanctuary and some of the statistics on this page are erroneous as well. I have done research personally on both the web and from my substantial library of big cat books, and the books and credible sites I have obtained state that the tiger is the most powerful cat. I would like to cite one of my animal encyclopedias as a reference for the tiger's strength on the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger.html" title="Tiger">tiger</a> page. My question for you is, is this appropriate, how would I go about doing this, and finally after I have done so what can I do to deter this individual from misleading wikipedia users. I have great faith in this cite but I have a very low tolerance for false information, misinformation, and especially vandalism. Thank you so much for any help you can provide me. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalix_0748.html" title="User:Malix">Malix</a> 1:12 EST December 8, 2005</p>

And Wikipedia is supposed to be devoted to displaying the most accurate and relevant information. I don't always want to be the one reverting his changes, so please help me. Also, I have a few more questions for you. Would you consider the entire works of Heinrich Schutz to belong to the Baroque period? And I now consider Beethoven's Symphonies 1 &amp; 2 to be late Classical and his Symphonies 3-9 to be early Romantic.

<p>Thank you for correcting the categorization of <a href="../../../u/n/_/Un_ballo_in_maschera.html" title="Un ballo in maschera">Un ballo in maschera</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the entries on the WikiProject Opera were posted many moons ago. I didn't realize this at first. It's confusing seeing a section called "Recent Work" and then seeing it was written in April. Would it be possible for me to clean up the page, not by deleting anything, but by moving entries to a section marked "April/May 2005" or whatever? (I have already done this with one stray 2004 item).</p>
<p>You are evidently a senior Wikipedian so doubtless you will know how to deal with this. Regards.</p>

<p>I have added a list of 680 operas to the Talk page to show presence/absence on Wikipedia. I am wondering whether I should put this on the main project page. You have more of structural sense about this than I have as a newbie. Do you have an opinion?</p>
<p>I am also wondering whether I can develop some of the sections on the main page. Is there any etiquette to follow? I'd prefer not to offend any of the old hands in the process!</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 14:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for setting up the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Opera_Operas_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Opera/Operas">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Opera/Operas</a>. That's splendid.</p>
<p>The list was originally compiled for a different purpose (I have an online opera magazine) so I have edited it to be more useful for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It is performance rather than history oriented. Almost the composers are still performed (but not all the works) so it might be an idea to add more historical stuff. It would be great if you could add Baroque works. The list is probably rather weak in that area. (Perhaps we could gradually up the total number cited as we do this?)</p>
<p>My only concern is about the accessibility of the page. I may try to make it more prominent. Please let me know if I do something which is 'un-Wikipedian'. My background is in publishing but I'm new here.</p>
<p>One further point. I have been listing the complete works on the {jacques Offenbach]] page. There are about 100. However I will only list the major ones on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Opera_Operas_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Opera/Operas">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Opera/Operas</a>. Does that seem reasonable?</p>

<p>Thanks for your message. Glad you are using the New Grove. Is that Music and Musicians? I am using the 4 volume New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Presumably Macmillan used the same house style for both, which should help consistency over the whole classical music/opera field.</p>

<p>Hi, I see you have been kind enough to fix some redirects on <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_belle_H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_1963.html" title="La belle Hélène">La belle Hélène</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately someone called Ringbang has been trying to implement his own French capitalization system (basically capitalizing every second word in the names) on Offenbach! After an exchange with him I tried to move the article back to the old name but couldn't, presumably because of the re-directs. Any idea how I can do this? Ringbang seems to be cleverer at this that I am! Is there some way of seeing all the redirects together?</p>

<p>I think I have been able to fix this - via cut and paste - so i think it's OK. Sorry to bother you. Hope all is well. We've been doing a lot of work on opera. Best.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_Archive8_0db2.html" title="Edit section: Jesus link">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jesus link</span></h2>
<p>I noticed you remove a link I posted on the Jesus page; it is called "Jesus, a historical reconstruction". First let me tell you I spent seven years developping this website.</p>
<p>It is:</p>
<p>- not commercial in any way</p>
<p>- presented only as A reconstuction</p>
<p>- fully researched and utterly documented</p>
<p>- the size of a small book</p>
<p>- covering many related topics affecting our understanding of Jesus</p>
<p>- posted on about 20 websites, some Christian, others not</p>
<p>- strictly about Jesus, the one credited to start Christianity</p>
<p>- under "historical Jesus", on the top 10 on Yahoo! and Google</p>
<p>- without hate against anyone</p>
<p>- warmly recommended among some of my readers (see below), including a few scholars (from different sides).</p>
<p>I also noted on the link list a posted website called the "Jesus puzzle", which is highly controversial, and against the existence of Jesus. So I am very perplexed about your standard of rejection or acceptance.</p>
<p>It does not matter if myself or somebody else posts my website, you or Izehar removes it. I sent Izehar emails requesting some answers, but I did not get any so far.</p>
<p>Excerpts of comments from my readers (complete texts in "my best review" and "... readers' comments" pages)</p>
<p>"Congratulations! ... easily the best documented &amp; most objective piece of Jesus research that I have found on the internet in almost a year of surfing. ... independent evaluation of the historical evidence that you demonstrate so well. ... such historical clarity ..."</p>
<p>"I really appreciate your efforts to your homepage. It's great and informative."</p>
<p>"I am fascinated and impressed ... This is a fantastic effort."</p>
<p>"You have done a very thorough job researching your material."</p>
<p>"You are to be commended on your extensive study of these matters."</p>
<p>"I have just stumbled across your work, and have spent a few hours reading it. Most impressive!"</p>
<p>"I was researching some information ... and sifted through 10 or 20 documents before finding yours. The others were not helpful in the slightest, and your site was clearly and concisely organized and had the information I needed."</p>
<p>"I have visited your website on the historical reconstruction of Jesus and I have found it very interesting. You have done an excellent work on it ... Your website has helped me understand a great deal of Jesus and life of early Christians."</p>
<p>"Your work is impressive, and valuable to those like myself ... but have immense difficulty accepting all the add-ons ... Again, thanks for your work, and for sharing it with others who care to explore the truth of religious matters."</p>
<p>"This is where your rational approach is most helpful ... by using historical research and factual information. It really takes a careful eye to spot these things, some of which are buried under layers of "over-familiarity". This is not a criticism, rather more a compliment, but I do want to say that your site is demanding careful attention."</p>
<p>"Good Work. I have been reading your account of the life of Jesus, and I find it very insightful."</p>
<p>"I have just finished reading Jesus a historical reconstruction ... What I found in your online book is something very believable ... Thank you very much for your dedication to these matters."</p>
<p>"You have an excellent site. It's obvious you have put a lot of work/thought/effort into its construction."</p>
<p>"Bernard D. Muller provides a beautifully presented picture of the historical Jesus ... he brings to the table, mostly, a lot of common sense. It's a deep site, with a lot to think about and ponder over. Highly recommended ..."</p>
<p>"Your history of Jesus is fascinating! Very thorough and impressive. I was just surfing through the net and came upon your site, and I must say, I spent a lot of time going through everything you wrote ... Again, congratulations on your work!"</p>
<p>"The author clearly writes with a great deal of knowledge ... Furthermore, Bernard does not break any academic rules ... The amount of valuable resources available at the site is exceptional and should not be ignored ... this website should not be overlooked in any study on Jesus."</p>
<p>"I recently found your site and I am very impressed, you did a lot of work! I never read about the events at Cesarea before and I can see how they could inspire John the Baptist and Jesus to do what they did. ... I find your reconstruction very believable ..."</p>
<p>"... the eloquent cases you make for a later (and real) 'Q', 'Thomas' and the like have given me pause over taking John Crossan's opinions as the last word ... I really think you are closer to disentangling the NT mess than most."</p>
<p>"I just read your website about "The epistles of Ignatius: are they all forgeries?". I was absolutely impressed. Zwingende Argumente! Great work! Will this be published in a "Fachzeitschrift"? ... I appreciate good scholarship - as you call it: "highly inquisitive" ..."</p>
<p>"... what I found most refreshing about your work is its objectivity and impartiality. I've been searching for some time for someone who could help fill in the gaps and mostly have found Jesus bashers full of the same sort of hate and prejudice I see in the world religions. These people are no better than those they criticize. Thank you for bringing me closer to the truth without inciting bad emotions. And thank you for providing such a gold mine of information. Your site is at the top of my bookmarks! ... Keep up the good work."</p>
<p>"Here he does a good job of logically reconstructing the life and ministry of Jesus. It's a fascinating read whether you are a Christian or non-believer."</p>
<p>I want to believe in wikipedia, but you must understand my feelings now are mixed. At times, I even think I am considered a p.... of sh.., to be blunt. If this problem is solved, I might even contribute.</p>
<p>PS: I am a lover of classical music, more so violin pieces, such as in sonatas, quartets and concertos. I am very fond of Spohr (I know, he is ONLY the best of the minor German composers, but I do not care). Of course, I am not a multi-talented genius like you. But I was greatly influenced by existentialism (and Sartre) from my days in France and I think my research on Jesus reflects that in its "down to earth" and human approach.</p>
<p>Best regards, Bernard</p>

<p>Antandrus,</p>
<p>Sorry, Sorry, I looked at the history sub-page too quickly. Of course, it was not you. But now, when I try to identify my deleter, he looks anonymous: this what I found:</p>
<p>This IP address, 205.188.116.73, is registered to America Online (AOL) and is shared by multiple users. Comments left on this page may be received by other users of this IP and appear to be irrelevant. Caution should be used when blocking this IP or reverting its contributions without checking. If you are an unregistered user operating from this address, note that this is not the IP address of your machine. 205.188.116.73 is the IP address of a proxy server that communicates between your browser and the Wikimedia servers. These and other proxies are shared among thousands of AOL users. If you are frustrated by irrelevant comments appearing here, you can avoid them by creating an account for yourself.</p>
<p>Since you are an administrator, can the posting of my website be protected, or am I at the mercy of some anonymous? Can you do something on that matter?</p>
<p>Thanks for your very quick answer anyway. I was not expecting anything that fast, more so I am not getting anything back from Izehar.</p>

<dd>Did you intentionally blank my entire talk page? I'll assume good faith and presume it was an accident.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Our community has developed over several years by consensus decisions of its members, and the model of editors, along with another echelon of users with slightly greater powers (administrators), has served reasonably well for those several years, without any heavily-supported movements for change. In other words, the community seems to be OK with it as is; it ain't broke, it don't need fixin'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your question more philosophically, whenever people gather themselves into large groups, hierarchical structures emerge naturally. I haven't studied this myself except informally, and to note that it indeed does happen; it may be a default characteristic of human nature. Some community members in any large group tend to be seen as "elders" and become leaders of the community; and in some cases there is a single leader over them all (we have such a model, though our leader minimises his day-to-day involvement). The number of levels of the hierarchy, not its existence, is usually the most contentious point, as is of course the occurrence of, and nature of, promotions from one level to the other.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to join the community by all means do. I see that your blanking of my talk page was the only edit you made.
