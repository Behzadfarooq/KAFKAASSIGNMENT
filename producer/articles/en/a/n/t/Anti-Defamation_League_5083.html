<p>The stated purpose of the ADL is to fight "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and all forms of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigotry.html" title="Bigotry">bigotry</a> (in the United States) and abroad, combat international <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, probe the roots of <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate.html" title="Hate">hatred</a>, advocate before <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a>, come to the aid of victims of bigotry, develop educational programs, and serve as a public resource for government, media, law enforcement, and the public, all towards the goal of countering and reducing hatred."</p>
<p>Historically, the ADL has opposed groups and individuals it considered to be anti-Semitic and/or <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a>, including the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, Father <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Coughlin_a31a.html" title="Charles Coughlin">Charles Coughlin</a> (leader of the Christian Front), the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Identity_769f.html" title="Christian Identity">Christian Identity</a> movement, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German-American_Bund_e1dd.html" title="German-American Bund">German-American Bund</a>, and the American <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia_%28United_States%29_e014.html" title="Militia (United States)">Militia</a> movement.</p>
<p>The ADL publishes reports on a variety of countries regarding incidents of anti-Jewish attacks and propaganda. The neutrality of these reports is disputed by some groups, who deny that these incidents indicate anti-Semitism or in some cases that anti-Semitism even exists.</p>
<p>The ADL holds that a modern and common form of anti-Semitism is the idea that according to Jews all criticism of the State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> is anti-Semitism. This claim is then used to criticize Jewish groups as unreasonable. The Anti-Defamation League states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Criticism of particular Israeli actions or policies in and of itself does not constitute anti-Semitism. Certainly the sovereign State of Israel can be legitimately criticized just like any other country in the world. However, it is undeniable that there are those whose criticism of Israel or of "<a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>" is used to mask anti-Semitism." <a href="http://www.adl.org/israel/advocacy/how_to_respond/anti_semitism_criticism.asp?xflag=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/israel/advocacy/how_to_respond/anti_semitism_criticism.asp?xflag=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>The ADL supports the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_state.html" title="Jewish state">Jewish state</a> and has vociferously opposed resolutions like the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379_5cee.html" title="UN General Assembly Resolution 3379">1975 United Nations resolution</a> (<a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_4686_e651.html" title="UN General Assembly Resolution 4686">revoked in 1991</a>) that had equated <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism_and_racism.html" title="Zionism and racism">Zionism and racism</a>, <a href="http://www.adl.org/durban/adl_quotes.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/durban/adl_quotes.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> as well as attempts to revive that formulation at the 2001 U.N. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Conference_Against_Racism_c27c.html" title="World Conference Against Racism">World Conference Against Racism</a> in Durban, South Africa. <a href="http://www.adl.org/durban/un_anti-zionism.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/durban/un_anti-zionism.asp" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

In the context of public schools, the ADL has taken the position that because Creationism and Intelligent Design are religious beliefs, and the government is prohibited from endorsing the beliefs of any particular religion, they should not be taught in science classrooms: "The U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights of Americans to believe the religious theories of creation (as well as other theories) but it does not permit them to be taught in public school science classes." <a href="http://adl.org/issue_religious_freedom/create/creationism_QA.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://adl.org/issue_religious_freedom/create/creationism_QA.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Similarly, the ADL supports the legal precedent that it is unconstitutional for the government to post the 10 Commandments in courthouses, schools, and other public places: "True religious liberty means freedom from having the government impose the religion of the majority on all citizens." <a href="http://adl.org/10comm/Prohibitions.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://adl.org/10comm/Prohibitions.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p>As its goal is to defend not only Jews, but also "all citizens alike and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens," the ADL has periodically made statements against misrepresentations of other faiths. For example, when the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Mormon_f738.html" title="Anti-Mormon">anti-Mormon</a> film "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godmakers_%28film%29_6648.html" title="The Godmakers (film)">The Godmakers</a>" was produced, Rhonda M. Abrams, Central Pacific (San Francisco) Regional Director for the ADL wrote a critical review, including the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had a similar movie been made with either Judaism or Catholicism as its target, it would be immediately denounced for the scurrilous piece that it is. I sincerely hope that people of all faiths will similarly repudiate "The Godmakers" as defamatory and untrue, and recognize it for what it truly represents—a challenge to the religious liberty of all.

<p>The ADL is well-known for its efforts to keep track of the activities of various extremist groups and movements. <a href="http://adl.org/main_Extremism/default.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://adl.org/main_Extremism/default.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> According to ADL Director Abe Foxman, "Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-Jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings. . . . Because extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources . . . [who] function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists. Some have performed great service to the American people—for example, by uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camps—with no recognition and at considerable personal risk." ("A League of His Own," letter to the editor, <i>The Village Voice</i> 38:20 (May 18, 1993))</p>
<p>The ADL regularly releases reports on anti-Semitism and extremist activities on the far left and the far right. For instance, as part of its Law Enforcement Agency Resource Network (L.E.A.R.N.), the ADL has published information about <a href="http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Militia_M.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=mm" class="external text" title="http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Militia_M.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=mm" rel="nofollow">the Militia Movement</a> in America and a guide to <a href="http://adl.org/learn/safety/Whysafety.asp" class="external text" title="http://adl.org/learn/safety/Whysafety.asp" rel="nofollow">Officer Safety and Extremists</a>. An archive of "The Militia Watchdog" research on U.S. right-wing extremism (including groups not specifically cited as anti-Semitic) from 1995 to 2000 is also available on the ADL website <a href="http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Militia_M.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=mm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Militia_M.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=mm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, some details of the ADL's monitoring activities became public and controversial, including the fact that the ADL had gathered information about some non-extremist groups. (See "The ADL files controversy" below.)</p>

<p>The ADL believes it is important to remember the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, in order to prevent such an event from ever coming to pass again. Along with sponsoring events and fighting Holocaust deniers and revisionists, the ADL has been active in urging action to stop modern-day "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>" and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> in places such as <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur.html" title="Darfur">Darfur</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>.</p>

A press release from the ADL stated that "PETA's effort to seek 'approval' for their 'Holocaust on Your Plate' campaign is outrageous, offensive and takes <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chutzpah.html" title="Chutzpah">chutzpah</a> to new heights. Rather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find ways to make sure such catastrophes never happen again." <a href="http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/4235_52.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/4235_52.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> On May 5, 2005, PETA issued an apology for comparing the treatment of farm animals to the victims of the Nazi concentration camps. PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said she realized that the campaign had caused pain: "This was never our intention, and we are deeply sorry."

<p>In 2006 the ADL condemned Senate Republicans in the United States for attempting to ban <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a> with the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Marriage_Amendment_d382.html" title="Federal Marriage Amendment">Federal Marriage Amendment</a> and praised its demise, calling it "discrimination".<a href="http://www.adl.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> That same year the ADL also warned that the debate over <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigration.html" title="Illegal immigration">illegal immigration</a> was drawing <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-nazis.html" title="Neo-nazis">neo-nazis</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semites.html" title="Anti-semites">anti-semites</a> into the ranks of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_Project_Inc._d80e.html" title="The Minuteman Project Inc.">Minutemen Project</a>.</p>
<p>ADL's New England Regional Office has also established a faith-based initiative called "The Interfaith Youth Leadership Program," better known as "Camp If," or Camp Interfaith. Involving teenagers of the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian faiths, the camp brings the teens together for a week at camp where the teens bond and learn about each other's cultures. The camp has emerged as a new attempt to foster good relations between younger members of the Abrahamic faiths. <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/06/a_different_kind_of_camp/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/06/a_different_kind_of_camp/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<p>The ADL has not very often worked together with <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a>-American and American <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> groups, owing to disagreement concerning the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>. However, the ADL has on numerous occasions reached out to elements within the Islamic community and works to improve interfaith dialogue. The ADL has publicly condemned slurs and attacks against <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. ADL publications on condemning bigotry towards Arabs, Muslims, Blacks and members of other minorities have often been used in synagogue adult education programs, and as part of Jewish-Christian and Jewish-Muslim inter-faith dialogue.</p>
<p>The ADL is sometimes at odds with Arab and Muslim groups, particularly over issues involving Israel and anti-Semitism. For instance, the ADL regularly publishes updates to its web site reviewing and cataloging negative portrayals of Jews in Arab nations' media. <a href="http://www.adl.org/main_Arab_World/default.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adl.org/main_Arab_World/default.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>Arab and Muslim groups are often critical of the ADL as well. For example, in a minor flap in New Jersey in June, 2001 over a politician who spoke to a Muslim group, the group accused the ADL of "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Muslim_742a.html" title="Anti-Muslim">anti-Muslim</a> <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>" <a href="http://www.cair-net.org/default.asp?Page=articleView&amp;id=86&amp;theType=AA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cair-net.org/default.asp?Page=articleView&amp;id=86&amp;theType=AA" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.</p>

The ADL's press release noted that <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bomber.html" title="Suicide bomber">suicide bombers</a> connected to the Palestinian group <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> wear green armbands and headbands inscribed with the <i>Shahada</i> as a symbol of their movement, and stated: "We are troubled that members of the Muslim Students Union have chosen to display symbolism that is closely identified with Palestinian terrorist groups and that can be especially offensive to Jewish students." Controversy arose over the ADL's statement that "The <i>Shahada</i> has come to represent, in radical Muslim circles, support for martyrdom and terrorist groups." A news release from the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations_0b3f.html" title="Council on American-Islamic Relations">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> denied that the stoles were expressions of support for terrorism, called the ADL's comments "bigoted statements", and demanded an apology; the organization's communications director Sabiha Khan said: "The ADL's hate-filled Islamophobic rhetoric labels all Muslims as terrorists, because every Muslim believes in the declaration of faith as the essence of Islam." <a href="http://www.cair-net.org/default.asp?Page=articleView&amp;id=1085&amp;theType=NR" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cair-net.org/default.asp?Page=articleView&amp;id=1085&amp;theType=NR" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> The ADL released a clarifying statement saying the ADL has nothing against the Muslim statement of faith and that, "It was never our intent to offend anyone and we apologize to those who took offense." <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=32363" class="external autonumber" title="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=32363" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>

Some of the information he obtained and then passed on to the ADL came from confidential documents (including intelligence files on various Nazi groups and driver's license records and other personal information on nearly 1,400 people) that were given to him by San Francisco police officer Tom Gerard.

Many of Bullock's files concerned groups that did not fit the mold of extremist groups, hate groups, and organizations hostile to Jews or Israel that the ADL would usually be interested in.

An attorney for the ADL stated that "We knew nothing about the vast extent of the files. Those are not ADL's files. . . . That is all [Bullock's] doing." (Meredith Jane Adams, "Anti-Defamation League may have broken records laws", Chicago Tribune, May 3, 1993) As for its own records, the ADL indicated that just because it had a file on a group did not indicate opposition to the group. <a href="http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>
<p>The San Francisco district attorney at the time accused the ADL of conducting a national "<a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spy</a> network", but dropped all accusations a few months later. In the weeks following the raids, however, a private class-action lawsuit was filed in San Francisco Superior Court against the ADL. The plaintiffs' attorney, former Representative McCloskey, claimed that information the ADL gathered constituted an invasion of privacy. The ADL, while distancing itself from Bullock, countered that it is entitled like any researcher or journalist to research organizations and individuals. Richard Cohen, legal director of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center_e0cd.html" title="Southern Poverty Law Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> in Montgomery, Alabama, stated that like journalists, the ADL's researchers "gather information however they can" and welcome disclosures from confidential sources, saying "they probably rely on their sources to draw the line" on how much can legally be divulged. Bullock admitted that he was overzealous, and that some of the ways he gathered information may have been illegal. (Meredith Jane Adams, "Anti-Defamation League may have broken records laws", Chicago Tribune, May 3, 1993)</p>
<p>The lawsuit was settled out of court in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. The ADL agreed to pay $175,000 for the court costs of the groups that sued it, promised that it would not seek information from sources it knew could not legally disclose such information, consented to remove sensitive information like criminal records or Social Security numbers from its files, and spent $25,000 to further relations between the Jewish, Arab and black communities. When the case was settled, <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussein_Ibish_2571.html" title="Hussein Ibish">Hussein Ibish</a>, director of communications for the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American-Arab_Anti-Discrimination_Committee_5935.html" title="American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC), claimed that the ADL had gathered data "systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and Arab-American organizations". ADL national director Abraham Foxman called the ADC's claims "absolutely untrue," saying that "if it were true, they would have won their case" and noting that no court found the ADL guilty of any wrongdoing. The ADL released a statement saying that the settlement "explicitly recognizes ADL's right to gather information in any lawful and constitutionally protected manner, which we have always done and will continue to do." <a href="http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></p>

<p>Some critics allege the ADL willfully exaggerates the prevalence of anti-Semitism, especially among Muslims. The critics also claim that the ADL defines legitimate criticism so narrowly that even moderate analysis of Israel could be categorized as anti-Semitic. Criticism from the right also stems from criticism of Israel being attacked as anti-semitic and tracking of what the ADL considers extremist or racist groups which many on the right do not agree are racist or extreme and actually consider patriotic. For example the ADL lists opposition to income taxes as extremist with white supremacist elements.</p>
<p>For example, Jewish linguist and activist <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> wrote in his 1989 book <i><a href="../../../n/e/c/Necessary_Illusions_5d2c.html" title="Necessary Illusions">Necessary Illusions</a></i>:</p>

In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Candace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of the Quigleys, contacted the Denver ADL office, claiming to have overheard cordless phone conversations of the Quigleys talking about putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning the Aronson children and wishing the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. The Quigleys and the Aronsons had been engaged in an escalating series of petty disputes prior to this incident. The ADL advised the Aronsons to tape the Quigleys (a tactic which had recently been made illegal). The ADL also labelled the Quigleys as violent anti-Semites in a press conference which led to felony federal charges being filed against them.</p>
<p>The Quigleys successfully sued the ADL for falsely portraying them as anti-Semites.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_federal_judge_2a40.html" title="United States federal judge">U.S. District Judge</a> Edward Nottingham wrote "it is not unreasonable to infer that public charges of anti-Semitism leveled by the ADL will be taken seriously and assumed by many to be true without question. In that respect, the ADL is in a unique position of being able to cause substantial harm to individuals when it lends its backing to allegations of anti-Semitism." The judge concluded that the ADL supported the Aronsons' accusations without investigating the case, or weighing of the consequences.<a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2001/01.04.13/news3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forward.com/issues/2001/01.04.13/news3.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time Israel comes under international pressure, as it did recently because of the war crimes committed in Lebanon, it steps up the claim of anti-Semitism, and all of Israel's critics are anti-Semitic. 1974, the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League, puts out a book called <i>The New Anti-Semitism</i>. 1981, the Anti-Defamation League puts out a book, <i>The New Anti-Semitism</i>. And then, again in 2000, Abraham Foxman and people like <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllis_Chesler_8a8b.html" title="Phyllis Chesler">Phyllis Chesler</a>, they put out these books called <i>The New Anti-Semitism</i>. So the use of the charge "anti-Semitism" is pretty conventional whenever Israel comes under attack, and frankly it has no content whatsoever nowadays.... What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no—there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Laqueur_d045.html" title="Walter Laqueur">Walter Laqueur</a>, a very prominent scholar. It's called <i>The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism</i>. It just came out, 2006, from <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Press_e785.html" title="Oxford University Press">Oxford University Press</a>. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous."<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/30/1418200" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/30/1418200" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></p>
