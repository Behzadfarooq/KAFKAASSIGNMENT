<p>[Original title was: "This is so sad" Minasbeede 21:51, 29 April 2006 (UTC)]</p>
<p>It's sad because still the emphasis is on combating spam at or after the destination server. Fine, do all those things. ISPs and others can also take very effective action at the pre-destination-server level, the "abuse" level. That's the level at which the spammers steal service in order to hide themselves and in order to keep their own costs down. That works because it is allowed to work.</p>
<p>There is more to do at the abuse level than to complain about how clueless many users are and about how that cluelessness is exploited by the spammers. The thing for the clueful to do is to fake cluelessness and to thereby cause the spammers as much difficulty and pain as can be mustered. Not only is that effective, it can be a source of very great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to grap? If the spammers are allowed essentially full freedom to exploit unprotected systems they'll exploit unprotected systems and they'll do it in a way that, as much as possible for them, makes it possible for them to keep sending spam through the destination-server-level defenses. There's never going to be a time (at least not in the next 10 to 15 years) in which almost all systems are fully secure. Securing systems is good but it is not aggresive enough against spammers. Create secure systems that look insecure and you'll be in a position to perhaps be a source of great grief to spammers. If you're against spammers what is holding you back?</p>

<p>A point of clarification:</p>
<p><i>Indeed, some argue that using a C/R system means sending</i> unsolicited, bulk email <i>(that is, spam) to all those people whose addresses are forged in spam.</i></p>
<p>The parenthesized "(that is, spam)" had been "(challenges to forged spam)". However, the point of the criticism described is that the challenges can <i>themselves</i> be unsolicited bulk email, and hence spam. This position is particularly elucidated by Vernon Schryver in news.admin.net-abuse.email -- Google Groups for his name and "challenge-response" should be enlightening.</p>
<p>In brief, however, the position is that a C/R system which sends challenges to forged spam is akin to an open relay or an open FormMail script: it can be caused (by the spammer) to send unsolicited email to a third party (the person whose address is forged in the spam).</p>
<p>There are a number of online sources elucidating this and other problems with C/R:</p>
<p><a href="http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Rants/challenge-response.html" class="external free" title="http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Rants/challenge-response.html" rel="nofollow">http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Rants/challenge-response.html</a> <a href="http://email.about.com/cs/spamgeneral/a/challenge_resp_2.htm" class="external free" title="http://email.about.com/cs/spamgeneral/a/challenge_resp_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://email.about.com/cs/spamgeneral/a/challenge_resp_2.htm</a> <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04746.html" class="external free" title="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04746.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.politechbot.com/p-04746.html</a></p>
<p>Another issue is more theoretical: The problem of spam is basically that the burden of carrying the messages is foisted off on people who do not want them or benefit from them. (A "spammer" who only sends messages to people who <i>want</i> them isn't a spammer at all, but a legitimate mailing-list operator.) So any "solution to spam" which works by increasing the burden to people who do not benefit is no solution at all -- rather, it is a compounding of the problem of spam.</p>
<p>And this is precisely what C/R does. If you use C/R, then people who send you legitimate mail are indeed quickly whitelisted and never see another challenge. However, when someone sends you spam, your C/R system fires a challenge into the air, which falls to earth you know not where. But, since spammers forge addresses, you can be pretty sure that it is not <i>the spammer</i> who will receive your challenge. (If it were, then he could respond and send you more spam -- and C/R would not work.)</p>
<p>Who receives the challenge sent out in response to a forged spam? It is either <i>nobody</i> (in which case, no harm, no foul) or <i>an uninvolved third party</i>. In the latter case, you have laid a burden (a small one, yes) on that third party, which he has done nothing to solicit and from which he benefits not at all. If that person's email address has been forged in ten million spams, of which one million go to C/R users, then each have participated in a piecemeal mailbombing of that otherwise uninvolved forgery-victim. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 00:08, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My justification for moving "Spam tips for users" to the top of the article is simply this: a casual browser of Wikipedia (and this article in particular) would be a person interested in finding advice on how to protect his or her own personal PC from spam; therefore, he would be most interested in tips on personal spam protection.

<p>I remember once hearing about a tool to counter dictionary attacks. It worked by allowing you to send a false "address doesn't exist" email, or something to that effect, back to the spammer to make the spammer think your address didn't exist. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name. Does anyone know where to get such a program?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This doesn't sound like a very good idea.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First off, most spam does not have a valid return address -- so a falsified bounce message would not go to the spammer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, a good deal of spam has a <i>forged</i> return address -- i.e., the spammer puts <i>someone else's</i> address on the header, so your bounce message would go to an innocent victim. (You would thus be spamming that person, and you could get kicked off your ISP or your mail server put on some <a href="../../../d/n/s/DNSBL_6327.html" title="DNSBL">DNSBLs</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Third, there are better ways to detect a dictionary attack. For instance, any such attack will show up very obviously on the mail server as a lot of attempts to deliver mail to nonexistent addresses. The mail server could easily run software that parses the log files and blocks any IP address that makes a lot of such attempts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because any such software sends unsolicited bulk email (see the second point above) it would constitute <i>spamware</i> and would be illegal to distribute in several jurisdictions. Even if it were once posted for download on the Web it would be likely that people would try very hard to convince the author to take it down -- it's a bad and dangerous idea. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 01:28, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A follow-on thought: The spam problem leads a lot of people to try strange and ill-advised things like this in an effort to "do something" about the problem. Many ISPs for instance seem to want more to be <i>seen</i> as doing something about spam, rather than to actually be effective. Likewise a lot of people with some programming skill take it upon themselves to write bad and ineffective "anti-spam" software -- I can think of one example where a guy tried to write "automatic spam-reporting" software that instead managed to flood <i>uninvolved</i> ISP mailboxes and piss off a lot of people. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 01:32, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(However, if the dictionary attack is deflected by sending SMTP Error codes that refuse delivery of the attack, then these issues largely go away - this is about as good as an IP-level block (there are pluses and minuses for each).)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(Where is spamware illegal? I know it violates many ISP TOS, but that's all.) --User:67.123.76.191</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's correct -- if you reject a dictionary attack (or any other spam) by sending SMTP errors, then you aren't likely to spam uninvolved people. The problem with the original poster's proposal was precisely that it involved sending email "to the spammer" -- that is, to the poor schmuck whose email address was forged onto the spam.</dd>

<p>I've noticed some comments on China. I live in China, but I use a non-Chinese e-mail address. If I use an e-mail service from inside China, I can't e-mail a lot of people outside of China. (I've started to notice sites that seem to be blocking me too, not just the Great Firewall.) In any case, the spam problems are starting to get bad here. Part of the problem is very, very, simple. Many Chinese are not well-educated about computers, the 'net, and antivirus software. There are a lot of zombie computers in China. On the up side, even though the problem is getting worse, the Chinese are starting to notice and complain, and even if they don't make as much money per user here, there's a lot of users. A lot of complaints are starting to pile up. I think more Chinese ISPs will start sharpening up and throwing out the spammers. One can but hope. Kaerondaes</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's my understanding that some sites (chiefly hobbyists and local companies -- not large ISPs) who believe that they will never have a correspondent or customer in China simply block Chinese IP space entirely using a nation-based blocklist such as <a href="http://www.blackholes.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.blackholes.us/" rel="nofollow">blackholes.us</a>. Likewise for other nations that have had anomalously high levels of zombie and spam-haven activity, like South Korea.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One difficulty is that most anti-spam activists (the people most likely to file accurate reports of spam, and to operate public DNSBLs and other spam-blocking resources) are in the United States and Western Europe. Most do not do business with China directly, and they are (or feel) unable to get in touch with Chinese ISPs responsible for the spam-emitting netspace. The language barrier is one problem; another is the perception of China as a "black box" or monolithic bureaucracy -- whereas what few detailed reports I have seen indicate that some Chinese networks are <i>substantially</i> cleaner than others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's worth noting that Spamhaus (<i>the</i> most reputable Western anti-spam operation these days) has done some collaboration with Chinese ISPs in an effort to stem the tide of spam from China. See <a href="http://www.spamhaus.cn/" class="external free" title="http://www.spamhaus.cn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spamhaus.cn/</a> for more.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another perception I've seen on news.admin.net-abuse.email, SPAM-L, and other anti-spam forums is that Chinese hosting services are believed not to care when their sites are used to host spamvertised Web sites. This leads to what I've seen described as one stereotypical pattern of international spam crime:</dd>

<li>He hosts a Web site in <b>China</b>.</li>
<li>He buys spamming software and a list of virus-infected systems from a <b>Russian</b> (or other <b>Eastern European</b>) black-hat programmer.</li>
<li>He sends spam through these virus-infected systems, which may be located in <b>South Korea</b>, <b>China</b>, <b>Mexico</b>, <b>Brazil</b>, <b>Western Europe</b>, <b>Israel</b>, and, yes, back in <b>America</b>.</li>
<li>The spam is chiefly targeted at <b>American</b> ISP users (and is written in English), but is also sent to people all over the world.</li>
<li>The spam victims go to the Web site, and (if they are fools) buy herbal Viagra; their credit card orders are processed through <b>Western Europe</b>.</li>

<dd>Thus, the spam that Americans receive and blame on other countries is in fact perpetrated upon them by <i>American</i> spammers, who are simply doing business and crime through other countries. Likewise, I would expect that most spam Koreans get is from Korean spammers, and most spam Chinese people get is from Chinese spammers! --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:51, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've noticed that most spam i get doesn't seem to be very well targeted though, i get shitloads of spam in english that is obviously targeted at americans and a fair bit that is in languages/scripts i can't even read (chineese being the most common) but very little that is actually relavent to me as a brit. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 09:11, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to PCWorld, replying to spam asking to be removed actually works: <a href="http://pcworld.about.com/magazine/2208p107id116572.htm" class="external free" title="http://pcworld.about.com/magazine/2208p107id116572.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pcworld.about.com/magazine/2208p107id116572.htm</a> see also: <a href="http://www.zyra.org.uk/spam2a.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.zyra.org.uk/spam2a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zyra.org.uk/spam2a.htm</a></p>

<dd>Well, it depends on the spammer. In the case of "mainsleaze" spam -- spam sent by major companies, or advertising agencies working for same -- replying may indeed get you (temporarily) removed from their list (until they harvest your address again).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many spammers, however, send forged mail. Sometimes they make up a fake email address, in which case replying to the spam will get you nothing but a bounce message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And in some cases, spammers have definitely used "unsubscribe" messages or links as a confirmation that an address is read. For instance, anti-spam activists will sometimes go to an "unsubscribe" Web page and submit a brand-new, just-created, never-used email address. If that address suddenly starts getting spam, that's a good indication that the spammer was using the "unsubscribe" link fraudulently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, most anti-spam folks advise not to "unsubscribe" from anything that you didn't willingly subscribe to -- instead, report it as spam to an anti-spam service like Spamcop, or to the ISP of the host that sent it. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 22:17, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any open communication network that allows someone to send you a message will be a target of spammers. I don't believe that a new protocol will solve the problem.

<dd>I proposed (see the top of this page) to change this article title and content to cover all spam (i.e. unsolicitited bulk messages) shortly before you proposed this. I didn't make the change I proposed because just before doing so, I saw how many pages link to this one. So if you're going to move this to wikibooks, which seems like a good idea, will you title it to cover not just email? What happens to the ~50 pages that link here? An auto-redirect to wikibooks feature exists? Or will folks get here and manually click over to wikibooks, or are you prepared to take the time to edit the ~50 pages that link here to point to the new wikibooks article instead. I'll commit to doing half. -<a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvey_cfd8.html" title="User:Elvey">Elvey</a></dd>

<p>I've heard several people mention a "do not email list". Is there some reason it isn't mentioned in this article? (Is there some other article that discusses do-not-email lists?)</p>
<p>"Such a thing does not exist" is *not* a good reason for leaving it out -- if it's a hoax/myth, then it's even more important to mention it and then tell people that it is a hoax/myth.</p>
<p>The article <a href="http://ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/bluesecurity/" class="external text" title="http://ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/bluesecurity/" rel="nofollow">Enabling the Complaint Department</a> briefly mentions how <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Security_1b7b.html" title="Blue Security">Blue Security</a> uses a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-way_hash.html" title="One-way hash">one-way hash</a> to distribute their "do not email list".

<p>You are right, "do not spam" lists should be mentioned. If I recall correctly, there actually are some of those lists out there, run by people other than governments. I seem to recall that the DMA even has one.</p>
<p>There are many problems with them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hashing the email addresses does very little to protect the email addresses. Spammers will simply check their lists and see which email addresses are on it, thus creating a list of better email addresses to spam. Spammers currently do dictionary attacks via SMTP to try and determine which addresses are valid, doing a dictionary attack on a hashlist is vastly cheeper, so you can be certain they will try that. They have millions of zombied machines to do the work, so it wouldn't even cost them much.</li>
<li>Many domains will want to be able to opt-out all of the email addresses. If this is allowed, then the vast majority of all email addresses will be opted-out immediately. If this is not allowed, then doamins will simply submit all of their valid email addresses, plus all email addresses that used to be valid (since they get spam), plus all possible email addresses that could be valid in the future in order to prevent address harvesting as mentioned above. This would create many terabytes of data per domain, but that isn't the domain's problem. Even if opting out the entire domain is allowed, some domains would probably submit the trillions of possibly valid email addresses anyway, in order to detect spammers who spam the do-not-spam list.</li>
<li>Who pays for maintaining the list? If it is the spammers or the government, then you will encourage domains to submit the trillions of possibly valid email addresses. If it is the end-user, then such a list would be hugely unpopular.</li>
<li>Different people want to exclude different types of spam, and they have different ideas of what "spam" is. Would you be able to opt-out of just porn, and if so, what is the defintion of porn? Would you be able to opt-out of political emails?</li>
<li>Enforcing such an opt-out list would be very hard, making the whole effort pretty much useless.</li>
</ol>
<p>A far better system, which would solve most of these problems, would be simply to have an opt-in list, instead of an opt-out list. People who *do* want spam can simply sign up to get it.</p>

<p>The recent AfD proposal complained that this article is too much of a "how-to manual". I tend to agree and I have tried to rewrite some of it to make it better, but I don't think I made much progress. I think the article title, "stopping e-mail abuse" is part of the problem, and I think changing it to something else would help. I think some of the problem is that many of the anti-spam techniques are things that individuals must do, and since most people don't want spam, these techniques end up sounding like how-to tips rather than neutral point-of-view descriptions of the ideas.</p>
<p>I encourage people to take another stab at this article. Be bold.</p>
<p>I think that creating a wikibook is certainly a valid thing to do. It can concentrate on the how-to stuff. However, I think there should still be an encyclopedic article covering of the various techniques. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 21:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rename is OK, but how about calling it 'Anti-email-spam techniques,' since there is non email spam (e.g., in on-line forums) so specifying 'email' would make the title more accurate. Minasbeede 20:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried going to the wikipedia IRC channels and asking questions about this, but didn't get any clear answers or guidance. I *think* the standard way of doing things is to name the article, say, "anti-spam techniques". If another article needs to be created for IM spam, or blog spam or whatever, then those would either be added to this article, or a new article would be created with, say "anti-spam techniques (messaging)" and a "also see" header would be added at the top. If the other articles become popular enough, then this article would be moved to "anti-spam techniques (e-mail)" and this would be come a disambiguous page. Basically, don't worry about the general problem until there is a general problem. Thoughts? <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 04:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess the question is whether we want to have information about IM spam, blog spam, forum spam in the article. I'd rather just keep the article about email and specify that in the title to make it clear. If we include all the other types of spam then the article could become unwieldy. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 04:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I think the point is that since it is easy to rename articles and since there aren't currently articles on anti=spam techniques for IM/blog/VoIP, we don't need to worry about it right now. The important thing is to get the name changed to something that doesn't scream "This is a howto manual!". When I was on the #wikipedia IRC channel, I mentioned that I was trying to change the name from "stopping e-mail abuse" and two people (I think both admins) immediately said to delete it because howto manuals are not appropriate. 23:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If we just call it "Anti-spam techniques" how will we word the opening paragraph? It would need to define anti-spam techniques in general terms and lead us to including all types of anti-spam techniques in the article (not just email). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 04:43, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the above discussion which first suggested naming the article "Anti-email-spam techniques" then "E-mail anti-spam techniques" I think I can conclude we like the idea of including 'email' in the article title. I suggested merely renaming that to "Anti-spam techniques (e-mail)". I am going to be bold and proceed with my idea so that something happens. Feel free to change it if there are objections. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 22:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I have gone through and fixed a bunch of the redirects. "E-mail anti-spam techniques" would have made a lot of the links read nicer with less editing, but this is still much better than the earlier name. I hope others will fix up a few links also. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 03:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
