<p>Your story was great. Sorry about your daughter being upset by the misunderstanding, and about your poor ceiling though!

<p>Hi, I hope you don't mind my asking you directly for advice -- I am not sure whether this ought to be a request for mediation or arbitration. It concerns WHEELER and his contributions on the Fascism and Early National Socialism pages. First I have to admit that I have never found WHEELER to be a useful contributor -- he piles quote upon quote, all taken out of context, to prove some point of his, while wilfully misconstruing the contributions of better-informed people. I have at times argued with him over certain points of interpretation in the Fascism article (but I never felt his conduct called for any formal intervention or sanction). In any event, I am extremely disturbed by his recent comment here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Early_National_Socialism/draft" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Early_National_Socialism/draft" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Early_National_Socialism/draft</a></p>

<dd>And by the way since you want to declare a pedigree just because your relatives suffered under the Holocaust.</dd>
<dd>The Nazis also committeed atrocities on the island of Crete. My uncle, Sirodakis, was a great underground fighter. It was my island that lead a ferocious resistance to the Nazis. It was my co-religionists, Catholic priests that went to the camps as well. And it was Jewish communists that destroyed the Orthodox Church in Russia. Many a Christian died in Jewish concentration camps in Russian before the Nazis ever killed a single Jew. So don't cry buster and don't wave your victimhood in my face.WHEELER 15:43, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, as far as I can tell, AndyL has not "waved" his "victimhood" in anyone's face; nor has he claimed any special pedigree (I do remember him mentioning that he had relatives who died in the Holocause, <i>only in direct response</i> to someone who questioned his personal background). WHEELER's comment follows a disagreement between him and AndyL about the relationship between the Hungarian and Austrian National Socialist movements -- that is, it really comes out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I see no call or excuse for the claim that Jewish communists destroyed the Orthodox Church in Russia -- this simply repeats the Nazi slander equating Judaism with Bolshevism. The suggestion that Jews build and maintained concentrtation camps for killing Christians is obscene anti-Semitism. Personally I think WHEELER should be banned for this. What do you think I should do -- simply put this forward to the mediation committee, or is there some more appropriate measure? Thanks, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 17:51, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply, in effect, twice. I have some responses but I posted them in a general way to the list-serve. By the way, of the four reasons for apologizing you ask about, I'd say I meant the fourth (for insulting Jews as a group) but add, also for abusing space in Wikipedia. Anyway, I appreciate your thoughts, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<p>A few days ago, AndyL listed a request on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a> page between User:WHEELER and himself:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User%7EWHEELER_8f11.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User:WHEELER">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User:WHEELER</a> and associated TALK page. Specific complaint about his anti-Semitic comment on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Talk%7EEarly_National_Socialism_13d1.html" title="Talk:Early National Socialism">Talk:Early_National_Socialism</a> but also about his general conduct around POV editing and unencyclopedic behaviour. AndyL 05:31, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>After discussing the matter with <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a>, it seems that the first step is to identify one or more members of the committee who are willing to mediate in this case, although before proceeding it will be necessary to clarify the goals of the mediation.</p>
<p>And just FYI, there has also been quite a bit of chatter on the WikiEN mailing list about similar issues.</p>
<p>If you are willing to act as the mediator in this case, please leave a brief note stating so at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html#User:AndyL_and_User:WHEELER" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation#User:AndyL_and_User:WHEELER</a>. The more people who are willing to mediate, the better, as this will provide more options for the two users to try to agree on.</p>

<p>Hi Ant -</p>
<p>You graciously refused my donation of CDN$10 to could meet with Jimbo and Angela, and told me to go away to the mountains. I work in them for the time, and have created a <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_Wildflowers_of_the_Canadian_Rocky_Mountains_7fab.html" title="User:Dwindrim/Wildflowers of the Canadian Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountain wildflowers</a> page. You are the first to see it; it still requires text for each of the flowers (created but yet to be placed), and there are a number of flowers which have not bloomed yet, so this is still an article in the works. ("Snowsnake" does not belong here either, it not being a wildflower, but rather a mythical beast. However, as you can see, 'mythical' often springs from 'I saw one once'.)</p>
<p>I'm glad you made it to Paris, and I always enjoy reading your comments on the mailing lists. I wish I had your talent for NPOV!</p>

<p>Yes, that was accidental, I was in edit mode when 172 protected the page... it actually should have come up as an edit conflict, don't know why it didn't.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think you should reinstate my edit since it was not an edit to content but to formatting. ie I replaced a ")" with a "]]" reversing an edit mistake I made a few minutes before. By reverting my edit you've destroyed the image that's supposed to be in the article. AndyL 02:07, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Probably not but I think Sam would look a bit silly filing an RfC against me for a making formatting edit that corrects one of my own mistakes:) AndyL 02:18, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

Looking at your Wikipedia articles, I imagine that perhaps you would interested to help me to create a Wikiproject about <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_currency.html" title="Local currency">Community Currencies</a>, (would be interesting to connect with EcoRegions) so to share a knowledge space about this item on Wikipedia..</p>

<p>From the deletion log:</p>
<ul>
<li>16:33, 8 Sep 2004 Michael Snow deleted "Genuine Progress Indicator" (article created by banned user)</li>
<li>19:16, 9 Sep 2004 Anthere restored "Genuine_Progress_Indicator"</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps unfortunately, the software does not call for an explanation when restoring a page the way it does for deletions. I would have thought that if you thought my deletion was inappropriate, the normal way to handle that is through <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>. In any case, at the very least I should have been informed of the undeletion and the reason for it (see <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">Wikipedia:Undeletion policy</a>). Accordingly, I am requesting that explanation from you now. Also, in this situation the undeletion policy calls for the page to immediately be listed on VfD, which I have done. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:43, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if being overly formal about this was disturbing. It's just that in previous disagreements over how to handle the overall EntmootsOfTrolls problem, people have objected that procedure wasn't being followed in blocking, and I'm trying to show that I want to work this out within our existing policies. Also, it's simply a personality flaw on my part.</dd>

<dd>You may be right that votes for undeletion would not have served the purpose well. However, I still think I should have been entitled to be informed of the undeletion. I didn't see your message on the article talk page until later, and wasn't sure what to make of it (anyway, why would I expect to find something on the talk page of an article I thought was deleted?). What I might suggest, perhaps, is that we delete this article and create a new one under the same name without restoring the history. I think I could take a stab at writing at least a reasonable stub.

<p>G'day Anthere</p>
<p>I read your comments opposing my proposal to remove user subpage discussions from VfD. I agree with you completely that the user should be contacted before any such listing. That's a core issue addressed by this proposal, and one of my main reasons for making it. Under the current system, there is no such requirement. Under this proposal, there is. Or have I missed something here? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:57, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, and your offer to let me remove your vote, but I really can't do that!</p>
<p>What I'd most like is for you to take a good look at the proposal. The vote ends this Sunday, and it looks most unlikely that consensus will be reached. Current voting is almost tied, and the last person to vote against had some ideas that could be incorporated into the proposal. So I think we will go back to discussion. Something should happen, but not this. I'm hopeful that this time we will actually get some discussion, and some people other than me working on the proposal! If we don't then this time it will lapse. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 01:15, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>If we find it too problematic to block banned users (Michael on AOL, the Halifax range-block), and we decide to allow "good" edits by banned users, what does it actually mean for somebody to be banned at all? It would seem to me that by this, they end up being given the same status as everyone else - after all, "bad" edits from anyone should be reverted or fixed, should they not?</p>

<p>Anthere, I very much enjoyed chatting with you in IRC, and I thank you for your valuable advice.

I'd hoped to say good-bye "in person" on IRC; since that <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_A_farewell_from_Snowspinner_0ce1.html" title="User:Orthogonal/A farewell from Snowspinner">won't be possible</a>, I'll doing it here.</p>

<p>Merci bien pour ton message, et ton email, Anthère.&#160;:) When I spent all my time on wikipedia I was quite ill, and it was a way of keeping myself busy, and sane.

<p>I can't believe you voted for me! How very nice.. To be honest, as much as I appreciate each vote (even the sockpuppet&#160;;) I appreciate yours most, mainly because I'm not sure how I deserve it. All I can think of is the time I was rude to you, and how much I regret it now... All I can say to excuse myself was that I was quite angry, and that I didn't mean to be hurtful, only rude&#160;:S In any case I extend my sincerest apologies, and gratitude, and I want you to know I think you are very kind.

<p><br />
A professor is holding a time-management course for managers. Without speaking a word, he puts a big glass on the table. (the managers look interrested) He takes some stones from the floor next to him, and puts them in the glass, until it is full. He asks the Managers "Is this glass full?" The managers say "yes"! Then the professor takes a bag of sand from the floor next to him, and puts it on the stones, until the glass is full. He asks again "Is this glass full?" One manager dares to say "...no?" The professor takes a glass of water, an puts it over the stones and sand, until the glass is full.</p>
<p>The professor asks "What do we learn from this?"</p>
<p>One manager tries after some time: "...that we can always put in our schedule more apointments, even if it is already full...?"</p>
<p>The professor then says: "If you put in first all the small stones, you will afterwards never get the big stones into the glass. The same is for the small and the really important things in your life..."</p>

<li>Dear Anthere, I liked to answer you at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Anthere" class="extiw" title="meta:User_talk:Anthere">meta:User talk:Anthere</a> but due to havy traffic or due to another reason the page is broken.</li>
<li>What I tried to point out in a previous e-mail is that I am not aware of different <i>areas of personal interest</i> of different contrinutors to Wikipedia. I should not talk to a person interesed in bees about different spelling of the name of one of the most important geographers of Middle adge as <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Idrisi_e9fb.html" title="Muhammad al-Idrisi">Muhammad al-Idrisi</a>. To find out different spellings in used actualy in Wikipedias in different languages <b>I spend 8 hours</b>.</li>
<li>To reaslise how diffcult it is to make <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:InterWiki" class="extiw" title="meta:Wikipedia:InterWiki">Meta:Wikipedia:InterWiki</a> links for a person like <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Lu%C3%ADs_Vives_26f4.html" title="Juan Luís Vives">Juan Luís Vives</a> one of the main humanists of Middle age writing also <i>De institutione feminae christianae (1523)</i> see <i>Berthe Vadier, Un Moraliste du XVIieme siècle: Jean-Louis Vives et son livre de l'éducation de la femme chrétienne (Geneva, 1892)</i> it takes hours too.</li>
<li>Both issues addressed at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html#indications_about_bibliographic_item.28s.29_.28see_Catalog.29" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)#indications about bibliographic item(s) (Catalog)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29#meta_name.3D.22KEYWORDS.22_content.3D.22....22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29#meta_name.3D.22KEYWORDS.22_content.3D.22....22" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)#meta name="KEYWORDS" content="..."</a> (<i>about how to handle many spelling variants and to achive top rankings at search engins listings</i>) are maybe posted at a pleace not having the interest of involved people.</li>
<li>The litte feedback I received until now about Bibliographical names points out that this would be a greather project. But how and where to start it?

<p>I am a new user. If I understand the history correctly, you established the soil science page on June 25, 2002 and set it to redirect to the pedology article. Would you object if I reworked the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedology.html" title="Pedology">pedology</a> article to be consistent with the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pedology" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pedology" rel="nofollow">wiktionary definition</a>, with pedology being the branch of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Soil_science" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Soil_science" rel="nofollow">soil science</a> that deals with <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Soil_genesis" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Soil_genesis" rel="nofollow">soil genesis</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Soil_classification" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Soil_classification" rel="nofollow">soil classification</a>?</p>
<p>I understand that pedology means literally the same thing as soil science. I am also aware that several individual field soil scientists in the United States have preferred being introduced as pedologists to distinguish themselves from agronomists, geologists, geographers, sanitarians and engineers who opportunistically represent themselves as soil scientists, but who in fact have only minimal soil science training and experience. I am also aware that the term <i>soil science</i> doesn't translate as easily as the term <i>pedology</i>, and that some national soil science societies have chosen to call themselves pedological societies.</p>
<p>Despite the above I find very persuasive considerations in support of clarifying pedology as being one of several branches within the soil sciences. Most soil scientists known to me are not enthusiastic with the pedology term as a comprehensive term for soil science. Practice in the pure science aspects of soil chemistry, soil physics and soil minerology are particularly difficult to define as branches of pedology. Furthermore, the ascendancy of the International Union of Soil Sciences (<a href="../../../i/u/s/IUSS_4c55.html" title="IUSS">IUSS</a>) has made <i>soil science</i> the clearly preferable term.</p>
<p>I maintain my certification as a professional soil classifier, so I can certainly appreciate that soil science would not be what it is (a robust discipline independent of geology, agriculture or the biological sciences) if it wasn't for pedology. Pedology is the single most important and defining branch of soil science. I certainly can't fault anyone who defends promoting pedology as the preferred term. I just think that the world has moved on beyond the 1970's and 1980's, a time when pedology quite possibly could have supplanted soil science as the preferred term.</p>

<p>Hello Paleorthid.</p>
<p>Yes, I started this article, at the same time of <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_sciences.html" title="Agricultural sciences">agricultural sciences</a>, which we rather call agronomy in my country. At that time, the encyclopedia was entirely empty with regards to soil science and agri sciences. I remember that at that time someone complained that the word pedology was too much "jargon", but I must admit that I stick to it, precisely for the reasons you seem to mention. These were not as clear in my mind, but indeed, what I was willing to discuss was more about "hard soil science".</p>
<p>Your arguments seem okay to me. Indeed, when I studied, my class was called soil sciences, and had a rather large meaning. While the lab where I later worked was a pedology lab. Hmmm, of course, yes, you are most welcome to rework all those. Especially since rather few editors have work on them (there was a lot of work done on soil life). I have no time any more to work on articles this year, but I sure am glad that my favorite fields are taken care of&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Additionaly, would you be interested in working on soil classification&#160;? I would love it for the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecoregion.html" title="Ecoregion">ecoregion</a> project... (my little pet project...)</p>

<p>That gave me a bit of a chuckle. How old did you think I was? How "young" do you think I look?

<dd>Well, 30 is nearer the mark than 45. But since our demographics are decidedly skewed towards a younger crowd, maybe I'm mildly surprised that people would assume I was that old - not that 45 is old. Even 30 is well above the median contributor age I would think. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 00:33, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
