<p>The article begins by saying that "Negri is perhaps best-known for his co-authorship of <i>Empire</i> and his work on Spinoza.". However, further on in the article, only <b>one line</b> mentions a possible (weak) tie between a (late) work by Negri (<i>Time for Revolution</i>) and Spinoza... To the best of my knowledge, professor Negri is famous for a) his political activities and b) a book on globalization. I see no evidence whatsoever in this article (or anywhere else) that Negri's work on Spinoza is significant. Even his work as a philosopher in general may be questionable -although I really can't elaborate on this. Any philosophers listening here? (In lack of competent contribution, I will modify the article incipit to make it sound realistic instead of merely hagiographic) Dpianelli 07:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think his work on Spinoza is reasonably significant (I would say it is his most significant work for an academic, rather than political, audience). His <i>The Savage Anomoly</i> and <i>Subversive Spinoza</i> are often cited as examples of (post-)Marxist interest in Spinoza (along with <a href="../../../e/t/i/Etienne_Balibar_3b6d.html" title="Etienne Balibar">Etienne Balibar</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Montag_3797.html" title="Warren Montag">Warren Montag</a>). It might be good to add a section on his philosophy, including the Spinoza books, <i>Insurgencies</i> and a discussion of the philosophical background to <i>Empire</i> and <i>Multitude</i>. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 06:31, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely concur with <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a>—Negri's work on Spinoza is indeed very significant among contemporary engagements with Spinoza. In response to Dpianelli's comments: Negri might be noteworthy for his activism and for his works (in the plural—he and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Hardt_3775.html" title="Michael Hardt">Michael Hardt</a> have written <i>three</i> books on globalization as of February 2007, when I write this), but he also is indeed one of the important Continental philosophers of the latter half of the twentieth century. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJob_L_9b21.html" title="User:Job L">Job L</a> 08:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think Negri's work on Spinoza is important, and can substantiate such belief via references and documentation, please go ahead. Just stating that he is "one of the important Continental philosophers of the latter half of the twentieth century" will take us nowhere near to a credible encyclopedia entry, I am afraid.

<p>I recently tagged the final sections of the article—those providing bibliographic information on books and articles by and about Negri—as needing cleanup. I don't have the time myself to take this on right now, although I'll try to get to it soon if nobody else has time either. Specifically, these sections need, in my opinion, to be revised in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Style and content</b> of entries should be consistent throughout all entries, in all the bibliographic sections. In other words, we should agree whether to separate bibliographic items (author, title, publisher, etc.) by commas or periods, whether to list the place of publication as well as the publisher, etc.</li>
<li><b>ISBNs</b> should be added wherever appropriate in order to honor the Wikipedia convention of providing library-style links to resources. (There's probably an official name for this convention, but I can't recall it right now—sorry.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, I'll try to get started on this soon, but as I'm a graduate student and the end of the semester is rapidly approaching, time is at a premium for me right now. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJob_L_9b21.html" title="User:Job L">Job L</a> 18:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Toni Negri is operating on too high an intellectual level for labels like "postmodernism" to be relevant (certainly the influence of Foucault on his work is far too complicated for it to be a question of 'being postmodern,' whatever that means, or not. Does anyone have a source for his 'dismissal of postmodernism'? Mgasner 06:30, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How is Negri's "intellectual level" "too high" for postmodernism to be a relevant category of analysis? On the contrary, <i>Empire</i> (co-authored with Michael Hardt) makes it clear that contemporary Empire (the authors' term for global sovereignty) is a postmodern phenomenon not to be confused with the nation-state sovereignty of modernity. Negri is not a "postmodernist" in the same sense that, say, Jean Baudrillard is, but he <b>is</b> a sort of postmodernist in that he analyzes globalization as occuring during the postmodern period.</p>
<p>The "dismissal of postmodernism" can be found in <i>Empire</i>, section 2.4 (pp. 137-56). <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJob_L_9b21.html" title="User:Job L">Job L</a> 22:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that someone (unfortunately, an unregistered user who gave no explanation for his or her editorial decision) has recently deleted the link to the "critical interview" with Negri published in the London <i>Independent</i>. Although I for one consider that interview to be in no way a fair assessment of Negri's work, I'm not sure that it deserves to be cut from the article. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJob_L_9b21.html" title="User:Job L">Job L</a> 06:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone has yet again removed the link to the <i>Independent</i> interview—and there is still no justification given for this editorial decision. <b>If</b> a <b>consensus</b> is reached regarding this interview, <b>then and only then</b> should it finally be removed. I have two questions for anyone interested in helping maintain the quality of this page:</p>
<p>1. What do other people think about including or omitting the link to the interview under question?</p>
<p>2. <b>Why</b> is this link continually removed? Would whoever keeps removing it please provide a rationale so that the rest of us can actually evaluate the decision to remove it? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJob_L_9b21.html" title="User:Job L">Job L</a> 23:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>update: Should be a <i>bit</i> better now that I have cleaned it up, albeit slightly. Still needs a ton of work.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't like the tone of this article. It is so laudatory that it could have been written By Mr Negri himself.</p>
<p>The article fails to give a clear idea about the charges held against Negri, about the climate of violence instigated by "Autonomia" in Italian society, and at Padova University in particular, and Negri's responsibilities in this regard.</p>
<p>The article does not explain why Negri was condemned to 17 years' imprisonment, and tries to give the impression that he was simply persecuted for being "an intellectual".giordaano212.190.74.28 15:43, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>..............</p>
<p>"Potere Operaio disbanded in 1973 and gave rise to the Autonomia group."</p>
<p>Autonomia wasn't a group, so much as a network of groups. Potere Operaio didn't 'give rise' to Autonomia - that is to vastly overemphasise their importance at the time. It would be more accurate to say that "Potere Operaio dissolved into Autonomia in 1973."</p>
<p>"Antonio Negri was arrested along with the others leaders of Autonomia"</p>
<p>Autonomia was a deeply heterogenous network of organisations, and didn't have leaders.</p>
<p>As for the comments on his trial/violence, It would also be far too broad and historically innacurate to also tag 'autonomia' as a whole as 'instigating a climate of violence.'</p>
<p>I think the article gives 'the impression that Negri was persecuted' because this is what happened in his case. But some more details on this couldn't hurt.</p>

<p>I have just tagged a statement that alludes rather vaguely to some critiques of <i>Empire</i>. The sentence needs to cite sources and, even better, to provide examples of the "activists and scholars" who critique the work. As the sentence stands right now, it implies that most or even all of the activists and scholars under question unanimously criticize Hardt and Negri. I can't speak for the activists that the sentence names, but as a scholar working in globalization studies I can attest that academics are by no stretch of the imagination universally dismissive of Hardt and Negri. On the contrary, although they are also not universally lauded, Hardt and Negri's <i>Empire</i> stands as a watershed event for critical globalization studies, at least within English departments and related fields. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJob_L_9b21.html" title="User:Job L">Job L</a> 01:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Antonio Negri is considered, by a good part of the Italian political establishment and culture, as the prototype of the "cattivi maestri" (evil schoolmasters), i.e. those who, while not personally indulging in violent acts, encouraged and helped organizing the extreme left wing's recourse to political violence in the 60ies-70ies in Italy.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale,Padova University, and his University Institute in particular, became notorious for the rampages of "Autonomia", the beatings (including of Professors) and a general climate of violence and insecurity.</p>
<p>There is little or no trace of this in this article, which gives simply the impression that Negri was wrongly persecuted, for reasons difficult to explain (for being an intellectual - as Foucault apparently said&#160;?)<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiordaano_2952.html" title="User:Giordaano">Giordaano</a> 16:02, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed some details. Once again, the article is still so laudatory that it seems written by Mr Negri himself, or by a close friend<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiordaano_2952.html" title="User:Giordaano">Giordaano</a> 17:01, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please, be serious. No one exiled Toni Negri. He fled to France in order to avoid having to sit his prison sentence.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiordaano_2952.html" title="User:Giordaano">Giordaano</a> 22:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tazmaniacs is convinced that Negri was persecuted. That he went into "exile", then wrote while "in captivity", that his friends are "famous autonomists".</p>
<p>This is all extremely partial, and aims at glorifying Negri's figure. While Tazmaniacs is clearly an admirer of Negri, he should realize that his figure is controversial (to say the least), and that a more objective portrayal should be worked out.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiordaano_2952.html" title="User:Giordaano">Giordaano</a> 11:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
