<p>The following quotes removed as irrelevant.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Heute gestohlen, morgen in Polen" ("Stolen today, tommorow in Poland") — modern German saying"
<ul>
<li>The say describes a real experience of voluminous car theft, a sad fact, but have nothing to do with polonophobia. It is unlucky that Poland lay on the route of stolen cars from Deutschland to Soviet Union. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:29, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A hen is not a bird, Poland is not abroad." — 18th-century Russian saying, justifying the Partitions of Poland.
<ul>
<li>The saying has no "hidden agenda" against Poland, just as it does not have a hidden agenda against chicken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:29, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first one is a stereotype of Poles being thieves (I am sorry to hear you are under the influence of the stereotype) The second denies Poland sovereignty, and tries to portay it as part of Russia.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 18:34, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The stereotype has its grounds. And I am not under influence. I was robbed by Poles eight (!) times during one year when I was a lecturer in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politechnika_Bialostocka_1f9b.html" title="Politechnika Bialostocka">Politechnika Bialostocka</a>. The reason is simple: it is on the bus route from railway/bus station to the huge flea market frequented by Belarussian peddlers, so naturally this bus line was frequented by thieves an thugs. The same with car theft. Poland was on a convenient car smuggler route, and the say does not portray <b>all</b> Poles as thieves. It reflects statistics. Or you are going to claim that equal number of stolen cars landed in France? 19:07, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sovereighty: So what? It (i.e., absence of sov..ty) was a historical fact. Nations conquered each other all the time. Russia conquered Komi, Mordvins, Tuva, etc. We don't look for anti-Mordvinism in this fact. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:07, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"The stereotype has its grounds. " I am sure Germans and Russians don't rob people or commit crimes like those Poles...</p>
<ul>
<li>I am sure that Germans don't steal cars in Poland. I am sure that Russian mafia operates in Poland.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:48, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"Or you are going to claim that equal number of stolen cars landed in France? " Actually they were stolen by Russian gangs and landed in Russia from what I know. Yet there is no German saying that "Your car is in Russia." --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 19:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You are mistaken here. (1) Russian gangs have perfect logistics support from Polish. (2) The destination was only well known in Germany. Have you ever been at a used car market in <a href="../../../s/z/c/Szczecin.html" title="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>? In my times 90% of sellers were Deutsch, 80% of buyers were Russki. There was an interesting small business of fake Polish license plates flourishing because 99% of all cars with German transit license plates were mugged on Polish highways between on their way from Germany to Belarus-&gt;Russia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:48, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Russian peasants (a source of all Russian folklore) did not persecute Poles in Poland" That would be very difficult because they were scarcely any Russian peasents on the territory of Poland, the main Russian population were soldiers and tsars administration. However in Russia persecution of Poles and negative stereotypes of them existed contrary to your belief, from link in the main article(I urge you to read it and links before commenting): <a href="http://www.acls.org/crn/network/ebook_gatagova_paper2.doc" class="external free" title="http://www.acls.org/crn/network/ebook_gatagova_paper2.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.acls.org/crn/network/ebook_gatagova_paper2.doc</a> "In Russian national consciousness, the image of the Pole as one from a foreign religion was formed long ago. The Pole's everyday behavior and his clothes were perceived as signs of his Catholic affiliation. Moreover, the Catholic was associated with dark powers. Because in the folk sphere the reflection of historical reality is very often transferred into the unconscious level, the complex, centuries-long history of Russian –Polish coexistence have "accumulated" a great mass of myths and legends. These unceasingly feed the dangerously antagonistic relations between the two peoples. Here are some small examples of folk creativity expressing negative stereotypes from one side: "The Polock is a cursed soul" "cursed unbelievers" "dishonest Polocks."" " Anti-polish sentiment gripped the peasant masses to a lesser extent, than it did the educated classes. However, in the common people also, Polonophobia was very noticeable. In any case, when a wave of fires swept over the western provinces of the empire in 1865 (soon after the rebellion), many anonymous letters and various kinds of rumors arose about the crafty schemes of the Poles. From all areas, mass accusations of arson poured out against the Poles. Their motivations seemed unconvincing. Nevertheless. all the "accusers" agreed that it was essential to severely/cruelly cut off the "criminal intentions" of yesterday's insurgent rebels. Here is one of many examples: in 1865, in Novoarkhangelsk settlement in Kherson province, a few insignificant fires too place. Local authorities with the total support of the population placed the blame for what had happened on two Poles: the officer Leshchinsky (who was on indefinite leave) and his fifteen-year-old son. In September of 1866 a major fire burned about 600 houses in the city of Serdobsk in Saratov province; there also, exiled Poles were found to be "guilty." They were saved from violent reprisals only by speedy transit by urgent convoy to another place. A later inquiry revealed the Poles had absolutely no involvement in the setting of the fires. In Saratov itself, something resembling the "Doctor's Plot" was initiated. The following very serious accusation was directed at three doctors of Polish decent who had worked in the Alexander Hospital: "The treatment of lower ranking officials has turned out to be completely careless and even intentionally incorrect, following the dangerous way of thinking of the Polish doctors Krasovsky, Rudkovsky, and Malakhovsky, the antagonistic feelings of whom towards the Russians have aroused the censure of military authorities and local society." The fears of Polish spies, arsonists and poisoners that was being whipped up by rumor aroused the residents of Moscow to form a home [national] guard (!). Multiple manifestations of Polonophobia were noted even in private life. For example, in Petersburg, the wife of the collegiate assessor Iurevich demanded that her husband be separated from her four minor children, asserting that her spouse "as a Pole tries to develop in them enemy feelings towards Russians."</p>

It does say about Molotv-ribbentrop Pact, so what? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> - As for the people who want to or attempt to rewrite history, to disparage the importance of this event and the important of the Soviet Union and the Red Army, the Soviet Army, in the victory over Nazism, we understand the events that this is connected with. For example, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is often mentioned, which resulted in a pact between Soviet Russia, the Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany, and the subsequent annexation of the Baltic States.</p>
<p>What can one say about this? Everything needs to be seen in the context of historic events. And I would ask you to return to the events of September 1938, when agreements were made between Nazi Germany and western European countries, which later went down in history as the “Munich pact”.</p>
<p>I would also remind you that these agreements were signed by the western allies: Daladier, I believe, from France and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and on the other side by Mussolini and Hitler himself.</p>
<p>The Soviet-German document was signed on a much lower level – on the level of foreign ministers – one year later, in response to the treaty signed by the western countries, which is now called the “Munich pact”. I would also remind you – and for you as Slovaks, this is probably especially important: as a result of the Munich pact, Czechoslovakia was handed over to Nazi Germany, and the western partners, as it were, showed Hitler where he should go to fulfil his growing ambitions – to the East. To protect its interests and security on its western borders, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Germany.</p>
<p>If we look at the problem in this context, it looks quite different. And I would recommend new historians, or rather those who want to rewrite history, to learn to read books before they rewrite or write them. Please stick to the topic of the article: existing or alleged anti-Polonism.

<p><i>==== Anti-Polonism in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> ====</i></p>
<p>{{Sectfact}}{{POV-section}}</p>
<p><i>Antipolish sentiments persist in Germany.</i></p>
<p><i>===== Rudi Pawelka =====</i></p>
<p><i>Poland is accused by some groups of having caused <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Rudi Pawelka the president of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preu%C3%9Fische_Treuhand_ed4f.html" title="Preußische Treuhand">Preußische Treuhand</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Association_of_Silesia_c63f.html" title="Territorial Association of Silesia">Territorial Association of Silesia</a> in his speech made in <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg.html" title="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> blamed the outburst of the war on, in his opinion, acts of aggression committed by Poles during the period 1918-1938.</i></p>
<p><i>===== German courts and Polish language and culture =====</i></p>
<p><i>German courts have not only forbidden divorced Polish-speaking parents to teach their children Polish, but also voiced objections to raising them in Polish culture, claiming that to do so would be harmful to their development.<a href="http://newsweek.redakcja.pl/wydania/artykul.asp?Artykul=12799" class="external autonumber" title="http://newsweek.redakcja.pl/wydania/artykul.asp?Artykul=12799" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://zeus.zeit.de/text/2004/43/Ehestreit" class="external autonumber" title="http://zeus.zeit.de/text/2004/43/Ehestreit" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</i> In addition they have been cases were Polish workers have been ordered by their employers to talk in German during their private time outside of work.</p>
<p><i>===== German media's portrayal of Poland =====</i></p>
<p><i>Another example of anti-Polish bias in the German media is the "Harald Schmidt Show." The highlights of this extremely popular program are insulting "jokes" about Poles, Polish culture and Poland. Harald Schmidt, who exploits antipolish views and stereotypes that a few decades earlier accompanied German crimes of genocide against the Polish people, such as supposed inferior intellect or natural criminality of Poles, has received the Bambi viewers' choice award, the Grimme Award, the Golden Camera, and the Golden Lion as best show host.</i></p>
<p><i>===== Florian Illies =====</i></p>
<p><i>Florian Illies, a former journalist with the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and best-selling author, also cashes in on a clear anti-Polish bias, with jokes on the Polish language and cleaners. Incidentally, Illies actively supported a motion to reanimate name the name of "Preußen" (Prussia) for a new German federal state to be formed by a merger of the capital Berlin with Brandenburg; hostility towards Poland had been one of the political cornerstones of historical Prussia <a href="http://www.perlentaucher.de/feuilletons/2002-02-16.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perlentaucher.de/feuilletons/2002-02-16.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>===== German constitution and politics =====</i></p>
<p><i>German constitution grants German citizenship to Polish-born persons if their ancestors were Germans citizens living on German territory as of 1937. In addition radical German organisations expressing anti-Polish views(blaming Poles for WWII), are visited on regular basis by leading CDU and CSU politicians <a href="http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/gazeta/wydanie_040518/publicystyka/publicystyka_a_7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/gazeta/wydanie_040518/publicystyka/publicystyka_a_7.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></i></p>

<li>"German constitution grants German citizenship to Polish-born persons if their ancestors were Germans citizens living on German territory as of 1937."

<p><b>Further, it is never asserted that such policies (if in fact they are policies) differ substantially from the treatment given Turks, Arabs etc.</b> Are the Poles singled out or this a general tendency toward homogenization (which, ultimately, the larger German society is free to pursue)? Poles have a long tradition in Germany of persecution and antipolish feelings are expressed on regular basis in Germany.In the past they have led to murder by Germans of 6milion Polish citizens.See previous talk.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 19:53, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really think the last point is important. It isn't Anti-Polonism if it occurs across the board with minorities, any more than Japanese attitudes are anti-Koreanism (xenophobic yes, but toward virtually every foreign group). I know, for instance, third-generation Turks cannot become Germans. So please prove the above points and attempt to show their notability vis-a-vis other groups. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:59, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>"<i>Poland is accused by some groups of having caused World War II.</i>" Has never been verified and is as ridiculous as accusing Poland for it would be. The sentence's origin lies in the (false) assumption that Rudi Pawelka did so, and because he is in the Preußische Treuhand and the Territorial Association of Silesia, Molobo alleged that these organizations, too, accuse Poland of having caused World War II.

The discussion continues also elsewhere, for example on Alx-pl's talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alx-pl#Rudi|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alx-pl#Rudi|" rel="nofollow">here</a> and one paragraph below). A good summary of the disputed part of Rudi's speech has recently been put by Alx into the article: "Rudi Pawelka the president of the Preußische Treuhand and the Territorial Association of Silesia in his speech made in Nuremberg said that the strained situation before the war was partly due to the acts of aggression committed by Poles during the period 1918-1938." What remains questionable is whether this mention is not a bit blown out of all context.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 14:07, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think it is substantially blown out of context. Overall I would assume that Pawelka does have an anti-Polish sentiment - as one may suspect from someone heading up one of the organizations associated with expellees from the area. However, as <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertreibung" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertreibung" rel="nofollow">de:Vertreibung</a> points out, the influence of those organizations has been diminishing over time. People like Pawelka are often referred to in Germany as "Ewiggestrige" <a href="http://www.wdr.de/themen/politik/deutschland/preussische_treuhand/index.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wdr.de/themen/politik/deutschland/preussische_treuhand/index.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (which translates as "political die-hard"). Such people hardly reflect common opinion in Germany.</dd>
<dd>As stated above, Pawelka does not blame the outburst of war on Poland; he definitely does not do it in the referenced speech. So the association made in the article is incorrect. Groeck 17:11, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In my opinion all these assertions without <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument.html" title="Argument">arguments</a> like links or clear facts make your comments seem 'certain that your beliefs are right and that others should accept them, without paying attention to evidence or other opinions' (quoted the definition of the word 'dogmatic' from an OUP dictionary).

<dd>Hopefully not! The "facts" mentioned in this article are simply wrong. At that point I agree with you, NightBeast. During this discussion I tried to point out, even if Molobo does not want to face the truth, that there are several Poles, me included, who completely disagree with this article. Molobo only gives sources, whose seriosity or/and neutrality are disputed. And he is not the only one. When you look at this discussion you'll realize that the links to the sources often start with www.google.de/... . If I brought sources like that in a text written for University, my Professors would kill me for that. So, if you want to give sources, give us real and neutral ones. I'm pretty sure you can't find any, Molobo. Best Greetings, Micha.</dd>

How much support did those claims have? Huh? You alone. Okay, it's obvious Space Cadet and Witkacy would support you there if you simply tell them to do so. The only paragraph which had support was 'German Polish Friendship', written by Alx-pl. Apart from me, Bayerischermann supported it. Ironically it was the only paragraph deleted by you, because you "question if such thing exists at all." Only Anti-Polonism does exist, right? Of course we have to acknowledge that Molobo's point of view is more important than those of others, do we not? And once no one sees a need to have the last word but just doesn't reply, they have lost the discussion, which is then "resolved", isn't it? Anyway. What I listed above are not "self-repeating allegations" that "have been resolved before on talk", but what remains of the 'Anti-Polonism in Germany today'-section with reasons for their deletion on the basis of previous discussions, and links to the relevant parts of the talk page.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 18:21, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The referenced article is from a 1989 professorial dissertation. The cited chapter reviewes conservative novels written in the late 19th and the early 20th century, specifically novels which contributed to and culminated in Nazi ideology. Anti-polish sentiment is mentioned in the review of novels written by Paul Schreckenbach early in the 20th century. One should, however, keep in mind that the review concentrates much more on Scheckenbach's attacks against the catholic church. In respect to Poland, the review concludes: "<i>In der imperialistischen Haltung, besonders gegenüber Polen, verbinden sich preußisch-konservative und völkische Interessen</i>", which I would translate with "His imperialistic attitude, particularly towards Poland, combines Prussian-conservative and nationalist interests".

<ul>
<li>Bad jokes. A good example is the Harald Schmidt show. In reality, bad jokes about one's neighbor are very common in Germany. <i>Neighbor</i> may mean the neighboring state (or country), or even the neighboring city. That does not indicate an Anti-anything prejudice. It is just bad jokes. Also, based on Schmidt's jokes, Germans are also Anti-Catholic, Anti-Japanese, Anti-East-Germans, Anti-Women, Anti-Bavarian (Bavaria is a German state), and so on. Germans must be Anti-Everything, I guess.
<dl>
<dd>However Germans didn't use such stereotypes to exterminate East Germans, Bavarian or women in specific.Jokes that Harald Schmidt uses are repeat of stereotypes that have led to mass murder of 6 milion Polish citizens and destruction of Poland and the fact that he is awarded for them certainly speaks something about German society if only about the lack of awarness of those German atrocities towards Poland, if not about the lack of will to know about them.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 12:16, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. First, your statements are POV. If mentioned in the article, sources would have to be provided, and different views would have to be discussed as well.

<dd>One should say "by German propaganda" and provide correct context, i.e., who used it, and when it was used. Russians, for example, were also declared "subhuman" by Nazi propaganda. From the references I could find, the term was used by Nazis for Eastern Europeans in general, not (just) for Polish people, and even for sick and handicapped people.

TOP + - "To avoid mistakes which might subsequently occur in the selection of subjects suitable for 'Germanization,' the RuSHA [The Race and Settlement Head Office] in 1942 distributed a pamphlet, The Sub-Human, to those responsible for that selection. 3,860,995 copies were printed in German alone and it was translated into Greek, French, Dutch, Danish, Bulgarian, Hungarian and Czech and seven other languages. It stated: + - The sub-human, that biologically seemingly complete similar creation of nature with hands, feet and a kind of brain, with eyes and a mouth, is nevertheless a completely different, dreadful creature. He is only a rough copy of a human being, with human-like facial traits but nonetheless morally and mentally lower than any animal. Within this creature there is a fearful chaos of wild, uninhibited passions, nameless destructiveness, the most primitive desires, the nakedest vulgarity. Sub-human, otherwise nothing. For all that bear a human face are not equal. Woe to him who forgets it." 1 The Nazis acknowledged that among the sub-humans, (especially among their leaders) there were those few who had obvious traces of Aryan-Nordic ancestry; however, it was decided that most of these people would have to be destroyed in order to leave the inferior races without leadership. It was possible that some of these superior people could be "germanized" -- but if not, one should at least preserve the good blood in their children. By this logic, many thousands of Polish children were subjected to a racial test. Those who had what Nazis defined as "Aryan" characteristics -- such as blue eyes, blond hair, a properly proportioned head, good behavior and above average intelligence -- were kidnapped from their parents and shipped to Germany for ultimate adoption by appropriate German families.

<p>I already provided information on polls in regards to German societies attitude towards Polish people.Please read talk carefully in the future Alx: "In the opinion polls about various nationalities, Poles rank lower than Turks or Russians, and 87 percent of young Germans regard them as "worse than themselves."(17) In popular TV programs, Poles are presented the way blacks were presented in the American press half a century ago."

<dl>
<dd>Dear Molobo, no one questions the fact that there is an anti-Polish sentiment among Germans. Every poll I know indicates that. You cite one of the polls. However it is not what I asked for. I asked you about polls that indicate that the <b>statement by Pawelka</b> is a commonly shared opinion and the statement reads as
<dl>
<dd><i>Rudi Pawelka the president of the Preußische Treuhand and the Territorial Association of Silesia in his speech made in Nuremberg said that the strained situation before the war was partly due to the acts of aggression committed by Poles during the period 1918-1938.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>which is a different statement than the one about which the poll you mentioned was. I want you to show us a poll that clearly indicates that this sentence is supported (or the original sentence which you introduced to the article) by a considerable procent of German population. If you can show the poll then you can put the information about the poll into the article and I will not promote the information about Schroeder opinion. Otherwise, I think the Schroeder opinion is really necessary to document the extent of the anti-Polish views represented by Pawelka. I really want you to be to the point as much as you want others to be to the point. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 09:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This was on August 7, 1944. In the shelter there were several hundred people, mostly women and children. In the afternoon of this day, after the Insurgents had retreated from Elektoralna Street, a German outpost was set in front of the gateway of the Ministry. About 9 o’clock in the evening 2 gendarmes entered the shelter and ordered all the men to go out. The soldier who stood on guard assured us that we were only going to work. We were led out three by three (we were about 150 men) to Mirowski Square, among the buildings of the two Market Halls. Here we were ordered to remove the corpses, scores of which were lying on the ground, and after that, rubble from the gutters and the roadway. <b>There were about a hundred Poles on the square when we came, all busy cleaning it up, and some hundreds of Germa n gendarmes, who behaved very brutally: beating the Poles, kicking them, and calling them Polnische Banditen.</b> At a certain moment they stopped our work and ordered those who were not Poles to step forward. One man who had White-Russian documents did so, and was immediately released. After an hour and a half’s work, the gendarmes ordered us to form threes. I found myself in the second rank. We were all made to stand with our hands up. An old man in the front rank, who could not hold his hands up any longer, was cruelly struck in the face by a gendarme. After 10 minutes five rows of three were marched off under the escort of five gendarmes armed with tommy guns to the Market Hall in Chlodna Street. By chance I heard the names of two of the gendarmes who shouted to each other, Lipinski and Walter. When we entered the building after passing two gates I saw, almost in the centre of the Hall, a deep hole in which a fire was burning; it must have been sprinkled with petrol because of the dense black smo ke. We were put under a wall on the left side of the entrance near a lavatory<b>. We stood separately with faces turned to the wall and hands up.</b></p>
<p>After a few minutes I heard a series of shots and I fell. Lying on the ground I heard the moans and groans of people lying close to me and also more shots. When the firing ceased I heard the gendarmes counting those who lay on the ground; they only counted up to thirteen<b>. Then they began to look for two more who were missing.</b> They found a father and son hiding in the adjoining lavatory. They brought them out, and I heard the voice of the boy shouting "Long live Poland", and then shots and moans."</p>
<p>As you can see there is much evidence that stereotype of Poles being criminals was used by Germans during their mass murder of Polish people.The same stereotype repeated by German media star that was awarded for his work.</p>
<p>I am sure those Poles would love German jokes about Poles being criminals...</p>

It seems to me that his comments about Schmidt's Polish jokes are actually meant to be positive, not negative (in the context used, making jokes about someone or something reflects some level of respect for the target of the jokes, not disrespect). But obviously that is just my POV.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have now spent several days trying to find any reference on the web which would indicate that Florian Illies "cashes in on a clear anti-Polish bias", much less how that would show an anti-Polish sentiment in German polulation if it were true. All I have been able to find is references that he thinks that it is ok to make Polish jokes. Unless someone provides a reference which would prove the claim, I am going to remove the text.

<li><b>Persistent prejudice against Poles (1945 to present)</b>. Seems to me that the references made do not reflect Anti-Polonism, but rather poor choices of word. To read an Anti-Polish attitude or "hostility" into misrepresentations of events in the early days of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> seems to be a quite arbitrary claim, not supported by anything but the author's opinion.</li>

<p>Yes.

Sure, if you pick a given skit, but in general no. Keep your thinking cap on. An anti-Polish joke on German T.V. is not the reappearance of the SS. Is Canadian culture anti-American? Of course. But no more anti-American than American culture is anti-Canadian (according to ME)...and of course it reveals a bond as much as anything else (why, incidentally, did German-Polish friendship get removed?). Nothing on the page proves to me that this is <i>specific and particular</i> to Poles. I asked this above and I think it important: is the treatment of Poles in Germany different than that provided Turks and Arabs? I'd like to see somebody prove yes. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:13, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Exactly. I collected some more stats, this time about articles in German language mentioning hate of foreigners. Countries are mentioned in such articles as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA: 67,900</li>
<li>Turkey: 46,200</li>
<li>France: 38,300</li>
<li>Austria: 35,600 (note: this number is misleading since it includes a lot of information about hate of foreigners in Austria)</li>
<li>Poland: 30,800</li>
<li>Arab/Muslim: 30,500</li>
<li>Italy: 30,000</li>
<li>Africa: 25,200</li>
<li>Spain: 19,000</li>
<li>Netherlands: 16,500</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, there is no statistical relationship between the number of jokes and the amount of "hate".</p>
<p>There are several good articles on the web about hate of foreigners in Germany, including some with Polish-German specifics and theories about its roots. For example, it apears that the East German SED (the only political party in the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Democratic_Republic_b577.html" title="German Democratic Republic">German Democratic Republic</a> before the reunification) started an anti-Polish campaign in the 1980's. This is information which can easily be confirmed and should have a well deserved place in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">Anti-Polonism</a> article. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Instead, there is a lot of non-information, information which would usually be removed from Wikipedia as "original research".</p>

<ul>
<li>Regarding the use of the term "dealt with". Obviously, that is not the case, since none it is not reflected in the article. "Ignored with Prejudice" appears to be more appropriate. As for the reference cited above, it actually proves my point. It mentions schools in Germany teaching Polish. It talks a lot about discrimination against foreign immigrants, and it states that <i>German laws cause great harm to Polish immigrants</i> - but it can not establish <i>specific</i> discrimination against Polish immigrants in particular (German law is just as disciminative against other immigrants, and even against Germans who accept other countries' citizenships). In fact, it seems to claim discrimination against Polish immigrants because German law does not specifically create an exception for Polish immigrants over other immigrants from other countries.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On a more general note about POV vs. NPOV. In order to be a neutral article, it would be necessary to provide opposite views for each claim made in the article. Statements made can not be considered "true" just because someone says it. Terminology such as "has been claimed ..." would be more appropriate than listing POV as facts. Ultimately, I think that those trying to establish the existence of specifically Anti-Polish sentiment in today's German society are doing themselves a disservice by excluding the complete picture. The article itself, as written today, is immediately identified as heavily POV and thus as unreliable. If anything, just the opposite is accomplished. As written, it is much more useful in establishing an Anti-German view of its authors than anything else, and the article might serve as a good example to be cited in an "Anti-Germanism" article elsewhere.</dd>

<dd>The article can easily be identified as POV even by a casual reader. Removing the tag would not change this.

<dd>Oh really&#160;? You must have missed those sentences</dd>
</dl>
<p>'The Germans speak arrogantly of Polnische Wirtschaft, thus confirming the economic differences between the two countries but conveniently forgetting the German (and Prussian) contribution to the destruction of that Wirtschaft<b>. In the opinion polls about various nationalities, Poles rank lower than Turks or Russians, and 87 percent of young Germans regard them as "worse than themselves."(17)</b> <b>In popular TV programs, Poles are presented the way blacks were presented in the American press half a century ago.</b> On the other hand, during the time of communism in central and eastern Europe, it was difficult for Polish and other immigrants from communism to develop pride concerning their country of origin. The poverty of eastern and central European countries, their lack of democracy and constant economic crises evoked the feeling shame and jealousy as contrasted with West German prosperity. <b>The discrimination of Poles (and of other ethnic minorities) in Germany has been exacerbated by the extremist right and its slogans of Deutschland für Deutsche and Ausländer raus!</b></p>
<p><br />
Still another problem is the culture shock stemming from two different perceptions of what Europe really means. <b>To Poles, it seems natural that they, together with the Germans, belong to a common European culture and share a common religion. This feeling of belonging together is not shared by the Germans. While the Poles accept German culture as part of European culture, the Germans do not see Polish culture as sharing the same cultural roots.</b> While an educated Pole knows at least some German writers, the opposite is not true of an educated German. The growing realization of this situation, the feeling of frustration, anger and resentment not only against the Germans but also against Polish culture is a natural result, and some immigrants begin to share the prejudices of the dominant group. While the emigration of the last 20 years has somewhat softened these problems, they still do exist.</p>
<p>That does not prevent the occasional Germans revisionist claims. Among those was a recent attempt by the extreme right wing German party, "Nationale Offensive," to establish itself in the Opole region of Poland, in the village of Dziewkowice. The Bund der Vertriebenen, an organization representing those expelled from east of the Oder-Neisse line, occasionally expresses revisionist goal and demands that Germans from Germany be allowed to join the German minority organizations in Poland. "Helmut, you are our chancellor too:" such posters (in Polish) occasionally appeared in Silesia under the auspices of such German organizations.</p>
<p><br />
In particular, the treatment accorded to Poles has obviously been not on the agenda of the German civil rights organizations or of those German scholars and thinkers who spend time agonizing over Germany's actions in the twentieth century. +</p>
<p>Few Germans wish to remember that the establishment of Poland's western border along the Oder-Neisse rivers is linked with the incorporation of 46 percent of Poland's prewar territory by the Soviet Union and the decision of the three Great Powers to transfer German population from Poland to Germany, and the Polish population from Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania to post-German territories. The forced human dislocation, without precedent in modern history, compelled 4.5 million Poles to leave their eastern and rural homelands and move to the industrialized region abandoned by the forcibly expelled millions of Germans. <b>The Germans remember the tragedy of their dislocation but conveniently forget that of the Poles.</b></p>

<p>This comment refers to the first part of this chapter. I understand it has been discussed before. After reading through the related talk page comments, there appears to have been an agreement that the statements made are unsupported by the facts. Yet, the text is still there.</p>
<p>I spent some time last night trying to find references for the several "it has been cited that ..." statements in this chapter. I could not find any. References cited confirm the statements, but not an associated Anti-Polish sentiment, much less an "Anti-Polonism" associated with it (of course, I might have missed something).</p>
<p>In addition, the claim made about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_cavalry.html" title="Polish cavalry">Polish cavalry</a> fails to mention that the "supidity and incompetence" argument was used during WW II as propaganda by the Germans (and would thus belong to the pre-1945 section).

<dd>The status of the term has long been one of my concerns. If I start a requested move to Anti-polish sentiment or Persecution of Poles would people say yes (and if so to which one)?

<dd>That explains a lot. Your proposed wording sounds good to me, though I don't think the library reference should be used (or it should clearly say that the (or an) equivalent Polish term is defined there).</dd>
<dd>In general, I would favor renaming the article to "Anti-Polish sentiment" or something similar, since it would be easier to describe and to provide real references (such as <a href="http://www.ifg.uni.wroc.pl/dbase/polen-deutschland.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ifg.uni.wroc.pl/dbase/polen-deutschland.pdf" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>; sorry, this one is in German). The stronger term "anti-Polonism" could then be used where appropriate, or even better be described in its own chapter.</dd>
<dd>For the record, the oldest reference I found for the term "anti-Polonism" is in a book dated 1919 (not a nice one): <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/DOCs/jewish_question_in_poland.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/DOCs/jewish_question_in_poland.doc" rel="nofollow">The Jewish Question in Poland</a>. From the context, and from other information available on the web, it appears that the term has been used historically mostly to describe Jewish-Polish relations <a href="http://www.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/yb03/06cala.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/yb03/06cala.pdf" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/21michlic.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/21michlic.pdf" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://www.polish-heroes.org/descargas/how-long-wandering.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.polish-heroes.org/descargas/how-long-wandering.doc" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> as well as for (perceived or real) anti-Polish sentiment in U.S. media in the 1970s <a href="http://www.saga.org.pl/old/poloniauk.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saga.org.pl/old/poloniauk.php" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

<p>I see no reason for changing the title. We don't have "Anti-Jewish sentiment".The word Antipolonism is used in scholary works. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 17:50, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The terms have different meaning. "Sentiment" implies "dislike", while "Anti-Polonism" is more along the line of "hate". "Sentiment" is a much broader term. The latter term is much easier to describe in the context of the first. Groeck 18:03, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In this context, I also looked up <i>Polonophobia</i>. This term is derived from <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">Xenophobia</a>, <i>Fear of strangers</i>, i.e., it means "fear of Poles", not "hostility towards Poles". It seems to have been widespread in Russia at some time in the past <a href="http://www.acls.org/crn/network/ebook_gatagova_paper2.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acls.org/crn/network/ebook_gatagova_paper2.doc" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

In a letter in March 1861 to his sister Malwine, Bismarck, for example, expressed the Prussian-German attitude towards the Poles which turned out to be a blueprint for the future: "So clobbeth the Poles so that they despair; they have my deepest sympathy for their situation, but, if we want to exist, we have no choice but to wipe them out ('ausrotten'); the wolf cannot help it that he was created by God the way he is, but one shoots him yet, if one can."(11)</p>
<p>When the German empire made frenetic attempts to germanise her Polish provinces, she was supported by organisations like the Ostmarkenverein or the Pan-German alliance. These endeavours were also well received by prominent German intellectuals. As, for example, the sociologist Max Weber, once a member of the Pan-German alliance, put it: "It was we who humanised the Poles"(12). This anti-Slavism was to be brought to a climax during the Third Reich. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 23:31, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have shown that you are not a serious contributor by using emotions. Most cultures, civilisations have committed atrocities or have stereotypes that led to ones.Germany, despite what may one think about it judging by posts from German uses, has them also. It is simply history.The fact remains that German culture has many stereotypes about Poles showing them as thieves, denying they are humans, or that they are inferior.You can't really dispute that, since you will find hundreds of scholary works, documents or trials on it.If you can't face history I suggest you avoid topics dealing with it.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Molobo, one might possibly conclude that you are possibly not a serious contributor yourself, since you keep repeating the same stereotypes again and again. Furthermore, one might possibly suspect some level of emotional response on your side, especially when it comes to your opinion about Germans. Per your own statement, this would also disqualify you as contributor. Fair is fair. Besides, one might possibly argue that your comments above <i>German culture has many stereotypes about Poles</i> have no meaning besides "so what&#160;? every culture has stereotypes". That is not the problem. The problem might possibly be the conclusions you appear to draw from it.</dd>

<dd>You are consistent in your claim that "propaganda --&gt; mass murder" and "propaganda --&gt; stereotype" would result in "stereotype --&gt; mass murder". Mathematically, your claim is that "A--&gt;B, A--&gt;C&#160;::= B--&gt;C, and you use that claim to show that Germans would be Anti-Polish (by further associating "mass murderer" with "anti-Polish). This is a essentially an example for a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_analogy.html" title="False analogy">False analogy</a>.</dd>
<dd>Another chain of claims you keep making is along the line of "1) Schmidt makes Polish jokes"; "2) Polish jokes are based on stereotypes"; "3) Polish stereotypes are anti-Polish"&#160;::= "Schmidt is anti-Polish". 1) and 2) may be considered true without prejudice (i.e., without verifying the claim). 3) is a conclusion which equals Polish stereotypes with anti-Polish attitute, which is wrong (both can exist independently of each other, and even if both were equivalent, the conclusion would still be wrong; it is a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_Fallacy_fcf4.html" title="Logical Fallacy">logical Fallacy</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_analogy.html" title="False analogy">False analogy</a>). Therefore, your conclusion that Schmidt would be anti-Polish (based on Polish jokes he made) is wrong. The same pretty much applies to all your arguments. <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasty_generalization.html" title="Hasty generalization">Hasty generalization</a> actually provides a nice example for your line of argument.</dd>
<dd>Nobody will deny that stereotypes exist. Suggested readings above should be quite sufficient to confirm this. The claim "approved by German society" would, however, require references and is otherwise POV.</dd>
<dd>In respect to your interpretation of Thomas Urban's quotes, your claim that he confirmed that <i>such "jokes" serve nothing else (but) the portayal of Poles in negative light</i>, which does not appear to be supported by the references you provided.

Your attempts of apologism towards German stereotypes of Poles as criminals is not going to change the fact that such stereotype was used in German atrocities against Poles and is still found in German society.Furthermore experts on Polish-German relations admit that Schimdts jokes serve to portayal a negative view of Poles. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 11:33, 30 September 2005 (UTC) "In respect to your interpretation of Thomas Urban's quotes" I didn't provide an interpretation.I provided a translation. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 11:33, 30 September 2005 (UTC) " The claim "approved by German society" would, however, require references" Schimdt won several awards.It doesn't seem he was isolated or that he angered German public by using stereotypes of Poles as criminals that accompanied German mass murder of Poles in XX century. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 11:33, 30 September 2005 (UTC) Furthermore you can find acceptence by another German public figure of his usage of the stereotype: <a href="http://www.kaindlstorfer.at/interviews/illies.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kaindlstorfer.at/interviews/illies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaindlstorfer.at/interviews/illies.html</a> "Was heißt das?

<p>"What a absurd conclusion. " Sorry but I already provided several examples of Germans atrocities where such stereotypes were used by Germans towards Poles. Here is another example of German stereotype of Poles being criminals that was used during an German atrocity:</p>
<p>he people who stood at the entrance were led, no, pushed in, not all at once but in groups of 20. A boy of twelve, seeing the bodies of his parents and of his little brother through the half-open entrance door, fell in a fit and began to shriek. The Germans and Vlassov's men beat him and pushed him back, while he was endeavouring to get inside. He called for his father and his mother. We all knew what awaited us here; there was no possibility of escape or of buying one's life; there was a crowd of Germans, Ukrainians* (Vlassov's men), and cars. I came last and kept in the background, continuing to let the others pass, in the hope that they would not kill a pregnant woman, but I was driven in with the last lot. In the yard I saw heaps of corpses 3 feet high, in several places. The whole right and left side of the big yard (the first yard) was strewn with bodies. (A sketch of the yard was made by the deponent.) <b>We were led through the second. There were about 20 people in our group, mostly children of 10 to 12. There were children without parents, and also a paralysed old woman whose son-in-law had been carrying her all the time on his back. At her side was her daughter with two children of 4 and 7. They were all killed. The old woman was literally killed on her son-in-law's back, and he along with her</b>. We were called out in groups of four and led to the end of the second yard to a pile of bodies. When the four reached this point, the Germans shot them through the backs of their heads with revolvers. The victims fell on the heap, and others came. Seeing what was to be their fate, some attempted to escape; they cried, begged, and prayed for mercy. I was in the last group of four. I begged the Vlassov's men around me to save me and the children, and they asked if I had anything with which to buy my life. I had a large amount of gold with me and gave it them. They took it all and wanted to lead me away, <b>but the German supervising the execution would not allow them to do so</b>, and when I begged him to let me go he pushed me off, shouting "Quicker!" I fell when he pushed me. <b>He also hit and pushed my elder boy, shouting "hurry up, you Polish bandit</b> ". Thus I came to the place of execution, in the last group of four, with my three children. I held my two younger children by one hand, and my elder boy by the other. The children were crying and praying. <b>The elder boy, seeing the mass of bodies, cried out: "they are going to kill us" and called for his father. The first shot hit him, the second me; the next two killed the two younger children. I fell on my right side.</b> The shot was not fatal. The bullet penetrated the back of my head from the right side and went out through my cheek. I spat out several teeth; I felt the left side of my body growing numb, but I was still conscious and saw everything that was going on around me"</p>
<p>As you can see the stereotype of Pole being a criminal, thief, bandit is used by the German here to murder Polish children and pregnant women.The same stereotype of Poles being criminals, thieves, and bandits is used in German tv by a person who is rewarded by German media society. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:50, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bizarre and repugnant racial categorizations were used in WWII to justify the mass murder of Poles.

Und – wie Florian Illies6 am Anfang seines Buches bemerkt – Schmidts&#160;»Polenwitze«&#160;hatten für diese Generation eine befreiende Funktion. Polen war nie ein solches Tabu wie die Juden gewesen, aber als ein&#160;»Opfervolk«&#160;im Zweiten Weltkrieg und dann im Kriegszustand 1981 unterlag es den Selbstbeschränkungen einer gewissen&#160;»political correctness «&#160;oder einfach der&#160;»guten Erziehung«. Da die Hemmschwelle nie so hoch gewesen war, und die alten Raster der Verachtung gegenüber dem rückständigen Volk und&#160;»der polnischen Wirtschaft«&#160;weiterhin virulent waren, fiel auch die Umstellung von der&#160;»unterdrückten Solidarnosc«&#160;auf den&#160;»barbarischen Polenmarkt«&#160;nicht schwer.

In der eu sind sie lediglich hinter den Geldern der Nettozahler her, und im Irak wollen sie obendrein als&#160;»trojanischer Esel Amerikas«&#160;am Krieg gewinnen. Sie spielen sich nur auf und sind nicht einmal imstande, eine vernünftige Automarke auf den Weltmarkt zu bringen. Dies sind vielleicht krass überzeichnete überzeichnete Stimmungslagen, doch keineswegs Projektionen. Die Reserve gegenüber Polens Aufnahme in die eu, die gerade die Eurobarometer in Deutschland anzeigten, wie auch die niedrige Position der Polen auf dem deutschen Thermometer der Sympathie belegen, dass in der deutschen Gesellschaft nach wie vor historisch viel ältere Aversionen gegen den östlichen Nachbarn existieren als die durch die Grenzveränderungen und den&#160;»Bevölkerungsaustausch«&#160;von 1945 verursachten. Und, was noch wichtiger und bedenklicher ist: Die Selbstkorrektive sind in der deutschen Tradition schwächer als in anderen historisch belasteten Fällen, etwa dem deutsch-französischen, dem deutsch-russischen, deutsch-amerikanischen oder deutsch-israelischen Verhältnis.

The article <i>analogizes</i> between prejudice, it <i>does not assert</i> that "Italian Black Legend" or "Polish Black Legend" are matter-of-factly used. Of course Black Legend <i><b>type</b></i> prejudices may be observed in anti-Polish attitudes in Germany, or anti-Chinese attitudes in Malaysia, or anti-Black attitudes in the United States, or anti-Anglo attitudes in Quebec, or anti-Jewish attitudes in much of Europe.

The book you have cited most consistently deals with Prussia from 1785-1815 which is why I suggest "historical German attitudes toward Poland." If you'd rather, "historical attitudes toward Poland, particularly in Germany," fine. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:17, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

W następnej epoce z kolei, bardzo krytycznie pisano o Odrodzeniu. Kiedy w Polsce odbudowywano gospodarkę po zniszczeniach 2. wojny światowej i tworzono system socjalistyczny, nauczano nas w szkole, jak kiepskim systemem była <b>Polska międzywojenna</b>.

<dd>Sorry to not respond. The article must be internally consistent. We can't say "it's used in the context of Jewish-Polish relations" and then cite a series of examples relating to Germany or (historically) Prussia. The examples above appear numerous but <i>to the English reader</i> remain sparse. A few ten year-old examples, a few Polish writers in English etc. I don't want to introduce systemic bias but this is the English wiki.

<p>It does not mean two or even four references, Molobo. You want, as I have stated more times than I can count, to insert the Black Legend bit as time of day. It's not time of day. You haul out the POV soapbox any chance you get and all you're doing with this is inserting POV. "Often" means regularly, in common discourse, obvious.

<dd>guys, I don't even get what this "black legend" stuff is supposed to be, in either of the contested versions. What does Anti-Polonism have to do with Spaniards? Can you not just quote whoever made the comparison, verbatim, for better or worse? I must say that the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_legend.html" title="Black legend">black legend</a> article is not very lucid either (look at the ToC, it seems to ramble about random episodes of Spanish history). For the uninvolved, it is quite difficult to follow the contorted logic of nationalists, and their little rhetorical pointscorings, so I would much appreciate if you could write this article in plain English, without having the reader read between the lines. 81.63.114.127 10:12, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"What does Anti-Polonism have to do with Spaniards?" Very little, which has been my point. Both countries are historically Catholic, which is one basis for comparison, but as I say and as your comment underscores "Black Legend" refers to Spain in common discourse. Yes, if someone could produce a verbatim point that we can discuss here that would be helpful. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 10:21, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Anti-Polonism</b> (alternatively spelled <b>antipolonism</b>; also, <b>Polonophobia</b>) is a political slogan that describes collectively all sentiments and all kinds of hostility toward <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>. The word <i>anti-Polonism</i> started to occur in Polish <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">right-wing</a> and radical right-wing media in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> as an answer to accusations of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> done by Jewish circles.</p>
<p>Historic counterpart of <i>anti-Polonism</i> is <i>polakożerstwo</i> (in English - <i>Poles devouring</i>) - a term used in <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> to describe anti-Polish politics of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_von_Bismarck_a556.html" title="Otto von Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the grounds of anti-Polonism are not <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">rasist</a> and it has no support in any organised ideology. The journalists, politics and priests use that term in the context of events that signify sentiment towards Poles (for instance in the context of Polish jokes, presentation of negative stereotypes of Poles in foreign media or historical misstatements like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_death_camps.html" title="Polish death camps">Polish death camps</a>).</p>
<p>Some right-wing journalists, when they refer to anti-Polonism, incorporate <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theories</a> which link the historical persecution of the Polish nation with the incidents of present times. According to these theories anti-Polonism manifested throughout the history in different ways both in acts of individual persons and in organised actions ordained by governments of states or organisations. The actions ranged from propagation of motivated by anti-Polonism aversion for Poles to felonious acts the goal of which was to suppress <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish state</a> and physical extermination of the Polish nation. The groups which are currently most frequently accussed for anti-Polonism include Jewish circles together with <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">Russian</a> politics.</p>

<p>Certainly-if only you will find a scholary source confirming this.As of now perhaps Alx-pl could translate the version from Polish encyclopedia about anti-polonism, which is quite different from Polish wiki.Of course you would have hard time arguing that the term is invention of right-wingers in Poland and used only by them, as it is used by Gazeta Wyborcza-a rather liberal newspaper<a href="http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34181,2999052.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34181,2999052.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. I am sure they abuse the term, but it isn't limited only to their line of thinking. For example Gross cites in one of his books Jan Józef Lipski using the term and condeming both antisemitism and anti-polonism. Lipski was known for criticising Polish nationalism and xenophobia so as you see the term isn't the domain of far right. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 12:25, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

(...) Kampania "polityki historycznej" wobec Polski zaczęła się parę miesięcy przed rocznicą zakończenia II wojny światowej. (...) Sens przekazu był jasny: Polska jest zawsze niepewnym sojusznikiem, w wojnie jej rola była dwuznaczna, a pretensje wysuwane przez Polaków (Katyń, Powstanie Warszawskie, pakt Ribbentrop-Mołotow) to rodzaj agresji propagandowej. W ramach tej kampanii były oficer Smiersz porównywał sytuację w Polsce w 1945 r. do obecnej sytuacji "naszych chłopców" w Czeczenii, zaś autorka poczytnej strony [internetowej] pisała o AK jako sojuszniku hitlerowców itp. Zdumiewa to, że operacja po tej rocznicy nie ustała, lecz dalej toczy się w najlepsze. Ostatnio można było przeczytać, że to Polska prowokowała hitlerowskie Niemcy do wojny oraz że "bojownicy polskiej Armii Krajowej w mieście Mińsk Mazowiecki wyrżnęli nasz szpital, zabijając 200 rannych i cały personel (kobiecy)".

<p>WARSAW, Poland -- When Russia looks westward these days, it seems to pass right over Poland. Russian leaders don't even seem to see that substantial land mass it has fought over so many times throughout history and which they have cynically regarded as merely a "corridor" -- theirs -- to Germany and to Europe. Somehow Moscow cannot bear the thought that Warsaw is now part of the West.</p>
<p>But it was not always that way. Historically, the Russians have considered Poland, without second thought, to be nothing but a part of imperial Mother Russia. A favorite refrain was "A hen is not a bird; it can't fly." Poland was the hen.</p>

<p>I toned down the article-Samoobrona btw is defined as leftist in its ideology so it didn't fit "far right" definition.Its already mentioned that symbolism used in past persecution of Poles is exploited by such parties-mentioning it three times and under badge from concentration camp seems improper and I believe gives dishonour to people who were forced to wear it. Of course mentioning it is ok with me but not under the badge.

<p>I know for a fact that the term in Poland is almost exclusively used in the context of right wing anti-semitic and anti-europeist propaganda. Information about some of the groups that make this use of the term belongs here "and" in anti-semitism in Poland. I am suprised that a user of Wikipedia supports the same use of the term done by Adam Gmurczyk (president of Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski) at texts like this: <a href="http://www.europeannationalfront.com/?id=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.europeannationalfront.com/?id=10" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 21:23, 27 November 2005 (UTC) I also think that all the historical part should be removed and maybe placed at an independent article, since this issue is about a modern right wing concept, not a historical once.

<p>I am glad to see the article move in a saner direction, i.e. shedding light on the development and political usage of the Polish word <i>antypolonizm</i>, instead of proclaiming some universal anti-Polish impulse behind the very disparate persecutions Poles have suffered at various points in history. Not surprisingly, not everyone shares my opinion: <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisvegas</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Polonism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29356696" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Polonism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29356696" rel="nofollow">complained</a> that <i>"this article was increasingly focussed on the anti-Semitism of right-wing Polish groups than the actual phenomenon of anti-Polonism."</i></p>
<p>The trouble is, there simply <i>is</i> no "actual phenomenon" commonly known as anti-Polonism. Nobody seriously disputes that Poles have suffered repressions in history, and that negative stereotypes about them persist. However, as a concept unifying all these very different repressions and stereotypes, <i>antypolonizm</i> is a dubious coinage. Listing Bismarck's anti-Catholic <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kulturkampf.html" title="Kulturkampf">Kulturkampf</a>, wartime atrocities against Poles and "Polish jokes" under the headline "anti-Polonism" makes about as much sense as it would to list the English conquest of Ireland, the Potato Famine and "no Irish need apply" signs under the headline "anti-Irishism". At best, such a definition is theory-building or original research, which simply is off limits for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As mentioned during the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-Polonism_cfd1.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Polonism">VfD</a>, the English word "anti-Polonism" is not in general use, whereas the Polish word <i>antypolonizm</i> is virtually a monopoly of said "right-wing Polish groups". Perhaps significantly, it is not even listed by the most comprehensive Polish dictionary, the <i>Słownik Języka Polskiego PWN</i>.</p>
<p>Typically, the word is used as follows (from the <a href="http://forum.gazeta.pl/forum/72,2.html?f=11&amp;w=13012566&amp;a=14560562" class="external text" title="http://forum.gazeta.pl/forum/72,2.html?f=11&amp;w=13012566&amp;a=14560562" rel="nofollow">forum</a> of a Polish talk radio network): <i>"There is no anti-Semitism in Poland, this is an invention of the Jewish population, which occupies high-ranking positions in the administration and government. There is, however, anti-Polonism. The Jews hate the Polish nation and are trying to destroy it at every turn."</i> This aptly describes the vicious circle of accusations of Polish anti-Semitism and Jewish anti-Polonism.</p>
<p>I found only one piece of evidence that uses the word <i>antypolonizm</i> in a similar fashion as "our" article: <a href="http://www.polonica.net/Antypolonizm.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.polonica.net/Antypolonizm.htm" rel="nofollow">"Antypolonizm"</a> in the "modern supplement" volume of the pre-war <i>Wielka ilustrowana encyklopedia powszechna Gutenberga</i>, a facsimile edition of which was published in the 1990s. Subtitled <i>"Activities aiming at the destruction of the Polish state and nation"</i>, the article boldy covers everything from remarks in Bishop <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thietmar.html" title="Thietmar">Thietmar of Merseburg</a>'s chronicle from 1012, via the Moravian educator <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comenius.html" title="Comenius">Comenius</a> who had welcomed <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Deluge_9632.html" title="The Deluge">The Deluge</a>, the usual suspects <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a> and <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Lenin_a39d.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a>, right down to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s "lies" in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schindler%27s_List_e7d2.html" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a>. In line with the term's political connotation, the article culminates in the conspiracy theory that <i>"after the 1953 reparation agreement between West Germany and Israel, activities aimed at denigrating the image of the Poles (in relation to the Jews during WW II) and at the same time white-washing the Germans became increasingly frequent"</i>. The article is hosted on a clearly anti-Semitic <a href="http://www.polonica.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.polonica.net/" rel="nofollow">"patriotic" hate site</a>, which also <a href="http://www.polonica.net/Antysemityzm.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.polonica.net/Antysemityzm.htm" rel="nofollow">declares</a> that <i>"The Jews use the term 'anti-Semitism' whenever Poles defend themselves against anti-Polonism. They also have an interest [read: business interest] in anti-Polonism"</i>. This speaks volumes about the people who coined the word anti-Polonism and use it with particular gusto.</p>
<p>In its current version per <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisvegas</a>, the article states that "anti-Polonism" has <i>"been studied in scholarly works by Polish, German and Russian researchers"</i>, and that it <i>"has entered mainstream academic usage to describe a variety of behaviours and ideologies influenced by an irrational hatred of Poles."</i> I vehemently challenge this: I am not aware of any works by "Polish, German and Russian researchers" which would employ the term "anti-Polonism" (either as a catch-all term in the way the article suggests, or specifically referring to "Jewish anti-Polonism") and at the same time deserve the label "scholarly" (which obviously excludes works by the likes of Ryszard Bender or Jerzy Robert Nowak). Likewise, the claim about <i>"mainstream academic usage"</i> appears to be created out of thin air.</p>
<p>It is about time we made a clear distinction between the <i>concept</i> of anti-Polonism and the <i>reality</i> it allegedly describes. The article should describe the concept, but without adopting the dubious ideological interpretation of reality by of those who mostly use it. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 17:51, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Polonophilia and Polonophobia of the Russians Bloomington, September 2000</p>
<p><br />
Call for Papers Polonophilia and Polonophobia of the Russians</p>
<p><br />
This conference is scheduled for September 16-17, 2000 at the Indiana University Bloomington campus. We invite proposals for papers on any aspect of the history of Russia's alternating attraction to and repulsion of Poland's cultural expression. Topics may include, but need not be limited to, contributions of Polish creativity to Russian culture and the reactive use by Russian artists and writers of Polish expression as a foil for creating a self-conscious Russian cultural identity. The conference is jointly sponsored by the Indiana University Russian and East European Institute, the Indiana University Polish Studies Center, and the University of Wisconsin Madison Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures. Co-directors are Bozena Shallcross, Indiana University; David Ransel, Indiana University and Alexander Dolinin, University of Wisconsin at Madison. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 18:16, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"You have also links to Russian work on polonophobia in the article"</i>. Well, I didn't find any, but that is what happens when an article gets as chaotic as this one.

<p>Intellectuals, Socialism, and Dissent: The East German Opposition and Its Legacy by John C Torpey</p>
<p>Page 81/82 Perhaps most significant for understanding the reaction of the East German citizenry to the earthquake rumbling through Poland during the second half of 1980 was the SED's blatant exploitation of traditional German anti-Polish feeling.In describing East German's reaction to Solidarność one interviewee noted that "this rather difficult[German-Polish] relationship played an important role. People say the Poles don't know how to work...The Party succeeded in developing a social psychology that was anti-polish. Wittenberg pastor Friedrich Schorlemmer who in the fall of 1989 would go on to help the ill fated citizens initiative Democratic Awakening, raised the matter of regime's exploitation of the older ressentiments towards the Poles.This tactic had become especially apparent in the rejuvenation of "Polish Jokes", some of which remained listeners of the spread of such jokes under the Nazis. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 20:03, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lot of this discussion centres on the treatment of Poles by Germans and ultimately by Nazis. What I would like to know is: was the persecution of Poles a part of the more general persecution of Slavs, or were Poles singled out as worse than say Russians, Czechs, Slovenians, Serbs, etc.? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 02:07, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is very difficult question and probably no one around can answer it conclusively. What I know is that for instance <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukrainians</a> collaborated with Nazi Germany and had their own military troops on German service during WW2. <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czechs</a> tried not to make any violence against Germans and some of their movie stars from before WW2 were in close relationships with high German officials during WW2. But this is I guess too weak to be a conclusive answer. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">Alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 18:25, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's true that in many Slavic countries there were Nazi collaborators, and that the persecution of the Slavic population varied across countries, partly because of that. But AFAICT this collaboration was mostly tactical, at least on the Nazi side, as, according to their ideology, Slavic peoples were inferior and their land was to be ultimately taken over by Germans. It's also worth of notice that the apologists of those collaborators are often the same people who propagate outlandish theories of non-Slavic origin of their peoples.</dd>
<dd>Vast numbers of Slavs were also extermined by Nazis in countries not as large or as close to Germany as Poland is. So, again, are there any sources for claiming that Nazis were specifically anti-Polish, rather than simply Slav-haters? Either way, the general anti-Slavism of Nazis needs to be pointed out. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 19:03, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem Zocky is that in contrast to Ukrainians or Czechs, Poles were viewed as inferior by German culture long before Nazism existed.And this traditional hatred and contempt was enforced eve n more strongly by Nazism.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:26, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For example see : htttp://www.oslo2000.uio.no/program/papers/s18/s18-blackbourn.pdf <a href="http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=1724846635492" class="external free" title="http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=1724846635492" rel="nofollow">http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=1724846635492</a> <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/902/223books.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/902/223books.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/902/223books.html</a> The stated aim of this scholarly study is to trace back the negative stereotypes of Poles entrenched in German historiography and popular culture ever since Prussia and Russia engineered the partitions of Poland in the eighteenth century. The treatise begins with a survey of authors and readers of the Prussian statistical publications in the period under review. We learn that the credibility of Beamtentumsliteratur (studies written by petty officials in Prussia) was often marred by corruption and dishonesty of said officials, as well as by their lack of proficiency in Polish. The data they collected were also marred by incompetence, ignorance and a classically hostile attitude toward the Other--in this case, toward the Poles. The writers' generalizing helped to distort the picture: whenever they did not like something, they were likely to say "as is always the case in Poland;" but when they encountered a city they liked (Poznan), they commented that "the city was built according to German standards." German officials routinely compared Polish peasant farmers to the wild inhabitants of "Kamchatka and the West Indies," or to "Roman slaves and American Indians." Such scholars and travelers as Johann Georg Forster compared Poles to "cattle in human form" (in SŠmtliche Schriften). A certain Lichtenberg (said to be Forster's friend) wrote that Poland was inhabited by "landowning despots, dirty Jews and plica" [Weichselzopf, or koltun]. The expression "German cockroaches" must have entered the English language owing to the similarly brutal descriptions of German immigrants to America by those who came earlier from the British Isles.</p>
<p>Among the specific complaints of these official record keepers were the prevalence of Catholicism among Poles (it was considered scandalous), low level of education, consumerism and vanity of the Polish landowners, poverty and servitude of the Polish peasantry, and the greed of Polish Jews who were seen as Poland's "third estate" and whose numerosity in Poland (by comparison to Prussia) irritated the German officials. üukasiewicz's conclusions are that the Prussian officials created a taxonomy within which persons of Polish nationality were perceived as inferior and in need of Prussian tutelage. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:37, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

While Herder was reflecting on the Slavs, Fichte was teaching in Poland and writing negative, racist comments about the Poles. Polish women were slovenly and with a stronger sex drive than Germans (p. 335); Poland was full of wild animals, wild people, and Jews. A racist diatribe published in 1793 (Joachim Christoph Friedrich Schulz's Journey of a Livonian from Riga to Warsaw) was republished in 1941 after the Nazis had conquered Poland, reflecting a trend among German scholars from the eighteenth into the twentieth century to perceive, in the difference between Germany and Poland, a boundary between civilization and barbarism, high German Kultur and "primitive Slavdom" (p. 336). --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 15:19, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am intimately familiar with the subject as I have researched it for University, and right now there is majoritary consensus that no such thing as Anti-Polonism in the sense given by the article exist outside the ideology of nationalist and/or right wing Polish parties. In its current form, the article would be approved by Adam Gmurczyk. I am also curious to know why Molobo has reverted facts that I have properly sourced with embeded links and explained at the Talk Page. Several undisputed facts like the term is not included at Słownik Języka Polskiego PWN have been removed by Molobo with no explanation. As I had put it, the first part of the article focused on Modern Anti-Polonism, which is an ideological fabrication entirely, while the second one did on Historical Anti-Polonism, which was also a reality but no longer exists. I'll wait for an explanation before re adding the information that you questionably removed. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 15:46, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Several undisputed facts like the term is not included at Słownik Języka Polskiego PWN have been removed by Molobo with no explanation</i> You can put that information in the article.Then I will put information that the word is found in National Library of Poland in Dictionary of subjects.You will put that it is rarely used in research.I will put a dozen or so scholary works as example that still, it is used. What will we achieve in doing that ? You can't dispute that the word exists.</p>

<dd>It doesn't exist in the sense assigned by this article, which is the same sense assigned by conspiracy theorists of right wing parties. Anti-Polonism is not a racial issue nowadays in the same sense it was i.e. in the XIX century and the first half of the XX century. Equalling Polish jokes with Nazi persecution is the typical speech of the NOP, not that of scholars. (Alexbulg, Revision as of 16:06, 13 December 2005)</dd>

<p>And please read before editing-they are two books by German researches on antipolonismus-yet you set it as "need citation".

<dd>And thus Polish jokes=Nazism, according to you? Quite an absurd line of thought, don't you think? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 16:47, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They originated there, yet their widespread use in the U.S. use constitutes Anti-Polonism, according to you, then. So you're saying that the Unites States society is an Anti-Polish and has links to the Third Reich? Absurd. Also, I don't deny Polish jokes exist, but you say in general that they are a demonstration of Anti-Polonism and racism, which is debatable at best. Now if you talk about WWII era jokes, it should be mentioned clearly "Nazi Germany-time Polish jokes" separated from modern use, as they are commonplace in the U.S., Russia, Italy and other places nowadays, just like American, Russian or Jewish jokes exist too. But now, you're mixing everything in the same bag. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 16:45, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nope, just that the jokes have German origin and are based on racist stereotype(similar to claiming that Poles have to think in certain way because they are Poles). And the book shows that reason for their spreas may have been the growing number of German emmigrants.Not my words. Are the jokes antipolish-of course even if their users don't consider them as such they led to stereotyping Poles as stupid and inferior. It also seems that they can led to discrimination at work : <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;id=9v-yCtn9tmkC&amp;q=polish+jokes&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dpolish%2Bjokes&amp;pgis=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;id=9v-yCtn9tmkC&amp;q=polish+jokes&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dpolish%2Bjokes&amp;pgis=1" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>
<p>I rather doubt however that American society has nowadays a strong anti-Polish bias.</p>
<p>But you say that it is a demonstration of Anti-Polonism. So basically its common use (even on movies) in the U.S., according to the logic you display at the article, points exactly otherwise. And that's more or less the same logic displayed at <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_forgot_Poland_e1ef.html" title="You forgot Poland">You forgot Poland</a>. Sorry, but your arguments are severely flawed, and you contradict yourself time and time again.</p>

<li>Jokes are antiPolish but it doesn't mean the whole society uses them, or that make all people antipolish.Oh and don't forget to sign yourself.</li>

Molobo's contributions too were much more directed towards me, and my own arguments of his Anti-Semitism are shown by his edits. If that's not what he meant (and he explains what he meant by deleting <b>relevant</b> and <b>sourced</b> information regarding Jews that belongs here), he'll have my apollogy. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 17:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>(The term) was frequently used as a diversion to deflect directed to Poles accusations of anti-Semitism which were expressed by certain Jewish groups</i>. In what way does this fit in Anti-Semitism and not here? By deleting it, it pretty much looks like you're trying to hide the existence of modern Anti-Semitism in Poland, which is an anti-semitic attitude in itself. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 17:45, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry but I never deleted it but changed its structure as it is presented to show the detailed situation.In fact your accusations are absurd because I was the first to enter the information that extremist circles abuse the term, and created chapter on misuse of the term. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 17:50, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No you were not. You created only the chapter and put it to the bottom to hide it.</p>
<p>Ekhem I didn't hide.It was quite visible to any user who would read the text. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 17:55, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yet you deleted all connection between the term and the complaint of Jewsih circles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Polonism&amp;diff=31207534&amp;oldid=31207040" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Polonism&amp;diff=31207534&amp;oldid=31207040" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. Please leave your own personal views outside of Wikipedia and let relevant information stay where it belongs, even if it contradicts your views. <i>In fact your accusations are absurd because I was the first to enter the information that extremist circles abuse the term</i> Absurd and false claim: I was the first to do it. In your version, no mention to right wing politics existed. You merely moved it to a different section to suit your own POV of presenting separately the "misuse" of the term to an alleged "reality" that doesn't exist. The term is basically used by said groups, and sometimes (rarely) used outside of them, not the other way around as you presented. So stop hiding relevant and connected information regarding the conections between the users of the term and his Anti-Semitic views, unless you support said Anti-Semitic views. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 18:00, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I put it in the chapter of the misuse of the term. <i>Please leave your own personal views outside of Wikipedia</i> I advise you to do the same. <i>In your version, no mention to right wing politics existed</i> Since they are both leftist and ring wing I see no reason to claim that such views are only part of one political side."So stop hiding relevant and connected information regarding the conections between the users of the term and his Anti-Semitic views, unless you support said Anti-Semitic views." Again there is a page on Antisemitism-you are welcome to edit it to your views, since you seem to be interested more in Antisemitism then Antipolonism.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 18:04, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The matters have a point of connection here, and thus as Alx-pl has said, claiming that it doesn't belong here is only your personal POV. Your attempt to separate them looks pretty much like a diversion to hide every trace of criticism towards anything related to Poland. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 18:25, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your constant accusations seem make me view critical your neutrality-if the term is misused it should be mentioned in specific chapter, and not spread throughout the whole article. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 18:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And your constant diversions of the point and omission to address critical issues make me be critical towards your neutrality too. I said many times, like other users (many) at this page that <b>the term is <i>not</i> misused; rather, it is almost <i>always</i> used by extremists</b>. If you feel that the rule is in fact the exception, that may only mean that you support the sense of the term assigned by the users of the rule, i.e. the sense given by NOP and the likes. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 18:39, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Those are the <i>rare</i> uses :-) They don't make it a key part of their speech, like extremists do, which is undenyable and has been repeatedly mentioned at this talk page. If that's "my POV", it is also that of nearly every other user who has posted here. On the contrary, your own POV, is only supported by you. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbulg_578f.html" title="User:Alexbulg">Alexbulg</a> 19:04, 13 December 2005 (UTC) <i>Those are the</i> rare <i>uses :-)</i> Those are the important and official uses.

<p>I reworded the lead a bit...but the rest of the article is still...crap. I started rewriting the next section, but it needs to be almost completely scrapped and started over, this time in English. Also, what is this persistent harping about "Polish death camps"? The only thing I can imagine is that the Poles who are griping about this usage have a very poor grasp of English and fail to understand that it means "death camps in Poland", and that no native English speaker anywhere is stupid enough to think it means "death camps set up by Poles". What this reeks of is Polish-POV-pushing--reinterpreting English usage according to Polish linguistic norms, and then crying "victim!", when, in fact, the entire problem is a failure to understand the original. <a href="../../../a/y/b/AYBABTU_f73d.html" title="AYBABTU">All your base</a> indeed. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 00:41, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since you obviously are a native English speaker, I can only congratulate you on your grasp of the language, contrary to the Poles, for whom the language is obviously too difficult to comprehend. I'm sure you were not trying to insult anyone. Now, take a look at the quote of David Harris (the American Jewish Committee Executive Director) whose command of English is apparently much inferior to yours: <i>"We would also like to remind those who are [...] careless in their choice of words, as has been the case with some media outlets, that Auschwitz-Birkenau and the other death camps, [...] were located in German-occupied Poland, the European country with by far the largest Jewish population, but they were most emphatically not Polish camps.</i> --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 01:14, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Harris takes a very <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptivist.html" title="Prescriptivist">prescriptive</a> view of "proper usage", which is not at all common among English speakers outside of predominantly leftist circles in academia, the media and politics. Nobody referring to "Polish death camps" has ever meant that they were set up by Poles, nor that they were an invention of Poles, nor does any native speaker believe that that's what it means. Citing Harris (or any number of other people) saying "they weren't Polish" (<i>i.e.</i>, a Polish idea), which everyone already knows, is pointless until you can find someone who believes they were. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 01:35, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tomer, perhaps with your superior understanding of English you can explain in what context the word "Poland" was used in the following quotes:
<ul>
<li>On January 1, 1994, the <i>New York Times</i> in an article titled <i>Victims of Bias Try to Guide Skinheads Off Road of Hate</i>, describes an anti-hate lesson to a group of youths at the Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. This article includes: "Mr. Frumkin, a 63-year-old native of Lithuania who was held at the Dachau concentration camp in Poland, related some of his experiences and said: "I hope to God you don't waste your lives hating. It's pointless."</li>
<li>On September 16, 1994, <i>The Pilot</i>, a Boston Catholic paper published: "At a reception for 190 Bostonians at the Holocaust Museum, Washington, D.C. "A Survivor's Story" -- Irene Weiss of Washington, D.C. tells the story of her years in Poland's Buchenwald concentration camp and how as a teenager she managed to survive the horrors of prison life."--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 01:42, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Certainly I can tell you. There's no dispute about what "Poland" means, this issue is over what "Polish" means. I can see how the usage in the second citation could easily be viewed as "careless" (and I'd be inclined to agree)...since it makes it possible to misinterpret (for someone who doesn't know the history of WW2) it as saying that <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buchenwald.html" title="Buchenwald">Buchenwald</a> was set up by the Polish govt. That said, I would say that the <b>The Pilot'</b>s editorial staff is in need of some English lessons, not that the statement is an expression or indication of "anti-Polonism". At the same time, both they, and the people at the New York Times, need some serious geography lessons, since neither of those camps were in Poland...Dachau is in southern Germany, and Buchenwald is in central Germany. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 01:55, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm gonna hafta go ahead and disagree with this assessment, since half of Bismarck's <i>German</i> empire was also Catholic. Nothing about the Kulturkampf was explicitly anti-Polish...the fact that it adversely affected Bismarck's views of the staunchly Catholic Polish populace is a byproduct of the conflict which was political, not religious, and based in a conflict between the authority of Bismarck as Emperor and the Pope as Religious Sovereign over half of Bismarck's subjects. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 09:05, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Why did I gripe so much in the preceding section about this whole section needing to be scrapped and restarted, "this time in English"? Because it took me 3 minutes to try to figure out what that sentence was <i>trying</i> to say (and I'm still not sure I did)...but seriously 3 minutes per sentence? That's ridiculous. It's like whoever was writing this was orgiastically gushing random incoherent ideas into the article without regard for whether or not they made sense, expecting that someone else should clean up after them. Clearly, that expectation has not been met... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 00:58, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, the form <i>accuse of</i> is used more often and is preferred by the Cambridge Dictionary so if you want to correct the phrasing you can just mention that it is the case.

<dd>"cuss" is a derivative form of "curse". Look at the way it's spelled. Beyond that, you can neither accuse nor curse Jewish circles of anything. You can accuse Jews or Jewish groups, but not Jewish circles. The sarcasm in that half of the post has to do with the fact that the origin of the word "kike"...oh nevermind. go read <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">the article</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 16:42, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now it's even (almost) funny. :-) You seem to suggest that "Jewish circle" is not a group of people.

<dd>There seems to be an understanding gap here. I did not say that "Jewish circle" is not a group of people, what I said is that you can't accuse (or curse) "Jewish circles" of anything. Ideas can circulate in Jewish circles. Terminology can be used in Jewish circles. But Jewish circles aren't a collective noun that can be objectified, despite its morphological appearance. In the same way, you can say "Anti-Polonism is a much-used propaganda tool in some Polish political circles", but not "Some Polish political circles circulate the idea that anti-Polonism is an everlasting evil comparable to anti-Semitism". You can, on the other hand, say "Some Polish political <i>groups</i> circulate...". Why? I don't know. That said, your reference to the Cambridge Dictionary doesn't support your claim, since you'll notice it's never used as an object in any of the examples... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 18:22, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>It could be removed since it dates back to attempt to delete the article based on allegation that the word doesn't exist. In order to disproved it several research articles have been found(German,English, Russian) that used. The whole indroductory sentence was made to counter those attempts of deletation.Curiously although research papers are given in sources somebody still puts citation needed. Of course the article is vandalised so often its hard to make it surivive.I stoped being interested when it was changed to "polish conspiracy trying to hide polish anti-semitism".

<p>I removed the quote:</p>
<pre>
As discussed in the Times Literary Supplement: 
</pre>
<p>Indeed, a significant proportion of Polish citizenry remains cocooned in myths of "traditional Polish tolerance" (largely true in the multi-ethnic Kingdom of Poland centuries ago, not much in evidence subsequently) and of Poland as "Christ among nations"-- a chosen people, singularly virtuous and ready to redeem the world in the name of "your and our freedom." For them, anything perceived as a slur on the good name of their country arouses passionate rebuttals and charges of malevolence and "anti-Polonism". In January l994 a young correspondent of Gazeta Wyborcza, Michal Cichy, reported on the case of about 40 Jews killed by a group of Polish fighters during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The article, which in no way implied that the insurgents at large committed such outrages, elicited an orgy of protests. A prominent historian, Tomasz Strzembosz, accused Cichy of practicing a "distinct type of racism," and charged his boss, Adam Michnik, of "cultivating a species of tolerance that is absolutely intolerant of antisemitism yet regards anti-Polonism and anti-goyism [sic] as something altogether natural." (Scholars have since then documented many other murders of Jews committed by soldiers of the underground Home Army.) -- Abraham Blumberg, Murder Most Foul, TLS, March 2 2001</p>
<p>The quote is inaccurate and misleading-Cichy has long time ago apologised for making the article seem to indicate Home Army was responsible. The thesis made in the quote is already stated in the article, and the last line of the quote is disputable. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 11:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sponsored jointly by the Polish Studies Center, the Russian and East European Institute, and the Office of International Programs, the two-day conference brought together some of the most distinguished researchers in the fields of Polish and Russian studies. The conference opened on Saturday, September 16 with welcoming remarks by Bozena Shallcross, Director of the Polish Studies Center, and David L. Ransel, Director of the Russian and East European Institute. The first panel addressed “Poland as a State of Mind.” This set the stage for subsequent panel discussions, which incorporated this theme into the broader framework of Russian acceptance and repulsion of the Polish cultural expression. This first session was moderated by Jeffrey Veidlinger (History) and featured remarks by Megan Dixon (Principia College), Brian Horowitz (University of Nebraska), and Andrzej Walicki (Notre Dame). Dixon presented a reconsideration of Pushkin with respect to the Polish Uprising. Horowitz read his paper “Despair with Poland, Russia, and the Jewish Diaspora: Poland and the Evolution of Lev Levanda’s Russian-Jewish Consciousness.” The renowned scholar Andrzej Walicki addressed the issue of “The Slavophile Thinkers and the Polish Question in 1863.” The floor was then opened for questions and discussion. The second panel, “Writing in Poland,” was moderated by Vadim Liapunov (Slavics), and focused on two writers who responded positively to Polish culture and two who have been classified as polonophobes. Presenters included Jiyong Jeon (Chosun University, Korea), who presented his paper “A.I. Herzen and Poland,” Irena Grudzinska-Gross (New York University), who spoke on “Joseph Brodsky’s Poland,” Judith Kornblatt (University of Wisconsin), who addressed the theme “At Home with Pani Polonophilia and Polonophobia of the Russians by Mark Betka Eliza: Izaak Babel and his Polish Characters,” and Nina Perlina (Slavics), who presented “Dostoevsky’s Polish Fellow Prisoners from The House of the Dead.” Saturday’s last panel focused on “Overlapping Terrains” and was moderated by David L. Ransel (REEI). This panel provided historical context for the occurrence of polonophobia in Russia. Leonid Gorizonotov (Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow) read a paper that focused on Russian press reactions to Polish socio-cultural expansion in the late 19th century. Barbara Skinner (Georgetown University) discussed Catholicism and the Uniate church as a basis for Russian polonophobia. Matthew Pauly (History) spoke on Soviet nationalities policy in Soviet Ukraine, 1927-1934. The day’s events concluded with a concert of Polish and Russian opera music featuring the soprano soloist Kinga Skretkowicz- Ferguson of the Indiana University School of Music accompanied by Juvenal Correa on piano. Sunday featured the fourth and final panel discussion, “Cultural Reflections and Projections,” moderated by Jerzy Kolodziej (Slavics). This panel focused on the incorporation of Polish cultural expression within the Russian arts as well as the conflicting self-image of Poles and their image in the eyes of Russians. The presenters were Halina Goldberg (University of Alabama), who spoke on “Appropriating Poland: Polish Dance in Russian Music,” David Goldfarb (Barnard College), who read the paper “Polish Self- Fashioning and the Russian Image of the Foppish Pole,” and Robert Przygrodzki (Northern Illinois University), who addressed “Vasili Shuiskii, the Staszic Palace, and Russian Politics in Nineteenth Century Warsaw.” The conference concluded with a plenary session moderated by David L. Ransel in which participants discussed options for the publication of conference papers. All the participants agreed to contribute their efforts to the compilation of an edited volume or special journal issue based on the papers presented at the conference. Mark Betka is a graduate student in the Russian and East European Institute and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.Irena Grudzinska-Gross and David L.

<p>Molobo, there are some issues with the version of the text you keep reverting to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Times quote. I understand you don't like the quote, but that is not a good reason for removal. There are many reasons to keep it; 1) It is one of only two uses of the term in English newspapers 2) Blumberg is a famous crimonologist, and he has been published in the Yale Law Review and Foreign Affairs 3) The Times of London (not NY) is a well-regarded publication 4) The facts of the use of the comment by Strzembosz are correct (and he reacted similarly to Jan Gross's work before the IPN study) 5) I removed the comment you did not like at the end, and you are welcome to include the apology or other material if you want.</li>
<li>Citations in the intro. The citations in the intro are not accurate. The fact that IU's music department used the words "Polophobia and Polophilia" does not mean the term "anti-Polonism" has "been studied in scholarly works" -- especially as the word anti-Polonism does not appear once in the entire overview that you reference. Similarly, the second cite you give is to support that anti-Polonism "has also entered mainstream usage to describe a variety of behaviours and ideologies hostile toward Poles or Poland" but the cited work says nothing of the sort, it just uses the word once, in terms of East Germany.</li>
<li>Quotes. You have trimmed quotes and added editoral comments, as in the case of Yitzhak Shamir, why can't the full quote, and the fact that Shamir is a Pole, stand on its own? It is no less offensive for it, and the context is useful, though it does not excuse his words. Similarly, David Lloyd-George did make his comments during the Paris Peace Conference in reaction to questions about German territories -- you removed that. Again, it doesn't excuse Lloyd-George, but the context needs to be included.</li>
<li>Jokes. I agree that Polish stereotypes are hurtful, but the Polish cavalry charge myth being "anti-Polonism"? (When I heard it as a kid, I thought it was an example of chivalry against hopeless odds, not an insult thing, but anyway) You are going to need to provide a source for that. Similarly, yes, Polish jokes were common in Nazi Germany, but there was a lot of horrible anti-Polonism there, which can be further expanded on in the article, if you want. But the citation you give actually dismisses the argument that American and Nazi jokes are connected in the very next page.</li>
<li><b>Overall</b>. The problem with this article is that it connects three very different things. The first was the very real anti-Polish feeling of the Nazis that led to the death of 1.9 million non-Jewish Poles under German occupation (and similar feelings, perhaps, among the Soviets). The second are Polish stereotypes, often deployed for humor, that can be hurtful, but are not at the same level as the first. The final one is the use of the term "anti-Polonism" often used by right-wing groups, and often as a deliberate response to charges of anti-Semitism, as in the response to Gross's studies of Jedwabne, etc. The result is an article that is somewhat confused -- trying to label all three things as equally severe, when the first was a real issue that led to genocide, the second an embarassment (though, as the book you cited points out, there are stereotypes of every nationality), and the last is dubious and makes sense mostly in the context of Polish-Jewish relations. It might solve a lot of issues to try to seperate these three concepts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyhow, those are the major issues I have with the reverted version. We really need to address them before restoring it over and over again. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 04:54, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1-The quote contains information already found in the article.It presents personal views of a single person whos neutrality can't be assured.As such it only serves to promote his own personal opinion on Poles.Its presence in the article serves only to reinforce stereotyping of Poles as anitsemities.If anything the quote can be given as example of negative antipolonistic stereotypes present in Jewish community.If you want its views to be presented why not make summary of the opinions instead of giving the quote ? It would be a better way then to put a wholy biased and POV quote in the text.A summary of the opinion would be better.</p>
<p>2-"The fact that IU's music department used the words "Polophobia and Polophilia" does not mean the term "anti-Polonism" has "been studied in scholarly works" " Please read the intro Anti-Polonism (alternatively spelled antipolonism; also, Polonophobia)</p>
<p>3-"Similarly, the second cite you give is to support that anti-Polonism "has also entered mainstream usage to describe a variety of behaviours and ideologies hostile toward Poles or Poland" Which is correct as the book and several others use the term.(Hartmanns Schlagwort vom "Ausrotten der Polen" : Antipolonismus und Antikatholizismus)</p>
<p>4. "You have trimmed quotes and added editoral comments, as in the case of Yitzhak Shamir, ?" There is nothing incorrect about the fact that Shamir presents Poles as nation of antisemites.</p>
<pre>
"why can't the full quote, and the fact that Shamir is a Pole, stand on its own?"
</pre>
<p>Yitzhak Shamir isn't a Pole.Its true that he was born in Poland, but this isn't of any importance to the text(he probably had Polish citizenship, but being a citizen of Poland and ethnic Poles are two different things).</p>
<p>5"I agree that Polish stereotypes are hurtful, but the Polish cavalry charge myth being "anti-Polonism"?" Such racist stereotypes were used by Germany to justify their aggresion on Poland and Poles by presenting them as stupid and irresponsible people.</p>
<p>6."though, as the book you cited points out, there are stereotypes of every nationality" The fact that Jews were murdered by Hitler doesn't make murder of Poles irrelevent.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Also Also-I removed the links at the intro since they are not supporting the sentence they were supposed to support(they speak nothing about the use of antipolonism).I added sentence about Jewish people using their ethnic background to escape justice.Right now the sentence at the end presents a one sided view of the subject. Restored passages that weren't disputed by you.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I added sentence presenting the other side of view. Restored complete information on persecution in Prussia, which is deleted for unknown reasons <i>In Prussia, and later in Germany, Poles were forbidden to build homes, and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs, financed by the Prussian and German governments. Otto von Bismarck described Poles, as animals (wolves), that "one shoots if one can" and implemented several harsh laws aiming at discrimination of Poles.</i> --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 14:18, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will need to address the above when I have a bit more time (though I think we are moving forward) but this sentence: <i>The other side of the dispute is that people comitting atrocities in communist occupied Poland largely escaped punishment, and some responsible for implementing Stalinist regime in communist occupied Poland for example <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salomon_Morel_9347.html" title="Salomon Morel">Salomon Morel</a> or Halina Wolińska, have used their Jewish ethnicity to accuse attempts to persecute them of being motivated by antisemitism,</i> is troubling to me. Why on earth is it relevant that two Jews may have used anti-Semitism as an excuse (and, incidentally, I question the accuracy of this phrasing, but that is neither here nor there).</dd>
<dd>The only rationale for this is that the author is trying to say: "Sure, anti-Polonism is sometimes misused to shut down charges of anti-Semitism, but so is anti-Semitism used to defend against anti-Polonism." This is problematic in a few ways: 1) It is irrelevant to an article on anti-Polonism, the term doesn't come up, and both Morel and Wolinski are Poles, who lived in Poland almost their whole lives, so why is it here are all? 2) This seems to explicitly excuse the misuse of anti-Polonism to cover anti-Semitism ("Look at what the Jews did to the Poles!"), 3) The phrasing seems to imply that all Stalinists were Jews, 4) There is very little equivalence between the private defenses of these two people and the use of anti-Polonism by the right in response to charges of anti-Semitism, or in the context of a Jewish conspiracy, yet this sentence clearly tried to draw it, 5) The sentence starts: "The other side of the dispute" -- what dispute is being addressed, surely not that anti-Semitism has killed millions, as the previous sentence says? What is this "other point of view" Molobo keeps using in his edit summaries? I don't understand the rationale for this sentence, and it really should be cut. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 09:34, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
It is a responce to a problem you created-by adding a one sided sentence, that pushes an opinionated view on the problem. The absolute claim that no Pole was killed as a result of Polish-Jewish antagonism seems radical in view of such events as Naliboki or Koniuch Massacre or many claims that communists of Jewish background abused Poles as a result of such antagonism.</p>
<p>By putting quotes like that you give impression of trying to influence the view of the article, and changing its neutrality, Like I said it would be better if you would do a summary of views presented in the quotes you want to put. However the fact that many people believe Polish-Jewish antagonism caused Polish casualities as well as Jewish will have to be presented anyway-it doesn't matter if you believe it true or not(Personally do you really think that no Pole was ever hurt or killed as a result of this ?). The fact that people of Jewish ethnicity are using their background to escape justice for murdering Poles is undeniable I am afraid(and Anna Applebaum can be hardly accused of antisemitism by writing on this I believe).Such information is needed to counterbalance any POV on alledged Polish antisemitism-as such accusations are misused. Trying to portay Poles as nation of antisemites is certainly a very hostile action towards Poles and Poland. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 09:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Molobo, with regards to your your last comment, you obviously were looking at an old version of the page, it was a typo that I corrected, as I meant anti-Polonism, as you can see.</dd>
<dd>As for your response, this is all <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, please find some sources for your arguments, I only included sourced quotes, you should feel free to do the same. But there is an underlying problem here: You have stated several times that Jewish Poles are not Poles (For example: "Yitzhak Shamir isn't a Pole.Its true that he was born in Poland...but being a citizen of Poland and ethnic Poles are two different things"). You can't be a Jew and a Pole, I guess. That creates some real problems in the article, as Jewish Poles can be anti-Polish, but Chrisitan Poles can't, no matter how they act. Does that mean any criticism of Poland by a Polish Jew is anti-Polonism? You basically state as much by saying that anyone who says that Poles are anti-Semites is commiting a hostile act. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 10:01, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The sentence in some sense makes the remark concerning the year 1919 superflous repetition of the same information. As the information on the year 1919 is well suported it seems that it's better to retain it instead of the information above.</li>

<dd>While we're at it."<i>In Prussia, and later in Germany, Poles were forbidden to build homes, and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs, financed by the Prussian and German governments.</i>" They were <i>all forbidden</i> to "build <i>homes</i>"? Where did they live? "<i>and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs, financed by the Prussian and German governments</i>" Was that the law introduced in 1908 which met resistance even with the conservative section of the parliament and came to use only <i>once</i>? "<i>Otto von Bismarck described Poles, as animals (wolves), that "one shoots if one can"</i>" The quote is twice in the text and is expressed like it was a strong argument. He described them <i>once</i> as such. "<i>and implemented several harsh laws aiming at discrimination of Poles.</i>" Weasel words concealing what those "harsh laws" were. Did Poles have to wear a star of David or what? Besides, "aimed at discrimination of Poles"? How do you know? "<i>the Polish language was banned from use</i>" Was it completely banned from use? Source? "<i>and Polish children were tortured at school for speaking Polish (Września).</i>" I take it you *summarized* the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGermanisation&amp;diff=26921673&amp;oldid=26875035" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGermanisation&amp;diff=26921673&amp;oldid=26875035" rel="nofollow">source</a> you added earlier. Even in one of the first sentences of that said source, there is a different description: "At first the German teachers tried persuasion." You're stating it like if you spoke Polish at school, you'd get immediately tortured. If you keep disobeying, it makes teachers angry and they punish you, whether by force or formal means. At that time, you could expect violence on the part of teachers. Of course a teacher overdid it when he injured a pupil's skin even at that time, but as the source about this 'torture' describes, it was only an extreme value and caused public outrage. Prove this example was common, if you state it like it was in general the case. Besides, 'torture' is clearly another weasel word, commonly understood in other, more violent and aimed contexts. "<i>Poles were also subject to forced deportations</i>" Only those who came from the Russian part of what had been Poland and didn't have German citizenship, but indeed there were a lot of them, over 26 000. "<i>and German government encouraged and financed settlement of ethnic Germans into Polish areas aiming at their Germanisation.</i>" I do not believe that this had to do with hostility towards Poles but a view evolved from the American and French Revolution that the state must be carried by the nation. Significant characteristic features of a nation are the same language and culture. It was not only the Polish nation that - to put it into your words - "awoke" in the 19th century but with the foundation of the German Empire the German one, too. Now with the said foundation, sections of the population that had a different language and culture than German was included within the borders of the Empire as well. People also spoke Polish, Danish, French, Lithunian or Sorbian. What happened to these non-German groups in the German Empire? They tried to assimilate them, make what is called "German territory" *really* "German", not out of hostility towards these people. Poles were the majority of these national minorities, around 5.5% of the population, but the tensions can only be understood as those between a non-German minority and the state. The political struggle between the German government and the Danes differs only in that they were a larger section of the population, stood more solid behind one another and knew how to defend themselves economically. The state also tried to get the Danish language, a language other than the German, gone, and were comparably unsuccessful. It is not xenophobia, nor Anti-Polonism, because it is not directed against the <i>people</i> but simply against non-German sub-cultures and languages within the German one. If Poles spoke German and adopted the German culture, your "German authorities" were happy. Prove the hostility and hatred you like to imply in the article. As for the sentences I analysed above, find sources. I do not have the time (or desire) to chat with you. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 13:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A racist diatribe published in 1793 (Joachim Christoph Friedrich Schulz's Journey of a Livonian from Riga to Warsaw) was republished in 1941 after the Nazis had conquered Poland, reflecting a trend among German scholars from the eighteenth into the twentieth century to perceive, in the difference between Germany and Poland, a boundary between civilization and barbarism, high German Kultur and "primitive Slavdom" (p. 336).Molobo
<dl>
<dd>The disputed sentence is under the headline "Persecution of ethnic Poles (to 1918)", which means <i>before</i> Nazi Germany. "German Reich" also sounds like 'German Empire', as 'Reich' is the German word for 'Empire' and the German Empire existed until 1918. In that context "conquer of Poland" would be explained as the partitions of Poland. So the sentence is misleading, whether intentionally or not. And where does it read "racist text<b>s</b>"? And what makes you think it was a governmental action? The rest of the sentence is copied completely from the stated source, which is certainly not the best way to deal with a copyrighted source but at least you sticked to the source. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 18:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"<i>and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs</i>" That's where your source about Germanisation comes in. It reads: "<i>As soon as 1832 General Grolmann devised a secret plan, envisaging integration (or Germanisation) of the province, including <b>forced buying up of estates</b>, colonisation by German peasants, integration of Jews from Germany, transferring the Polish gentry and civil servants to other German provinces, strict subjection of the church to the state and abolition of the Polish language in schools. The catholic clergy and the gentry were acknowledged as the most dangerous enemies of Germanisation; it was assumed that the peasants could be won over to the policy of the Prussian government. This plan was effected over the next decade with varying determination, hence periods of repression interwoven with periods of liberalisation.</i>" Firstly, property is not the same as estate. Property is a thing or things that you own, which logically includes an estate but property is not limited to area in which you live. Secondly you ripped the term out of an enumeration, which means cherrypicking of the most extreme statements out of the context of 'Germanisation' and putting them into another - Anti-Polonism. <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Original research</a> or is there any secondary literature on Anti-Polonism or Anti-Polish sentiment or Polonophobia including it? Thirdly, your sentence makes no mention of the quantity of those 'forced buy-out's suggesting that if you were a Pole at that time, your property was automatically targeted for forced buy-outs. That reminds me of the persistent insistence of yours on the sentence "<i>Polish players face discrimination and insults from Germanic sportstmen as shown by the example of Dietmar Kühbauer who refused to hold an interview with Adam Ledwon, saying he "stinks of Poland".</i>" Finally, since you defined historical Anti-Polonism in the wiki-article to "<i>rang[ing] from felonious acts the goal of which was to suppress the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish state</a> to physical extermination of the Polish nation.</i>" and the goal here is undoubtedly Germanisation, ie the spread of German language and culture.<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a></li>

The result of the internal and equally of conditions external to its territory, triply divided between Russia, Austria and Prussia, was an attempt to halt the collapse of the state (fig. 1). Such was the appointment of the Commission of Good Order or the proclamation of one of the first constitutions in the world; the attempt was made too late and was fruitless. Wielkopolska greeted the beginning of the nineteenth century as a part of Prussia. The Prussian state took over the new province severely destroyed by war and disease (in about 1815 the number of inhabitants of the Duchy of Poznań was estimated at barely 776,000). Mainly Catholics lived here, in the majority Poles, but Jews constituted a large minority and with them, most frequently Protestant, Germans (this last group present from the thirteenth century, however had been subject step by step over the years to Polonisation, e.g. the catholic settlers from Bamberg, arriving in the eighteenth century in the area of Poznań). The Prussians built their own feeling of national values and conviction of the civilising mission of the Prussian state. Seeing on the newly taken terrain Polish gentry in oriental style sashes, another language, which at times they referred to as "the rotten local language", another culture and system of values, they looked on the new country practically as nineteenth century Europeans at "wild people from the bush" (Łukasiewicz 1995, p. 44), or as the English at Hindus and Chinese. It was obvious to them that the new country should be civilised and Germanised. Initially Germanisation meant integration regarding law and politics with the remaining parts of Prussia, or Germanisation of the state structure. The Prussian administration, law and legal system were introduced. In truth from the beginning Germans were favoured, but the government allowed, that Poles as jointly subjected "brothers of the Slavonic language" might retain their language and habits. This did not hinder the many Germans coming to the province, in their utter conviction of their own superiority, and so it was obvious to them that soon the Poles would civilise themselves, which for them was synonymous with adopting the German language and culture. From the time of the first partition of Poland came modest numbers of succeeding German settlers, taking up then thinly settled land. By about the mid nineteenth century 40 % of the large estates belonged to Germans (of these 1/3 were royal estates, and the rest were private one, taken as a result of i.e. marriage or taking indebted Polish estates). Whereas German civil servants came to Wielkopolska Province only for a certain time, after which they returned to Germany. On the other hand, the conquered nation, that is the Poles, also did not look with favour on the new government, regarded by them as occupiers. The upper and better-educated layer had a feeling of their own values, long cultural tradition and also valued their own language. Forced to accept foreign citizenship, they did not intend to accept the customs and language of the "Partioners". The lower and less educated classes did not in the beginning have a strong feeling of separate nationality, but they shared the distaste for the Prussians, whose army had behaved badly for a hundred years in the conscious experience of the poor inhabitants of the province. Certainly a cause was that devils represented in pictures of the eighteenth century wore Prussian dress - with wig and plaited pigtail. The nineteenth century rural folk had to accustom themselves by degrees to the fact that also the officials of His Majesty wore such dress. There was also the awareness of religious and linguistic separation (the word German in old Polish means literally dumb). Additionally in the first years after the annexation of the new province, many Germans of a sufficiently suspect reputation became administrators of the new province, who effectively discouraged the new subjects from possible assimilation. The deeds of government and the mutual distaste had the affect that from the beginning possible neighbourliness between both communities and even an improvement of the co-existence was a difficult problem. Even so cooperation between various sections of both communities from time to time improved, also leaders of both nationalities often formed more or less temporary alliances for defence. There were instances equally of Germanisation and Polanisation. In the Napoleonic Wars some German volunteers from Greater Poland fought on the Prussian side, whereas the Poles fought on the side of Napoleon. In the years 1807-1815 Wielkopolska was part of the Duchy of Warsaw formed by the Emperor of the French. At the Congress of Vienna it was again subjected to the rule of the King of Prussia, but it was transformed into a separate Grand Duchy of Poznań, and the king promised the Poles the maintenance of "political existence" within the Prussian administrative organisation, he also promised equal rights for both nationalities. The defeat of the November Uprising, which broke out in 1830 in the Russian Partition, was exploited by the Prussian authorities to abandon the policy of peaceful co-existence. As soon as 1832 General Grolmann devised a secret plan, envisaging integration (or Germanisation) of the province, including forced buying up of estates, colonisation by German peasants, integration of Jews from Germany, transferring the Polish gentry and civil servants to other German provinces, strict subjection of the church to the state and abolition of the Polish language in schools. The catholic clergy and the gentry were acknowledged as the most dangerous enemies of Germanisation; it was assumed that the peasants could be won over to the policy of the Prussian government. This plan was effected over the next decade with varying determination, hence periods of repression interwoven with periods of liberalisation. From the third decade of the nineteenth century, one may observe the first symptoms of the Wielkopolska community organising itself, during which, generally the Germans had less problems with the establishment of organisations of a German character, whilst the Poles in general had to fight hard to establish their own. For the government regarded them, certainly correctly, as a symptom of Polish defence against Germanisation. Finally by about the mid nineteenth century in Wielkopolska the inhabitants were around 70% Poles, 5% Jews and 25% Germans (plus civil servants temporarily in the province). Of the 44 thousand population of the city of Poznań itself, the Poles made up 50%, and the Jews and Germans 25% each (but 75% of the land belonged to the Germans).</p>

2. Wielkopolska Province in the years 1857-1918</p>
<p><br />
2.1. Political conditions of the existence of two archaeologies in the second half of the nineteenth century By the mid nineteenth century it was ever more apparent that the hope for a rapid "self civilisation" of Wielkopolanians by willing Germanisation had been fulfilled to large extent only in relation to the Jewish minority (Grześ, Kozłowski, Kramski 1976). The result of government policy, ever more favouritism of Germans (and the Evangelist persuasion) and discrimination against Poles (and Catholicism), in the mid nineteenth century ever less attempts were made at peaceful coexistence between both nationalities. In exchange the national, religious and cultural separateness of Poles and Germans began to be accented. The Poles succeeded in founding in 1857 the Poznań Society of Friends of Science (Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk Poznańskiego - TPNP) and other cultural institutions such as the theatre in Poznań. One of the landowners of the Wielkopolska Province, the Pole, Edward Raczyński, donated to the city a large library (which however the Prussian authorities succeeded in Germanising). In order to better resist economic pressure Poles organised their own agricultural education, established banks, and societies of an economic nature. This activity was already perceived half way through the sixth decade of the nineteenth century by the provincial government as a threat to the future. From 1858 the Germans took up the idea of the unification of Germany under the Prussian aegis. For Wielkopolska Province it meant an intensification of the policy of Germanisation and increasing the privileges for Germans. The final purpose was the Germanisation of society by the elimination of the Polish language and culture. The Germanisation of elementary schools was begun, though it proceeded with difficulty because of the lack of sufficient numbers of teachers knowing the German language. In 1867 the Grand Duchy of Poznań was incorporated into the North German Union. The victory over France in 1871 caused an increase of nationalism in Germany. From then the Germanising of Greater Poland meant the dislodging and paralysing of the "Polish element" (mainly gentry and clergy as the most aware opponents). Combating opposition against unification, Chancellor Bismark declared the policy known as the Culture Battle. In 1872 schools of a religious persuasion were closed, and the state took up the supervision of education. The estate of the Church was transferred to the supervision of laypersons, monastic orders were dissolved, and the paragraphs of the Prussian constitution assuring the freedom of the Catholic Church were removed. In Wielkopolska the Culture Battle took on a nationalistic and sectarian character. Mainly specially chosen teachers and officials were engaged in Germanisation, there was even a fund for prizes for Germanisation results. When at the end of the 'seventies the Culture Battle action became milder, this did not apply to Wielkopolska. The failure of Germanisation caused the German philosopher E. Hartmann in 1885 to proclaim the slogan - eradication of Slavs on the German territory. The President of the Bydgoszcz Regency, Tiedemann, in 1886 prepared a new Eastern policy programme: Denkschrift betr. einige Massregeln zur Germanisierung der Provinz Posen. During which, he drew attention to the fact that ordinary German inhabitants of the province were unwilling to engage till now in the propagation of Germanness, for they felt uncertain and alien in Greater Poland. The conviction of centuries of settlement in Wielkopolska was to give the German inhabitants self-assurance and convince them of the correctness of elimination of Slavs from the province terrain. In 1886 the Clearance Commission was established to buy up Polish estates. The funds of the Commission were continually increased over the following years, but the final effect was poor. In truth it had succeeded in increasing the overall number of Germans in the province; however the number of Poles as a result of higher natural increase had increased still more, especially on the towns. The price of colonisation was also high; the creation of one German farm cost the government and taxpayers (equally the Polish) 60,000 marks (for comparison a labourer for physical work in Poznań was paid 0.3 marks per hour). In the following years the Polish language was completely abolished in ordinary schools (with the teaching of religion), which provoked strikes by Polish children, quelled by beatings. After a short period of thaw in the years 1890-1894, the government returned to the policies of forced Germanisation. In 1894 on the initiative of German landowners - Hansemann, Kennemann and Tiedemann, the Organisation for the Propagation of Germanness in the Eastern Borders (Verein zur Förderung des Deutschtums in den Ostmarken) was established, called for short Hakata, after the first letters of the surnames of the founders. The organisation demanded the abolition of the use of any Polish at all from schools, the prohibition of the use of Polish at meetings and the closure of Polish newspapers. It joined the struggle for forcing through the proclamation of new laws on evicting Poles and bringing in Germans. In 1904 the settlement law was changed from the aspect of the battle with the greatest threat to German culture - Polish peasants. In 1908 the law of forcible buy out of Polish estates for the needs of German colonisation was announced (it came into force from 1912 to 1914, only 4 estates were expropriated). In order to completely stop the Polish parcelling out of land, from 1914 the government introduced first right of purchase (for the government) and of granting consent for subdivision by local authorities. The policy of discrimination against all classes of Polish society and the Catholic Church caused the acceleration of the process of developing the sense of national awareness among the Polish peasantry, consolidation of all classes of Poles and a growth of anti German bias among them. In the struggle to endure Poles had to learn good organisation and managed to effectively resist Germanisation. The slogan brought forth in the time of the greatest intensification of economic pressure "Your own to your own by your own" not only had an economic note, but also a cultural one. On the other hand, the permanent increase by the government of the privileges of German inhabitants often fuelled a sense of menace for the Poles and the bringing in of anti Polish orientated officials caused a growth of anti Polish feeling among the Germans. In this situation, in spite of periodic attempts at cooperation, also in science, including archaeology, Poznań began to have two faces - Polish and German. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 01:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No I thought we would just move the article together with the talk page and the archives to the new name. A formal vote would be in place before this happens but I'd like to gather some comments before I start it.

<dd>In fact, the vote is not necessary provided that there is a common sense of consensus that this is a good option. In my opinion, the change of the name is well justified, especially in the light of the sources that Molobo presented above. Of course we need some time to get the feeling. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 12:17, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is one more issue about it. Google gives less hits for polonophobia than for anti-Polonism so the choice is not that obvious. Although, it may be the case that anti-Polonism has a good number of hits due to the fact that it is a name of an entry in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 12:38, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's wait a bit and see if anyone rises objections to the rename. I've seen the google results and had the feeling that "anti-polonism" is mostly used in Polish pages (being written or translated by Poles into English), while Polonophobia is more universal. This is just a hunch, only. Nevertheless, we do not have to blindly follow google if there's a consensus that the other name is less controversial and better recognised. --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 15:01, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>. I fully support the idea to move <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">Anti-Polonism</a> to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonophobia.html" title="Polonophobia">Polonophobia</a>. In a way, the fact that even as staunch an advocate of this article as Molobo supports the proposal points to a key problem: Apparently, there is not much awareness of the different implications of "anti-Polonism" and "Polonophobia", respectively. "Polonophobia" simply denotes an irrational fear of or aversion against all things Polish. Thus, it primarily describes an <i>emotion</i> and, by extension, the behaviour resulting from that emotion. On the other hand, the -ism suffix in "anti-Polonism" points to a quite different meaning: typically, "isms" are not just emotional behaviour patterns, but fully fledged, more or less coherent <i>systems of thought</i> usually based on a single premise or a set of premises. E.g., "xenophobia" denotes an emotional response to foreignness, whereas "racism" denotes a system of thoughts, and the resulting complex behaviour, based on the premise that Man is not equal, but that physical differences between races and/or groups determine what rights and positions people should have in society. Of course, some phobias and "isms" go hand in hand, and often enough, an "ism" may be revealed as being an irrational phobia in the guise of a "rational" doctrine. But that does not mean that the concepts are interchangeable - "anti-spiderism", if it existed, would mean something quite different than "arachnophobia". By the same token, "anti-Polonism" is quite different from "Polonophobia".</p>
<p>If the current contents of the article were to be moved to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonophobia.html" title="Polonophobia">Polonophobia</a>, it would still be a soapbox-ish mess of POV-guided original research (yes, attributing the same motivations to Polish Jokes and Auschwitz <i>is</i> original research, and a rather dubious one at that). The advantage of a move: The message of the article would be toned down a bit - claiming that some people might have an irrational <i>fear</i> of Poles is at least somewhat less implausible than postulating the existence of an elaborate inherent <i>doctrine</i> behind phenomena as disparate as those enumerated in the article. It would also vacate the title <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">Anti-Polonism</a> for a better description of how the term is used by certain Polish authors - namely, originally and until now predominantly in the context of "Jewish anti-Polonism", as a rhetoric tit-for-tat response to claims of "Polish anti-Semitism". I and some others have pointed this out and backed it with evidence in the VfD and elsewhere (can't be bothered to look it up now).</p>
<p>For a much better handling of the problem, I recommend to have a look at <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antypolonizm&amp;oldid=2447920" class="external text" title="http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antypolonizm&amp;oldid=2447920" rel="nofollow">pl:Antypolonizm</a>. The Polish article concisely describes the meaning attributed to the term, its usage by whom and for what purpose, and its rather hypothetical character. In short, it describes correctly anti-Polonism as a <i>concept</i>. The English article, on the other hand, seems unable to make the necessary distinction between concept and object. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 22:02, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I support renaming the article, but I oppose Thorstens original research, that would seek to erase mention of persecution of Polish people, by limiting the term to personal phobia's. Clearly that was not the case with material presented. <i>less implausible than postulating the existence of an elaborate inherent</i> doctrine <i>behind phenomena as disparate as those enumerated in the article</i> Another attempt of Thorsten to deny any organsied persecution of Polish people-easly discredited by knowledge about discrimination under German Empire or during World War 2. As far as I know also, Neonazi and Nationalist groups in Germany exist to this day. Why should they have abandoned the traditional racist dislike and hatred towards Poles that characterised those groups in the past ? Seems yet another whitewashing attempt of original research. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 22:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but your above comment strikes me as somewhat confusing. I'm not sure you even understood what I wanted to say. Nobody disputes that nationalist groups in Germany have a dislike of Poles. Nationalists dislike other nations by definition. But the question is, is the term "anti-Polonism" a generally employed concept to describe and understand this phenomenon, either in or outside Poland? In my opinion, it is not, and if it isn't then Wikipedia should not present it that way - period. I also don't quite get what you mean by <i>"Thorstens original research"</i>. Even less do I understand your statement<i>"Another attempt of Thorsten to deny any organsied persecution of Polish people"</i>. I think anyone who cares enough to check my contributions can decide if there is any basis for this accusation. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 23:44, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 1904 a law was made forbiding building new buildings or buying land without agreement from local administration. The law was aimed against Poles and its goal was to block them from buying land. Historia 1871-1939. Anna Radziwiłł and Wojciech Roszkowski.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zeit.de/2004/26/A-PolBoden?page=all" class="external free" title="http://www.zeit.de/2004/26/A-PolBoden?page=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.zeit.de/2004/26/A-PolBoden?page=all</a> Am 28. Juni 1904 beschlossen Nationalliberale und Konservative im Preußischen Herrenhaus mit 207 zu 105 Stimmen eine Novelle zum Ansiedlungsgesetz. Am 10. August trat sie mit der Unterschrift Wilhelms II. in Kraft. Ihre antipolnische Ausrichtung versteckt sich im Paragrafen 13b, wo es gewunden heißt: „Die Ansiedlungsgenehmigung ist im Geltungsgebiete des Gesetzes, betreffend die Beförderung deutscher Ansiedlungen in den Provinzen Westpreußen und Posen, vom 26.April 1886 zu versagen, solange nicht die Bescheinigung des Regierungspräsidenten vorliegt, dass die Ansiedlung mit den Zielen des bezeichneten Gesetzes nicht in Widerspruch steht. Im Alltag bedeutete diese juristisch verschraubte Klausel: Hunderte von Anträgen polnischer Bauwilliger wurden jetzt abgelehnt. In den Akten stand dann vereinfacht: „Weil XY Pole ist.“</p>
<p>All those sources were presented to the user Sciurinæ (who isquestioning the fact of Poles being forbidden from buying land or building homes). Neverthless the user known previously as Nightbeast ignores those sources and continues to vandalise the article, trying to delete or show as dubious all mention of persecution of ethnic groups by Germany. Molobo</p>
<p>I am afraid to say that as usual the sources have been again ignored by Sciurinæ Molobo</p>

I will not comment on the rest of your tirade, so let's try to filter out useful information. I guess you think these two sources would dismiss my suspicion about the sentence "<i>In Prussia, and later in Germany, Poles were forbidden to build homes</i>". Well, that suspicion was justified. I've just read <a href="http://www.dradio.de/dlr/sendungen/merkmal/257220/" class="external text" title="http://www.dradio.de/dlr/sendungen/merkmal/257220/" rel="nofollow">this text</a> and of course the two sources of you and I got a whole different picture. Owing to the Ostflucht, the percentage of Germans in the Eastern part of the German Empire was diminishing as opposed to the government's plans so these areas were more and more polonised (to put it in your words) while the government wanted it germanised. So they <i>did</i> have a reason other than just hating Poles, as you would love the text to read. Now your sources are betraying you. It reads "in den Provinzen Westpreußen und Posen" (= the province West Prussia and the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Posen_fbc9.html" title="Province of Posen">Province of Posen</a>), not whole Prussia let alone whole Germany. It doesn't read "in Prussia and later Germany" either. When was that law in force? In 1701 until 1918? No, your sources reads it was imposed on "28. Juni 1904" (June 28, 1904) Molobo, so it could only be in force between 1904 and at most until 1918. Nicknamed 'Obserwator' your view was also challenged in the forum you were later banned from <a href="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?p=540051" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?p=540051" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> so who's in effect the one ignoring sources? I was right in guessing you committed a propagandistic logic fallacy in the shape of a hasty generalization of the place and time that Poles were forbidden to built houses and a glossing over concerning the reasons for the forbiddance. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 15:42, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article needs more sourcing, such as the statements attributed to Frederick the Great. From the dialogue here on talk it looks like strong feelings are at stake.

<p>I have to strongly support the article, and especially the section on Polish jokes. I was shocked to hear the US my first Polish Joke. I couldn't understand why nationals of Copernicus, Chopin, Kosciusko, Pulaski, and Paderewski the general public understood as unintelligent. I was personally asked: Are Polish as stupid as they say they are?</p>
<p>So why would there be so much suggestion in the US that Polish are stupid? I think this article hits the nail on the head. While jokes have always been around about many nations, the plethora of Polish jokes and the depth of their suggestion is outstanding. It makes perfect sens that Nazi Germany would develop and spread them. Why, even in WWII Warsaw Polish were proud to repeat German jokes! The big difference is that the Western world, Great Britain and the US, accepted this propaganda. Why? The answer lies in the political issues of the conclusion of WWII. The British and the American governments betrayed the Polish nation. Much can be said about this fact. To save their faces a pro-Russia propaganda has been introduced and by implication anti-Polish. Even though RAF was thankful to Polish pilots for their service during the Battle for England, the English nation wanted Polish nationals out of their country. The sentiments of British people changed enormously toward the Polish soldiers from viewing them as heroes to viewing them as nuisance.</p>
<p>This is how the jokes found a breeding ground in English speaking world.</p>

<dd>I am sorry but that is one silly conspiracy theory. I highly doubt the Nazis were responsible for the spread of Polish Jokes in the United States and the English-speaking world. Such jokes were probably around long before the rise of the Nazis. Maybe you should do some more research on the issue before puttinh forward such a strange idea.</dd>

<dd>The Polish joke info is wrong - it quotes a book, the Mirth of Nations, which sets up a strawman theory that these jokes originated in Nazi Germany, and then proceeds to prove that this isn't the case (the next paragraph starts "there are serious problems with this argument..."). The article previously simply mentioned the theory, without the fact that it wasn't true! All you need to do is flip forward a couple pages in the Google Books reference to see that this is a case.

<dd>All I have to go on is the book you yourself quoted in the article, which actually argued the opposite of the point your quoted it for. It may have been the case that the German government spread Polish jokes, but the book argues pretty convincingly that these jokes did not originate during the Nazi regime, and that they are unrelated to American Polish jokes. The book also argues that it was unlikely that they were used as propaganda. Regardless, you should not <i>delete your own sources</i> when they disagree with you -- the book says these jokes did not originate in Nazi Germany, and your latest edit just deleted the book and reinserted the assertion that they did without any support at all. That doesn't mean that Polish jokes aren't mean, or anti-Polish, or whatever, but you can't just delete evidence you don't like, especially when you were the one who first quoted it, even if incorrectly. It is not how research should be done.--<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 18:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine, that would be good - but it does not justify removal of sourced material arguing the other point of view, especially when that source was good enough for you when you thought it supported your point, and only erased after it contradicted you. I'll wait until tomorrow, but the language you deleted should be restored, if for no other reason than to address the concerns of the anonymous editor who first posted in this section, drawing a historical connection between American Polish jokes and the Nazis, a connection which the book you cited catagorically denies. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 18:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I appreciate your comments on my comment about Polish jokes in the US. I didn't quote any books.</p>
<p>I think bringing in ideas for discussion which are controversial is not wrong. Polish history has been misrepresented for a long time and ideas have to be explored. My main question is why are Polish jokes so popular in the US? They are more popular then other ethnic jokes. I understand that most countries have jokes about their neighboring nations. But the fact of Polish jokes popularity does make a statement. I think jokes are a subconsious response to a lack of understanding or capacity to comprehend. This is why in Poland a number of jokes has been created about the Holocaust (an unthinkable historical event). If you can't understand why you may as well joke about it to come to terms with a historical event.</p>

<dd>Polish jokes have been told in America since the 19th century. And they aren't really Polish jokes per se, as much about jokes about 'stupid immigrants' that were recycled with every new wave of immigrants, to pick on the new kid in town, so to speak. They were around here far earlier than WW 2. These were the same jokes that the Italians and Irish heard, and then were redirected at the new Polish immigrants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the stereotype of Polish-Americans is that they are stupid, but then the Irish have the burden of drunkenness, the Jews of cheapness, the Blacks of laziness and a proclivity for criminal behavior, etc. No matter where you are from, or what your ethnic heritage is, there will be jokes, insults and streotypes about you. With the huge influx of Hispanic and Asian immigrants into this country, they are now often the target of these jokes. For instance if you happen to be from India you are immediately assumed to work in a convenience store (e.g. Apu). The fact that Indians living in America often enjoy a much higher economic status and level of education is irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have read somewhere that these ethnic jokes are used as a form of cultural integration by Americans. Much like the new kid at school, you get made fun of before you become accepted. Part of the reason why it may seem like the jokes are more common than about other ethnicities, which I doubt they are, is that a lot of times Americans feel that an appropriate way to acknowledge the fact you are from another country is to insult you with some stereotype about your people. So if you tell someone you are from Poland, a lot of times they will say some stupid comment about it. Of course that often reveals more about the type of person you are dealing with more than anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That being said I doubt any of these jokes are really spoken in hatred or meant to incite atrocities or violence. If anything it indicates a form of self consciousness that a lot of native Americans feel about their lack of a definable cultural heritage. Talk to a 3rd or 4th generation American about their ethnic background and you'll rarely get any one group coming it at above 1/4 when they recite their litany of fractions. As soon as you hit the 3rd generation, in which both yourself and your parents were born here, you probably identify yourself more as an American anyway, regardless of where your ancestors came from. Even if you have a Polish last name those jokes just don't bother you as much and you might have no problem repeating them. Repeter 06:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can create an article about anti-this and anti-that. That's just plain silly. No serious encyclopedia has an article about "anti-polonism".

<dd>Since I'm sure that you know Google like the back of your hand, I expect you enlighten Volkerfreund about his mistake of not having excluded all the hits generated because of Wikipedia. Entering "Anti-Polonism wikipedia", you can see that these hits are approaching 700. On the other hand, are about 300 hits (excluding wikis) a real argument? Then ihgfedcba would be an existent word too. Volkerfreund, it's useless arguing that the word does not exist and worth pointing out only that it's not widespread at all. As for Molobo's implication concerning <i>Volk</i> ... I mean, implying that the guy who has recently described you, Molobo, and other Poles as "gang" could in any way be comparable to the Nazi's calling Poles bandits, or that Volkerfreund, whose nickname most likely has nothing to do with <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volk.html" title="Volk">Volk</a> but the fact that on this talk:page, some months ago, a user said his name was Volker (and Volkerfreund = friend of Volker), don't you be too quick in *identifying Nazism*. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 18:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the word studied, as there is no evidence that the phenomenon of anti-Polonism is studied as such (with one exception of the works of Prof. Jerzy Robert Nowak). There are various studies that refer to anti-Polonism which is another story. Maybe the formulation:</p>

<dd>'Several different' may be better. To me, 'various' meant something like 'many different', which is too bombastic for the rare amount of the studies. However, the Oxford dictionary refers to it as 'several different', and defines 'several' as 'more than two but not many', which is a fair description for the amount of studies, I think. The web-dictionary of Cambridge (thanks to you I know of it) refers to it as 'many different'<a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=87796&amp;dict=CALD" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=87796&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> and 'several' as 'some; an amount that is not exact but is fewer than many'<a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=72202&amp;dict=CALD" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=72202&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. So before questioning either definition of 'various', it might be an idea to directly state 'several different', to cut a long story short. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 21:35, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Poland lost approximately a third of its population.

The Nazis targeted Poles and Jews for different reasons: Poles only in Poland, Jews throughout the German sphere of influence. The killing of Polish Jews had nothing at all to do with "anti-Polonism". The tally of victims in Poland was approximately 3 million Jews - 90% of the Jewish population; 97% of the Jews who remained under Nazi occupation - and (according to current estimates) between 1.5 and 2 million ethnic Poles, or about 7% of the ethnic Polish population. The pre-war population of Poland was about 36 million, consisting of 27 million ethnic Poles, 4 million Ukrainians, 3.3 million Jews, 1 million Germans and 700,000 others (Lithuanians, Belarusians, Czechs, Gypsies etc.). The loss of "one third of the population" would imply that 12 million people were killed, a gross overstatement. Conceivably, total losses might have reached 5 million or 15%. The term "Jewish Pole" is also never used in Polish-Jewish discourse. The normal shorthand is Poles and Jews; more formally, Catholic Poles or ethnic Poles (not quite equivalent, since there were ethnic Poles who were Protestants, atheists, etc. - even a few Muslims) and Polish Jews.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i></dd>

<dd>The commonly given figures are 6 million dead Jews and 6 million dead Poles, with an intersection of 3 million Polish Jews (which is the commonly used term). These 3 million certainly included some who <i>"had a Jewish family members [...] three generations ago"</i>. However, the majority of Jewish citizens in pre-war Poland formed an ethnically distinct group, a significant proportion of which did not speak correct Polish (don't have the exact numbers handy now). That about sums it up. No matter how you look at it, "one third" will be way out of reach. By the way, does anybody find this rhetoric of "we are better because we've had much more deads than you did" as pathetic and disgusting as I do, no matter who it is coming from?

In EU they just live from the money of net contributors and in Iraq they want, in addition, win things as a »Trojan donkey of America«. They only act up and are not even able to introduce a resonsnable car make to the world market. These moods are perhaps blatantly oversubscribed, but they are by no means projections. The reserve against Polish joining EU, which was immediately indicated by Eurobarometer in Germany, <b>as well as the low position of Poland on the German thermometer of the sympathy signify that in the German society there are still many aversions which are older than the ones resulting from the "population exchange" in 1945</b>. <b>And, what is more important and alarming, people who are self-corrective with respect to this part of German tradition are weaker than those with respect to other historically laden cases like for instance German-French, German-Russian, German-American or German-Israeli relationships.</b> --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 19:40, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I strongly suggest listing current polonophobia or anit-polonism (1990-2005) in separate section. It is very much widespread type of xenophobia eg. in Germany. Order of wiki article suggests it disappeared on 1945...</p>
<p>I also don't understand so long passages about LPR and overuse of polonophobia. It is very much marginal movement. Populist minority exists in any country and in Poland it is not more vocal and overusing it than in other countries.</p>

<dd>While I agree that there was no intention to absorb the entire Ukraine into Poland at the time, despite the fierce nationalist policies in the interbellum even Galicia and Volhynia were not fully swallowed, Ukraine's independece per se is too a selfless motive for waging a bloody war. The goal for Poland was to contain Russia (and no one can blame it for that BTW). For that it needed to wrestle control of Ukraine out of pro-Russian faction and from Russia itself because Ukraine was not able militarily to do it on its own. How far would it go would have depended on the success. No need to bring here some selfless motives never heard of in international politics.

<p>By Irina Kobrinskaya Posted: Thursday, February 3, 2005 ARTICLES Polish News Bulletin Publications Date: January 1, 1900</p>
<p>The following is a summary of an article, featured in Rzeczpospolita, by Irina Kobrinskaya, political researcher at the World Economy and International Relations Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. <i>The ironic saying that kurica ne ptica, Polsha ne zagranica ("chicken not bird, Poland no foreign country") conveys the essence of Russia's paternalism towards the Central European countries. No wonder, therefore, that Poland's continuing efforts to boost its international weight have been met in Russia with at least incredulity. The news that Poland would manage a separate zone in Iraq was initially received in Moscow as a joke. The tone of all comments was the same: a small country acting as if it was an international power. Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Washington, and London are discussing the future of the world and the Polish frog puts its leg forward for shoeing. The Russians felt that the Poles were being more royalist than the king, which they thought comical but also highly irritating.</i></p>

<dd>Molobo, thanks for pasting a relatively short piece this time. Now to the issue, if you check the web-search hits, you will see that Poland is much more uncommon in the proverb. The reason was that Poland was not the easiest country to get a travel permit in the USSR. The easiest was to travel to go to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slanchev_Briag_26e7.html" title="Slanchev Briag">Slanchev Briag</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>.

<p><i>If you don't know Russian, how can you know Russian proverbs.</i>Huh ? The proverb is widely known in Poland as an example of imperialistic attitude towards Poland. There is no need for knowledge of Russian language to know what it means, as it is frequently translated(myself I was born in times when forced learning of Russian language in Poland during Soviet occupation was slowly abandonded and could learn fortunetly English and German instead). <i>Poland is not the most common word in this proverb.</i> I am only interested what it means towards Poland, as towards other countries it could have different meaning as seen by above statement by non-Polish author. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Molobo. First of all thank you for not pasting the entire article here. I read it. Firstly, the proverb is nowhere in the text. Only in the article's summary. That it neither the journalist nor the person he interviews mention it. Secondly, this is a discussion between two Poles. So, if you are saying that the prevailing view in Poland about this proverb is the nonsense you wrote, their sticking to it would not have proven anything. The true meaning of the proverb is shown by the web-search which produces less hits for Poland than for other countries. Non-abroad is simply something where it was easy for Soviets to get, because to get to a true "abroad" was impossible. Be it Bulgaria, Mongolia, Poland or East Germany, the proverb was a sarcasm about the Soviet travel restrictions and not about this or that country. I will not be responding anymore to this rant of yours and will leave it to others to judge. You refused to keep my explanation in the article and replaced it with your polonocentric views. Very well, the explanation will then be at talk and your ignorant explanation in the article will be marked. This is not something I am terribly concerned about to spend more time to restore the correct info. I view this as a fringe article and just stopped by to make some obvious correction. Please stay on topic and don't overload the page with another bunch of outbursts such as your pride that you "fortunately don't know Russian". I wish I knew Polish to enjoy poetry of Mickiewicz in original, because I very much liked it in the Ukrainian translation. But it would also allow me to comment more of the nonsense prop stuff you use as your sources. That is if I had nothing better to do. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:34, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course it is true that many Poles made their careers in Russia. Until the advent of harsh anti-Polish laws in the later part of 19th century they even formed a large part of that country's local administration, business and so on. However, this was mostly true to the period before the short romance Alexander had with liberalism came to an end. Also, Alexander graciously agreed to allow the Polish authorities (in the period when the Congress Kingdom still had much autonomy) to open an university in Warsaw (the Vilnian academy was much, much older). His son closed it down after 15 years, however. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 20:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of the concerns of misuse seem valid to me as the article mentions it has been misused and the category had too many names of people who were just Communist Polish Jews. Skimming the current article I don't think it's misusing the notion that badly. However another strain of editors seem to insist that no such thing as anti-Polish sentiment exists for reasons I find baffling. Although the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> once had similar, and I think possibly related, problems. I think initially it was felt that it shouldn't even be an article because it would be misused, it was not a notable topic, or because Anti-Catholicism is sensible.

                       BY JOE BABCOCK
                       DAILY NEWS WRITER 
                              
                       The New Yorker magazine is catching flak for publishing 
                       a cartoon that angry New Yorkers are calling a Polish 
                       joke.
                       The drawing by veteran cartoonist Bob Weber appeared in 
                       the Feb. 19 issue of the magazine and depicts two kids 
                       chatting at a bus stop with the caption, "My parents 
                       named me Zbigniew because they were drunk."
                       Zbigniew is a traditional Polish name.
                       In the predominantly Polish neighborhood of Greenpoint, 
                       Brooklyn, some residents who had seen the cartoon were 
                       shocked.
                       "I'm assuming the person who drew this hates Polish 
                       people," said Anna Doda, a music store owner who has 
                       been in the U.S. for 20 years.
                       "The people from different nations, they drink, they get 
                       drugs; so why did they make the joke about Polish 
                       people?"
                       Others were less surprised.
                       Martin, a 19-year-old hardware store worker, wrote it 
                       off to a double standard in Americans' acceptance of 
                       ethnic jokes.
                       "You make fun of blacks or Hispanics and you're a 
                       racist," he said. "So, instead, people say 'Yeah, let's 
                       make fun of the Polish.'"
                       The New Yorker sent a form response to readers who 
                       complained via e-mail, apologizing and claiming "the 
                       tacit assumption ... is that the child is not of Polish 
                       origin." The e-mail said the intended joke was that 
                       Zbigniew is an unusual name.
                       That was the explanation New Yorker editor David Remnick 
                       gave the Daily News.
                       "The heart of the joke is the difficulty in saying the 
                       name; there's no ethnic slur," he said, but when asked 
                       if the cartoon would have been published if it had 
                       featured an Asian or African name, Remnick responded, "I 
                       don't know."

<p>I was surprised not to find any info in the article concerning the very common feeling of inferiority and/or shame some Poles have (for being Poles, I guess) especially when visiting other countries. I would think this is related (since it's probably a consequence) of anti-Polish discourse. 201.25.232.61 02:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)Rodolfo</p>
