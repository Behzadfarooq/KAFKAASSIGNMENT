<dd>I think I would be far easier to just redirect Anti-Armenian sentiment to this page, since they are more or less synonyms. I think people are more likely to type in Anti-Armenianism than Anti-Armenian sentiment, and (IMPO) I think that Anti-Armenian sentiments are (in some places) deeply rooted enough to deserve their own term. Also consider the terms <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Italianism_6e78.html" title="Anti-Italianism">Anti-Italianism</a> with only 560 Google results, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Turkism_482a.html" title="Anti-Turkism">Anti-Turkism</a> (970), <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Irishism_7387.html" title="Anti-Irishism">Anti-Irishism</a> (413) not to mention <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Slavism_f231.html" title="Anti-Slavism">Anti-Slavism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Hellenism_8fa3.html" title="Anti-Hellenism">Anti-Hellenism</a> and a slew of other 'unofficial' terms that seem to comply with wikipedia policies. But, I would still wait for more opinions. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 03:11, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the following piece from this section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A number of Georgians have also blamed Armenians for supporting the Abkhazian separatists and even helping them commit "genocide" against ethnic <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgians.html" title="Georgians">Georgians</a>. One Georgian newspaper in 2006 claimed that Armenia was plotting against Georgia, and was planning to "occupy" Abkhazia in order to gain sea access, as a part of a "Great Armenia" plan.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is referenced by Regnum.ru (<a href="http://www.regnum.ru/english/739111.html" class="external free" title="http://www.regnum.ru/english/739111.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.regnum.ru/english/739111.html</a>). However, it should be noted that Regnum republished this article from the APA (the Azeri Press Agency in Baku). It is a false allegation intended to create tension between Armenians and Georgians. The solid truth is that most Georgians do not allege that Armenians committed "genocide" against them and do not believe that they intend to create a "Greater Armenia" to encompass Abkhazia. Such an allegation is absurd.</p>
<p>For the record, no information from the Azerbaijani media should be seen as reliable. Take this piece that APA published back in February <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:6sBmmi1nuWgJ:en.apa.az/news.php%3Fid%3D20470+Igdir+residents+say+their+soldiers+would+ruin+Armenia+if+war+begins&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:6sBmmi1nuWgJ:en.apa.az/news.php%3Fid%3D20470+Igdir+residents+say+their+soldiers+would+ruin+Armenia+if+war+begins&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It describes a mass protest against the slogan "We all are Armenians, we all are Hrant" that took place on February 5 in the Igdir Province of Turkey. One villager supposedly claimed that "Armenians beheaded my ancestors in the Sacrifice Feast" (a line I find deeply offensive, not just as an Armenian but also as a Christian). Later, however, a friend of mine from Turkey (an ethnic Turk) told me that nothing was reported about it in Hurriyet, the biggest daily in Turkey. In fact, Hurriyet reported that the Igdir Province was under 30 inches of fresh snow that day, rendering its main highways inaccessible (thus also proving that the image included in this article is false). -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 20:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not realize this was a republished article, I thought they were just using Baku for a few statistics. They seem to quote several different papers through the article, including the Armenian paper <i>Golos Armenii</i> and the <i>Azg</i>. In any case, the bottom of the article does state that neither the Georgian ambassador to Armenia nor other Georgian papers could prove or find the sources mentioned in the <i>Aisi</i>.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 21:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was considering adding the Azeri cartoonist Kerim Kerimov Mammadhan, who has made around 4000 mostly Anti-Armenian cartoons (depicting Armenia as a giant snake, Armenia trying to take over the world, Armenians causing death, terrorism, lots of ugly caricatures, etc.), to the 'Anti-Armenianism by individuals' section. However, the only source I can find, besides copies of an old news articles, is his misspelled English-translation official homepage.

<dd>Has the irony been lost on him that his efforts to equate the Armenian people with Nazi Germany look almost exactly like the kinds of images the Nazis used to demonize the Jews? Really, just compare these two images <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Liberators-Kultur-Terror-Anti-Americanism-1944-Nazi-Propaganda-Poster.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Liberators-Kultur-Terror-Anti-Americanism-1944-Nazi-Propaganda-Poster.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>,<a href="http://www.kerimkerimov.az/pics/karikatures/karikatura2_15.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kerimkerimov.az/pics/karikatures/karikatura2_15.jpg" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, it's easy to see where Kerim is getting his ideas. I'd say he's a notable enough person to be included, since he's a prominent scientist in Azerbaijan. I'm under the impression that sites with extremist views can be used when describing the individual's activities and views. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 01:13, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Going back to Augustgrahl, I was actually just about to mention the striking similarity these cartoons have with those made in Nazi Germany depicting the Jews. Actually, a better comparison would be with those cartoons produced in the Arab World depicting the Jews as "expansionist Zionists". -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 01:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's not true I think Azeris hate us more than Turks, for all we have done, 1) occupying there land, 2) committing a massacre, 3) causing more than 1 million to flee there own country so we can inhabit our ancient lands. I don't have any hate towards Azeris or Turks either, but Azeris are more Anti-Armenian they are number one on our list, Turkey can't do anything there in the worlds spot light there role models, but Azerbaijan can, I like them, but not there government.

<dd>I never said that no Azeris hate Armenians, but rather that we need to be aware that not all Azeris feel this way about us. In my view, the only way for the Armenians and the Armenian nation to advance internationally is to prevent themselves from becoming as hateful as this. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 02:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That true I was going a little overboard sorry, if you fight hate with hate it leads up to bad things, I know what you mean now, not all Azeris, I agree. Artaxiad 02:06, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>By hating you would only prove their point that were racist. I don't remember seeing anti-Azeri cartoons in any Armenian newspapers <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVartanm_31d8.html" title="User:Vartanm">Vartanm</a> 02:06, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that these cartoons speak for themselves. They don't succeed in making Armenians look bad but rather they give the Azerbaijani nation and its people a bad name. We need to remember what kind of government that the Azerbaijanis are under at present. While Ilham Aliyev dances with his wife Mehriban Aliyeva at balls in Baku and receives oil revenue in his back pocket, oil workers are toiling, refugees are starving, and democrats are being tortured. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 02:12, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sentence "According to Armenian and most Western scholars, during World War One, the Turkish government massacred up to 1.5 million Armenians in a genocide known as the Armenian Genocide." does not have a neutral point of view. I changed it with "In addition, during World War I Ottoman Empire is accused of committing Armenian Genocide."</p>
<p>Also can someone provide citations for the sentences "The position of the Turkish government is that the Armenians who died were casualties of the expected hardships of war, the casualties cited are exaggerated, and that there was no genocide." and "Alparslan TÃ¼rkeÅŸ, a late Turkish politician considered by many to have fascist views". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicrain_f206.html" title="User:Micrain">Micrain</a> 17:01, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is nothing POV about Armenian and most Western scholars. If you want sources I can provide planty. While your version that Ottoman Empire is accused of committing Armenian Genocide is a clear Turkish POV that is trying to deny the genocide. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVartanm_31d8.html" title="User:Vartanm">Vartanm</a> 17:16, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, the sentence I changed was incorrect since the Turkish Government is a different government than the Ottoman Government and it cannot be accused of what happened during the conflict. Secondly, this article is not directly about Armenian Genocide so it is not good to discuss the number of people died during the conflict, POVs of Armenians, Western scholars and Turks in this article. It is better to refer the reader the article about Armenian Genocide and let the reader decide what he/she will think after he/she reads that article. Thirdly, it is incorrect to mention "most Western scholars" because there is no quantitative data which shows how many people think the conflict was a genocide or not. You may find me plenty of Western scholars that support the conflict can be classified as genocide, as I can find you plenty of sources that support the idea that it cannot be classified as genocide. Fourthly, please provide sources for the sentence about the position of the Turkish Government and Talat PaÅŸa, or it should be continued to be tagged as "citation needed" which you erased. Lastly, I am supporting Turkish POV as you are supporting the Armenian POV but basing your argument on deletion of the work I did on my POV is not nice. Every POV should be discussed about every subject regardless of our personal views. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicrain_f206.html" title="User:Micrain">Micrain</a> 18:45, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, yes and no. It was the Ottoman Empire and not Turkey, but as a succesor state to Ottoman empire, Turkey can be held accountable for what happened to the Armenian people. Secondly, this article is about anti-Armenianism and the Armenian Genocide is very much relevant to the article. there is nothing wrong about including general information about the Armenian Genocide. Thirdly, see the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> for the most Western scholars. Fourthly, the fact you asked for was for Astalan Turkes, and I provided a neutral source from Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. And Lastly, I'm sorry if you feel that I deleted your work, but in Wikipedia we try to be as neutral as possible and stay away from Armenian and Turkish POV. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVartanm_31d8.html" title="User:Vartanm">Vartanm</a> 20:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I donâ€™t the article states that every person who denies AG is <i>racist</i> in the strictest sense of the word, in the same way not every Holocaust denier is a racial antisemite. There is nothing to suggest <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> is a racist, though he has often questioned the validity of the Holocaust. We can, however, assume that, in the same way Ahmadinejad is violently anti-Israel, that most AG deniers have some opposition to the Armenian Republic and to Armenians as an international cultural entity. There may be exceptions in both cases, but we are more concerned with the general rule. The definition if Antiarmenianism is made clear in the first two paragraphs of the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 23:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO, I think no one's got a phobia of us, rather it is hate of us. Anti-Armenianism represents hate and Armenophobia is fear. Like, I understand the reasoning behind the word "Islamophobia" let's say, cause of Islamic radicalism and the sheep-like behaviour of the American public into thinking all Muslims are "evil" and they are terrified of them. I don't see that kind of phobia towards us, rather it is government sponsored hate towards the Armenians. But that's just how I see it...nonetheless they are both negative to our people and I would support anything you guys chose. Google has more hits for Anti-Armenianism but that's only cause wikipedia uses it. Also, I agree that Armenophobia is short and easy to locate as Vartan put it. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 23:53, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While hate and fear directly are connected, I am going to say that (with some exceptions) hate of Armenians is stronger than actual fear. However, it probably should be listed as an alternative term, and a redirect page for that term would not hurt. I don't think a page move in necessary. Plus we would have to reset all the pages that redirect here already. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 00:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
