<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anthropology VS. Sociology</span></h2>
<p>What is the difference between Anthro and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a>? I have read a simplistic view that anthro is for people different from the researcher and socio for people like the resarcher.</p>
<p>The term "sociology" was invented by Comte as applied positivism, and sociology as a discipline has remained strongly positivistic in a strict sense. Anthropology comes out of an entirely different set of traditions, mainly comparative law (sociology is anti-law), anthropo-geography, and Vokerpsychology. The first chair in anthropology was 1869, in Berlin. The people who made up the anthropology at Cambridge when Malinowski went there were mainly appointed in psychology, and in the tradition of Volkerpsychologie. Sociology departments were founded separately, beginning in the 1880s, and by that time the major theoretical icon was Herbert Spencer. Where positivism was consistently aligned with political authoritatianism, anthropology (under these heads and as it coalesced) was consentently aligned with democratic and republican political sentiments. Sociological were first introduced in anthropology in Britain by E. B. Tylor in 1885, and then by Radcliffe-Brown in the 1930s. The institutional section in this article is way off the point. It should be replace by something that fits the title. M Leaf.</p>

<dd>I was wondering the exact same thing. I'm looking at this and thinking that it's not worth studying because, if I'm right, genetics have something to do with culture, which of course is a duh statement if you look different. However, I see that sociology is the greater of the social sciences because it includes human behavior. I don't really see too much talk about human behavior here. It seems like a bunch of rubbish and looking at really old societies. "Digging through the past". So how can this be one of the greater social sciences? I think I read somewhere that it takes bits and pieces of the other sciences, but I really don't see it mixing them all together for a big picture, which sociology does. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberman_3feb.html" title="User:Cyberman">Cyberman</a> 00:45, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Soc is the study of human social interactions, while anthro is the study of humans, including our evolution and development, our language, our culture and our past civilizations. The current article on anthro is terrible, IMO and does not do anthropology justice. They both are behavorial sciences; anthro focuses on the four sub disciplines of physical, cultural, linguistic and archaeology. Sociology focuses on the origins, institutions, organizations and development of society. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Potter_73b9.html" title="User:Jason Potter">JPotter</a> 20:50, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The way I like to think about the differences begins with the 19th century origins of the two disciplines. Sociology traces its roots to the most enduring social policy question to emerge out of the industrial revolution: "With all these positive and progressive changes occuring in society, why are the poor still around?" An early economist name Frederic LePlay in London was the first to articulate the problem and begin systematic investigations of the possible causes. Thus, for me, sociology has its roots in the analysis of class differences. As it has evolved, it has incorporated other problems and research programs, such as gender and race. Yet, class continues to be an enduring framework for understanding the primary mission of the discipline. Anthropology has its 19th century roots in a different problem altogether: "Does it matter in some ethical, moral, or aesthetic sense that people around the world look different from each other?" The earliest anthropologists were physical scientists who try to measure the differences in the way people looked and then tried to relate these differences to behavior. Anthropology has its roots in racial science. A major revolution in the discipline took place in England and the U.S. just before the First World War. Rather than seeing race as the explanation of behavior, anthropologists, especially Boas at Columbia University, but also to some extent Malinowski at University Colle</dd>
</dl>
<p>ge, London, began to see racial thinking as the behavior to be explained. Anthropology has evolved to include issues of class and gender in its analyses, but the deconstruction of the explanatory power of the race concept continues to be the primary motivation for focusing on local communities and global processes. 140.192.149.26 16:18, 30 September 2005 (UTC)Rotenberg.</p>
<p>In part, the differences between anthropology, sociology, and history are best seen as artifacts of 19th century academic posturing. These disciplines are heavily overlaped. However one way of thinking about it is to notice the names. Sociolology - society - is a top down approach, begining with the notion that there is this society thing in the modern industrial world that can be studied in whole or in its constituent parts and even looked at historically. Anthropology - Anthro (man) - is a bottom up approach that begins with the notion of people and studies them, thier technologies and institutions, across time and space. History - (story) - is also a study of people and society but it is done through the medium of the written word, an examination of the written record of the past.<a href="../../../d/h/b/User%7EDHBoggs_f312.html" title="User:DHBoggs">DHBoggs</a> 04:33, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When I began studying anthropology at the University of Chicago I asked this same question, and I was told that "anthropology is what anthropologists do." Sounds about right to me! Mayser 19:59, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, the main difference between anthropology and sociology is not in the objects of the research (which overlap tremendously) but in the methods: Anthropological research (socio-cultural anthropology) is based on long-term participant observation, whereas sociology bases itself on structured quantitative or qualitative surveys designed to test a pre-formulated hypothesis. One will rarely find sociological research based on any long term participant observation. Likewise one will rarely find anthropological research extensively based on data gleaned from structured surveys analysed statistically. Participant observation consists of living with the 'natives' and participating in their day-to-day activities in order to 1) identify recurring cultural patterns which take the form of ideas &amp; beliefs, practices, and artifacts; and 2) gain an understanding of the meanings and motivations underlying these patterns. (added by Flo - 18 April 2006)</p>
<p>It is true that sociology relies more on surveys and less on participant observation than anthropology, but that is not a useful distinction. Participant observation is a technique used in all the social sciences, even sometimes in history, and it is certainly used in sociology. Further, the anthropological literature is repleat with the use of surveys and statistics, some branches such as Etnoscience and Cognative Anthropology being particularly dependant on them, not to mention the use to which both statistics and various kinds of surveys are utelized for anthropological linguistincs medical anthropology and, of course, archaeology.<a href="../../../d/h/b/User%7EDHBoggs_f312.html" title="User:DHBoggs">DHBoggs</a></p>

<dd>I think a major difference is that sociology sees humans as discreet beings seperatable from their activities (culture) and, though influenced by, the creators of culture. Modern anthropology sees humans and culture as a cohesive structure with influence going both ways. Also, most anthropologists believe in a much more fluid and self-determining relationship between culture, society, and individuals than it seems sociologists do. Additionally, some anthropologists view this relationship as evolutionary... So, as a tool for interpreting and manipulating a society within the same society, sociology isthe better tool. As a tool for understanding a group of people, their culture, their physiological adaptations, their history, and their relatedness to others, anthropology is the best formal tool. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathbunny_3da9.html" title="User:Deathbunny">Deathbunny</a> 01:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could someone explain the similarities and differences between Human Geography and Socio-Cultural Anthropology? I've noticed that many Universities have Anthropology or Geograhpy Departments but they rarely have both. What is the history around this pattern? -Curious</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, human genetics holds absolutely no factors on your culture. Now, I am an anthropology student, and for the most part, Anthropology deals with the cultural realities that pervade our society; where as Geography looks more at humans within a context of a location, i.e people in Russia's Komi region, or Urban studies. Anthropologists look at the culture of people. They study the phenomenology and look at how biological/medical factors, cultural, regional and physical factors could influence culture. This is also different from sociology. Traditionally, Anthropology dealt with foreign cultures, but not so today; however, Anthropology is closer now to sociology than before. Anthropology (again) is more concerned with the facts surrounding a cultural phenomenon, where as sociology focuses more on the statistics, it's placement within a context and the ability to form a rubric to better understand and fix the social inequalities. You may also wonder: "What importance does anthropology have in our modern context." Well, I'll tell you. Anthropology, since it allows us to understand society, helps us in the Legal, Medical, Business and educational fields. We seem to be blind to the fact that people of various cultures ignore medicine, because their own cosmology may not allow for much room for expirience with it. We also have truency among many aboriginal groups world wide, which alot of times can be explained culturally. Alot of business people employ anthropologists to give them a field research of the business possibilities in a new investment area.</dd>

<dd><i>"...human genetics holds absolutely no factors on your culture."</i> That's an odd and somewhat incorrect statement. Human genetics is a <i>major</i> factor in human culture. Human genetics is a major factor in human behavior. Human behavior influences culture. Culture influences human behavior. Human behavior influences genetics. Three short examples: 1. Lactose tolerance after childhood is a genetic adaptation that is a result, over time, of living in a pastoral society. This adaptation alters cultural practices by changing diets, social structures involving herd animals (including dairy vs. raisng for meat), and the results of a fat-rich diet. 2. Mate selection is based on health and geneticically heritable traits. These traits tend to be reinforced, sometimes to extremes. The side effects of these extremes influence behavior and the cultural activities based on it. 3. Several recent studies have attributed male homosexuality to genetic or epigenetic sources. I won't even start on the cultural influences of male homosexuality or the responses to it and/or it's "prevention".<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathbunny_3da9.html" title="User:Deathbunny">Deathbunny</a> 01:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A better explanation is this: Geography deals with all things that are spatially organized, and their organizations and spatial relations (whether human or non-human). Anthropology deals with all dimensions of humanity and humankind. Personally, I think anthropology is <i>less' like sociology now than fifty or a hundred years ago. For one thing, anthropologists studied people in their own ("Western") societies for a very long time - Frazer writes about praces in England and Hortense Powdermaker wrote an ethnography of a twon in Mississipi in the 1940s. Moreover, sociology has increasingly becomemore andmore positivies (in the USA, not in the UK), whereas anthropology remains as open to hermeneutics and critical theory, or at least to non-positivist methods of research and analysis, as it was a hundred years ago. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:27, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>I reverted to the previous version. Here is why: the most recent change deleted holism and added transculturation as a subheading. But holism shouod not be deleted -- it is a defining concept in anthropology, if you look at virtually any intro textbook the word will be highlighted in the first or second chapter. Since it is a term anthropologists use to define their field, it ought to be in the article. Transculturation, on the other hand, is a minor (thought important) concept in anthropology. The section following the header, "transculturation," was about a lot more than transculturation, and I think transculturation is too specific a concept for much discussion in a general article. It certainly should be linked. I made sure that the set of anthropological topics links includes transculturation <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV Issue</span></h2>
<p>I have removed a short section of three paragraphs from the article. I have pasted them here but first I will explain my reasons for doing so which are five. First, I feel that quotes in an encyclopedia article about anthopolgy should come from known anthropologists. Karl Marx was a progresivistic political philosopher, not an anthropologist, not even remotely. I fully appreciate that many anthropologists adopted a Marxist perspective and that Marxism provides a rich theoretical source in all the social sciences, but the same can be said of biology, economics, Darwinism, theology etc. Quoting Darwin on general anthropological theory would be equally inappropriate, for example. Further that "peoples" experience is increasingly atomized begs the question of what people. Western People? All p eople? These are subjective Points of View and one of the strengths of anthropology is that it demonstrates differences in cultural response making such a universal statement seem unlikely, problematic. It is further questionable, if true, that this is indeed "one of the greatest paradoxes". Third, the quote itself discusses the global spread of industry; it does not say anything about the atomization of traditional groups or make any causal link between the two phenomena. Fourth, the claim of "increasing" class/religion/race conflict begining in the 16th century has no empirical grounding. One can argue the opposit, that ethnocentricism and intolerance have decreased with increased contact as exemplified by the eradication of slavery and the birth and growth of the civil rights concept. That new cultural expressions arrise through contact is unquestionable, but that they are "confusing and disturbing" is an ambiguous and subjective statement that clearly depends on who and what you are talking about. And last, the paragraphs strongly promote a theoretical perspective that believes progress is an inherent characteristic of evolution; a VIEW that Darwin himself, and many contemporary theorists was/are very much opposed to. Here is the section I removed:<a href="../../../d/h/b/User%7EDHBoggs_f312.html" title="User:DHBoggs">DHBoggs</a> 16:54, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">politics of anthropology</span></h2>
<p>I deleted this sentence, which at the least needs work:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Over the past sixty years anthropology's increasingly leftist disposition has made intelligence work 'politically incorrect,' although changes to the American Anthropological Association's code of ethics have actually loosened restrictions on such work.</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, I think it is poor style to rely on "political correctness" as an explanation. The shift refered to can be ascribed to two forces in my opinion: the relationship between eht anti-Vietnalm war movement and anthropology in the US signalled in part by Hymes edited volumne on reinventing anthropology, and second, the fact that in the post-colonial period native peoples around the world have much more autonomy and can decide whether or not anthropologists can work among them, thus discouraging anthropologists from activities (such as spying) that could get them in trouble with their hosts. The first cause predates political correctness (as popularly understood) the second may be pragmatic or rooted in a pragmatic notion of ethics. Second, the statement about the AAA code of ethics needs some work. My recollection is the code still explicitly states that the reseaercher's first obligation is to the host community. Am I wrong? In any event, I think clarifying details are needed here, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<p><br />
First, yes, it is poor style to refer to 'political correctness' and I will try to rewrite it&#160;:) But in general rather than just cut stuff out, wouldn't it be better to have added to the wikipedia by including say, the content of your post to the entry itself rather than the talk page?</p>
<p>Second, the sentence uses "anthropology's increasingly leftist disposition" as an explanation of why "Intelligence work is 'politically incorrect'" rather than the other way around. So in fact there is no appeal to 'political correctness' as an explanatory concept.</p>
<p>Vietnam was relevant for anthropology but in fact anthropologists did intelligence work there as well (see <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=10489" class="external text" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=10489" rel="nofollow">the kerfuffle in the New York Review of Books</a>). Dell's book is part of a regular feature of anthropology in the United states where every twenty years a young generation demand an anthropology that is more 'relevant' than that of their professors. Hence it is part of an ongoing dynamic of 'increasingly leftist disposition' (although, to be sure, often a politically quiescent kind) rather than a 'before and after' shift.</p>
<p>As for the idea that formal political independence gives local peoples more power over who works with them, the <a href="http://archives.theconnection.org/archive/2000/11/1128b.shtml" class="external text" title="http://archives.theconnection.org/archive/2000/11/1128b.shtml" rel="nofollow">Yanomami controversy</a> pretty much lays that idea to rest. The biggest step forward in ensuring informed consent from informants has come from changes to human subjects testing requirements in powerful countries. Fourth world peoples are often not well served by independent governments headed by national majority ethnic groups, and the postcolonial state, often lacking in capacity and resources, is hardly a guarentor of grassroots empowerment.</p>
<p>Finally, the discussion of the AAA code essentially correct:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Over the past several decades the explicit condemnations of secretive research have been removed from the AAA's code of ethics--the principles of professional responsibility (PPR). In 1971 the PPR specifically declared that "no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given" by members of the AAA. By 1990 the attenuation of anthropological ethics had reached a point where anthropologists were merely "under no professional obligation to provide reports or debriefing of any kind to government officials or employees, unless they have individually and explicitly agreed to do so in the terms of employment." These changes were largely accomplished in the 1984 revision of the PPR that Gerald Berreman characterized as reflecting the new "Reaganethics" of the association: In the prevailing climate of deregulation the responsibility for ethical review was shifted from the association to individual judgments. As anthropologist Laura Nader noted, these Reagan-era changes were primarily "moves to protect academic careers...downplaying anthropologists' paramount responsibility to those they study." The current PPR may be interpreted to mean that anthropologists don't have to be spies unless they want to or have agreed to do so in a contract. A 1995 Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics declared that the committee on ethics had neither the authority nor the resources to investigate or arbitrate complaints of ethical violations and would "no longer adjudicate claims of unethical behavior and focus its efforts and resources on an ethics education program."" -David Price, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20001120&amp;c=1&amp;s=price" class="external text" title="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20001120&amp;c=1&amp;s=price" rel="nofollow">Anthropologists as Spies</a></dd>

<p>Sorrym, I am not pursuaded. If you insist on presenting these views in the article NPOV policy requires that they be presented as views, not as fact. But perhaps you misunderstand my points. First (and perhaps least) I still take issue with the "left-wing" terminology. Informally, I think I know what you mean and think I agree but it is poor style for an encyclopedia article because it rasies the question, "left wing" in what sense? better to provide a more specific and concrete account than rely on this catch-phrase. But to address your substantive points, i do think you misunderstand my point about Vietnam. I did not mean that all anthropologists objected to anthropologists serving as spies during the Vietnam War. i thought this was clear from my invoking Hymes' book, which specifically criticizes anthropologists' work for the US government during the war. My point was, it was a reaction against that collaboration that led to Official AAA condemnation and the growth of a general change in the sense of professional ethics. Next, I simply disagree with your dismissal of the effect of local group autonomy. The Yanomamo case actually supports my point because at the time of Chagnon's fieldwork they had not regional political authority. But this is not the case today and in manyh other parts of the Amazon, the US, Australia, etc. The need for local approval today -- not just from the host country or colonial governments but brum indigenous peoples is not the only factor in this phenomenon, but it is most definitly an important factor. I am sorry if I wasn't clear, but I was not referring to host statyes (I agree with your point about host states/governments), I was referring to local and regional quasi-autonomous organizations that represent the interests of native peoples independent of states. This is clearly what many anthropologists at various roundtables and panels on ethics at the last several AAA meetings have been responding to (among other things). I agree that the rise of IRBs is a factor, but I do not think it is the main factor especially since most human subjects review processes institutionalize a liberal notion of individual consent that may be culture-bound and not sufficient when dealing with societies with both collective identities and collective instruments of representation. Finally, Price aside, a quick look at the AAA statement on Ethics states very clearly that: the current statement does not supersede earlier dtatements and resolutions; that the anthropologist's primary responsibility is to the people studied; that anthropological findings should be made public (as long as the privacy of human subjects is maintained); and finally that anthropologists should not do covert work for their own government. If you want to represent Price's view, we also must represent this other view. I deleted the passage in question because I felt what I was deleting was short but needed to be totally rewritten. I am glad that I did not rewrite it at the time because, seeing how we disagree, you would surely have objected. If it was you who wrote what I took out, I wanted first to see if we could reach an accommodation. Perhaps we can, still. If you accept the points I make here I invite you either to rewrite this passage, incorporating the above points -- or put in the views you wish to express in a way that leaves room for me to add these points myself, and I will do so. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<p>First: I think we have very different and detailed (as well as nuanced) points of view about the history of anthropology and the ethics of fieldwork in out-of-the-way places. Second: my entire contributions to (and indeed, creation of) this section were meant to unPOV earlier, anonymous contributions to the article which stated baldly that anthropologists were leftist Jewish spies. Why should I argue with your unPOVing it further when I'm already unsympathetic?!? We both agree (at least sufficiently for the purposes of a general article) -- I just didn't feel it polite to cut out what the other person put in its entirety and tried to flesh it out in the spirit of accomodation. Its tempting to carry out this argument in the context of wiki edits because it is so interesting (and we do disagree on some points), but I don't think its in the best interest of the wiki. So maybe on IRC or something.</p>
<p>However, there some minor editing to do to iron out the entry as it reads right now (this disagreement has improved its quality I think), so do watch for my work there and edit it as u see fit. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Golub_1c00.html" title="User:Alex Golub">Rex</a> 04:44, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Kevin MacDonald's scientific criticism of politics of anthropology as a part of a mainly Jewish leftist strategy has been cancelled by Slrubenstein.It's easy to cancel any uncomfortable criticism calling it "anti-Semitic".Cal State Prof. MacDonald's argumentation is well-founded, unemotional and accepted by many of his American colleagues and worlwide. He answered his critics in a well-founded unemotional way, too, weakening the counterarguments essentially. Is Wikipedia also a part of this media manipulation described by MacDonald?</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not part of the media manipulation described by MacDonald because 1) Wikipedia is not part of a manipulative conspiracy and 2) MacDonald may not describe a manipulative conspiracy. Please feel free write whatever you like. If you are the same person who inserted the earlier comments about John Barker and Price, you will see that your contributions have led to discussion which has improved the page - thanks for that. However you'll also note that in each of these cases neither Barker nor Price ended up being particularly good sources for claims of a 'mainly Jewish left wing conspiracy'. Barker very rarely mentions Boas in his book 'Race', which is outdated in any case because it entirely predates modern genetics. The reference to Price resulted in a conversation that concluded that against the original claims posted here that anthropologists and Jews have historically been widely employed in the intelligence community. I'll take a look at MacDonald's work in more detail shortly, but judging from what's on his website it seems like a close examination of his argument might reveal a position more nuanced (although still possibly objectionable) than your representation of him. I thank you for your contributions but in the future you may want to examine your sources more closely to ensure they actually support your points. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Golub_1c00.html" title="User:Alex Golub">Rex</a> 20:16, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC) Baker is not outdated, to discuss the morphology of the 40 human races it is not necessary to refer to genetics, Baker has mentioned this "trick" of the Boasians,too. Funny is the first part of your argumentation ("petitio principii"):"Wikipedia is not part of the media manipulation described by MacDonald because 1) Wikipedia is not part of a manipulative conspiracy (...)" It seems to be a typical "Boasian" argumentation.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate that you are absolutely allowed and even encouraged to write whatever you like on this page -- anyone can contribute to the wikipedia. I have worked to incorporate your changes by editing the parts I found problematic and elaborating on those that I thought were worthwhile. This is how wikipedia works. Your contributions have improved the quality of the page. But no-one on wikipedia is allowed to write just what they please without being answerable to their fellow contributors, who edit contributions based on their accuracy, coherence, and the staet of expert knowledge in this area. I personally think I've gone out of my way to be accomodating. If you think that you are being censored or otherwise treated unfairly, then there is a [Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution] process that you should feel free to undertake.</p>
<p>Substantively: AndyL has provided substantial evidence of MacDonald's shortcomings to which you have not yet responded with any sort of evidence. If there is more that you would like to say about the secret service, please do so - although on this score contributors have sufficient evidence to alter your original claims and we've heard nothing more from you on the subject. Your main feeling seems to be that you just really <i>really</i> don't like Franz Boas. But as is mentioned (twice) in the article, Boas's activism and opposition to the race concept are public knowledge today and he sought great publicity for them during his lifetime. Given this fact, it's hard to see why his work should be labeled a 'conspiracy'. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Golub_1c00.html" title="User:Alex Golub">Rex</a> 22:50, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>sigh* Littlefield's article (I assume I have found the right one) points out that Boas had an enormous impact on the institutional context of academic anthropology and that this impact explains the coverage of the concept of 'race' in textbooks. This is a separate issue from the idea that Boas pursuing a strategy to destroy western civilization in order to assure the victory of 'The Jews'. The wikipedia article already mentions Boas's prominence and opposition to the notion of race. I cut the reference to Baker (and am editing it again) because it was tacked on to a discussion of monographs by British social anthropologists, where it clearly does not belong. The fact that you no longer claim that Baker's book is an attack on Boas indicates you agree with the original reason I deleted it -- it does not support the claim you make. Also please note that Baker's professional speciality was cytology, not anthropology as you have claimed in the past. I am once more removing allegations that the American Anthropological Association /directly/ worked with the CIA in the 1950s. The wikipedia now has a detailed discussion of espionage and anthropology (including a discussion of Operation Camelot). If there are details of /direct/ collaboration of the CIA and the AAA I'd like to see them. As much as I respect your right to continue editing this page, if this sort of continued, baseless re-insertion of claims over and over continues I am going to opt for mediation and, if that fails, arbitration.

<p>I don't agree to you that I'm a troll because of the following: 1.) Littlefield's study reveals the high percentage of Jews, women and third world scientists in Boasianism. Boasianism does not weaken the power of gentile Europeans in general as depicted by MacDonald,but especially the power of European males. All groups that have an interest in that destruction can be found in Boasianism, not only the Jews as focused on by MacDonald. 2.) I have never doubted that "Race" by Baker has been t h e greatest attack on Boas ever. The fact, that he was a cytologist primarily did not hinder him to be a great anthropologist, too, as acknowledged by other important anthropologists. 3.) The AAA has been directly involved in secret service activities.(cf. "www. thenation.com"): " The American Anthropological Association also secretly collaborated with the CIA. In the early 1950s the AAA's executive board negotiated a secret agreement with the CIA under which agency personnel and computers were used to produce a cross-listed directory of AAA members, showing their geographical and linguistic areas of expertise along with summaries of research interests. Under this agreement the CIA kept copies of the database for its own purposes with no questions asked. And none were, if for no other reason than that the executive board had agreed to keep the arrangement a secret." 4.) Your strategy is similar to the one applied by some Jewish critics of MacDonald. The discussion of some details is arranged in a manner to evoke the impression that the essential thesis of MacDonald or me would be wrong. 5.) I have got the impression that you are mere ideologues who try to censor me in an un-American way.</p>

<p>1) I stand corrected on the relationship between the CIA and the AAA and have made changes in the article to that effect. 2) Baker: I do not doubt that Baker was a highly emminent cytologist. I do however think it is inaccurate to label him an anthropologist when this was not his primary field. <i>Race</i> hardly ever mentions Boas and is not a sustained polemic, or even a deep engagement with Boas's work. It is a comprehensive summary on the literature on the physical anthropology of race as it has been practiced up to that time and is obviously an important work in that regard. 3) As for Littlefield et. al. they write about the "elite nature of anthropology in the period before 1960" and that "in spite of anthropology's commitment to the study human diversity, its practitioners were quite homogenous in terms of class origin and social background. Few women or individuals of minority background were represented in the profession" (645 of the article). They argue the shift in the way textbooks cover race is due to society-wide shifts in demographics that occurred <i>two decades after Boas died</i>. 3a) Littlefield also reveals that most people who argue that race is real are white southern Christian men who were first, last, or only children. Does this indicate a conspiracy on the part of white southern Christian men?

<p>If I had not remarked Baker, MacDonald and Littlefield, the article would have remained totally manipulative. Boasianism is unscientific, Baker's overwhelming amount of details falsifying Boasianism cannot be denied. The whole Wikipedia is obviously leftist.But all leftists and Boasians will be tread on their heels because of their false, manipulative and destructive leftist ideology leading to the hidden holocaust of the Europeans in the inevitable,final clash of cultures in Europe.</p>
<p>First off Boas was trying to get around the racist outlook of the evolutionary anthropologists like Lewis Henry Morgan and other social Darwinists. Boas was about collecting as much data as he possibly could inorder to get an emic perspective, thus avoiding any colonialist rhetoric, and making anthropology a disicpline about people. Unlike anthropologist before him that avoided the effects of colonialists Boas brought the effects to the fore front. Yes, Boas's approach was subjective rather than objective but that does not mean that it is anymore unscientific than any of the so called hard sciences, which incidentally all involve some sort of subjective interpretation. Just because Boas was a German Jew does not mean that there is some knid of Jewish conspiracy in anthropology. (GRQ in Lethbridge)</p>

<p>Questions about the term ‚ÄúCommon Era‚Äù often arise among anthropologist working in colonial contexts with non western peoples (i.e. most of us). Some anthropologist and archaeologist have come to prefer the fairly neutral ‚ÄúCurrent Era‚Äù whereas others prefer the traditional AD/BC system for sake of clarity. As an Anthroplogist, I am of course troubled by the rise of hegemonic discourse and this dating reinvention strikes me as a particualraly egregious example. I find the use of ‚ÄúCommon Era‚Äù deeply troubling. I'm no christian (perish the thought), but I have no moral problem using an age old dating system (like AD/BC) based on the rise of some religious figure, whatever their title, be it Christ or Confuscious or Julius Ceasar or whomever; if it is commonly known and used it is not a matter of accepting some religious viewpoint to refer to dates relative to the rise of a historical figure like Jesus or acknowledging the rise of a widespread religion. To be offended by a historically accepted dating system because it was established around a religious figure that we don't believe in is simply overreacting in my view, but if people feel that change is necessary, they should be at least as sensitive to what they are changing it to as they were to what they were changing it from. Calling something a "Common Era" is preaching an occidental viewpoint. To whom is this era common? The answer is - Western Judeo/Christian Imperial powers established and descended from Roman institutions. It tacitly assumes that Europeans, and Euroamericans are really the important people; really the only ones whe matter and there is nothing wrong with claiming an era is "Common" history/culture to everyone who now uses the dating system. I assure you that many people in developing non western nations who use the Gregorian calendar would not think of themselves and their history as having anything in common with Europe or to be participants for the past 2006 years in a commonality with Europeans except perhaps as colonial subjects. Therefore, using "Common Era" amounts to legitimising western colonialism and the orientalist worldview. The term "Common Era" excludes most people on earth and marginalizes everything that is not western history. It is bigoted and I respectfully suggest anyone who uses the term reconsider what it is they are saying and why. I doubt very much that people who advocate this term have ever considered it from this point of view.<a href="../../../d/h/b/User%7EDHBoggs_f312.html" title="User:DHBoggs">DHBoggs</a> 05:25, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the division into four is not recently anymore. Archaeology and linguistics are not a part of antropology, Isn't it that antropology was founded by structuralist linguists? And thus began as a part of linguistics?--212.87.102.237 16:35, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Many schools in the US still have a four field focus, and many more have a focus in 1, 2, or 3 of the subfields at the graduate level while still covering all four at the undergraduate level. There is some debate over whether or not any of the subfields should split from the whole, but at present at least <a href="http://www.aaanet.org" class="external text" title="http://www.aaanet.org" rel="nofollow">AAA</a> is still a four-field association (five if you count applied anthropology as an extra field, as they do). --- Ph0rk 00:11, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="US_POV.3F" id="US_POV.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">US POV?</span></h2>
<p>From a European perspective this article is bit too US-focused. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>- why deal with US anthropology before British and French anthropology? The logical order would some kind of historical sequence, and though they developed in some independence from each other the US was a latecomer (for example, the Bureau of American Ethnology, which is mentioned, was founded in 1879, and was concerned only with America; wider in scope were the Societe Ethnologique de Paris founded in 1839, or the Ethnological Society of London founded in 1843).</dd>
<dd>- Why highlight linguistic anthropology for special mention rather than other aspects of social anthropology (there's also medical anthropology, ethnomusicology &amp;c)? Is it US anthropology faculty practice? Better dropped in the front list. Some mention of Gluckmann and power might be useful.</dd>
<dd>- there ought to be more stress (either here or in the History of Anthropology article) to 19th-century theories of social evolution: though now academically defunct, they were very influential at the time (and remain so in popular culture such as <i>2001 A Space Odyssey</i>).</dd>
<dd>- Some key figures such as Montesquieu, Rousseau and Henry Maine should be mentioned (the Marx quote is interesting but long and could be excised for space).</dd>
<dd>- The hint ("it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European chauvinism, since its relationship to imperialism was and is complex") that with some qualifications anthropology is more or less about colonialism, except in the US which fortunately doesn't suffer from colonialism, is misleading. This needs to say either less or (preferably) more. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_O%27Sullivan_118a.html" title="User:Mark O'Sullivan">Mark O'Sullivan</a> 09:41, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As mentioned in the article intro: "In the United States, 'anthropology' is traditionally divided into four fields" - hence the mention of linguistic anthropology (the fourth field).</p>
<p>I'll agree the article is US-centric, though I'd think Europeans would be more confused by the mention of archaeology than linguistic anthropology - given the link between linguistics and French structuralism. Any discussion of the four-field approach would necessarily include linguistic anthropology; though I don't see why that section can't be moved down to the anthropology in the US section. I'd imagine that would require significant restructuring, though. Ph0rk 05:17:00, 2005-09-03 (UTC) ____________</p>

<p>Anthropology and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnology.html" title="Ethnology">Ethnology</a> are two different fields.

I don't think they should be merged, but amazingly, there doesn't seems to be anything relating the ethnology article to anthropology, not a word nor less a sentence.

Firmin‚Äôs work argued the opposite, that "all men are endowed with the same qualities and the same faults, without distinction of color or anatomical form. The races are equal" (pp. 450). Firmin grew up in Haiti, and was admitted to the Societ√© d‚Äô Anthropologie de Paris in 1884 while serving as a diplomat.
