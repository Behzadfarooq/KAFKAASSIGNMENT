<p>I apologize for tagging the article heavily. I understand that it is mainly an initial draft by a single person, who has no obligation to cover everything at once, but the article concentrates mainly on modern topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>This article appears to be a long list of anti-Turkish insults, and lacks reasoning. The article when re-written must not provide any justification for such insults. I agree that anti-semitism is different than most forms of racism, but Turcophobia has been quite prevalent in Western media recently. Tauphon 11:40, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It fails to trace really deep roots of anti-Turkism, to the times when the words like "<a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamluk.html" title="Mamluk">mamluk</a>" "<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashibazouk.html" title="Bashibazouk">bashibazouk</a>", "arnaut", "<a href="../../../j/a/n/Janissary.html" title="Janissary">janissary</a>" filled people with dread.</li>
<li>The second item missed is Turkish <i><a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastarbeiter.html" title="Gastarbeiter">Gastarbeiter</a></i> not very much liked in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>.</li>
<li>Third, the two-pronged <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> issue: both as the base of Armenian anti-Turkism and as the base of <i>accusations</i> in anti-Turkism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure in time other editors will fill these and other gaps without much political quarrel. Inshallah. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 01:38, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>This article doesn't seem to say much of anything. After reading it, I'm not sure if Anti-Turkism does or doesn't exist, or even what it is. If this is a legitimate subject for an article, then this needs to be rewritten and restructured.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suggesting that people who are or have historically been repressed by Turkey are just "anti Turkish" is demeaning to those people.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article seems to suggest that any resentment or negative feeling towards the nation of Turkey or any specific people thereof is Anti-Turkish. One can't attribute every negative opinion to anti-x.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The suggestion that Anti-Turkism has any parrallels to anti-semitism is also ridiculous. The</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article is written without nutrality, and as the author's comments above indicate, and lack objectivity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The issue does not discuss the Cyprus issue, or the question of Turkey's entrance into the EU</li>

<dd>I have added considerably to this article however I am disputing the <b>General Information</b> section for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>It reflects the views of whoever wrote it.</li>
<li>I believe that yes some Anti-Turkism sentiments are misconstructions.</li>
<li>However I do believe that some people actually do believe hate all things Turkish.</li>
<li>I do believe that Anti-Turkism does have strong racial reasoning behind it. I have read and heard so many people call the Turks "Mongols" or Mongoloid, etc... 86.1.80.37 18:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I deleted the "What is Anti-Turkish?" section because it seemed rather unencyclopedic, especially the list of "clues". Suppose a news source criticizes both the PKK and the Turkish Army for human rights violations. Are they considered anti-Turkish because they try to provide both sides of an issue? Also the section was unsourced. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 18:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you Kholkhoi I think it was just copied from a similar section from the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Hellenism_8fa3.html" title="Anti-Hellenism">Anti-Hellenism</a> article. 86.1.80.37 18:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps a section about this could be added. In the Netherlands for example, the term "Turk" as a degoratory term is used to say someone is "stupid". I believe the same thing is true in Russian. It's unfortunate, but it's true that this kind of racism happens. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 18:32, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Really I didnt know about the use of the word Turk to denote "stupid" in the Netherlands and Russia. However I have heard it is used in Iran as a degoratory term. 86.1.80.37 18:39, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Iranian deputy interior minister for security affairs, Ali Asghar Ahmadi, admitted that the demonstrations in Tabriz were far more than a mere protest against a newspaper insult. In fact, there is much resentment in Iranian Azerbaijan about the region’s economic and social difficulties. <b>That resentment is fed by the attitudes of ethnic Persians toward ethnic Azeris—an attitude well captured in the phrase "Torki khar" (Turkish donkey), used by Persians in reference to Azeris, whom they regard as the "muscle" of the Iranian economy to be dominated by Persian "brains".</b> <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2476" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2476" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

For example, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/turk" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/turk" rel="nofollow">Merriam-Webster</a> and <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/turk?view=uk" class="external text" title="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/turk?view=uk" rel="nofollow">Oxford</a> both have normal, neutral definitions. I'm going to remove that reference, as the PDF doesn't say when the dictionary was looked at. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a> 15:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"I'd rather be a Paki than a Turk" I don't think this is worth adding to the page. Football fanatics insult everything about the opponent team. Have you ever been to an international match in Turkey? There are tons of incidents way more worse than this. Also this sentence is mainly insulting Pakis rather than Turks. They're just trying to make Turks annoyed.</p>
<p>Is this an important example for Anti-Turkism&#160;? No, I don't think so.</p>
<p>I am Greek and I would like to clarify something about the Turkish nationality. During the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans (Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and Serbia) and Cyprus many people were forced or just made to become Muslims. These people were Minor Asians, Hellenes (the nation that is not correctly called by the western Europeans Greeks, Grecs, Griechen etc.) , Slavs (Bosnians), Bulgarians, Albanians (the tribe of the Ghegs) etc. When somebody referred to a Christian, he called him “Romios” or “Roum”. Romios comes from the greek word “Romaios” which means Roman (The Roman Empire existed till 1453, when the Turks entered Constantinople) . On the other hand, when somebody referred to a muslim, he called him “Turk”, no matter which his nationality was. So there are no legal citizens in Cyprus that are actually Turks. There are just muslim Cypriots, who are occupied by Turkish troops and an illegal government. The state of Cyprus is one and it should be governed by the Cypriots (Christians and Muslims). As far as the anti-turkism is concerned, I think that, if the Turkish government could act democratically without the interference of the Turkish army, things would be better. Anti-turkism is the result of the actions of the Turkish state, which are against their neighbors and the minorities in turkey.</p>

<p>I think that what the guy is trying to say is that anti-turkism today is based rather on the political practices of the modern turkish state than on racial preconceptions, e.g. the ethnic inferiority of Turks. It's worth pointing out that there is a difference between attacking someone who is a moslem citizen of the Ottoman Empire (of Arabic, Albanian, Bosnian, Greek, Russian or even Italian origin)and a citizen of modern-day Turkey.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.1.249.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.1.249.248_0e54.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.1.249.248">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>So what do you think about insults we see everyday like "barbarian, savage, bloodthirsty etc Turks"&#160;? If you search the word Turk in various internet forums, you'll find out how people make racistic comments when it comes to Turks. US and Israel are always criticized like Turkey about their foreign policies but it's rare when you see comments like barbarian Americans, or barbarian Israelis/Jews. People generally criticize their policies based on their governments, not the people. But when it comes to Turks, you see comments insulting Turks. Turks are hated for various reasons, mainly for their history and current policies. And this is clearly anti-Turkism. You don't have to have a different skin color to face the Turkophobia.88.254.178.160 03:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
