<p>It's important you take a look at your new article (Plasma Quest Limited) and decide what to do about it since it currently does not meet Wikipedia standards as presently written. The most important concern is whether this organization is important enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia -- see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)</a> -- what makes an organization worth including in Wikipedia</li>

<li><a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> -- what are the sorts of sources volunteers consider to be credible when assess verifiablilty</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> -- what goes in the article needs to come from somewhere else, not just your own head or "everybody knows that ..." Having said that, paraphrase, don't copy, other sources -- don't violate copyrights (that gets material instantly deleted.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the article reads a bit like a press release; see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, especially the section that reads <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">"Wikipedia is not a soapbox"</a>. Also see <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>.</p>
<p>You'll want to address these issues pretty soon or your article will be deleted.</p>
<p>I should add that other editors who look at this article to judge its suitability for inclusion in Wikipedia will likely be dismayed, as I was, by the fact that you have immediately put a prominent "Plasma Quest on Wikipedia" link on your company's home page. To us, that just drives home the suspicion that these contributions are spam, not good faith additions to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Clearly there's some real talent at your little company and we hope some of you will take an interest in contributing scientific material to Wikipedia for the sake of furthering Wikipedia's mission. In the meantime, you'll want to avoid using Wikipedia as part of your marketing plan; you might get tagged by some other editor as Wikipedia spammers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> -- Wikipedia's rules on the subject</li>

</ul>
<p>I know you're new here and all this is probably a surprise. Read over the links I've cited and see how you want to handle this.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to publicise Plasma Quest on Wikipedia. Your points have been noted and make good sense. I have made an amendment to the article as it currently stands removing the 'advertising' side to it, whilst trying to make it a genuine 'scientific' contribution to an area where Wikipedia currently lacks in information. I have removed the Plasma Quest on Wikipedia link from the website. I have also read over the notoriety issue and have made a point on that in my response to your other message.</p>
<p>Your points are fully noted and understood. I would really appreciate your assistance in making this article suitable to Wikipedia and as I said above I have made some amendments as a start. I would ideally like to change the title from 'Plasma Quest' to HiTUS or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I hope my intentions are now clearer and I look forward to taking this forward with you.</p>

<p>I have just proposed your Plasma Quest Limited article for automatic deletion in 7 days. While that sounds ominous, it's preventable if you address the notability, verifiability, vanity, original research, and reliable sources requirements above.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is with notability -- with so few employees and such low sales, you may just not meet the threshold (yet), no matter how hard you try on the article.</p>

<p>Thank you for the assistance.</p>
<p>I have amended the text to highlight the HiTUS technology, which offers the improvements in the domain and taken the sting out of the Plasma Quest header. Could the article title be changed to HiTUS with the keywords such as physical vapor deposition and sputtering included in the article.</p>
<p>As for notability, the company itself is based in the UK and there is a global business development team, but I'm looking to take away the advertising aspect away, and communicate the major recent evolutions in the technology. Of course if, at the same time, I can assist Plasma Quest that is a bonus, but there is something to communicate on Wikipedia given the improvements and the lack of information available in this domain.</p>
<p>I hope that addresses your issues on these points.</p>

<p>You can change the name of the article. I had to look it up and found this link: <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVery_Frequently_Asked_Questions_1bf3.html#How_do_I_change_the_name_of_an_article.3F" title="Wikipedia:Very Frequently Asked Questions">Wikipedia:Very Frequently Asked Questions#How do I change the name of an article?</a>.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of time to lend to help with the editing, but I'm sure you can recruit some people. Start by putting a note on the talk page(s) of whatever broader article(s) covers this technology (i.e., if you were writing a new article on <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hook%2C_Hampshire_2d70.html" title="Hook, Hampshire">Hook</a>, you might leave messages on <a href="../../../h/a/m/Talk%7EHampshire_d0c5.html" title="Talk:Hampshire">Talk:Hampshire</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Talk%7EBasingstoke_b161.html" title="Talk:Basingstoke">Talk:Basingstoke</a>). This also gets you a level of semi-peer review to make sure your article is not too self-serving. While that may not sound like something you want, trust me, you don't want to get involved in pushing the envelope on self-serving edits -- you end up wasting inordinate amounts of your time and others' while eventually losing in the end.</p>
<p>You may want to also consider merging the Plasma Quest/HiTUS article into a broader article as a section, but for now, I'd stick to the path you're on while recruiting help from folks that work on the broader article. Once you see what you've got after a few days, you and the others can decide on the best path. I would not make any changes to a broader article without first proposing them on that article's talk page. See <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a> -- in theory, everyone's free to change anything they want to any article, but if you drop a big block of text on another article, the people that have edited may get alarmed and just delete it, especially if the editor is seen as a new editor with an agenda. So that ownership policy lives in a sort of dynamic tension with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>. Finally, notwithstanding all the rules and guidelines to maintain some sort of order and harmony, at the practical level is ultimately subject to the limitations of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">Human nature</a>. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<p>A.B. - Will take on board the above advice tomorrow during my day 'European time'. Could I kindly ask you to take a peak tomorrow to make sure I'm on the right lines. I'm new to this and this information is important to take this particular entry in Wikipedia forward and of course will help communicate this technology. I just need to make sure I do it within the framework of what is acceptable to Wikipedia. Thank you again for your help, Antony</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure (and if I don't forget ...) However, I really encourage you to reach out to other editors more familiar with your technical field. You could write something totally outrageous about this subject and it would fool me.</dd>

<p>I'd like to change the Plasma Quest headline and put HiTUS in its place, which is the technology. I will then complete the article during the week and add to other articles on the same subject and share knowledge Plasma Quest holds in the relevant domains to improve on current articles.

<dd>Sorry to be so abrupt above; I wanted to get word to you ASAP since copyright-related deletions occur very rapidly. As to your new material, I'm hardly a judge of the topic. I appreciate your good faith efforts and I suggest you raise the issue on the article's talk page at <a href="../../../s/p/u/Talk%7ESputtering_cf8d.html" title="Talk:Sputtering">Talk:Sputtering</a>. That's where you need to get consensus and that article's other editors will have a better feel for the material than I do.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd raise this topic there ASAP since undiscussed large deletions or additions of text by unknown editors tend to alarm and agitate an article's existing editors; they're naturally wary of anything even remotely related to commercial agenda-pushing. Raising the topic on the article's talk page is a courtesy and it affirms your good faith to others. (I know you're editing in good faith, but the other editors don't yet know this). Think of this phenomenon as a "human nature overlay" of Wikipedia's official guidelines and policies.</dd>
