<p>I guess that I'd like you to adopt me.--Ladywater 07:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>My dear adopted friend. My sympathies and prayers are with you. Under your tutelage and guidance thus far I feel as though I have gained a great deal. I appreciate the resources you have pointed me to and I will use them should the need arise. Meanwhile I am busily working at a variety of projects and enjoying my time on wikipedia. My best to you and yours. May you have a well-deserved rest and come back energized for the next chapter of your life and work.

<p>Who's lorenzo? Yeah, i suppose i could be more specific with edit summaries, but I make so many vandalism reversions and new page speedy tags in one sitting that it's much easier for me to just hit the undo button. Think about it this way, undoing vandalism doesn't really need an explanation, but undoing a goodfaith edit should always have an explanation. So if a non-anonymous user simply does an "undo" function on an edit, it's safe to assume that he's reverting vandalism. I'll try to pop in an "rvv" when i get a chance, though. Rock on. -<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETaco325i_a7ce.html" title="User:Taco325i">Taco325i</a> 01:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was astounded to find that, for the stated purpose of making the article look less like a resume, a great deal was simply deleted. I left a polite note on the administrator's page to the effect that I believe a great deal of significant material which should be integrated to the article has simply been removed. Any comments?<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanticle_6af9.html" title="User:Canticle">Canticle</a> 09:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've already left a message on Canticle's talk page. I was unduly harsh in the edit, and there's no question of an 'edit war'. But the fact remains that an encyclopaedic article does not need to list every time this woman has spoken and every article she's written.

<p>I don't know. On the one hand, encyclopedia articles are by nature short summaries that do not delve into extreme detail. On the other hand, if someone has gone to the trouble of collecting a great deal of information, and <i>provided that it is incorporated into appendix-like sections</i> at the end of the article and not integrated into the article (as is the case here), why throw away the info? It's not detracting from the article. So, sorry, but I can't give you a definitive answer. My inclination would be to keep the info, though. It's not hurting anyone and might be helpful to someone. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anthony! It's a very good question. I'm not completely expert on this particular disruptive user myself, but I do know he uses several extensive IP ranges which cannot realistically be blocked because of collateral damage issues. You can probably learn more about it by looking at the various writings about him on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> and the entries in the block log that correspond with comments left there by the actual people running the checkuser requests. He's quite persistent, and seems to believe quite genuinely that the admins here are a U.S.-government-run conspiracy to shut down his particular discovery of Truth, but I'm not entirely even sure what that is. Thanks for your help with this! <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 00:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes we do indeed make large range blocks when the user is exceptionally disruptive. Here is an example of the latest block activity versus Cplot: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Raul654&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Raul654&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -- you can see that some /24 ranges are included, and Raul has identified some specific static IPs as well. It is possible that some are wireless points. A lot of the IPs are in the Chicago area, but here's one in Oklahoma (68.97.130.236). He seems to find new IP ranges regularly. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 01:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I suppose that blocking the entire State of Illinois might be seen as slightly harsh, not to mention the State of Oklahoma. But how does he do it?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 01:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A very good question. He seems to have access to numerous ISPs. We have had past troublemakers who went to different wireless points (Starbucks, and airport, a convention center, a school ...) but this one moves quickly between providers. I'm not sure. There was one theory posted on AN/I that it may be more than one person, posting pre-written rants, but from the similarity of the user names, and the characteristic misspellings in the edit summaries I think it's just one nut. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 01:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You were pretty quick on the trigger without checking the overall USC coverage. If editors don't give proper time for additional info to be added, it is difficult to add an article. There are already several USC articles and none on Title 10 giving it very lopsided coverage. Title 10 is referenced elsewhere and crucial to US Armed Forces yet there is nothing on it in Wikipedia.

<p>Dear Anthony,</p>
<p>I only added Catholic so as not to confuse the issue for people that may not be historians. I wanted to show that 'Poles' and 'Jews' are not necessarily different peoples or nationalities. Hence I added Catholic. I could have said 'non-Jewish' or 'Christian, but I figured, as you know, that since Poland is overwhelmingly Catholic, that a difference should be noted. I have a keen (and related) interest in Auschwitz too, but I'm not dogmatic. If you feel it shouldn't be changes, I'm OK with that. But I think you know what I was trying to say. I notice you are in England. I spent a summer in Huddersfield, West Yorks when I was 16, and love the England.

I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior.

<dd>It's not an issue, and the user involved, although taken aback, was fine - and that's what counts.

<p>I'm afraid you're pretty much not allowed to send Ockenbock insulting messages. The good news is I've been through several campaigns by these kinds of &lt;insert your favorite adjective&gt; vandals. They always tire and give up before the people who care about Wikipedia do. That's the nature of their behaviors: they have no positive value so eventually even the most tedious mind gets bored.

<p>Hi Anthony, the article creator seems to have made a genuine mistake while editing the page, leading to all that Hugh Jackman stuff getting included in it. Would you mind looking over the article once again, and reconsidering your opinion?</p>
<p>I also just read about your wife's passing. I know that anything I say will sound hollow, but you have my deepest sympathy and condolences. <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms"><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana</a>_<a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta"><b>dzasta</b></a></span> 13:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about the late reply, Anthony, I appear to have overlooked your message. I still don't think B P Taylor satisfies WP:BIO, so I haven't withdrawn the nomination, but I've made a note about the changes to the article, and adjust my statement accordingly. Hope that helps.

<p>In reference to the apology for my first "Speedy Deletion", not at all! I certainly took your advice to heart and tried to do a much better than more thorough job. I never gave it a second thought (as it pertained to an attack) and have no idea who brought it up to you. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention (only way ya learn)! I appreciate the apology but once again, it is not needed, you were simply doing your job to help educate a n00b. Thanks again for the help and kind words, have a great day! -- <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeath666_1f2f.html" title="User:Death666">Death666</a> 23:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually I think my greater concern is with <i>rouge</i> Adopters, not good Adopters who take on lots of work (as long as they do good work), of course there is lots of shades of grey between these two extremes. As the program is just getting bigger and bigger, I think <i>rouge</i> adopters may become a problem and something we need to keep an eye. When we do get our first major problem with an Adopter then we can deal with it then, using diplomacy first and if that fails the standard procedures in place for disruptive users. At but thinking about the issue now, we might be little more prepared for it.</dd>

<dd>In terms of the adoptee numbers issue, I would leave as you do not seem to have a major problem with it, and there are plenty of new users seeking adoption going around.

<p>Hello, there! It's me, Radical3, who apparently wrote an article about a bloodsucking butterfly and was deleted by you. Have you heard of the program "The Most Extreme"? It is a program on Animal Planet and I just recently watched an episode named "Bloodsuckers". I am aware that my spelling is incorrect, because I'm not sure about it, wierd name. And I know that there aren't any websites about this species, however ... on the program, they did tell me that this species was recently discovered therefore, I don't think there are any websites on the Internet about this species. But, I'm afraid it's true, this butterfly does suck blood! Go to this website: <a href="http://www.tv.com/the-most-extreme/bloodsuckers/episode/620507/recap.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tv.com/the-most-extreme/bloodsuckers/episode/620507/recap.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/the-most-extreme/bloodsuckers/episode/620507/recap.html</a> Radical3 23:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look, dude! Just because there aren't any websites about this species, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. This species <i>was</i> just recently discovered, <b>THIS YEAR</b>. I wouldn't expect anyone to make a website about the butterfly. Now, if you don't believe me, that's your problem. So if you wouldn't mind, I would really appreciate it if you put my article back or I'll contact Wikipedia and do something about it. If you just put back, everything will be fine for you and me. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadical3_4c4a.html" title="User:Radical3">Radical3</a> 16:23 December 31, 2006</p>

<p>You're not reading into my meaning, which is probably just plain my fault. What I mean by it is that I find the various templates impersonal at best, and while I can appreciate that they can certainly be useful if you want to handle a new user with kid gloves, slapping a subst: on something which is on the face impersonal to make it seem like something it isn't bothers me in a number of ways. I'd rather be spared. --<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickulator_2c55.html" title="User:Stickulator">Stickulator</a> 13:56, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>The answer to your questions - or my opinions at least anyway&#160;:):)</p>
<p>1. Offering adoption to someone that already has an offer -</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not see a particular problem with this, gives the new user choice. Normally I don't because I have plenty of Adoptees already, but when I go looking, if I see someone who particularly interests me, or I think would be a suitable <i>challenge</i> then I happy to offer adoption even if someone else has.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. Vanishing Adoptees</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have had only had one so far - but when a user only asks one question and then stops contributing I see no problem with ending adoption - always by leaving a message on their talk page explaining why. Time involved - depends on user. If user not contributed for a week or so - then that is fine. If the user is still contributing occasionally maybe longer. As long as explained properly I would not be overly worried.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also if a user is still contributing but not responding to you, you can always offer end adoption, but state that they can always get another adopter instead.

<p>I submitted a thanks to the administrator who agreed to reinstate the article to give me a chance to justify it for inclusion.</p>
<p>One of the issues is that this professor is linked in several other areas in which I have contributed so its seems logical that she should be included in wikipedia. The problem seems to lie in my fledgling abilities to make a convincing and properly formatted case.</p>

<p>Let's be honest, at no stage has anyone actually told him what's <i>wrong</i> with the articles (unless the talk page has been blanked... hmmm... let's see... nope, First entry was a very welcoming {{<a href="../../../d/r/m/Template%7EDrmspeedy_65ca.html" title="Template:Drmspeedy">drmspeedy</a>}}).

As it is all I see on the talkpage is a bunch of messages saying "no!" I can't in all conscience block someone for breaking a rule they may well not know exists.

I'd never heard the "commonly said" rumour that he had CTEV and I'm rather glad he seems not to have.

<p>Thank you for your comment. Your note confirms the suspicion I had which is that there is necessarily a degree of subjectivity (not necessarily malicious) in such decisions.</p>
<p>My position is that most (if not all) links and references deserve, if not a full article, at least a reasonable reference. Perhaps this would create an unwieldy amount of data but I don't think that "wikipedia" needs to conserve space that desperately.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>As a current Adopter with the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_a79f.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User">Adopt-a-User</a> program there has been some ongoing developments that we would like to bring to your attention.</p>
<p>A new <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adopter%27s_Area_9ea8.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adopter's Area">Adopter's Area</a> has been created where you can find useful <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adopter%27s_Area_Resources_2e75.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adopter's Area/Resources">resources</a> and other Adopter's <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adopter%27s_Area_Experiences_ee44.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adopter's Area/Experiences">experiences</a>. Please feel free to add any resources you may have found useful as an Adopter, as well as recount any experiences that you think may help others. If you know of any useful resources for new users / Adoptees then you can add them <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adopter%27s_Area_Resources_2e75.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adopter's Area/Resources">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also the way the adoption process works has changed slightly. To decrease workload at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a>, on offering adoption please change the <b>{{Adoptme}}</b> template to <b>{{Adoptoffer}}</b> on the user's user page, and this will add the user to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_having_been_offered_adoption_5561.html" title="Category:Wikipedians having been offered adoption">Category:Wikipedians having been offered adoption</a>. Users that have already been offered adoption can always have a second or third offer, but by separating out those users that have not had an adoption offer yet, it is hoped that no one will go lacking.</p>
<p>Furthermore numerous Adopters have been adding their details to a <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adoptee%27s_Area_Adopters_f0cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adoptee's Area/Adopters">list of users available for adopting</a>, to offer a more personalised service and allow new users to browse through and pick their own Adopter. The quickest way to adopt though, is still to contact users at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things I'd like to do on Wikipedia is bring the article about advance fee fraud to FA status. I've gone over the Quality scale and don't really know what it would be classed as.

<p>Thanks for the tip, but as the consensus seems to be to <i>not</i> to translate, it's kind of a moot point. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarom_7c23.html" title="User:Carom">Carom</a> 00:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks again for your input - based on the response from various editors (including you), I'm going to leave the ranks in German, but go ahead with translating the orders of battle. I'm testing a format that involves giving full translations, but also give the original German (linked to an article, if possible), except in cases where the German consists of cognates (like Infanterie Regiment). It's in a couple of articles right now, and unless there are some protests, I'll work this though the rest of the articles when I have time. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarom_7c23.html" title="User:Carom">Carom</a> 03:08, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Anthony.bradbury, I have not reposted any articles that you have deleted, however I have been contesting your speedy dleteion tages because they are mixtapes and I think that people would find it helpful to have the tracklistings here on Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/z/User%7EJizzy305_3d01.html" title="User:Jizzy305">Jizzy305</a> 02:24, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand. However, you accused me of vandalizing Wikipedia because I have "re-posted deleted articles". However, I do not believe that the articles I have recently created should be deleted. They are mixtapes and albums. I am simply posting they're track listings, which will help many people. I have found the track listings to the G-Unit Radio sereis and they helped me out a lot, I thought that they could help out other users of Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/z/User%7EJizzy305_3d01.html" title="User:Jizzy305">Jizzy305</a> 02:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>About the {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hang_on.html" title="Hang on">hang on</a>}} flags, there are no discussion pages for those recently created articles, so I have posted my reason at the bottom of the articles.</p>

<p>Yes, you have been mistaken. I recently created an article for G-Unit Radio West Prt.1 (LA American Wasteland). I was going to re-create, but I did not because I thought that you might think that i was vandalizing Wikipedia, and also, I could not find the tracklist for that album.</p>

<p>Sorry about the discussion thing, it was red, so I thought I could not post in it</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/z/User%7EJizzy305_3d01.html" title="User:Jizzy305">Jizzy305</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your advice, I will now contest each article you think should be deleted.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/z/User%7EJizzy305_3d01.html" title="User:Jizzy305">Jizzy305</a></p>
<p>Thank you, if I ever need help, I shall turn to you. However, the reason I made these articles is because I had many G-Unit underground songs and did not know which album they were on. I found these track listings and it helped a lot because I found out which songs where on each album, so I thought it would also help other Wikipedia users.</p>

<p>Yes, her name is indeed unusual. She is part Creek (Muskogee) indian/native american and part black American.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain her CV and will be able to significantly and authoritatively update the article and should, I believe, dispel any concerns about notability.</p>
<p>On a related note I am curious as to why or how a decision is made to mark this or any article for deletion. I have written several which have yet to be challenged in any significant way. Two other professors (Howard Winant and Leila Rupp) have been unsuccessfully challenged for deletion but many other less well written articles that I have done seem to have passed unnoticed or at least unchallenged.</p>

<p>Wow, that is <i>quite</i> a nice article. That's a lot of work. I am more or less an inclusionist, so <i>I</i> am not going to nominate the article for deletion, and, furthermore, if someone else does, I'll try to help defend it as best I can.

<p>I started the article for 2 reasons. The first was I kept seeing his name pop up everywhere in articles I was looking at today, and yet he had a red link. Secondly, he's a billionaire, one of the richest men in Canada, and has done a whole lot of stuff for Vancouver and BC. I actually have his autobiography, but I haven't read it. He's someone who needs an article, and it suprised me that it's been left alone for so long. What I put is just common knowledge of what I can recall. I'll get more in depth after I actually get some information on him, like when he was born.

<p>Thanks for your comments, which I appreciate. After reading Breitman's book I am convinced that Himmler was the "architect" of the Holocaust in the sense that he took Hitler's general, and possibly not explicit, instruction to "solve the Jewish question" and devised a concrete plan to carry it out. I don't think Goering played any significant role. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My reading of that is that Heydrich said in effect to Goering - Hitler has decided to kill the Jews and Himmler has ordered me to get on and do it. Sign this, you lazy fat schweinhund, and we will get it done and you won't have to worry about it any more. And Goering was happy to sign and let someone else do the dirty work. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:14, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ah, I failed to notice your response of 17/12 re Der Reichsministerial Fuß. Thanks. On the Holocaust, I think the chain of command was Hitler -&gt; Himmler -&gt; Heydrich -&gt; Eichmann. Goering was nominal No 2 in the regime so his pro forma consent was obtained. But as you say, this must remain speculation. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 16:05, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you. I would very much like to be "adoped" by you. The delays you mention are not problematic for me. In fact I will be dealing with them regularly as my wife is about to spend 4 months in London as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and we will need to coordinate our phone calls.</p>
<p>I do know the film "Silent Running". I have seen it several times and I love it. It was done by Douglas Trumbull who did the special effects for 2001 (you likely already know that). I too am a science fiction fan though I have read too little of late.</p>
<p>My areas of interest are music (I am a classical composer in my spare time), amateur photography, literature of all sorts, psychology, sociology, history (particularly music history) and many other things.</p>
<p>I thank you for your offer and I look forward to a fruitful collaboration from "across the pond" as they say. I think we will both learn valuable things.</p>

<p>Yes an interesting user. I first came across them when they were using a template on potential adoptees page that added them to the Category of user seeking to ADOPT! - quite annoying. See <a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalter_Humala_d356.html#Adoption_Template" title="User talk:Walter Humala">User_talk:Walter_Humala#Adoption Template</a>. They never replied to this request, but did stop adding the template - so that was good.</p>
<p>Even with 300+ edits to their userpage, they do meet the criteria - but I agree with you they are possibly not the ideal adopter. What is interesting, is that even after offering adoption to quite a number of users, they have never been taken up - so the users are deciding for themselves and self-regulating potentially "poor" Adopter (Walter if you read this, I am not suggesting you will are a poor user, but that you may be, like we all could be to varying degrees). So in the bigger picture - we can not stop users, who might not be ideal, from offering adopting, but we have to rely on new users picking for themselves, giving them access to information to help if they have a problem with an adopter (Adoptee's Area etc...), and severe cases intervene.</p>
<p>In this case I think you have done the right thing, possibly I would have been a bit more chilled about, but you did not do what should not be done, that is insist that they do not adopt - that would be counter productive. We should not try to use any authority or punishment to stop potentially poorer users offering adoption, but just like wikipedia, give some sound arguments why there might be problems. One of these that you missed in this case, not that it matters, is that Walter has often offered adoption on the basis that it was some kind of slave program - I assume a joke - which I think is not the best way to go about things.</p>
<p>Anyway If it is okay - can we copy the points from here and my talkpage the talkpage of Adopt-a-user so others can see the discussion. Cheers <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_f0fa.html" title="User:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 20:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two points - still can't find your reply Anthony - have looked at your contribution, Walter's contributions, and Walter's talk page history. Other point - Walter is obviously very keen to Adopt, though has not as yet managed it, which I see as good aspect of the <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">Adopt-a-User</a> program. Maybe we should just leave it be. If he does manage to adopt we can warn any of his adoptees soon after. There is a bigger discussion here and I think we should take it to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdopt-a-User_aea5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Adopt-a-User">Wikipedia talk:Adopt-a-User</a> - and get others opinions especially the Admins.

<p><i>It does seem that potential adoptees are voting with their feet, and staying away in their hordes. Perhaps we might leave it alone for the moment? While his block makes him unsuitable, there is no compulsion we can apply. Are you prepared to contact any adoptee he might collect and notify them of the criteria?--Anthony.bradbury 22:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Great minds think alike hey. Yes I will keep an eye on him and contact his adoptees if he gets any - just another thing to add to my long list of duties for Adopt-a-User&#160;:(:( <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_f0fa.html" title="User:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 22:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My girlfriend - who is now dragging me away to watch <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_Housewives_828f.html" title="Desperate Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a> - oh the punishment - thinks that the Catholic guy slur is really bad.

<p>Hey mate no problem. yes when I started my articles on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Argentine_films_44f6.html" title="List of Argentine films">List of Argentine films</a> earlier it was playing up then on new pages I had to keep clicking page backwards and forwards!!

<p>I also think me edits are nearer 30,000 now. I total it at the end of every month. It has amazed me how quick it adds up. This of course includes minor quick edits. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 21:27, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the speedy tag from this article and I want to explain why. You placed the tag entirely properly as the article was clearly an empty. However, high schools have a degree of inherent notability so I have converted the page into a stub. If you are (understandably) still concerned then an <a href="../../../a/f/d/Wp%7Eafd.html" title="Wp:afd">Afd</a> is the way to go.

<dd>Thank you. It really seemed to me that conversation, if that is the right word, between <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">User:Malber</a> and a harmless teenage editor was so far out of order as to be totally off the planet. I note he has a 48-block. While it may be possible that a very young aspirant may be emotionally/psychologically/intellectually unready for Adminship, this would show in their answers and in their edit count. So ageism is wholly inappropriate. I have one no-consensus RfA on my record.

<p>First, good article. Second, no, I was unaware of the debate: I always thought that Göring was the German spelling and that Goering was the more conventional English form (cf. Schröder/Schroeder), as ö does not exist in English. With regard to Goebbels, I've never seen the spelling Göbbels. We title our article "Hermann Göring". In any case, Goering is not necessarily incorrect, but I thank you for your understanding. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 23:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, further questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you give a page reference from Shirer?</li>
<li>If he had a shortened leg, I can understand why he wore a built-up boot to compensate, but what would have been the purpose of the iron leg brace?</li>
<li>He writes at one point in his diary "My foot troubles me badly. I am conscious of it all the time." Why would he have pain in his foot? Is this not more suggestive of club foot than of a shortened leg? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
