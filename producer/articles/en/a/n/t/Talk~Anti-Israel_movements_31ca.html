<p>probably, some guy made it to create a page about how anyone that opposed Israel was a nazi, so I just re-worked it. How is it POV? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 19:20 Nov 10, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current version of the article is reverted to before Lir's attempts at NPOVing it. It is currently hopelessly POV (according to my POV) and contains no information that is not already in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a> and contains very little information at all... mostly statements of someone's opinions, commonalities and generalizations without support. I recommend a redirect. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 19:42 Nov 10, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Is it POV now? I think a page that sums up the anti-israel organizations in general would be good. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 19:55 Nov 10, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Basically, Zionism is a religion. I think more is opposed than merely Zionism, the occupied territories has to do with nationalism. Which of course is related to Zionism...<a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 19:59 Nov 10, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems NPOV to me now, though I don't know a whole lot about the topic. I'm still tepidly in favor of a redirect though, but this page seems good now and I suppose a page about the specific movements would be nice. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 20:03 Nov 10, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>66.32.18.98, why don't you explain what you don't like about Lir's version of the article here on the talk page so we can work out a neutral version.</p>
<p>For example, here are some reasons why I prefer her's (though it's possible that neither one is NPOV)</p>
<p>You state "It is also commonly used as a subterfuge to mask anti- Semitic and neo- Nazi sentiments as political correctness or human rights awareness" in the opening paragraph--this is a subject that deserves its own paragraph elsewhere in the article. Placing it here is misleading because it seems to imply that most anti-Israel movements are anti-Semitic or neo-Nazi.</p>
<p>Do all terrorist groups believe "there is no hope for negotiation with their enemy, which they percieve to be <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, anyone who supports or befriends Jews or any non- Muslim, regardless of age or sex who does not espouse their rigid Muslim doctrine and theological- based hatred."?</p>
<p>Most egregiously POV is "eradication of the Jewish homeland, argued by some to be occupied in violation of <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a> despite a historical, moral and legal precedence giving right to the state of Israel to exist." Many people do not believe there is any historical, moral or legal precedence in granting the right of existence for Israel. Myself, for example.</p>
<p>Would you like to respond and maybe work out a useful article? <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 06:21 Nov 13, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Many people do not believe there is any historical, moral or legal precedence in granting the right of existence for Israel. Myself, for example" ...that statement shows bias right there. How can anyone debate an issue when there's obtuse bias like that? Suppose for example we were debating Native American's rights and you didn't even agree to the fcat that they had historical rights of ownership that were violated? There could be no debate. The same applies to this; you can't separate anti- Zionism from anti- Semitism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Between the blatant anti- Semitic bias of the clique of you regulars and the bullying and threats by admins, this place doesn't really smack of neutrality unless its the "neutrality" like mav et al. think it should be.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>66.32.18.98 why are you reverting Lir's and Danny's version of the article? Danny was the last person to edit the content of this article (which happended to be Lir's rewrite) and I trust that Danny made sure the article is NPOV. And your track record on messing with the Columbus article and pestering Lir only tends to discredit your motives. I know that Lir can be anti-social and rude sometimes but at least she has a log-in and answers email. You on the other hand use a new IP with nearly every visit (five of which were blocked). Please play nice or the Admins will have to track down your ISP and file a complaint. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 06:21 Nov 13, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>shouldn't this just be named 'liripedia", then? and who the fuck are you talking about biased? you said Israel was commiting genocide against Palestinians.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>remember...the UN has said that the occupation of Palestine is illegal! That certainly has bearing on this issue and tends to discredit the Israeli position! <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 06:24 Nov 13, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>66.32--we have a policy of presenting all sides of an issue. The fact that you believe all who oppose Israel are evil fascists can most certainly be included in the article-however the article cannot and will not state that all who oppose Israel are evil fascists. It can only state, "Some argue that anyone who opposes Israel is a fascist." If you have sources stating that the Israeli government has made such statements, we could even have the article say, "Israel argues that all who oppose it are fascists." <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 06:41 Nov 13, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK folks. It is time to stop feeding the troll. Simply revert any edit you see any 66.32.xxx.xxx IP makes. --mav</p>
<p>See, thats where we really differ mav. Simple reverting any edit they make is pointless. It doesn't hurt to at least look at what they submit. Part of this article was written by 66.32 or is an edited version of 66.32. The problem is 66.32 refuses to drop certain POV points and always reverts the whole article-much like you suggest doing to 66.32. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 06:56 Nov 13, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article doesnt even state why "Anti-Israel movements" oppose Israel. But isn't this the same thing as anti-zionism? --<a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Major changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Included only movement who oppose the existance of Israel and not just a movements opossing its current policy.</li>
<li>Removed "Pasificist". (you can re-add them, but please reason why).</li>
<li>Specified measured taken by each group.</li>
<li>Added Israel's repsonse aboout anti-Zionism ("merely an antisemitism in disguise").</li>
<li>Here is the reedited text:</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Anti-Israel movements</b> are movements directed against the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israeli</a> government and sometimes rejecting the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> premise of Israel's existence. Such groups vary from the radical left through the extreme right till Islamist exteremist and even terrorist organizations. Some act only at the political level, arranging demonstrations against Israel and call to ban it, while others take violent measures against Israelis and Jews worldwide.</p>
<p>The main types of anti-Israeli groups are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazis_f17f.html" title="Neo-Nazis">Neo-Nazis</a>\<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemites</a>: those groups concentrate in the western world, where free speech and free press are reachable as tools to spread anti-Israeli propoganda. Those groups reject the right of Israel to exist by merely denying any rights from the Jews, including the right of self definition in a independent state. Such groups are usually declared illegal in their countries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionist_d028.html" title="Anti-Zionist">Anti-Zionists</a>: these groups are usually identified with the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_left.html" title="Radical left">radical left</a> and their motto is "we are not against <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, only against Zionism". These group claim that <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> is a racist <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialist.html" title="Colonialist">colonialist</a> movement that stealing the land from its rightful owner - the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinians.html" title="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>. Such group accusing the Zionist movement in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> and policy of apartthide and even "ethnic cleansing" toward the Palestinians. Although they do not define themselves as anti-semticis, some of them are tend to use antisemite motives in their propoganda. They usually do not take direct violent actions against Israel although some of these groups advocating terrorism against Israel. Such groups are usually take legal steps to promote their cause - such as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstrations.html" title="Demonstrations">demonstrations</a>, publishing articles in the press, forming anti-Israeli cells and campuses and calling for banning of Israeli products and even Israeli people. Example of such group is the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Solidarity_Movement_2eb9.html" title="International Solidarity Movement">International Solidarity Movement</a> (the <a href="../../../i/s/m/ISM_ebf2.html" title="ISM">ISM</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/t/Neturey_Karta_0b0a.html" title="Neturey Karta">Neturey Karta</a>: a small fundementalist sect of ultra-orthdox Jews who resist the existance of the secular Israel because it was created by secular Jews and not by the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>. There group is outcasted by almost every major stream of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, including ultra-orthodox Jews.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Muslim exteremist: reject the existance of Israel on the base of the hatred of the Arab world toward Israel. Part of them are joining <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionist_d028.html" title="Anti-Zionist">anti-Zionist</a> groups in order to stage protests against Israel and promoting the banning of Israel in the western and Arab world.</li>
</ul>
<p>See further discussion in: <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Israeli_conflict_df9c.html" title="Arab Israeli conflict">Arab Israeli conflict</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerilla.html" title="Guerilla">Militants</a> who believe there is no hope for negotiation with their enemy, whom they perceive to be foreign <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialists</a>. Some of these militants espouse a doctrine of warfare referred to by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">UN</a> as "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>". As in many such <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">wars</a>, these groups have been targeting <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian.html" title="Civilian">civilians</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/n/Noncombatant.html" title="Noncombatant">noncombatants</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian_infrastructure.html" title="Civilian infrastructure">civilian infrastructure</a>. Almost of the organization who uses direct violence against Israel are Arab Muslim and were declared as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> organizations by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a>, the <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israeli</a> government argues that it is not occupying any territories in violation of any law, and that the militants mentioned above are <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_combatant.html" title="Illegal combatant">illegal combatants</a>. Israel further argues that it has attempted negotiations, but that the militants are unwilling to negotiate.</p>
<p>Israel also accuses the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Authority_16df.html" title="Palestinian Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> of not only failing to take firm action against the illegal combatants, but aiding and abetting in the crime of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>.</p>
<p>Israel also claims that anti-Zionism is merely an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a> in disguise (queoting <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_d548.html" title="Martin Luther King">Martin Luther King</a>) and reasons that such groups only derprive the Jew's right for independent state while other state, mainly Arab dictatorships, gain strong support from such groups. That is, Israel claims, proves that they are racist and discriminantive toward Jews.</p>
