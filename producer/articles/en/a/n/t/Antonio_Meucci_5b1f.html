Antonio Meucci.</div>

<p><b>Antonio Santi Giuseppe Meucci</b> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">April 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1808.html" title="1808">1808</a>–<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">October 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>) was an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> inventor, and the very first inventor of the Telephone, as confirmed by the US Congress which passed a resolution crediting the little-known Italian immigrant as the phone's rightful originator.</p>
<p>On June 16th 2002 US Congress recognized the impoverished Florentine immigrant as the inventor of the telephone rather than Alexander Graham Bell. Historians and Italian-Americans won their battle to persuade Washington to recognize Antonio Meucci <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> as a father of modern communications, 113 years after his death. The vote by the House of Representatives prompted joyous claims in Meucci's homeland that finally Bell had been outed as a perfidious Scot who found fortune and fame by stealing another man's work. Calling the Italian's career extraordinary and tragic, the resolution said his "teletrofono", demonstrated in New York in 1860, made him the inventor of the telephone in the place of Bell, who had access to Meucci's materials and who took out a patent 16 years later. "It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and his work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged," the resolution stated. Bell's immortalization in books and films has rankled with generations of Italians who know Meucci's story. Born in 1808, he studied design and mechanical engineering at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, and as a stage technician at the city's Teatro della Pergola developed a primitive system to help colleagues communicate. In the 1830s he moved to Cuba and, while working on methods to treat illnesses with electric shocks, found that sounds could travel by electrical impulses through copper wire. Sensing potential, he moved to Staten Island, near New York City, in 1850 to develop the technology. When Meucci's wife, Ester, became paralyzed he rigged a system to link her bedroom with his neighboring workshop and in 1860 held a public demonstration which was reported in New York's Italian-language press. In between giving shelter to political exiles, Meucci struggled to find financial backing, failed to master English and was severely burned in an accident aboard a steamship. Forced to make new prototype telephones after Ester sold his machines for $6 to a secondhand shop, his models became more sophisticated. An inductor formed around an iron core in the shape of a cylinder was a technique so sophisticated that it was used decades later for long-distance connections. Meucci could not afford the $250 needed for a definitive patent for his "talking telegraph" so in 1871 filed a one-year renewable notice of an impending patent. Three years later he could not even afford the $10 to renew it. He sent a model and technical details to the Western Union telegraph company but failed to win a meeting with executives. When he asked for his materials to be returned, in 1874, he was told they had been lost. Two years later Bell, who shared a laboratory with Meucci, filed a patent for a telephone, became a celebrity and made a lucrative deal with Western Union. Meucci sued and was nearing victory - the supreme court agreed to hear the case and fraud charges were initiated against Bell - when the Florentine died in 1889. The legal action died with him. Yesterday the newspaper La Repubblica welcomed the vote to recognise the Tuscan inventor as a belated comeuppance for Bell, a "cunning Scotsman" and "usurper" whose per- fidy built a communications empire.</p>

<p>This list is also taken from Basilio Catania's historical reconstruction<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>1825 Chemical compound to be used as an improved propellant in fireworks</li>
<li>1834 In the Florence's Teatro della Pergola, he sets up a "pipe telephone" to communicate from the stage to the maneuver trellis-work, at about eighteen meters height.</li>
<li>1840 Improved filters and chemical processing of waters supplying the city of Havana, Cuba.</li>
<li>1844 First electroplating factory of the Americas, set up in Havana, Cuba. Before, objects to be electroplated were sent to Paris.</li>
<li>1846 Improved apparatus for electrotherapy, featuring a pulsed current breaker with rotating cross.</li>
<li>1847 Restructuring of the Tacón Theater in Havana, following a hurricane. Meucci conceived a new structure of the roof and ventilation system, to avoid the roof to be taken off in like situations.</li>
<li>1848 Astronomical observations by means of a marine telescope worth $280.</li>
<li>1849 Chemical process for the preservation of corpses, to cope with the high demand for bodies of immigrants to be sent to Europe, avoiding decomposition during the many weeks navigation.</li>
<li>1849 First discovery of electrical transmission of speech.</li>
<li>1850-1 First stearic candle factory of the Americas, set up in Clifton, NY.</li>

<li>1862 US Patent No. 36,192 on a kerosene lamp that generates a very bright flame, without smoke, (therefore not needing a glass tube), thanks to electricity developed by two thin platinum plates embracing the flame.</li>
<li>1862-63 Process for treating and bleaching oil or kerosene to obtain siccative oils for paint (US Patents No. 36,419 and No. 38,714). "Antonio Meucci Patent Oil" was sold by Rider &amp; Clark Co., 51 Broad Street, New York, and exported to Europe. See expert comment.</li>
