<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Kiedis_85cd.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Anthony Kiedis was born in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Rapids%2C_Michigan_4f0d.html" title="Grand Rapids, Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, to John Kiedis and Margaret "Peggy" Idema (née Noble). His parents divorced in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, when he was three. He has two half-sisters, Julie and Jenny, and a half-brother, James. Kiedis lived with his mother in Grand Rapids until he was eleven, then moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California, with his father, a soon-to-be actor and drug dealer. Anthony's father was the person who introduced him to drugs for the first time. Anthony would later go on to use and abuse many drugs in his lifetime. His great-grandfather, Anton Kiedis, is <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanians.html" title="Lithuanians">Lithuanian</a> and his paternal grandmother has some <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohican.html" title="Mohican">Mohican</a> blood. His godfather was <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Bono_ac17.html" title="Sonny Bono">Sonny Bono</a>. Kiedis spent much of his youth listening to <a href="../../../s/l/y/Sly_%26_the_Family_Stone_7194.html" title="Sly &amp; the Family Stone">Sly &amp; the Family Stone</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Wonder_c1f2.html" title="Stevie Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> - artists who would influence the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound. Around the age of fifteen, while a student at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairfax_High_School_%28Los_Angeles%29_35e3.html" title="Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)">Fairfax High School</a>, he met <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Balzary_f675.html" title="Michael Balzary">Michael Balzary (Flea)</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_Slovak_1569.html" title="Hillel Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a>, with whom he would eventually go on to form a band.</p>
<p>He went on to study at <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a>, but dropped out after losing interest, due to his abusive relationship with drugs. This cycle of addiction and recovery in the mid to late 80's would become a basis for a lot of Anthony's early lyrics. After dropping out of UCLA, Kiedis was offered to open for a friend's band, so he got together with friends Flea, Slovak, and Jack Irons. Initially, the group was named <i>Tony Flow and the Miraculousy Majestic Masters of Mayhem</i>. Slovak and Irons were in the band <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthym.html" title="Anthym">Anthym</a> at this time. According to his autobiography, Kiedis used to take up the role of a "protector" in school, defending all the kids who were outcast or bullied. When future bandmate <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flea_%28musician%29.html" title="Flea (musician)">Flea</a> was playfully putting Kiedis's friend in a headlock, he told Flea to back off. When the misunderstanding was revealed, they became friends. Also in Scar Tissue, Kiedis talks about how he slept over Flea's house in his child years, and repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with Flea's sister, Karen. He lost his virginity when he was around twelve years old to his father's girlfriend at the time, a redhead named Kimberly.</p>
<p>Later in life, Kiedis often struggled with <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addiction.html" title="Drug addiction">drug addiction</a>, including <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>. He tried to get clean after the heroin <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overdose.html" title="Overdose">overdose</a> death of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_e31d.html" title="Red Hot Chili Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> guitarist <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_Slovak_1569.html" title="Hillel Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a> on June 25, 1988, saying he would never shoot up again. He entered rehab and ended up staying clean for 5 years. He relapsed in 1993 because of a strong painkiller used while having his <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisdom_teeth.html" title="Wisdom teeth">wisdom teeth</a> removed. He went in and out of <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehabilitation.html" title="Rehabilitation">rehab</a> over the next few years, but has reportedly avoided another relapse since December 24, 2000. "It’s easy to be a junkie," Kiedis said in the March, 2007, issue of <i><a href="../../../b/l/e/Blender_%28magazine%29.html" title="Blender (magazine)">Blender</a></i>. "It’s not easy to be one of the greatest guitar players of all time, or one of the greatest writers."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Kiedis published a memoir titled <i><a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar_Tissue_%28book%29_6f6e.html" title="Scar Tissue (book)">Scar Tissue</a></i>, which peaked at number 17 on the New York Times Bestseller List.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> It is a detailed insight to Kiedis's life from a rebellious child to a rockstar.</p>

<p>In early 1982 Kiedis, high school friends with <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_Slovak_1569.html" title="Hillel Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a>, witnessed young Hillel bullied by a young <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Balzary_f675.html" title="Michael Balzary">Michael Balzary</a> and stood up for Slovak. Kiedis, a kind of friend to the nerds and geeks as he says in his book Scar Tissue, stood up to bullies. When Kiedis went to confront the bully <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Balzary_f675.html" title="Michael Balzary">Michael Balzary</a> (Flea),he realized they were alike in more ways than one. Both quickly became good friends. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Irons_7006.html" title="Jack Irons">Jack Irons</a> (drummer) began to socialize with the two and eventually Slovak was friends with all four of them. The group were invited to play in a club as <i>Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem</i>, which would eventually change its name to the <i>Red Hot Chili Peppers</i>. The band's original line up consisted of the four friends, leading up to their first studio album, at which time Jack and Hillel reunited with their original project. After <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_%28album%29_4f03.html" title="The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)">The Red Hot Chili Peppers</a></i>, Hillel Slovak was reunited with Anthony and Flea. Another album later, Jack Irons rejoined the band until leaving due to Hillel's drug overdose. Since then, the band has experienced at least twelve different line ups, releasing nine studio albums in the span of 24 years.</p>
<p>Kiedis has always been the band's <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontman.html" title="Frontman">frontman</a> with his good looks and charisma. Along with fellow band co-founder Flea, Kiedis has never left the band, although in his 2004 memoir <i>Scar Tissue</i>, he said he was kicked out of the band for a month due to <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehabilitation.html" title="Rehabilitation">rehabilitation</a> problems. Kiedis is one of the main musical songwriters of the group and writes most of the lyrics, although all of their songs are credited to <b>Flea-Kiedis-..</b> with the other band members at the time. From 1989's "Mother's Milk" to 1991's "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" album and since 1999's "Californication" album, John Frusciante and Flea have written all of the music for RHCP with Kiedis supplying lyrics and melodies. His lyrical style has varied over the years. From their early roots as a band, Kiedis wrote many lyrics involving <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a>, and life in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">L.A.</a> As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he started to write songs about <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, struggles in life and loss of friends, incorporating a larger sense of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_realism.html" title="Social realism">social realism</a> and thoughtfulness in his lyrics.</p>
<p>He started being the vocalist of the band by <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapping.html" title="Rapping">rapping</a>, which he could do at extreme speeds, keeping a consistent <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm.html" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a>. Starting from as early as <i><a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother%27s_Milk_84c4.html" title="Mother's Milk">Mother's Milk</a></i> in 1989, Kiedis would write songs for the band with more melody rather than the basic rhythm and beat style of <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop.html" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a>, their first song doing this was "<a href="../../../k/n/o/Knock_Me_Down_d389.html" title="Knock Me Down">Knock Me Down</a>". The melody was actually shaped and reformed by the guitarist - John Frusciante. Upon joining the band, he sang lead vocals on the song along with Kiedis. 1991's <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik_8e6a.html" title="Blood Sugar Sex Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></i> still saw Kiedis rapping, but he started singing his first melodic ballads in songs like "<a href="../../../u/n/d/Under_the_Bridge_e70d.html" title="Under the Bridge">Under the Bridge</a>", "<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaking_the_Girl_1699.html" title="Breaking the Girl">Breaking the Girl</a>" and "<a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Could_Have_Lied_982b.html" title="I Could Have Lied">I Could Have Lied</a>". Over the years, Kiedis would favor singing rather than rapping. Kiedis said in his memoirs that he got many vocal coaches, but none of them would help him sing "better". In fact, it was not until 1999's <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Californication_%28album%29.html" title="Californication (album)">Californication</a></i> when he could take full control of his voice to sing. Many critics and reviewers agree that his voice has greatly improved and might have even reached its height in the Chili Peppers' most recent album <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium_Arcadium_b43a.html" title="Stadium Arcadium">Stadium Arcadium</a></i>.</p>
