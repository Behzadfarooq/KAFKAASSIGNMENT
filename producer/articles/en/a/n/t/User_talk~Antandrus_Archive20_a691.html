<p>Hi again! What about the links for <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peabody_Institute_37fc.html" title="Peabody Institute">Peabody Institute</a> faculty who do not have entries in WP? Many of them probably will not have one; in one case (Paul Johnson, whom I know and who is a good guy) the link took us to a disambiguation page that does not include him. I'm also wondering about the faculty links that take us straight oout of WP to an external bio page. Is there a consensus on how to handle these things? As a Peabody alum I am glad to have a good entry here, but I find it hard to fathom the rationale for some of these things.

<p>Dear Antandrus,</p>
<p>Would you kindly stop deleting my entries about composer Lera Auerbach. I am not sure why you are doing this. If you have a problem please discuss it with me first, before simply deleting it. Specially deleting it as self promotion, when it clearly is not. I am a graduate of the Juilliard School with a special interest in contemporary Russian composers. I have grown fascinated by Ms. Auerbach's music and general creative output as poet and pianist as well. She is probably the single most important exponent of polystylism after Alfred Schnittke. Please visit the website of her publisher Sikorski in Hamburg to learn all about this very significant composer of the living generation. So please cease and desist deleting my references to her work. Thank you.</p>
<p>I understand I am new to Wikipedia, but please respect my entries. DeStella <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeStella_5cb9.html" title="User talk:DeStella">(talk)</a></p>

<dd>She does not belong on lists that contain the most famous composers to work in a given genre: you have been putting her alongside people like Bach, Barber, Hindemith. Consider what Wikipedia would be like if every one of 30,000 active composers put him or herself, or their own favorite minor composer, in the encyclopedia in such a way. We have a lot of problems here with over-promotion of minor figures, and I have noticed that Lera Auerbach is quite aggressively promoted in this way. We are not a vehicle for promotion. Thank you, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 17:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your response. As a polystylist, I have put her name with Alfred Schnittke, John Zorn, etc. Very much her peers. I have noticed that Wikipedia has in general focused its content about composers from an American perspective.If you want to get technical about the direct connection with Schnittke - please research her work thoroughly before asserting your opinion. I have noticed that Wikipedia has in general focused its content about composers from an American perspective. Many major and significant composers not well known in America, but likely more significant in the global view are omitted repeatedly from its lists.</dd>

<dd>Please stop deleting my entries unless you can effectively prove I am incorrect, not simply because of your opinion. Wikipedia is a factual encyclopedia edited by users around the world, not a forum for academics to exert editorial control. In the case of this composer. You speak of minor, when by the age of 30 she has a catalogue of over 80 major works, thousands of performances and is currently and actively performed by a great number major artist today. What I am doing is not promoting a favorite composer, but bringing to light a very significant living composer - to you and others that share an interest in the history of music. So please do not delete without disussion with me.</dd>

<dd>I am not deleting your entries "because of my opinion". Lera Auerbach does not even have an entry in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Grove_f9ac.html" title="New Grove">New Grove</a>, which is the most commonly used standard for notability of composers on Wikipedia, and you have been inserting her name into places that are clearly inappropriate -- lists of famous cello sonatas and violin concertos, alongside Bach and Britten and Hindemith. No. Please provide a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> before inserting her into more lists as you have been. I am an administrator here, and part of my job is to watch for <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a> which exist only to inflate the importance of their favorite topics. And remember that the <i>burden of evidence is on you</i> to assert notability, not me. That's policy here. See <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> which explains it.

<p>Antandrus,</p>
<p>Thank you again for your response. I do understand, appreciate and agree with some of your points. But do YOU decide what is innapropriate. If so, then the whole point of Wikipedia is lost. I will certanly become more familiar with WP policies. BUT, I understood Wikipedia to be a bit more visionary than the New Grove, which misses most of the 20th and 21st century. I seriously question this particular case. Cello Sonatas. The aricle is Cello Sonata not Cello Sonatas by Dead Composers or Famous Cello Sonatas (and this title would be very deceptive as famous is a reltive term). This article is missing 80% of the existing sonatas, not even the "famous" L. Boccherini, performed by most every cellist, is listed. Not to mention the 20th century and 21st century works! - If Wikipedia aspires to be of real relevance in the future of the global community it cannot assert the type of editorial control exhibited here. IT MUST BE BETTER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAT ALL OTHERS! I understand that a separate list of Sonatas by epoch may be needed. But that can be done after a list is unmanageable.</p>
<p>In this case, the programming of Auerbach's cello Sonata by the Music Directors of the Lincoln Chamber Music Society David Finckel (Emerson Quartet Cellist) in his inagural and most visable performce yet is credible enough for the work to be included in a list of Cello Sonatas, which is what this article is!</p>
<p>Please do not delete without discussion with me. You did it again! Please put back the Auerbach cello sonata in the CELLO SONATA article. Or, change the name of the article to Cello Sonatas by Dead Composers or at least Famous Cello Sonatas (which would be challengable) i.e. Frank Bridge's sonata. I must insist you reconsider what you are doing. From my perspective, you are standing in direct conflict with what Wikipedia is. I appreciate your committed work to Wikipedia, but please kindly consider what I am telling you, sometimes a detached perspective can be very useful. At this point I trust that you are an unbiased administrator, without personal issues with succesful living composers.</p>
<p><br />
With best wishes,</p>
<p>DeStella</p>

<dd>Well hello again. I strongly recommend you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>. We are not a publisher of original thought; we are not a vehicle for correcting wrong biases, or means of establishing a new worldview beyond what you seem to think the New Grove represents. We develop our content from secondary sources, such as the New Grove, and those only. It's all in our policies. Speaking of "detached perspective", I would like to point out that your entire purpose on Wikipedia appears to be promoting a single living composer. Are <i>you</i> detached? With all due respect, I would take you more seriously if you had done something besides promote a single composer who is not even listed in the New Grove. Please beware of <i>ad hominem</i> attacks and red herrings, such as accusing me of having "issues with succesful living composers". Do you think that thousands of living composers should all add themselves or have their friends and enthusiasts add them to every article and list on Wikipedia? Do you? Exactly how "detached" are <i>you</i>?

<p>Dear Antandrus,</p>
<p>Yes, This is not hidded. My profile asserts it. I am also a Contemporary Russia buff/expert with several degrees in music. And who do I have the pleasure to talk with? I could not find your name anywhere. I became aware of Wikipedia while issuing it as a research tool. I do not see your name accesible in your profile. To avoid conflict of interest in this case I would like you to answer me about the issues I raised with the Cello Sonata article in General and Wikipedia in General. You became defensive, is there a reason? I am interested and in awe of Wikipedia as an idea AND you did not address the points about Cello Sonata article and how this is handled. I added Elliot Carter Sonata among others less known, and will continue to do so. I am very curious as to how you will handle these.</p>
<p>And yes, with appropriate managed lists yes, Wikipedia should have comprehensive listings of creative artist in all disciplines. In example critiria similar to the Recording Academy. Where an artist that has a minimum of publishing or recording credit is listed. There are such lists in Wikipedia. This can be done with cello sonatas, violin concertos, etc.</p>
<p>By deleting relevant entries, regardless of their source Wikipedia will never achieve what it strives to do. This can be a very productive dialogue at many levels. Hope to continue it. It is not personal. If anything it is about the relevancy of living composers. And from this I cannot be detached. And I have a lot of experience with this. I plan to become much more active in teh WP project. Thank you for the back and forth.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>DeStella</p>

<dd>Let's separate these topics. 1) I'm happy to see you editing the cello sonata article; the piece by Elliott Carter is extremely important. Please continue to improve this article and others. If you are familiar with the cello repertoire, go ahead and write about the specific compositions; I would be elated to see someone knowledgeable arrive, for there are not many editors in this area working at present. Second issue: 2) I ask you to abide by Wikipedia policy regarding <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Please do not edit articles about people you know. That includes your wife. Only an uninvolved person, who <i>does not know the subject</i> should do that. If someone is truly notable, <i>others will write about that person.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">Red herrings</a> will not confuse me, since I have studied logic. By blaming this conflict on me because I am "defensive" or because I "have an issue with successful composers", you provide lovely examples of <i><a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">ignoratio elenchi</a></i>, i.e. red herrings. Please do not do that; these are also <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> attacks. The topic here is conflict of interest: please do not edit articles about people you know, or insert mentions of those people into Wikipedia elsewhere. No one who does this can conform to the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view policy</a> for reasons which should be obvious. That's why we depend on uninvolved people to do that.</dd>

<dd>We welcome knowledgeable newcomers in the field of contemporary music with open arms. Unfortunately, many of them engage in self-promotion, and that is something that Wikipedia's administrators are tasked with preventing. This is what I am doing. I wish Lera Auerbach's career well, and I'm sure her music is lovely; I'd like to hear some. But Wikipedia is NOT a vehicle for promotion.</dd>

<p><br />
Antandrus,</p>
<p>"Logic sometimes makes monsters" <i>Henri Poincare</i></p>
<p>Let's stick with the Cello Sonata article. I am intrigued and bothered by your editorial logic. And I have a very valid point you are ignoring.</p>
<p>YOU are deciding which is a relevant cello sonata and what is not. You have decided that the Carter is relevant and the Blackwood sonata is also relevant (I would be surprised if most cellist would even know Blackwood - I happen to like the work) and they belongs in YOUR version of this list.</p>
<p>This article as well as other similar ones need to be a list arranged by epoch, or other criteria, otherwise it is not accurately titled.(CELLO SONATA - LIST OF CELLO SONATAS) This information needs to be aquired from all source available. Then organized accordingly. Otherwise you are hindering the true potential of Wikipedia. I am sure of this! Specially in the awakening of internet 2 technologies.</p>
<p>I cannot but agree with the personal promotion issue. But in this case you are making a particular composer the issue. I have many other composers I'd like to ad to this lists and possibly write about - and I would not mind being edited or corrected by the Wikipedia community, but not by ONE person. This cannot possibly be what Wikipedia intended. If it is so, the visionary model would be compromised and lost in long term.</p>
<p>If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of source. Should it be included? or is it subject to Editorial opinion based control by ONE person. Please answer me this one question.</p>
<p>And, is the Cello Sonata List a list of existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas which an administrator agrees with as relevant?</p>
<p>All the best wishes,</p>

<dd>All righty then. If you think I'm biased, <i>go ask for another opinion from another administrator</i>. There's 1200 of us. Do it. The list is here: <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Administrators_33f6.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Administrators">Wikipedia:List of Administrators</a>. I'm sure you can find one who is not "defensive" or does not "have issues with successful composers". Please leave a post on the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">administrators' noticeboard</a> if you think I am biased. Do it! If you truly believe that I am biased, go get another opinion! And don't accuse me of having "my version" of the cello sonata article, for I <i>have not edited it</i> except to remove your promotion. I <i>did not write the article</i>. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 18:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Antandrus,</p>
<p>You still did not answer my questions&#160;:) Which do not relate to the self promotion issue, which of course is clear. I will in the future refrain from adding any information about family members. But, If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of editor. Should it be included? Isn't it a loss to WP? - And, is the Cello Sonata List (and this question applies to all open lists in WP) a list of all existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas to be determined by administrators? In any case, thank you for your time in clarifying a lot about WP and its mechanisms.</p>
<p>These are relevant quotes from information I have found in WP guideline pages:</p>
<p>"Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources. "</p>
<p>In this scase the list title is LIST OF CELLO SONATAS. So adding any existing and published cello sonatas should be valid unless the listing title is changed to narrow the list. I would suggest adding the criteria to Cello Sonatas that are in print or published. Do you agree?</p>
<p>And, I simply politely ask that if you have a problem with an entry, you tag the sentence or listing by adding the <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> or use another WP guideline way to allow for the editor to respond. Not simply arbitrarily remove. In particular with lists.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time and I look forward to becoming more involved in the WP community. Kudos to all involved!</p>

<dd>Hi again; thanks for promising to follow our COI guideline: that's my main issue, <i>as an administrator</i>, with your edit that started this thread. As an editor I have no problem with you adding or removing names from lists, and I encourage you to improve articles in any way you would like. Regarding the list of cello sonatas--this is a problematic issue, and has to do with the evolution of Wikipedia. Within the last couple years most of the embedded lists within articles have been moved to their own articles, but several years ago that was not the case (see the history of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_music.html" title="Renaissance music">Renaissance music</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Renaissance_composers_a03a.html" title="List of Renaissance composers">List of Renaissance composers</a> for an example). <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello_sonata.html" title="Cello sonata">Cello sonata</a> is a sadly neglected article and needs a lot of improvement. Have a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_compositions_for_cello_and_piano.html" title="List of compositions for cello and piano">List of compositions for cello and piano</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_solo_cello_pieces.html" title="List of solo cello pieces">List of solo cello pieces</a> for two more places some of these things are written up; and I suggest it may be time to split off List of cello sonatas as its own article. Our evolving guidelines increasingly suggest moving these lists <i>out</i> of articles. (See <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony.html" title="Symphony">symphony</a> for another ghastly article that needs a major content improvement, and contains a list which ought to be pruned/moved elsewhere -- though others, as always on Wikipedia, may disagree.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There have been many discussions on whether lists should be all-inclusive or "most famous only" -- and I've seen two approaches. Most of the time the "most famous only" does not work because of the POV inherent in making the choice. A new precedent, and one of the finest examples on Wikipedia (in my opinion) is here: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_operas.html" title="List of important operas">List of important operas</a> (and also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_major_opera_composers.html" title="List of major opera composers">List of major opera composers</a>). I think these are two of the best lists on Wikipedia. Look at the methodology used to determine which items were or were not famous enough to make the lists, and look at how well everything is explained and sourced.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hope this helps. I <i>am</i> happy to have you here editing on Wikipedia in spite of our initial collision over the conflict of interest issue.

<p>Hello Antandrus! As a newbie administrator I would appreciate your help with something. I've become more familiar with the blocking system a bit now and slowly starting to get the hang of it. In the future I'm aware that I would most likely encounter some school IPs which need to be given soft blocks to prevent collateral damage. I've learned the language of the tick marks somewhat good however, I would appreciate your advice. What is the best way to implement soft blocks in such cases?

<dd>Yeah I'm not sure how effective a 32 hour block will be, he's already been blocked.

<p>Maybe Crossmr should not be <i>removing large portions of discussion with no discussion</i>. Perhaps he should not be editing other people's talk pages? Improper, irresponsible, arrogant, and just plain wrong. Crossmr is guilty of this over many articles, and it just plain insulting to other users. I guess if you disagree with Crossmr, your opinion / position / comments / discussion just don't count. As long as Crossmr chooses to act like this, users (and clearly it's more than just me, I don't live in SF or Seattle) will continue to "abuse" Crossmr as he does them. Perhaps if he toned down his ego a bit, people would have fewer problems with him? 24.116.200.178 01:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You may have noticed Eagle101 and myself adding more music files to our music articles. I'd like it if you could give these a checkover - specifically, please check for redundancies.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There has been an excess of vandalism on the page Yuriy Leonovich, which I created last year. Someone thinks that I am actually this person and is insistant on having the page removed. I remeber explaining to you, in August, the situation, because the issue came up before. When I came to Wikipedia I didn't know how to begin a page. I couldn't find any information on how to do it. I finally figured out how to create a "personal page", and hoped that I could move it right away, with a Wikipedian's help. Just because Leonovich is not world famous does not make him any less noted. He has had works performed in Carnegie hall, and completed Tchaikovsky's Cello Concerto. I also received an unsinged message on my Talk Page, talking of vanity. I believe it's the same unregistered user that has been vandalising the page. I am well aware of Wikipedia rules of vanity and promotion. I am here to state the facts. As you can see, there is a legitimate reference on the Yuriy Leonovich page: www.tchaikovsky-research.org. This page is mainained by Brett Langston and Alexander Poznansky, authors of the Tchaikovsky Handbook, and other well known biographies on Tchaikovsky's life. The authors are used as references on different pages on Wikipedia. I hope you understand my position.</p>

<p>Hi, Antandrus. I was wondering . . .if you heard a song played on the radio, can you play the melody/harmony/etc. on the piano? How long does it take for you to do that? I just asked because I am curious to see how advanced piano players play popular tunes by ear.

<p>It's me again. In case you were wondering where I was.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should be glad that I have stopped vandalizing and you are willing to admit to it. If I were still vandalizing, I would have been vandalizing at Wikipedia for almost two years. Fortunately, for you, I am not.</p>
<p>Anyway, you said on your user page "my credentials are real and verifiable". If you want someone to sincerely believe you, you should give some verification. I don't see any verification, so I won't believe you for now. You have to make it clear to some admin that you real do have academic experience (and a doctor's degree), because you say you grew up in poverty in the California mountains, which makes me think you might be lying too,</p>
<p>And someone could try to create a scandal about you, maybe someone who knows you personally, and could reveal you and you would be in the same boat as Essjay. However, I am not SURE you are lying. But you have to have verification somehow, because now no one would believe anyone who says they have academic experience, even an admin, as longs as they are a Wikipedia editor. Shlikon 16:17, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will give verification to people I trust. Jimbo knows who I am. Why don't you ask him? I do not need you to believe me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"...grew up in poverty in the California mountains..." LOL. That's funny. Honestly, that gave me a pretty good laugh for early in the morning. Would you please point out where I said that?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And no I don't know who you are. I have an idea, but if I'm right your grammar has improved somewhat from before, which makes me think you might be taking your school studies more seriously than you used to. If that's true, congratulations, and continue to make progress. I was a troublesome kid too, and I'm fairly tolerant of kids who remind me of myself long ago.

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I wonder why Jimbo didn't just tell on Essjay. He probably knew Essjay's identity. I didn't think Jimbo likes lying in the community.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Anyway, I know that Wikipedia definitely has problems. I was looking into a website called Wikipedia Watch which might describe it. I heard that it has caused a lot of controversy (including owner Daniel Brandt to be blocked).</dd>

<dd>I actually have an idea in my head of a Wikipedia Watch parody. It's called Encyclopedia Dramatica Watch. Not like they need to be watched. Everyone knows theat they aren't accurate. 16:41, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for noticing my edits to the Years in music pages. I'm a student of early music too, and just discovered that little project. I don't have access to the online Grove, that I know of, but I do have a shelf of books that I've been going through. I've seen your years, and they're quite good. My approach seems a little more random. Instead of going year by year, I'm going item by item, and attaching it to the appropriate year. Some of the years might be kind of lean, but I figure they will fill up slowly. - <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffg_946b.html" title="User:Geoffg">Geoffg</a> 04:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there! It is very spring-like here in NH (even though I know it won't last), so I am not doing what I orter be doing but fooling with this stuff instead. I am trying to get my userboxes to be in three columns but the code utterly defeats me. Do you do much with this kind of thing? I tried a helpme but as you can see from the bottom of my discussion page I got not much. Should I just issue another helpme or what?
