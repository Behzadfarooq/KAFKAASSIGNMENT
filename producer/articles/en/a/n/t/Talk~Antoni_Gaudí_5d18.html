<p>Antoni Guadi never felt Spanish, he never spoke Spanish and he was one of the most important independentist in the catalan history. It is not fair to define Antoni Gaudi as a Spanish, considering that now Catalonia is a recognized nation, (See Catalan New Status of autonomy) legally, the Catalan nationality exists. Define him as a Spanish It's like define the Dalai Lama as a chinese.</p>

<p>Antoni (in Catalan) was his first name, now, how to rename the page? -- Perique, Barcelona. 2002/06/27</p>
<p>Is Antoni his Catalan first name, or what? The article's name Antonio, but that name isn't mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">jheijmans</a>, Wednesday, June 26, 2002</p>

<dd>Checking some other sources, it appears that he's already very well known as Antonio (at least in some other online encyclopedias) -- the count of occurrences seems to be about equal for both names.

<p>Are you sure about that 3 times higher thing? Can't seem to find it anywhere, though could be so.... in Gaudi's coppersmith imagination</p>
<p>Three times is incorrect. The central tower is supposed to be twice the height of the facade towers. The central tower is still proposed and four of the facade towers have been completed, one of which was finished by the time of his death. They are in fact, as he intended. ref.

<p>Opinions: Should a person's masterworks be wikipedia subpages? I think they should be standalone articles for simplicity in cross-referencing, esp. if important enough, e.g. Mona_lisa rather than Leonardo/Mona Lisa....</p>
<p>What is the general consensus then&#160;?<br />
The point against the solution would be that it is naturally connected to the given person.<br />

<dl>
<dd>I really don't mind the subpages, I just am thinking of a typical need to reference without having extra characters to type. Sort of the "World Book" approach, ya wanna know about Sagrada Familia? Ya pick up the S volume... I don't agree that subpages are "naturally connected" (v.s.) any more than a separate article with a link. And how do you handle collaborations?

<p><i>Although a big cat lover, he was less of a fan of smaller creatures, such as the wasp. This was shown when Gaudi used a large stick and lots of preservation to chase the wasps in Spain. They are yet to return. Gaudi was also a very generous man and did a lot of work for charity, most notably sacrificing his leg (right) to save the life of a small child, unfortunately the leg was too big.</i></p>

<p>I can't understand why the article says he was a "Catalan architect" and not a "Spanish architect". Are we politizicing the Wikipedia?. I'm Andalusian and I don't see that the articles of Lorca, Velazquez, Picasso, Machado, Cernuda, Murillo, Alberti or Aleixandre say "Andalusian artist". And I don't see why the article cannot say that Catalonia is not a country or that it belongs to Spain. It gives the impression that Catalonia is an independent nation when it is not. The name of Spain is only used to enlarge the figure of the architect as if to enlarge the figure of Velazquez we use the word "Europe".</p>
<p>I have a strong respect for Catalan nationalism but I don't think we have to support it in Wikipedia by using sentences such as "Catalan artist" without making explicit that all Catalans are Spanish as of today. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/u/e/User%7ERuedasox_7e78.html" title="User:Ruedasox">Ruedasox</a> (<a href="../../../r/u/e/User_talk%7ERuedasox_bac8.html" title="User talk:Ruedasox">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ruedasox_6ea6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ruedasox">contribs</a>) 21 August 2006.</small></p>

<dd>But there is no possible comparison between England or Scotland with Catalonia. They don´t share the same history. England and Scotland are countries inside another country and have also been countries for many centuries. Catalonia has never been a country. England and Scotland are different countries when they play soccer or rugby (not in the Olympic Games) but Catalonia has never played against another country in a official game.

<dl>
<dd>Gaudí was about as emphatic a Catalan nationalist as they come: he usually refused to speak Spanish. As far as I know, none of the individuala you mention (except maybe Lorca) had a comparable relation to their Andaluz identity, but I'd be ready to stand corrected. It probably would be appropriate to mention Lorca being Andaluz more prominently in his article than we do, because he is an emphatically Andaluz cultural figure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is true. Most of the individuals I mentioned are not Andalusian nationalists. Not even Lorca or Alberti were neither Spanish nor Andalusian nationalists. But many of them had a prominent Andaluz identity comparable to any Catalan nationalist. You don´t have to be a nationalist to have a regional identity. But the point I want to emphasize is that I don´t think we should say "a Catalan or an Andalusian painter" for example, no matter if the individual did not consider himself Spanish. I think that we should say the nationality the individual has or had and then, later in a different paragraph, state their political or nationalistic identity. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ruedasox 22 August 2006 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ruedasox_22_August_2006_7870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ruedasox 22 August 2006">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Antoni Guadi never felt spanish, he never spoke spanish and he was one of the most important independentist in the catalan history. Is not fair to define Antoni Gaudi as a Spanish, considering that now Catalonia is a recognited nation, (See Catalan Status of autonomy) legaly exist the Catalan nationality. Is like define the Dalai Lama as a chinese.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that he never felt Spanish. But when he lived his passport said he was Spanish and his nationality was Spanish. Catalonia is not a country. The Catalan Status of Autonomy says it is a nation but it says that in the preface so it doesn´t have full legality. As far as I know it does not exist a country that is recognised in the United Nations and that is called Catalonia. When a catalan travels abroad he-she shows a Spanish passport, not a Catalan passport. When a catalan athlete goes to the Olympics he participates under the Spanish flag. etcetera. I´m not an anti-Catalan nationalism. I´m a liberal and I think Catalans may have the right to be considered a country. But as of today Catalonia is a region, comunidad autonoma, in Spain. And this is an encyclopedia and it should be objective instead of a place where political ideas are showed through.</dd>

<p>I agree with Jmabel and the unsigned comment above. Catalan nationalism played an important part in Gaudí's life. But Catalonia was a part of Spain, Gaudí was a citizen of Spain, he carried a Spanish passport, he paid taxes to the Spanish authorities, etcetera. He was a Spaniard, and therefore should be referred to as such, alongside Catalonia.

<dd>I wouldn't use <i>Spaniard</i> (which is generally a designation of ethnicity, and a bit archaic). - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:00, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Weel, Catalonia is not a state. That's true, but is a Nation. And as I said in my previous comment, if you check the Dalai Lama article here in wikipedia, you can't read he is Chinese, because is not, even if Tibet is (legally) a part of China. Right? Using the same rule, Why don't you go there and change it, writting The Dalai Lama was a Chinese spirtual leader from a chinese region? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 83.71.107.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.71.107.247_626b.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.71.107.247">contribs</a>) 20 September 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Because the Dalai Lama's situation as an exile makes the situation a bit different. I'm not sure what his actual citizenship is; if you happen to know, it should probably be in the article. He certainly does not have a PRC passport. Perhaps he travels on papers from the (unrecognized) Tibetan government in exile? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:05, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This sounds like a political debate. It is true that Gaudi was Catalan. It is true that Gaudi was Spanish (I don't know his "feelings" like others on this forum apparently do). It is true that Gaudi was European. To refer to him as any of these would not be incorrect. My impression is that referring to him as Spanish offends some nationalists, however it doesn't make it incorrect. Furthermore, I agree that he had great pride in his culture (he was actually thrown in jail once for refusing to speak Castillian), however I am unaware of him not recognizing that his culture was one of many within Spain. In fact he had ties to two of the most powerful families in Spain, the Lopez, and the Guell (the latter being Catalan, of course). I believe he was also a monarchist, implying that he had respect for the Spanish state. The political debate should be taken elsewhere, and I believe that reference to him as either Catalan, Spanish, or both should no longer be debated. 130.221.105.69 17:48, 27 September 2006 (UTC) Alberto</dd>

<dd>On a similar note... I believe the following statement is too strong and/or not correct "Gaudí, among others, promoted the Catalan nationalist movement by incorporating elements of Catalan culture in his designs." There's no question he incorporated Catalan culture into his designs (the red and gold stripes atop the spire of Bellesguard, the many references to St. George, among many others), however I don't think he was a nationalist per se. The word nationalist to me implies something stronger than pride in your culture, it implies a political message. I have never found any evidence that he was anything other than proud of his heritage. I think the statement should be changed to something like "Gaudi incorporated elements of Catalan culture in his designs (examples)" then a statement could be made about how these designs might be an inspiration to nationalists. 130.221.105.69 18:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC) Alberto</dd>

<p>I am aware of Gaudi having had only one sibling, Francisco, d. 1876, yet the article implies he had 4 siblings. Anybody know for sure? 69.167.58.163 19:39, 29 October 2006 (UTC) Alberto</p>
