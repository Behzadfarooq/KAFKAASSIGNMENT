<dd>The neutrailty of feminism? Feminism is about women, period, and is biased in everything it writes, says, advocates and does. Normally this bias is expressed as simple misandry, although it is often hidden in postmodernistic rhetoric. Here are a few feminist slogans.</dd>

<p>Article needs some major meat IMHO.</p>
<p>I encourage editing some lines.</p>
<p>"Anti-feminist groups particularly point to the dramatic increase in the divorce rate and breakdown of the family since the rise of feminism, and note that crime statistics, teenage pregnancy, and drug abuse are all higher among children of fatherless homes [citation needed]. Their critics point out that correlation does not imply causation, that anti-feminist groups fail to consider social factors besides feminism, that social ills faced by children without fathers can also be the result of the father's decisions, and that feminism is not to blame for role models and gender roles that predate it.”</p>
<p>I'd argue that "critics point out..." should be changed to "critics argue...". There are strong statements of fact here that fail to account for potential responses of the antifeminists, particularly the claim about them FAILING to consider social factors. They may very well have taken them into account, but this article, as it is, will leave you in the dark.</p>
<p>"Antifeminists are fond of reports that conclude the Violence Against Women Act hurts men and does little to help women. (Let the Violence Against Women Act Expire Charlotte Allen)"</p>
<p>Again, while referring to the VAWA may be common among antifeminists, it is somewhat suspect to say that they are "fond of" such reports. After all, this research is believed to prove injustice, and while pointing out injustice may be a blast, this section could equally well be interpreted to say that antifeminists like to know that the VAWA supposedly hurts men.</p>
<p>So, it should read more like this; "Antifeminists often point to/have pointed to..." or so, if they indeed discuss that, in such depth. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomi_d253.html" title="User:Thomi">Thomi</a> 21:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This doesn't really have anything to do with whether you're a feminist or an anti-feminist. Feminists and anti-feminists alike may edit any article they please, as long as they conform with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy and other Wikipedia policies. As a feminist and someone who believes in the important of Wikipedia presenting a neutral point of view, I removed this text. You could have done the same yourself. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 19:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for removing the text. But if you don't see it as something a feminist would say about anti-feminism and not something which describes anti-feminism or the reasons behind it, there's not much I can say. Do feminists call women "whiners"? Not that I've ever seen. Feminists do spend an inordinate amount of time and effert calling any man with issues a whiner, I know this from direct experience. Feminism is clearly not about equal treatment, as feminism itself does not treat men and women equally.</dd>

<p>All of the "bullies" material was added by the same user, <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonympics_cbe0.html" title="User:Lonympics">Lonympics</a> (look at the history of the page to see who added what). So, you're right, both quotes make the same sense, i.e., none. As for who gets to write the articles, the answer is, everyone does. If you're suggesting that a feminist is unable to write a neutral article on anti-feminism, I'd have to disagree. Everyone has a POV, but it needn't show up in the article. —01:11, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>If you're suggesting that a feminist is unable to write a neutral article on anti-feminism, I'd have to disagree.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that there is an inherent bias that makes objectivity implausable, at best. Feminism has claimed the victim high ground (and made it pay), so even admitting that men are victims (usually of policies crafted with or by feminism) would be giving up the bias feminism has built against men in the name of political favoritism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are many examples, look at the Duluth model, or the Violence Against Women Act, penned by feminism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I get the time, I may start adding to the article, there's no shortage of material.</dd>

<dd>Feminism doesn't "pen acts". Feminism is a movement; people pen acts, not movements. And no, even if the Duluth model or VAWA are flawed, it doesn't follow that feminists are biased against men or that feminists can't be objective; those are absurd claims. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 20:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for feminist objectivity, perhaps you can show me some. Feminism has a built-in bias that cannot be eliminated. It's about women, and only women, it's sexist from the get-go and always will be. Feminism <b>is</b> sexism. This is not hyperbole, it's a simple fact.</dd>

<p>Contemporary anti-feminism is very different from the way it was back in the 50's. But since Adolf Hitler is listed as a anti-feminist, it pretty much destroys the credibility of contemporary antifeminism, because no distinction is made.</p>
<p>I'm a feminist in that I'm pro women's suffrage and all that good stuff, but I'm antifeminist in that it seems that instead of blanket equality, it's politically correct to be misandronous (prejudiced against men). I mean I'm here at UCLA and there are tons of anti-spousal/relationship abuse but it's all targeted towards men, how men can stop it. To be able to say that since the majority of relationship abuse cases are commited by men, this kind of advertisement can be done would be like saying that since the majority of people in prison are black, we can start printing literature on how to fix black people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 169.232.111.114 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_169.232.111.114_4a35.html" title="Special:Contributions/169.232.111.114">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I have removed comparisons of masculism to anti-feminism. They are two completely different things. masculists are concerned with men's issues, which might include criticism of feminist ideas, but all movements should accept criticism without labelling the critics in such a manner. I'm sure there are many anti-feminists who are also masculists, but that doesn't make them the same thing or even similar. There are many feminists who criticize masculism, or are even anti-masculists, but one does not necessarily follow from the other. The connection is spurious.</p>
<p>To an extent, I think the comparison is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> - an attempt to discredit masculism by associating it with anti-feminism. I think it would be better to see the positive aspects of masculism and criticize the negatives, rather than making such a blanket umbrella statement. 24.68.180.163 04:29, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article seems to serve no purpose other than to list cavils against feminism. strictly speaking, unless one takes on antifeminism as a campaign (some do), it is best seen as reactive (or file under misogyny!) i should think such an article should simply be a subsection under an article entitled Feminism, which there is no effort to define here. And I agree that it is of very poor qualty. Question: what about Camille Paglia or Christina Hoff Sommers qualifies them to be classed as feminists, apart from their own self-labeling? Much of simple antifeminism--especially from a religious basis, but not only--claims to be profeminist or prowoman, but from a presumption of essential inequality. The label feminist for the two women mentioned seems merely opportunistic, but since the article makes no effort to provide first principles, how could we judge?</p>

<p>The label 'neoconservative' is applied to some of the critics of feminism on the article, such as Hoff-Sommers and Fox-Genovese. Is this label appropriate to describe them? Christina HS is a member at the Independent Women's Forum, which is a conservative and explicitely anti-feminist think tank, but Genovese is a member at the Women's Freedom Network, which is a libertarian-leaning "moderate feminist" group. If Genovese doesn't define herself as antifeminist or neoconservative, this latter label should be dropped in her case. I believe we shouldn't call one a 'neoconservative' because he/she opposes left-wing feminism until we get to know his/her other political views (sorry for the bad English).201.50.170.20 10:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the ugliest tactics that ideological feminists use to silence their enemies is character assassination, libelous labeling and personal attacks. This entire article is one such attempt. There is no distinction between people who are critical of SOME (shameless) feminist ideologies versus those who are critical of ALL feminism. We need to make a distinction between ideas (which can and should be questioned) and the people who do the questioning here. In addition the term 'anti-feminist' in one I have never seen in print so I wonder who coined it and who is propagating it.</p>
<p>Another red flag for me is the very definition 'anti-feminist' which is far from clear here. Who (the inane ideological wing of the Sisterhood I imagine) decides who is an Anti-feminist here. Who are the sources for these perjorative characterizations and definitions or do wiki editors decide who is or isn't 'Anti-feminist' here. Shameless personal labeling shows how afraid ideological feminists are of having their ideas tested. Such mean-spirited attempts to silence potential opponents is typical of Stalinist states, not democratic encyclopedias.</p>
<p>Many women who call themselves feminists have leveled devastating criticisms of ideological feminism while being supporters of feminism in general. I notice that these women (Hoff-Summers, Paglia and Fillion etc) are being purged from the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> page despite well-reasoned arguments against the worst of radical feminisms excesses. Are these women also 'anti-feminists'? Does some feminist goddess in the sky decide who is good and who is bad or are there some reasonable criteria here?</p>
<p>For those who think I am imagining things here, please glance at the content I pulled in from <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Studies_9bd9.html" title="Women's Studies">Women's Studies</a></p>
<p>Karen Lerhman criticizes the state of women's studies as summarized below. She quotes Patai and Koertge who say that the feminism espoused in the vast majority of women's studies departments "bids to be a totalizing scheme resting on a grand theory, one that is as all-inclusive as Marxism, as assured of it's ability to unmask hidden meanings as Freudian psychology, and as fervent in its condemnation of apostates as evangelical fundamentalism..." Lerhman goes on to say that feminist writers "by squelching all internal dissent" have "allowed hyperbolic rhetoric, false statistics, politicized scholarship, reverse sexism, and general silliness free reign".</p>

<li>Orthodoxy and ideological policing</li>
<li>Ostracization and/or termination of female dissidents</li>

<dd>Hi. Discussion of the article within the article is unencyclopedic. Use the talk page, or just make the changes you want yourself.</dd>

<dd>I added content not discussion which was more 'enclyclopedic' than the unsourced weasel worded opinions already there. However I will also be glad to discuss this here. I can also see why you wouldn't want a discussion on the article itself.</dd>

</dl>

<dd>Also, if you feel that the article has a pro-feminist POV, that is indeed a problem that needs correcting. However, the solution is not to inject your own <i>anti</i>-feminist POV - that simply compounds the problem. Please do your best to use neutral, encyclopedic language. Thanks!</dd>

<dd>My issue is not that this article is pro-feminist. To be pro-feminist is fine. What I hate are weasel worded whines that label people (anti-feminist) perjoratively with no credible criteria. I like many feminist ideas. However, I hate cunning Stalinist stunts to silence opposing views as shown by many feminist writers about other feminists (I refer you to Hoff-Summers, Fillion, Paglia, Lerhman and many other reasonable women who call themselves feminists). This article implies that ALL people who criticize feminist ideas are 'anti-feminist' by definition. This is perjorative, mean-spirited and just silly.</dd>

<dd>I'm removing the NPOV tag from the article because <b>it is essentially unchanged since the last time a NPOV tag was removed</b>. I am willing to discuss the article though. I notice you use the words "<i>despite well-reasoned arguments against the worst of radical feminisms excesses</i>" above. Wikipedia is not a place for well reasoned arguments, it is a place for externally referenced factual descriptions. If we know of a POV, we are asked to include it, without commenting on whether we personally believe it to be persuasive or not. NPOV does not mean that points of view are not included, it means that if a POV is included it is written in a neutral tone. If you feel a particular aspect or attribute of anti-feminism is missing from the article, include it, citing references. If you feel something in the article is not factually correct, put a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> marker on it and delete the material if no-one cites a reference within a reasonable time. Finally, the comments in your criticism apply to feminism rather than anti-feminism. The tactics of feminists are not really that relevant to anti-feminists, who oppose feminism rather than feminists. This distinction is often missed. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 23:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added the POV tag back because this whole article is full of weasel worded, unsourced POV to silence opponents of some forms of femimism who have other POV's be they feminists or self-proclaimed anti-feminists. There is no clear definition of 'anti-feminism' at all here.I agree about your need for externally referenced factual descriptions and sources. However all encyclopedias by their very nature include (hopefully sound) reasoning in their explanations. I see a lot of ridiculous rhetoric in this article that is far from clear from whatever POV. My criticisms refer to TACTICS that some feminists use to silence dissent be it here or anywhere in related articles. To call all people who criticize certain aspects of feminism 'anti-feminist' is an ugly form of personal assassination. I want to be sure this article is somewhat clean with these distinctions.

<dd>I am no vandal. I hope you will be openminded enough to note that this article has very very few direct references to anti-feminism in the literature. (I found very few recent references on a quick search of Amazon as well so I suspect a lot of this content is original research and I can well see all the other unsourced weasel-worded claims) My intent here was to demand some semblance of sourced NPOV. But I hear your point. I will go back through and better 'target' the 'shotgun pellets' as you call them. However I take issue with your characterization of 'wholesale changes'. I added one short paragraph, rearranged the order of one section and deleted the Noeconservative label. Other than that I left the original content intact. The only new statements I added are sourced from content that is clearly shown in the article. Now if you want me to find statements from Hoff-Sommers or others alluding to personal attacks from their feminist 'sisters' I will be glad to. However clearly there is baseless 'anti-feminist' name-calling going on here that does not belong (uncalled) in a NPOV encyclopedia. Therefore, before do begin wholesale reversions I ask that you at least discuss specifics first to prevent edit wars. I will listen carefully to your concerns as long as you listen carefully to mine.(anonymous)</dd>

<dd>The content about Hoff-Sommers was here long before I added this quite obvious content. If you want me to go get her books and show you what she says about these personal attacks I will be glad to. However the logic is obvious here (name-calling is name calling.) This whole article is full of original research. I added just three statements using sources in the article. However I agree totally with your statement about more information and less opinion which is what I did this POV check for in the first place. I see no rigorous research sources on anti-feminism here so if any editor has some please so note. NPOV begins with clear definitions and clear principles which can be understood by all.

<dd>I pulled this down from above. I suspect some feminists would rather attack people than their ideas. To build an article that calls anyone who disgrees with ANY aspect of feminist orthodoxy an 'anti-feminist' is a fine way to silence opponents and distract potential followers from examining the ideology itself. To me, one can argue with an someone else without resorting to the dirty tricks that politicians so often use to smear their opponents.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, we need to focus on truly 'antifeminist' ideology here (like 'women are less than equal human beings' or whatever) rather than black-balling well-meaning feminist (or masculinist) dissenters who are critics of orthodox feminist idealogies. One should be able to test feminist idealogies and methods without automatically being branded an 'anti-feminist'. There is a huge difference between dissenting and and being 'antifeminist'. I believe we need to be very careful to make this distinction here. Genuine criticisms of feminist ideology belong in the feminism page not here.</dd>
<dd>In addition the silly idea pushed by many feminist idealogues that there is JUST ONE form of feminism (gender-ginning, victim saint, woman as superior to man) is clearly false. There is no single feminist theory. There is no single 'like, like, like' form of feminism. In fact probably the majority of American women subscribe to much more moderate ideas like equity, accountability and human rights (minus reverse sexism). To use totalistic tactics that perjoratively represent all feminists as ONE is to dis-count, demean and silence the many other diverse ideas that make up feminism. (anonymous)</dd>

<p>I think DMoss's recent change to the first paragraph is problematic. Many feminists proudly claim far more sweeping goals for the movement than simple legal parity - feminism has important cultural elements as well. And the article presently has "equity feminists" being called antifeminists in certain quarters.</p>
<p>I can't access the link DMoss sourced his change to as it's a "members only" site. But I'm concerned that a "Women's Studies Encyclopedia" would likely have its own version of feminism to set forth in preference to others. Wikipedia should not do this.</p>

<dd>Okay. So, we now have the odd situation that antifeminism is defined as opposition to equality under the law in the first paragraph - yet in the body of the article, feminists who confine their aims to equality under the law (equity feminists) are described as anti-feminist! This makes no sense.</dd>

<dd>I'm sure that Helen Tierney is a good, scholarly source. I'm just not sure that she's a good concept-defining source. Feminism exists on a very broad spectrum. A single feminist's definition is likely to represent only a point along that spectrum. And indeed basic knowledge of the subject tells us that Tierney's definition is much narrower than the one used by many feminists - and by their opponents. - <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD"><font color="darkpurple">Dan</font><font color="black"><b>B</b></font>†<font color="blue">Dan</font><font color="darkblue"><b>D</b></font></a> 19:57, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its not surprising that more radical feminists would regard less radical feminists as <i>antifeminist</i>. Our task here is not to sort out feminism, but to accurately and completely describe antifeminism. The editor of a scholarly encyclopedia is likely to be the <b>best</b> concept defining source available. Had Tierney written a mere book on gender politics you may have been able to criticise her position, but a 3 volume encyclopedia with two editions that is highly regarded by academia is a major achievement.</dd>

<dd>Well, at the moment, by accepting Helen Tierney's definition, this article (in its first paragraph) takes the point of view that opposition to feminism is not antifeminism when what is opposed is a form of feminism whose aims extend beyond equality under the law.</dd>

<p>I have cut the list of "types of feminists," which made the vague claim to be "from linked sources" without saying which sources it was from or including links. Assuming that the individual characterizations really can be sourced, it is still OR to collect them into a roster of "types." I reproduce the list below in case the editor wants to rework it into a better-sourced, less POV form:</p>
<p><i>Types of antifeminists (from linked sources)</i> <i>*Men who see feminism as a "fraud".</i> <i>*Successful women who hold the perception they are unacknowledged by certain feminists due to differing ideology.</i> <i>*Non-feminist women who consider feminist ideology anti-male or misandric.</i> <i>*Women who feel feminism fails to represent them as women or who see feminism as a "social disaster" for women.</i> <i>*People such as Christina Hoff-Sommers who call themselves 'equity' feminists.</i> <i>*People (feminists and non-feminists alike) who disagree with what they consider radical feminist gender ideology.</i> <i>*Fathers who believe that feminists, or feminism, is responsible for what they consider unfair treatment regarding their children.</i> <i>*Traditionalists and religionists who take a conservative view of male-female sex-roles.</i></p>
<p><br />
This content was sourced from links in this article that others added before me. NOTE THERE ARE ALMOST NO SOUND ACADEMIC REFERENCES ON THIS PERJORATIVE POLICITICALLY LOADED TERM SO 'TYPES' BEGIN TO CLARIFY WHO IS CALLING WHO ANTI-FEMINIST FOR WHAT REASONS HERE. I summarized these types simply to show the basis for calling someone 'anti-feminist' and to highlight the absurdities of the definition...eg an anti-feminist feminist is a contradiction in terms as an anti-Republican Republican would be. Imagine baby Bush calling John McCain an anti-Republican because he opposes the adminstration's torture policies. That is how absurd and baseless some feminist name-calling is. We need to clean up this article's definition. I will cite these sources and reinsert types because there was no POV here other than those stated in the linked sources so that other editors have a basis upon which to define anti-feminism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, I don't think links to sources will completely solve the problem. I think the list itself is OR/POV - collecting various independent descriptions into a classification system original to you. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD"><font color="darkpurple">Dan</font><font color="black"><b>B</b></font>†<font color="blue">Dan</font><font color="darkblue"><b>D</b></font></a> 20:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look this whole article is based on a double-speak definition and full of unsourced weasel worded characterizations. I simply tried to make distinctions between the various types of so-called 'anti-feminists' already sourced in the links. I figured that would shed some light on who is being accused of being 'antifeminist' and for what reasons. We have to have some clear idea what anti-feminism means otherwise we just have an article here that is a cunning, covert and vicious propaganda piece for those who hate credible criticisms of modern feminism (as opposed to showing those GENUINE anti-feminists who hate all forms of female equality). If there are no sound sourced criteria to call someone 'antifeminist' I for one will get my broom out and clean up this article. If you have a better idea than this list to make clear who is who here then please discuss it but please don't just cut content you don't like for POV reasons. (drop in editor)</dd>

<p>I just reverted a large number of edits. The purpose of these edits appeared to be to remove information rather than to add to or improve the article. No indication was given that the information removed was incorrect, nor were sources cited to indicate the information was incorrect. It is not a good idea to remove the work of others without replacing it with better work, or providing reasons why the material removed is factually incorrect. Piecemeal deletions like this add up to <i>article blanking</i> over time. This is a form of vandalism that is difficultr to detect in its early stages, and can be difficult to deal with if the deletions are mixed up with bona-fide contributions. I am sure DanB made the deletions in good faith, but the end result of the individual deletions was little different to the kind of vandalism where someone block deletes information that does not fit their own <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">point of view</a>.

<p>I think I see part of the reason for the trouble. Although Tierney's encyclopedia was revised in 1999, the entry "antifeminist movements" is based on no source more recent than 1986 -- and its subjects are confined to a paragraph on American anti-suffrage and an extensive discussion of the campaign against America's ERA amendment in the seventies. Although historically interesting, this has very little to do with antifeminism today, which is almost entirely cultural, not legal.</p>
<p>The article also refers <i>only</i> to the United States -- US suffrage and the US equal rights amendment.</p>
<p>I really don't see it as a useful source for a broad consideration of antifeminism as an idea, although it would be an excellent basis for specific information on the defeat of ERA.</p>

<dd>I would be happy for you to source a more up to date definition that is peer reviewed to the extent of the definition in Tierney. 20 years is not particularly long in the evolution of a word that has its roots in the turn of last century. Any marked difference in definition in a decade or two is likely to be transitory and more a reflection of contemporary politics than a genuine change. The concentration on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservative.html" title="Neoconservative">neoconservative</a> views in the article is an example, in another 20 years people may wonder what a neoconservative view is, but antifeminism is likely to be alive and well. It is also difficult to seperate historical antifeminism from US politics as this is where the movement developed. Our challenge is to seek out and document antifeminism in other countries, not to complain about the work others have already done in the article. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 00:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dave no offense but I believe we must first define the term clearly with clear distinctions between those who hate all forms of female equality versus those who hate some feminist ideologies.

<p>I pulled in the following dictionary definitions of antifeminism. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antifeminism" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antifeminism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It is one thing to use the correct definition but quite another to use 'antifeminist' perjoratively so 'good' feminists can perjoratively label so-called 'bad' feminist dissenters. I am going to clean up the definition section and make these distinctions here.</p>
<p>To use post-modern feminist definitions for antifeminism is POV. Many diverse authors (both femininist, masculinist and other) have noted the fraudulent and totalitarian nature of MODERN feminist scholarship. Therefore I insist that we use commonly available dictionaries to define these terms to eliminate POV and to make proper distinctions between fair characterizations and totalitarian doublespeak. Someone who hates female equality is indeed antifeminist. However someone who hates fraud or bombast in establishment feminism is far from 'antifeminist'. We need to show these distinctions here...otherwise this article will become just another propaganda piece for those feminists who feminist Phyllis Chessler (<i>The Death of Feminism: What's Next in the Struggle for Women's Freedom</i>, Phyllis Chesler, 2006, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-4039-6898-5</a>) bravely calls "cowardly herd animals and grim totalitarian thinkers". (drop in editor)</p>
<p>There seems to be a strong POV concern about the definition of anti-feminism. I am concerned about a double-speak definition that for example calls dissident feminists 'antifeminist' just because they are critical of certain aspects of modern ideological feminism. This tactic is commonly found in totalitarian tyrannies planetwide. Therefore, I will not stand for this article being used as a propaganda piece for ideological feminists to attack credible opponents of their ideologies using personal slander. I welcome legitimate discussions about the definition and POV in this article. Please be specific, constructive and goal oriented so we can prevent needless edit wars. I have been bold as per wiki policy in cleaning up the definition. However, I am willing to listen to <i>reasonable</i> concerns about POV here and to consense on NPOV. (drop in editor)</p>

<dd>The definition is limited for good reason...a distinct and limited definition is what prevents radical gender feminist 'politicians' from using this article as a covert, cunning and vicious propaganda piece by expanding the definition (ad infinitum) to falsely include anyone seen as politically incorrect. One can oppose the modern (gender) feminist movement AND support women and womens liberation as so many feminist whistleblowers have shown us without being 'antifeminist'. (I refer you to Wendy McElroys Sexual Correctness: The Gender Feminist Attack on Women for a better take on this than I offered here.)

The intro needs to be a short sharp definition only as it is often captured by on-line serch engines or used in abbreviated versions of Wikipedia. I'd also point out that an academic Womens Studies Encyclopedia is no more or less biased than a dictionary. Given that it is a specialist encyclopedia it is more likely to give a reliable definition than a more general work. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 09:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC) s</p>

<dd>I cannot concur with this suggestion. Many other articles have had hard fought battles over definition because the definition defines the scope of the entire article, creates distinctions between what is and what is not part of the article, and brings clarity to the entire article. Radical feminists have been accused of absurdly expanding definitions and using double-speak definitions for POV political purposes (such as calling all forms of heterosexual sexual intercourse 'rape' without distinction). This article is one such attempt where anyone who is seen as politically incorrect by a particular group of feminists can be defined that way perjoratively and without accepted basis. Wikipedia is not a front to be used by any group to attack their legitimate opponents. That is why I brought in general dictionaries definitions of these terms. As for a women's studies dictionary definition of the term please spare me...that is about as unreliable and POV as one can get. I refer you to the sources on <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">Women's studies</a> for a whole host of credible criticisms of biased scholarship within most women's studies programs. I insist on using genuine and commonly accepted and credible dictionaries to define 'antifeminism' rather than a brand new discipline that has been accused (by many feminists and others) of being a (fraudulent) front for ideological feminism. If you have better commonly accepted dictionary definitions please bring them in. Otherwise, please do not use a particular groups definition(s) to push their POV or to assist a particular group to slander it's enemies. (drop in editor)</dd>

<dd>NO it is mere REASONING that all articles use to explain things. If someone calls herself a 'feminist' and someone else calls that very same person an 'antifeminist', we have a contradiction in terms. This would be like Bush calling McCain an "anti-republican' just because McCain fights for some of the original ideals of his party against Bush's double-speak about say <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>. This is exactly why we cannot use radical feminist definitions of so-called 'anti-feminism'. Radical feminists rarely play fair with language. To see politically correct progressives stoop to the same ugly tactics right-wing 'born agains' president's use is dissapointing and disgusting to me.(drop in editor)</dd>

<p>Can anyone find the clip of him answering questions from the audience following a speech in 2000 after he joined the Reform Party? What the media did not report on, was that he either retracted or modified the controversial statement about Western capitalism and said his sister was upset with him for this statement. He does not retract his antifeminism or his view that women should generally accept traditional roles, but he admitted the statement was excessive. Someone asked him a question about a statement he made regarding the Holocaust as well as a question about that statement. Buchanan said he can only answer one question from each audience member, and told the man to choose one.

Listed below is how covert, cunning and perjorative radical feminists 'play' with the definition of feminism and antifeminism to attack credible critics. I insist on reasonable, commonly accepted definitions here so this article becomes no wiki-weapon for radical feminist ideologues to use to mind-murder their critics. I insist on distinctions between genuine antifeminists and false antifeminists along with some sort of explanation of this ugly totalitarian tactic of labeling credible critics 'antifeminist'. Otherwise, I insist that we limit this article to a study of genuine antifeminism and genuine anti-feminists.</p>
<p>1)Take perfectly reasonable and commonly defined definitions of feminism <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/feminism" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/feminism" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and antifeminism <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antifeminism" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antifeminism" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>2)Expand the definitions of <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> to absurd extremes so all false, fraudulent, untested or mean-spirited misandric 'feminisms' are included as equal forms of feminism. Then expand the definition of antifeminism to mirror so-called modern definitions of feminism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antifeminism&amp;oldid=90074104" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antifeminism&amp;oldid=90074104" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Make no distinctions between feminism as science, as politics or as philosophy. Make no distinctions between forms of feminism in logical opposition to each other (eg gender-ginning versus equality forms of feminism). Do all this within an incestuous context of 'gender' studies with gynocentric reverse-sexist 'peer' review. Call these parochial, irresponsible, and totalistic definitions the new 'official' definitions of feminism and antifeminism.</p>
<p>3)Use these new 'official' definitions to attack credible critics (be they feminist, non-feminist or other) of all 'official' forms of so-called 'feminism' without regard to reason and without resorting to civil dialogue. Resists all calls for responsible definitions so that critics of modern feminisms can be attacked PERSONALLY rather than PROFESSIONALLY. Use 'antifeminism' as label to silence, slander, and stonewall all those who fail to toe the 'Party Line' so that the so-called establishment feminist Sisterhood can appear intact within it's cocoon of inane ideological cant <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/03/29/girls/print.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/03/29/girls/print.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to wait a week or two for other responses here. I will address NeoSpora's issues above and cite the content. Then unless other editors have constructive reasons why I should pull this content I am going to reinsert it in shortened form. I welcome suggestions about style and placement. I placed this content-at-issue at the top of the article because it speaks directly to the definition and prevents perjorative use of the term 'antifeminist' in the entire article.

<dd>Well, the problem is very basic.

<dd>Misogyny (/mɪ.ˈsɑ.ʤə.ni/) is hatred or strong prejudice against women. The word comes from the Greek words μίσος (misos, "hatred") + γυνη (gunê, "woman"). Compared with anti-woman sexism or misandry (hatred or fear of, or strong prejudice against men), misogyny is viewed in feminist theory as a political ideology [citation needed] - similar to racism or anti-Semitism - that justifies and maintains the subordination of women by men. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.111.95.210 (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.111.95.210.html" title="User talk:128.111.95.210">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.111.95.210_33c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.111.95.210">contribs</a>) 05:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Please note the usual radical feminist definition 'creep' in misogyny where some uncited reference to some unstated theory is being used to expand the common dictionary definition for unstated reasons. This is a cunning, covert and all-to-common tactic to rape language for radical feminist political purposes as has been done with the common gynocentric usage of the term 'gender'. Misandry researchers Nathonson and Young note that this is a favorite (and totalitarian) tactic ideological feminists use to take power without having to be accountable.

<dd>You are correct in wanting to keep the article limited to describing anti-feminism—my point is that the purpose of the article is not to "show" anything. You are in danger of appearing highly non-NPOV if you imply, as above, that "we" need to show something about academic freedom on Wikipedia in this article. Further, your continual assertion that the term "anti-feminism" is pejorative and slanderous is terribly POV.
<dl>
<dd>I agree the purpose of the article is not to "show" anything. A good NPOV article uses NPOV sources to create some sort of credible content. When I began to edit here, this article was nothing short of incredible with covert, cunning and radical feminist POV throughout. You cannot have it both ways here. Either we use credible sources and stick to commonly accepted definitions or we build an article full of narrow partisan propaganda pandering to particular radical feminist POV that is politically correct now. I brought that "academic freedom" discussion into this discussion page merely for <i>discussion</i> so that you and other editors would see what people who hope to stifle dissent have done elsewhere in the hope that we ALL do better here as we build this article. As for my assertion that the term "antifeminism" is 'pejorative' and 'slanderous' when used <i>falsely</i> to attack other feminists (who do indeed believe strongly in female equality) that is FACT. At least a dozen prominent, independent, FEMINIST authors have made similar claims about the totalitarian tactics that some radical feminists use against whistleblowers, dissidents, womens studies students and others. Therefore, I am being far from POV here to have concerns about the possibility of the same tactics being used here by editors 'friendly' to the views of radical female-superiority feminism...I am merely being realistic. I raise these concerns so that 'good faith' editors know what I (and what we all) are up against as we try to build a NPOV article within a highly loaded and quite covert, cunning and care-less context.

If you have genuinely NPOV dictionaries with other definitions I am always willing to reconsider but please spare us so called 'NPOV' definitions from highly politicized disciplines like <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">Women's studies</a> which have huge conflicts of interest (vis a vis antifeminism) and a bad academic reputation to boot. My intent here is to clean this article up so it cannot be used as a dumping pit for any valid criticism of female-superiority feminism or used as an article within which to take cunning, covert, and politically motivated cheap shots as credible critics of modern so-called 'feminisms' that have strayed far from a focus on female-male equality and have become platforms for rampant female superiority rants and mean-spirited <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandry</a>.</dd>

<p>Using the common dictionary definition of antifeminism, <b>unless</b> he or she disbelieves female equality or is a male chauvinist:</p>
<ul>
<li>no non-feminist is an antifeminist</li>
<li>no feminist whistleblower, dissident or other feminist critic is an antifeminist-for instance individualist feminist Wendy McElroy is no antifeminist just because she 'deconstructs' radical feminist rape pretensions as in <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/mcelroy/mcelroy9.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/mcelroy/mcelroy9.html" rel="nofollow">The Politics of Rape</a></li>
<li>no conservative is an antifeminist</li>
<li>no researcher of feminist falsehoods, fraud or other politically correct feminist flim-flams is an antifeminist</li>
<li>no <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandry</a> researcher is antifeminist</li>
<li>no researcher of feminist scholarship (see <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">Women's studies</a>) is an antifeminist-Micheal Ghiglerie is no antifeminist just because he utterly destroys gender-feminist 'theories' about the causes of sexual assault using scientific methods in <i>The Dark Side Of Man</i>.</li>
<li>no <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masculinist.html" title="Masculinist">masculinist</a> is an antifeminist</li>
<li>no editor here (such as me for example!) who insists on distinct distinctions to prevent double-speak slandering definitions is an antifeminist.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <b>genuine</b> antifeminist might be (we need NPOV sources here!):</p>
<ul>
<li>a fundamentalist Muslim adherent (male or female) (as shown in Chesslers <i>The Death of Feminism</i> 2006)</li>
<li>a fundamentalist Hindu as shown in the feature film <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_%282005_film%29.html" title="Water (2005 film)">Water (2005 film)</a></li>
<li>a fundamentalist Christian who believes male superiority/female inferiority is ordained by his or her god.</li>
<li>a person who believes women have no right to equality as human beings.</li>
<li>philosophers such as Neitche (sp)</li>
<li>secular male chauvinists.</li>
<li>others to numerous to name.</li>
</ul>

I believe this article needs to show genuine antifeminists rather than straw-men or straw-women that some superiority-feminists use to slander their enemies. Chessler makes this point well in <i>The Death of Feminism (Chapter 2: Women and the Crisis of Independent Thinking)</i> and she has many 'sisters' and 'brothers' who have made similar assertions about ideological feminisms.

<p>Below is how feminist Phyllis Chessler describes the Orwellian left-wing manipulation of language for political purposes in <i>The Death of Feminism</i> (2006). When we use false 'antifeminist' labels in this article (as shown above) to unfairly slander people or their ideas we are indulging in left-wing totalitarian hate speech. To stoop to the ugly level of politicians who use personal attacks to duck the issues demeans wikipedia. Therefore, I insist that we eschew politically motivated double speak definitions of the term and use common NPOV dictionary definitions instead. I also insist that we show the difference between obvious POV lies and NPOV truths here. (drop in editor) 71.102.254.114 18:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"In my opinion, American campuses have indeed bred a new and diabolical McCarthyism. Academics now presume that they have the right to teach brazen lies and engage in hate speech, which they expect to be protected in the name of "free speech" or academic freedom. Worse, when academics try to teach a non or anti-left wing view of any subject, they will be accused (by the new McCarthyites) of leading a McCarthyit witch-hunt against the left wing totalitarian suppression of free speech".</p>
<p><b>"As I continually intone: Orwell himself would weep at such extreme linguistic distortions."</b> (emphasis this editor's)</p>
<p>"Free speech and academic freedom are very important. However, professors are also supposed to teach the difference between a truth and a lie. The earth is round, not flat; Darwin was right about evolution; communism failed; women are oppressed, and men are too. Many professors have abdicated this responsibility. Professors must be allowed to hold their own political or intellectual point of view; however they should also teach students that more than one point of view exists. Professors should also allow students to make up their own minds without being publicly shamed or academically punished."</p>

<p>I pulled the following section from the article because very few of these authors appear to deal with <i>genuine</i> antifeminism as far as the common definition is concerned (please see discussions above) To use this article to hide and slander all credible critics of feminist falsehood, fraud, or ideology is disengenous. This article is for genuine antifeminists not for feminist whistleblowers, feminist dissents, non-feminists and other non-antifeminists. If there are genuine antifeminist sources (please see dictionary definition) in this list please pull them back into the Further reading section as genuine sources. Otherwise please refrain from using false sources for antifeminism content. (drop in editor) 128.111.95.110 05:23, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I pulled in Amazon for some NPOV sources.

If highly partisan feminists define modern <i>antifeminism</i> using their own definitions we might mention them and their definitions here but to imagine that they (people with huge conflicts of interest and blatant biases) get to decide on the common dictionary definition is absurd.

<p>Content at issue:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who defines anti-feminism today</dd>
<dd>Historically, the label 'antifeminist' was a term applied to people opposed to classical feminism...that is people opposed to female equality in general which at that time meant the same thing as being opposed to 'feminism'. However, more recently, feminism has morphed into many forms of often conflicting 'feminisms' up to and including female-superiority 'feminisms'. Therefore, the clear logical connection between opposing female equality and opposing today's forms of feminism is no longer true. Today, one can be critical of feminism, believe strongly in female (and male) equality and yet be falsely labeled an 'antifeminist' because others consciously and/or unconsciously refuse to make distinctions between female equality and other feminist ideologies which have nothing directly to do with female equality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some people such as religious fundamentalists believe in female inferiority and male superiority as foundations for their faith. These people rarely define themselves as 'antifeminist' because, <i>for them</i>, feminism has no meaning. Others, both feminist and non-feminist alike, label them as 'antifeminist' because they clearly match the definition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, proud antifeminists who understand but disagree with female equality often label <i>themselves</i> as 'anti-feminists'. These people are also usually labeled 'antifeminist' by others as well because they so clearly fit the definition of the term. In this case, the persons self-identification coincides with others definition of him or her as 'antifeminist'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, in odd but not unusual cases, people call themselves 'feminists' only to be labeled 'anti-feminist' by other feminists. For instance, feminist whistleblower <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christina_Hoff_Sommers_a68c.html" title="Christina Hoff Sommers">Christina Hoff Sommers</a> rejects the term "antifeminist", calls herself a feminist and believes strongly in female equality but has been called an 'antifeminist' by many of her so-called 'sisters' within mainstream feminist circles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Non-feminists, scientific researchers, and others, <i>who support female equality</i>, are often labeled 'antifeminist' by today's feminists when their views are at odds with one or more aspect of status quo feminism regardless of the content of their claims. Some radical feminists have even gone so far as to claim any criticism of any aspect of feminism is by (their) definition 'antifeminist'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In extreme cases, any form of challenge to totalistic feminist ideology is called "intellectual harrassment" and the label 'antifeminist' is used to target people who would otherwise be seen as merely exercising their right to free speech. In less extreme cases, anyone (female or male) whose religion, politics, or personal values differ from radical feminist proscriptions is labeled 'antifeminist' by definition. People associated with anyone labeled 'antifeminist' can also be labeled 'antifeminist' by radical feminist partisans regardless of their viewpoints about female equality.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“Historically, the label 'antifeminist' was a term applied to people opposed to classical feminism...that is people opposed to female equality in general which at that time meant the same thing as being opposed to 'feminism'.“</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is completely unsourced.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"However, more recently, feminism has morphed into many forms of often conflicting 'feminisms' up to and including female-superiority 'feminisms'."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Where is the source? When exactly is “recently”? Based on what?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Therefore, the clear logical connection between opposing female equality and opposing today's forms of feminism is no longer true."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>POV, unsourced, and nonspecific. First of all what are “today’s forms of feminism”? Who decides? How are they different from yesterday’s or yesteryear’s or whatever if the opposite?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Today, one can be critical"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As opposed to yesterday when “one” would have no valid points? You need to establish that.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“of today's feminisms, believe strongly in female (and male) equality and yet be falsely labeled an 'antifeminist' because others often fail to make distinctions between female equality and other feminist ideologies which have nothing directly to do with female equality.”</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Where is the source and who are these people?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“Some people such as religious fundamentalists believe in female inferiority and male superiority as foundations for their faith.

In this case, the persons self-identification coincides with others definition of him or her as 'antifeminist'. Usually these people share a belief in female inferiority and male superiority which fits the definition of the term.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not only is this sloppy, unsubstantiated, and nearly nonsensical, but who decided that just because somebody calls themselves an antifeminist means they actually are?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“However, in odd but not unusual cases, people call themselves 'feminists' only to be labeled 'anti-feminist' by other feminists.

</dl>
<p>This is redundant and POV. Firstly, again, the view of Hoff Sommers as a “whistleblower” is completely subjective; if you have something significant where she is referred to as one then use it. Second, what is “mainstream feminism”? Do you have a source? Who decided? This looks weasel’y and POV because you have to work your logic backwards to conclude therefore anything that says Hoff Sommers is antifeminist = “mainstream feminism”. If you’re arguing it is POV and false to claim Hoff Sommers is antifeminist “because other feminists disagree with her”, you cannot turn around and call unnamed feminists who refer to her as “antifeminist” the “mainstream feminism” simply because you disagree with them.</p>

<dd><i>“Non-feminists, scientific researchers, and others,</i> who support female equality<i>, are often labeled 'antifeminist' by today's feminists when their views are at odds</i> with one or more aspect of status quo feminism regardless of the content of their claims.”</dd>

<p>“Cat-fight”? Nice. It is a genuine disagreement and lack of meeting of the minds when it comes to motivation and beliefs. It is sourced (or linked) and to-the-point about differing view-points, or at least explanations, on the “different kind of feminist” VS “anti-feminist” definition (however small, or at times non-existent, it may be) and therefore relevant to the topic.</p>

<p>One the ugliest totalitarian tactics that gender-ginning "patriarchal oppression" feminists use against politically incorrect feminists, non-feminists, and others critical of establishment feminist flim-flams is to expand definitions to absurd extremes so they (the politically-correct victim-saints) can slander people who show how hyprocritical they are. Politically incorrect Conservatives who believe in female equality are often called 'antifeminists' just because they are Conservatives. When they go on to criticize establishment feminist abuses of feminism, they are slandered with vengeance as Dr. Laura claims in the following piece from her column in the Santa Barbara News Press (11/19/06)...(a paper ironically run by a rich and totalitarian female tyrant who has fired all her good people because they insisted on editorial firewalls). If Dr. Laura is telling the truth here, establishment feminists fit the definition of "antifeminism" because they refuse to recognize and acknowledge (politically incorrect) women who have become equal to men. I am no fan of Dr Laura but she seems to have a point here. Therefore, I insist that we use care when labeling people or their positions 'antifeminist' in this article.(Drop in editor) 71.102.254.114 23:00, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current combination of 'Characterized by ideas or behavior reflecting a disbelief in the economic, political, and social equality of the sexes' and 'activity indicative of belief in the superiority of men over women' seems to not adequately sum up either, plus disagrees with the further elaboration of the topic in the article. Even though the online dictionary definitions include 'reflecting' and 'indicative' for protection, the definition does not reflect antifeminism, since it mixes up what is actually being anti-ed. There is a difference, for example, between the abstract core values of feminism (equality of the sexes), and the effects of feminism: one could certainly be pro the former and anti the latter. Yes, the concreteness of any claim regarding the latter is always debateable, and any of us might agree or disagree regarding any particular statement made on that topic, but an article on antifeminism needs to include this variance in its definition, unless it is only concerned with portraying it as pejorative. <a href="../../../j/g/d/User%7EJgda_4de9.html" title="User:Jgda">Jgda</a> 00:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just made fairly substantial changes to the article. Here's the reasoning:</p>
<p>Definition: added a second paragraph on the use of the term to mean "opposed to feminism". Briefly discussed the complexities of this definition, which are directly tied to the complex definition of the term "feminism" (cf. <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">Feminism</a> and the many related articles).</p>
<p>History of antifeminism: There was nothing in this section at all, so I've thrown together an intro and a few examples for each of the areas of life mentioned in the original definition of antifeminist (economic, political, social. also religious.) I trust these examples are well known enough and expressed in such a way as to be NONPOV, but critical feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>Antifeminism Today: There was a confused section on "Who defines feminism" which I've essentially removed. A few words did make their way into the second paragraph on the definition, but essentially this paragraph was saying that there are problems with a reactionary use of the term, when that use wasn't given initially.</p>
<p>Then there was material which I simply cut. To be specific, there were some uncited objections to the term antifeminist which didn't make it at all clear whether they were the objections of a self-declared antifeminist or someone unwillingly labelled as such. Bolted onto that was an uncited assertion about what some feminists allegedly say about some non-feminist women (the relevance of this to "Who defines antifeminism?" wasn't at all clear). Then a paragraph about an author who <i>doesn't</i> see herself as antifeminist, and a response by another woman who also doesn't use the term. (Perhaps the term was used in their respective works, but that was also not made clear). I can't think of many objections to these cuts, but if you have them, let me know.</p>
<p>Finally, I added a few words regarding one of the quotes to suggest the definition of antifeminism that the author was using.</p>
<p>That's it. Comments welcome.</p>

<dd>'This usage is problematic because feminism itself is an excedingly diverse movement which has no single, central philosophy. As such, a person defining themselves as antifeminist in this sense is defining themselves only as in opposition to their own understanding of feminism. Conversly, a person who applies this label, in this sense, to another is falling victim to the same misunderstanding of the diversity of feminism.'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I removed the 'purely reactionary' qualification as, at best, unnecessary; at worst POV. The op-ed regarding feminist diversity (femi-versity?) and, therefore, the problem with opposing feminism, is POV and (in my POV) rather absurd. If people can get away with calling themselves 'feminist' - if the term and concept actually exists and is used by people meaningfully - then the term 'anti-feminst' can likewise be used. Certainly when somebody says they are a feminist they are not saying that they support every single statement on feminsim made by anyone else who calls themselves a feminist (a logical impossibility): likewise regarding antifeminists. <a href="../../../j/g/d/User%7EJgda_4de9.html" title="User:Jgda">Jgda</a> 22:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate your point, in that "purely" was too strong, and could arguably carry POV connotations. I'd assert, however, that excluding the remainder, and particularly the notion that an "anti-x" definition is reactionary, is unwise. Any school of thought that identifies itself as "anti-x" is dependent on the definition of "x". (Essentially all schools of thought that define themselves in this way have to deal with this issue. (cf. anti-capitalism, anti-environmentalism, anti-theist, etc.)). This does not contradict your statement that the term "anti-feminist" can be used, it only illustrates that the reactionary usage is dependent on the definition of "feminist". Where multiple definitions of the base term exist, the anti- group will always face the clouding of its own identifier. To exclude this problem implies a universality to the reactionary definition that such a term can almost never carry. Put simply, you're not dealing with complementary antomymns here.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'd prefer something like: This usage is subjective because multiple definitions of feminism are in use. As such, a person defining themselves as antifeminist in this reactionary sense is only defining themselves as in opposition to their own understanding, or definition, of feminism.</p>
<p>Either way, I'll leave this material off the page until you, and others, have an opportunity for comment. Nonetheless, I strongly advocate the reintroduction of the term "reactionary" (or an appropriate synonym) for the reasons outlined above. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoolsWar_1e46.html" title="User:FoolsWar">FoolsWar</a> 05:59, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the measured response. 'Reactionary', I would still argue, as a word carries more in its meaning than purely 'in reaction to' and I have only ever heard the word used in a pejorative sense (Thesaurus.com lists such synonyms as: Tory, counter-revolutionary, die-hard, fogyish, obscurantist, old-line, orthodox, philistine, regressive, retrogressive, right, rightist, rigid, standpat, traditionalistic). 'Reactionary' has a highly politically-charged common usage (at least in academia), otherwise you could say that any of the leftist revolutions were 'reactionary' since they were in reaction to the oppression of the working class etc. and get some very strange looks from politics majors. The first definition on Dictionary.com, for example: 'of, pertaining to, marked by, or favoring reaction, esp. extreme conservatism or rightism in politics; opposing political or social change.' Antifeminsts tend, for example, to see themselves (whether we agree with them or not) as trying to enact social change, not oppose it: there are social problems that exist right now that were caused (intentionally or not) by feminism that need to be changed.</dd>

<dd>I see what you are saying re. anti-ness, and many atheist thinkers have attempted to avoid this trap. I would alter, for above reasons, your piece above to: 'This usage is subjective because multiple definitions of feminism are in use. As such, a person defining themselves as antifeminist in this sense is defining themselves as in opposition to their understanding, or definition, of feminism.' Although, one could write a similar thing about a person who claims to be a feminist: 'This usage is subjective because multiple definitions of feminism are in use. As such, a person defining themselves as feminist is defining themselves in support of their understanding, or definition, of feminism.' so I don't know how useful it is as a statement, other than to throw doubt on the person's ability to make the claim. <a href="../../../j/g/d/User%7EJgda_4de9.html" title="User:Jgda">Jgda</a> 06:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to know why feminists are allowed to define our movement? Antifeminists disagree with the premise upon which feminism is based; that women in the past and today have been under oppression from men. We believe that only by focusing on women's difficulties and men's benefits in society, and ignoring men's difficulties and women's benefits in society has this false belief been viewed as an undeniable 'fact'. We are not against women, we are not against women's equality, in fact many of us are women. We do not want women to lose the vote, we do not want women to stop working, we do not want to take away education and health care for women. We simply do not believe that feminism has a valid solution for problems, in fact we believe that feminism has caused many of the problems we face today. We also do not believe that feminism stands for men or their many issues they face, in fact they tend to stand in direct opposition to men getting help in situations such as domestic violence and father's rights. The idea that one must be pro-feminist to be pro-woman is just one of the many untruths feminism promotes that antifeminists do not believe.</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I agree with you, the definition given comes from the dictionary. There is definitely a difference between how this word is used as a self-application and how it is used to apply to an other (which seems to rarely happen anyway: <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogyny</a> being more popular), and the dictionary only seems to provide a meaning for the latter. Under the rules of this game here at wiki - both official and otherwise - to define the former meaning you would need a published source that cannot be accused of bias.

<dd>I think an example of people opposed to feminism calling themselves "anti-feminist" would be a reasonable source for that use of the term. The only problem might be in showing that the source was representative, and not just a fringe use of the term; so books published by respected publishers, or articles in scholarly journals (or magazines with reasonably wide circulation), would be good, but references to web-pages would be more problematic.<a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 06:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added the content in the second paragraph because some other editor moved ALL of the critical references on <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> over here as being 'antifeminist'. This includes dozens of authors both feminist and non-feminist who are critical of status quo 'oppression' feminisms but otherwise support equality feminism. I ask again who decides who is 'antifeminist' here...to throw around pejorative labels that wreck peoples careers on an encyclopedia is libelous.</p>
<p>Please either tighten up the definition in the second paragraph or delete it altogether. Legitimate critiques of feminism belong on the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> page rather than here unless the author is against all forms of female equality. To rape definitions for political purposes is a common tactic totalitarian feminists use to slander their enemies. We deserve better here.

<dd>Legitimate criticism of feminism does belong here, despite the out-of-step definition being used. An antifeminist does not have to be against all things ever said or done under the banner of feminism just as a feminist does not have to be for all things ever said or done under the banner of feminism, particularly since both are logical impossibilities since this would mean contradicting yourself. It remains very important, obviously, for certain people to retain control over this word, despite its common usage being completely different to how the dictionaries still define it. This website has certain rules, so this entry will just have to remain patently inaccurate. Don't sweat it, it has no bearing or influence over the term anyway. <a href="../../../j/g/d/User%7EJgda_4de9.html" title="User:Jgda">Jgda</a> 03:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that some legitimate criticism does belong here. The issue to me is one of distinction rather than one of inaccuracy. As Patia and Koerge show feminists have raped this word by expanding the definitions to absurd extremes so that they can silence any and all critics of any or all feminist ideas with a the label anti-feminism. This is an cunning, covert, and ugly political stunt to tar people rather than discuss their ideas. It resembles how Jimmy Carter is being called 'anti-semitic' for saying that the Israelis do commit human rights offenses against Palestinians. That's what I get all hot and bothered about here. Any suggestions on how to handle this? The obvious stunt here was to call ALL authors critical of ANY aspects of feminist ideology 'anti-feminist' no matter how credible and dump them all here rather than showing them in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a>.

<p>Second Wave feminists have a terrible reputation for raping the language for their pejorative political and ideological POV pushing as in 'ALL heterosexual sex is rape', or 'gender' means 'female' and many other absurd definitions. In <i>Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies (Chapter 11 Policing the Academy)</i>, authors Patia and Koerge show how feminists rape the term 'anti-feminism' to make absurd claims about so-called 'antifeminist intellectual harrassment', to protect their separatist sandboxes from normal academic criticism and to silence legitimate critics of feminism (be they feminist or non-feminist). Therefore I insist that we use NPOV dictionary definitions for our main definitions and clearly show how feminists use 'antifeminist' to slander their enemies when we show THEIR self-serving definition(s). I also insist that we use clean distinctions between common NPOV and POV feminist definitions of 'anti-feminism' so that feminists political POV pushing is obvious here. Just because an extreme and unrepresentative group of feminist partisans uses THEIR pejorative, self-serving and far from commonly accepted definitions for THEIR own purpose is reason enough to fall back on common dictionary definitions and to state the sources of definitions that are 'special'. No one single group gets to impose definitions on all the rest of us and call them 'common' minus widespread useage...no matter how weak, whiny, and mean-spirited the group might be.(drop in editor) 128.111.95.47 03:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But the definition of anti-feminism as a hostility to women <i>isn't</i> some kind of feminist POV pushing; it's one of the earliest meanings of the term, as given by the OED, probably the premier scholarly dictionary. Your addition to the article, claiming that the use of the term to mean anti-woman is an invention of "modern feminists", is false, as the OED makes clear. It makes sense for this article to concentrate on the use of the term to mean opposition to feminism, rather than hostility to women (because we already have <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">Misogyny</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_chauvinism.html" title="Male chauvinism">Male chauvinism</a> articles for the latter use). But to claim that the other use is "slander" is incorrect and pushes a particular antifeminist POV. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 04:53, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do we need this section? It refers to unequal treatment of women which is presumably already covered at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogyny</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_chauvinism.html" title="Male chauvinism">male chauvinism</a>, or <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_rights.html" title="Women's rights">women's rights</a> (or if it isn't, should be moved there. It might be useful to include a section on the arguments made by early opponents of women's rights (in the days before the word "feminism" was in wide circulation), perhaps starting with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Knox_74e0.html" title="John Knox">John Knox</a>. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 05:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I second the motion to delete. I've changed it enough to note that it is a litany of feminist claims. <a href="../../../y/a/k/User%7EYakuman_5a52.html" title="User:Yakuman">Yakuman</a> 05:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Deleting it since it does not refer to antifeminism, but to unequal treatment of women dating back to times when feminism itself didn't exist, for example: "The denial of leadership roles for women in some Christian denominations, for example the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Church, is a long-standing example of antifeminist practice." - nothing to do with anti/feminism - it predates it by far. "The rape and existing slavery of black women slaves in America was justified by the perception that, because the women were non-white they were therefore non-Christian and in turn impure." - nothing to do with anti/feminism, same applies to black male slaves. "Throughout the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, the hereditary system of kingship meant that power was handed down patrilineally. Thus, while a woman could inherit a throne, it was not a common occurrence." - women did inherit the throne on a number of occasions with Cleopatra and Queen of England, Cathrin the Great of Russia, etc as vivid examples. Again, nothing to do with anti/feminism. "Economically, women were denied various occupations on the grounds of their sex." - no sources, vague statement, not about anti/feminism. "For example, in nineteenth century America, women were not permitted to consume alcohol in public." - not related - it is not a consequence of anti feminist views, but again unequal laws towards women (feminist or not). Dear feminists, please, limit yourself to propaganda in the section on "feminism" - there is no need to go bashing any other sections of wikipedia - we do know what you want to say, no need to stick it in everywhere. Women =/= feminists and antifeminism =/= misogyny. Lost Angel 19:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added this section, with some antifeminist quotes by Nietzsche and a brief explanation of his antifeminism. Maybe someone can help me with this, with more information on Nietzsche's antifeminism and that of other philosophers. I may add more. One idea I have is maybe adding more to the part about Nietzsche's view that feminism is detrimental to quality motherhood, and other philosophers who shared similar views.<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShield2_8ee2.html" title="User:Shield2">Shield2</a> 07:49, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
