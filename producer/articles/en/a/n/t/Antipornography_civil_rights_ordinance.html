<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipornography_civil_rights_ordinance.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The idea of combating pornography through civil rights litigation was first developed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Boreman_9ab1.html" title="Linda Boreman">Linda Boreman</a>, who had appeared in the pornographic film <i><a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_%28film%29_f946.html" title="Deep Throat (film)">Deep Throat</a></i> as "Linda Lovelace," published a memoir, <i>Ordeal</i>, in which she stated that she had been beaten and raped by her ex-husband <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Traynor_de1d.html" title="Chuck Traynor">Chuck Traynor</a>, and violently coerced into making Deep Throat. Boreman held a press conference, with Andrea Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_Against_Pornography_6b71.html" title="Women Against Pornography">Women Against Pornography</a> supporting her, in which she made her charges public for the press corps. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> began discussing the possibility of legal redress for Boreman under federal <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> law. Two weeks later, they met with Boreman to discuss the idea of pursuing a lawsuit against Traynor and other pornographers. She was interested, but Steinem discovered that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> for a possible suit had passed, and Boreman backed off (Brownmiller 337). Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, began to discuss the possibility of civil rights litigation as an approach to combatting pornography.</p>
<p>In the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Minnesota_1d57.html" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, to teach a course in literature for the <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Studies_9bd9.html" title="Women's Studies">Women's Studies</a> program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography. Hearing about the course, community activists from south <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> contacted Dworkin and MacKinnon to ask for their help in curbing the rise of pornography shops. Dworkin and MacKinnon explained their idea for a new civil rights approach to pornography, which would define pornography as a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> violation against women, and allow women who had been harmed by pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The Minneapolis city council hired Dworkin and MacKinnon as consultants to help the city find an approach to deal with pornography. (They billed the city for $18,000 more than the $5,000 they were contracted for, and the overbill was not honored.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>) Public hearings were held by the city council, with testimony from Linda Boreman, Ed Donnerstein (a pornography researcher from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>), and Pauline Bart, a radical feminist professor from Chicago. The ordinance was passed on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> but <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veto.html" title="Veto">vetoed</a> by Mayor <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_M._Fraser_c1bb.html" title="Donald M. Fraser">Donald M. Fraser</a> (who opposed the idea on its merits and also claimed that the city ought not get involved in litigation over the ordinance's constitutionality). Five men and two women voted for the ordinance; two men and four women voted against it.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The ordinance was passed a second time in July 1984, and was vetoed again by Fraser. Radical feminists obstructed both council meetings in which the vetoes were sustained.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In the interim, the city council in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> invited Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft a similar ordinance, and also held public hearings. A different version of the ordinance, rewritten to focus specifically on pornography that depicted violence, was passed by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> city council and signed into law by Mayor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hudnut_81b5.html" title="William Hudnut">William Hudnut</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. However, the law was quickly challenged in court, and overturned as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">unconstitutional</a> by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Seventh_Circuit_cf11.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit">Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a>'s ruling on <a href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/hudnut.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/hudnut.html" rel="nofollow"><i>American Booksellers Association, Inc. v. Hudnut</i></a>. The Supreme Court upheld the appellate court's ruling without comment. The case is often cited as an important decision on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a> as applied to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of the defeat in the courts, Dworkin, MacKinnon, and some other feminists continued to advocate versions of the civil rights ordinance, organizing campaigns to place it on the ballot as a voter initiative in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> (where it was voted down in the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a> 58%-42%), and then again in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellingham%2C_Washington_1fe8.html" title="Bellingham, Washington">Bellingham, Washington</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> (where it was passed in the referendum, 62%-48%). The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> filed suit against the city of Bellingham after the ordinance was passed, and the federal court again struck the law down on <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment</a> grounds.</p>
<p>Feminists were strongly divided over the anti-pornography ordinance. Some feminists, such as <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_McElroy_2268.html" title="Wendy McElroy">Wendy McElroy</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Willis_bade.html" title="Ellen Willis">Ellen Willis</a>, and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susie_Bright_d03e.html" title="Susie Bright">Susie Bright</a>, opposed anti-pornography feminism on principle. Many anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others -- including <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Brownmiller_c6cb.html" title="Susan Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a>, Janet Gornick, and <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Kaminer_c93b.html" title="Wendy Kaminer">Wendy Kaminer</a> -- agreed with Dworkin and MacKinnon's critique of pornography, but opposed the attempt to combat it through legislative campaigns, which they feared would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of free speech, or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> and entangling it in political squabbles (Brownmiller 318-321).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipornography_civil_rights_ordinance.html" title="Edit section: Butler decision in Canada">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Butler</i> decision in Canada</span></h2>
<p>In 1992, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> made a ruling in <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Butler_8538.html" title="R. v. Butler">R. v. Butler</a> (the "Butler decision") which incorporated some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal approach to pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In <i>Butler</i> the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law <i>could</i> be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Legal_Education_and_Action_Fund_ea3a.html" title="Women's Legal Education and Action Fund">Women's Legal Education and Action Fund</a> (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon. Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, arguing that feminists should not support or attempt to reform criminal obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book <i>Pornography</i> were held for inspection by Canadian customs agents <a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under a law that she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance; Dworkin did <i>not</i> support the decision; and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) was a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the <i>Butler</i> decision <a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Dworkin and MacKinnon placed special emphasis on the legal definition of pornography provided in the civil rights ordinance. The civil rights ordinance characterizes pornography as a form of "sex discrimination" and defines "pornography" as <i>"the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and/or words,"</i> when combined with one of several other conditions. In the <a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppD.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppD.htm" rel="nofollow">"model ordinance"</a> that they drafted, Dworkin and MacKinnon gave the following legal definition:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. "Pornography" means the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and/or words that also includes one or more of the following:</dd>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a. women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things or commodities; or</dd>
<dd>b. women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or</dd>
<dd>c. women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest, or other sexual assault; or</dd>
<dd>d. women are presented as sexual objects tied up or cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or</dd>
<dd>e. women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or</dd>
<dd>f. women's body parts-including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks-are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or</dd>
<dd>g. women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or</dd>
<dd>h. women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. The use of men, children, or transsexuals in the place of women in (a)-(h) of this definition is also pornography for purposes of this law.</dd>
<dd>3. "Person" shall include child or transsexual.</dd>

<p>Each version of the ordinance provided different <i>causes for action</i> under which women could file sex discrimination suits related to pornography.</p>

<ul>
<li><i><b>Trafficking in pornography</b></i>, defined as the production, sale, exhibition, or distribution of pornographic materials. Making pornography available for study in government-funded public libraries and public or private university libraries was exempted from being considered discrimination by trafficking. Any woman could claim a cause for action against the trafficker(s) as a woman acting against the subordination of women. Men or transsexuals who alleged injury by pornography in the way that women are injured by it could also sue.</li>
<li><i><b>Coercion into pornographic performances</b></i>. Any person coerced, intimidated, or fraudulently induced into pornography could sue the maker(s), seller(s), exhibitor(s), or distributor(s), both for damages and to have the product or products of the performances eliminated from public view. The law stated that a number of specific factors, including past sexual history, other involvement in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, the appearance of cooperation during the performance, or payment for the performance, could not by used (by themselves, without further evidence) as evidence against a claim of coercion.</li>
<li><i><b>Forcing pornography on a person</b></i> in a home, workplace, school, or public place. Any person who has pornography forced on her or him could sue the perpetrator and the institution.</li>
<li><i><b>Assault or physical attack due to pornography</b></i>. The victim of an assault, physical attack, or injury "directly caused by specific pornography" could seek damages from the maker(s), distributor(s), seller(s), and/or exhibitor(s) of the pornography, and an injunction against the further exhibition, distribution, or sale of that specific pornography.</li>

<ul>
<li><i><b>Defamation through pornography</b></i>, defined as defaming any person (including public figures) through the unauthorized use of their proper name, image, or recognizable personal likeness in pornography, and allowing for authorization, if given, to be revoked in writing at any time prior to the publication of the pornography.</li>
