<p>Many are complaining about what this article implies in certain areas. Moaning about how it's arguing for a side. I have neutralised some wording on here, but we must leave the stories that some may consider "whacky", as long as we do not turn it into any form of propaganda.</p>
<p>If someone feels distressed at the concentration on "whacky" ASBO cases, then feel free to create a section that comments how some have praised the ASBO, but keep it neutral.</p>

<p>Why don't you concentrate on the good aspects of ASBO Legislation instead of being the usual, run of the mill, boring teller of "whacky" ASBO Stories</p>
<p>ASBO has a place in modern society because modern society has failed miserable. We are a Nation of whingers who want things to happen to improve our lives but when that change occurs our bleeding heart suddenly turn in panic and we start bleating about a Nanny State!</p>
<p>Its just typical of the malaise affecting this Country since the Lefties of the 60's started to ruin every aspect of our lives.</p>

<p>i think that this Anti Social Behaviour Order may finally bring an end to the uncontrollable youths who are terrorising our communities which can usually be traced back to bad parenting -145.229.156.40</p>
<p>I recall an article in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> some time ago discussing these, and giving as an example an elderly man who was prohibited from making sarcastic comments to his neighbour; the <i>Economist</i> suggested that it was somewhat ridiculous that a government could legally prohibit someone from making sarcastic comments.

<p>An IP has changed the article to say that the evidence must be to the standard of criminal law not civil law. This contradicts things I've read on this subject. Anyone know for sure? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secret</a><a href="../../../s/e/c/User_talk%7ESecretlondon_8864.html" title="User talk:Secretlondon">london</a> 15:40, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No evidence is based upon civil law ie. hearsay, reports and evidence from witnesses who who are absent from the court. This is part of the reason why they are so effective, oftern when a criminal case has been thrown out of the criminal court the police will still use the case for an ASBO in the civil court. Although breach of the asbo is a criminal matter.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually it's a combination of the two - criminal standard of proof but anonymous testimony and hearsay are admissible. Confirmation can be found in Home Office guidelines here....<a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/cagetfile.asp?rid=536" class="external free" title="http://www.together.gov.uk/cagetfile.asp?rid=536" rel="nofollow">http://www.together.gov.uk/cagetfile.asp?rid=536</a></dd>

<p>I removed "Rather than providing her with treatment or counselling," from the ASBO for attempting suicide paragraph. First, it's not clear to me that this is an option for magistrates, particularly when the woman in question does not suffer from a mental disorder (as reported in the press). Second, the phrasing doesn't suggest a NPOV. I think readers can draw their own conclusions from a bald statement of the facts. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknesbitt_5453.html" title="User:Marknesbitt">Mark Nesbitt</a> 13:10, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I changed "sarcastic remarks" to "sarcastic remarks to neighbours or their visitors"; as it stood before it was misleading. I agree with the NPOV flag here, the infrequent eccentric uses are strongly highlighted and changed slightly to make ASBOs appear more personally offensive. mr_happyhour</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not from UK and because I've heard about ASBO, I came to read this article to learn more about that piece of legislation. As it stands, the article mentions rather absurd examples of ASBOs. However, the article states that there is public support for this legislation so the article really needs to describe some cases where, according to the supporters of the legislation, applying this legislation makes sense and is effective in reducing whatever it is supposed to reduce. 80.221.36.191</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Social_Behaviour_Order_a341.html" title="Edit section: More POV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">More POV</span></h2>
<p>The article currently makes ASBOs out to be draconian. Whether they are or not isn't the point: the article has to maintain a level of POV. Example: The claim that "a seventeen-year-old forbidden to use his front door" makes ASBOs seem ridiculous and tyrannical, but checking out the source shows that "So bad was his behaviour, which included attacking homes and cars and shouting obscenities, that police had to use CS gas to subdue him" -- hence, the guy wasn't some innocent victim. Other stuff, like having <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_police.html" title="Thought police">Thought police</a> listed in the "See Also" makes it quite obvious that this article needs a serious POV clean up. I'm not saying that ASBOs aren't crap or often overly harsh; all I'm saying is that this article needs to be a bit more diplomatic, and more importantly, honest, about things. 66.229.160.94 00:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While you can keep the tone neutral - there is only so much you can do to avoid the facts. An ASBO means that in Britain today you can be banned from doing something that is not illegal itself - under a set of entirely subjective conditions. If you fall afowl of the police or neighbours for your political views - you can have your freedoms severely curtailed under the premise of an ASBO.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the clear facts are that the ASBOs are not just used for unruly teenagers. Even when they are, it's probably not the most useful thing in the world - and will create more people with criminal records (when they break the ASBO) or resentment of the authorities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no way that an objective detailing of what ASBOs entail will show them in a positive light. <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZoney_0cf9.html" title="User:Zoney"><b>zoney</b></a> <span style="color:green; font-size:larger">♣</span> <a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZoney_bef0.html" title="User talk:Zoney"><b>talk</b></a> 11:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The UK is dissolving into martial law. Anything that documents this is worthy of praise and I praise the authors of this article. Whilst the ASBO could be seen as the final solution for the 'Neighbors from hell' problem of urbia, its just giving yet more power to people who don't deserve it.</p>

<dd>I think it should be there as some people have noted that the introduction of ASBO's was a slippery slope into a police state. It is a POV, but it is one that is held by a significant minority.

<p>The article, as it stands, is quite well balanced. However we need a little more information on the 'non-typical' asbos as they seem to be written for shock value at the moment.</p>
<p>We also need to add information about support for ASBOs as there seems to be an overall 'anti' asbo feel to the page (although this isn't too strong). -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 13:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>the article refers to a case where 2 youths were prevented from wearing a golf glove in manchester. but the refrence is simply "A case at Manchester Magistrates Court, November-December 2002." which is probably the vagest refrence i've seen in a while. could somebody find an actual refrence? otherwise i would feel that it should not suggest that it is a refrenced fact. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Keirstitt (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Keirstitt_4df7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Keirstitt">contribs</a>) 22:15, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I believe I have dealt with a fair amount of the problems that this article had regarding POV. It now needs work to tidy up its actually wording though.

<p>Are you sure the ASBO in the Republic of Ireland is introduced in March of this year? A case in my town was brought against someone in about January of this year. 86.43.68.170 21:05, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was in the article. Removing and sticking here. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 17:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ASBO Concern highlights the following issues:</p>
<p>1. Asbos can be used to criminalise behaviour that would otherwise not be illegal. Under asbo law, people have been banned from playing football, feeding pigeons, swearing, being sarcastic and riding a bicycle. Asbo laws have also been used to curb people's rights to free speech and association. It is not uncommon for someone to be banned from being with more than one other person in a public place.</p>
<p>2. If you breach your asbo you can be sent to jail for 5 years, with children aged under 17 years facing a 2 year Detention and Training Order. Overall, one in four of those who have been given an asbo have ended up in prison.</p>
<p>3. The Government said that asbos would only be imposed on children "in exceptional circumstances" but this promise has proved to be worthless. In reality, more than four in ten asbos have been imposed on young people aged less than 17 years old.</p>
<p>4. Many of these asbos have been imposed on children with special needs. A study by the British institute for Brain Injured Children (BIBIC) found that up to 35 percent of young people with asbos had a diagnosed mental disorder or accepted learning difficulty.</p>
<p>5. Asbos have also been imposed on vulnerable adults including people with mental health problems and homeless beggars: - One homeless man was given an asbo banning him from begging in an 'earnest and humble manner'. He carried on begging, was jailed and died in prison. - In another shocking case, a suicidal woman was banned from going near the railways, multistorey car parks, rivers or bridges. Instead of offering support to deal with her depression, the judge threatened her with imprisonment for being a nuisance!</p>
<p>6. Anyone who gets and asbo can be publicly 'named and shamed' - this means that your photo and personal details are posted on the internet, through door to door leaflet drops and poster campaigns. Children as young as 10 have been named and shamed in this way, with some facing threats of violence from vigilantes as a result. Other children regard naming and shaming as a perverse "badge of honour", making it very unlikely to change their behaviour for the better.</p>
<p>7. Asbos are being misused because they are so easy to impose. Less than one in a hundred of the applications made so far have been refused This is because local council officials or the police merely have to persuade a judge that your behaviour "may cause harassment or alarm or distress" to someone else to get one imposed. They are also allowed to use second or third hand hearsay as evidence in court, so it is very hard to defend yourself against vindictive or mistaken allegations.</p>
<p>8. There is no evidence that asbos stop people from behaving antisocially. More than four in ten are breached and frequently those that are not merely move the problem on to another area. This is because at best they are a quick fix which fails to address the root cause of problem behavour.</p>
<p>9. There is strong public support more positive methods of tackling antisocial behaviour. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Trust found that two thirds of those surveyed preferred preventative approaches to punitive approaches such as asbos.</p>
<p>10. Asboconcern has presented the government with a dossier of evidence of the widespread misuse of asbos. But Ministers have so far refused to accept our call for full independent review of their use. We believe that the public has the right to know why so many asbos are being imposed, how many asbo recipients have disabilities or medical conditions, what people are being banned from doing and why so many asbos fail to work.<small>Small Text</small></p>
