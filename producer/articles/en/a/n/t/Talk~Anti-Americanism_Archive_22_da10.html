<h2><span class="mw-headline">Various improvements by Marielleh</span></h2>
<p>On April 30, editor Marielleh has made some very good changes, not only removing spelling errors but also POV, plus adding useful information and better language. Another user, "Jayjg", has reverted these edits without reason or explanation. This is a pity. Take for instance this paragraph:</p>
<p>Former version: "The fall of the Soviet Union may have created more space for criticism against the United States, because the American security umbrella was no longer needed."</p>
<p>Clearly POV: "American security umbrella was no longer needed" - there were quite a few people in Europe who always felt that the so-called "security umbrella" was never really "needed" or wanted.</p>
<p>Marielleh's edit: "Paradoxically, the fall of the Soviet Union may have brought an increase in anti-Americanism, because the U.S. was left as the world's only superpower, and people who formerly saw the United States as a bastion against Communism or needed the American security umbrella no longer felt the need to support the United States. <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">Globalization</a>, often portrayed as an American <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoliberal.html" title="Neoliberal">neoliberal</a> project, while improving international contact, has also magnified the visibility of trade conflicts and increased societal insecurity about jobs."</p>
<p>Removed POV, and elegantly so. Added info, a wonderful improvement. I will now go and restore it. Rkrichbaum 22:24, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the former version was not quite NPOV, but Marielleh's edits in general either make it much worse or are textbook <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. They also tend to digress heavily from the point of the article. The replacement of the relevant photo with a totally irrelevant one is also questionable. --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada"><font color="red">█♣█</font></a> ▪ <a href="../../../r/e/h/User_talk%7ERehpotsirhc_1b9c.html" title="User talk:Rehpotsirhc">Talk</a></sup> 22:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You've got it backwards: your former version was Marielleh's edit while your note of Marielleh's edit was the former version. The line beginning "Paradoxically..." has stood on this page for months. Jayjg correctly reverted it. The one thing lost was some dabbing s/he did. Also, the pic was not an improvement at all. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:00, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with both; Marielleh has been POVing and inserting <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> digressions into several articles. I can't imagine why someone would believe a caption which states "The concentration camp has heated anti-American sentiment." could possibly be helpful or neutral or fall within policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 15:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe quoting the source of this assessment will help: <i>"Testimonials and photographs of atrocities emerging from Guantánamo feed anti-American sentiment. 'Guantánamo provides rhetorical fodder for politicians seeking to bring down United States-allied rulers in their own countries,' the New York Times reported. 'It offers a ready rallying point against American dominance, even in countries whose own police and military have been known for severe violations of human rights.'"</i></dd>

<dd>- As to the picture, it provides an example of and explanation for "anti-American" sentiment. Why is this hard to understand? Does anyone really believe that the existence of this concentration camp in Guantanamo Bay does not influence public opinion in other states? Or is it the "loaded" term "concentration camp"? In this case, the caption could easily be altered, maybe to "What has been reported about the POW camp in Guantanamo Bay has heated anti-American sentiment."
<dl>
<dd>Everything you cite is assumptive (with the exception of Great Satan, which is still there less the Shah's name). "...stems from..." is not a statement to take for granted and I suggest you examine the disputes again before declaring them non-disputed. The pic itself may have value somewhere, but to replace an excellent intro pic, that literally has the article title jumping out, makes no sense. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it is kind of funny that you say it is "assumptive" that feelings of distrust or dislike toward the United States tend to increase when United States causes wars, violates international laws; that the US strongly supported the totalitarian regime of shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi; and that "the sentiment against the United States stems from domestic politics, particularly in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where the governments are in close relationship with the U.S. In these countries, dislike toward the U.S. stems from opposing the country's own corrupted goverment."</p>
<p>Whereas you restore the following unsupported claim:</p>
<p>"Anti-Americanism is often described as a phenomenon that is uniformly hostile to the United States independently of the real attributes of the nation and has characteristics of a distinct ideology." ... "a school of thought" ... a "coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism".</p>
<p>"often" described? characteristics of a "distinct ideology"?</p>
<p>Where have these characteristics of a distinct ideology ever been described?</p>
<p>Certainly not in the rant against the "hard" left that you added as a source to the "anti-Semitism" comparison ("The New Anti-Semitism?" <a href="http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/article_view.php?article_id=749" class="external free" title="http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/article_view.php?article_id=749" rel="nofollow">http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/article_view.php?article_id=749</a>).</p>
<p>Among the listed sources I can only find one (<a href="http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0902/antiamerican.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0902/antiamerican.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0902/antiamerican.htm</a>) that contains something like a coherent argument, not so much in support of the concept that "anti-Americanism" is a distinct "phenomenon" or an ideology, but contending that various theories of empire contain elements of "anti-Americanism(s)". Did you read it? This very source states:</p>
<p>"We take for granted that such a thing as anti-Americanism exists; we leave to others the task of contesting this presupposition."</p>
<p>LOL! Now there's an assumption if I ever saw one. And what's up with the royal plural? Delusions of grandeur? Rkrichbaum 18:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, no thanks on the appeal to emotion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, phrasing: "Anti-Americanism is often described as..." is a qualified suggestion; "the sentiment against the United States stems from domestic politics..." is a statement of fact. By all means we should mention policies, but not like this. It mistakes a proximate factor for an ultimate cause. The implicit corollary to "In these countries, dislike toward the U.S. stems from opposing the country's own corrupted goverment" is "in the absence of U.S. support for corrupt govt's there would be little or no Anti-Americanism in these countries." Does <i>that</i> make sense? No, it doesn't: even it had an utterly benevolent foreign policy, America would still suffer from being Christian, secular, capitalist, "run by Jews" (take your pick). Of course, policy absolutely <i>amplifies</i> things, so devise a sentence noting that but please don't assign <i>cause</i> as if it's undisputed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the intro edits, we have two very simple points made: "some think it a dangerous ideology" and "some think it an over-blown hodge-podge used for propoganda." In both cases you simply removed the former and left the latter as our statement of fact. I'm sorry but this is a POV push. Suggest tweaks to the wording—I can live with phenomenon ahead of ideology for instance—but simply removing the point leaves us half-done. I would call the racialism described here an ideology; insofar as the United States is configured and packaged, as noted, as a decadent power and a Crusading Christian one by bin Laden etc., I think you're dealing with an ideology. What would you say the (sourced) comment from Henri-Levi denotes? Something more than a "rough composite" to be sure. I'm not asking you to agree but we can't simply present the "what's the big deal?" angle in the absence of the "this is serious" angle. This from the J.W. Caesar article: "Anti-Americanism rests on the singular idea that something associated with the United States, something at the core of American life, is deeply wrong and threatening to the rest of the world." That is, an ideology or ideologies not (merely) a "rough composite."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The source was quick because I had little time: try Anti-Semitism and Anti-Americanism in Google Scholar and tell me it hasn't been professionally discussed. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 20:22, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I don't think you understand my objection, so I'll give it another try.</p>
<p>Whether anti-Americanism is dangerous is not the point. Of course it is, should and will be widely debated, scholarly and otherwise. But I think the current version of the article is not particularly helpful to understand the term and its connotations properly.</p>
<p>It is undisputed and irrefutable that the anti-American label <b>covers a wide range</b> of attitudes, rhetoric, certainly prejudices and sometimes actions. Anti-American<b>ism</b> is the term which sums up what is deemed anti-American by the respective author. One might say, e.g. "Chinese anti-Americanism", and this would denote the sum of everything anti-American that one might find in China or among Chinese. Or "Anti-Americanism in Africa" might be the heading for a study on anti-American rhetoric, activities, and sentiments in Africa.</p>
<p>This is not my interpretation, or some POV, this is the general <b>use</b> of the term, including in the listed sources.</p>
<p>You have cited <b>NOT A SINGLE SOURCE</b> that would attempt to <b>define</b> "Anti-Americanism". No surprise, since a scientific definition of "Anti-Americanism" does not exist. (I have a source for that, albeit in German).</p>
<p>Rubinstein/Smith attempt to classify certain <i>types</i> of Anti-Americanism: 1. spontaneous reactions / 2. part of ideological constructs (e.g. communism) / 3. oriented towards action / 4. instrumentalised for other purposes. They do <b>not</b> describe Anti-Americanism "as an undifferentiated phenomenon that configures the United States and the American way of life as threatening, independently of the real attributes of the nation", as is now ridiculously claimed in the intro. Nor do they describe it as an "ideological movement" (at least that is what I get from a secondary source - is the article available online somewhere? You cite page 35, presumably the first page of the article - do you have the quote verbatim?).</p>
<p>Caesar lists various quotes, mostly by 19th century conservative intellectuals, and Heidegger. It is unclear how they are supposed to be connected, especially when the article culminates in the absurd claim that "Through the writings of thinkers like John-Paul Sartre, "Heideggerianism" was married to communism, and this odd coupling became the core of the intellectual Left in Europe for the next generation." This is typical Cold War propaganda and reminds of the pet argument of right-wing Libertarians, that Communism and Nazism are essentially the same. Hardly undisputed, though, and it does nothing to bolster your claim that Anti-Americanism is an "ideology". On the contrary, like other right-wingers in the list of references Caesar seems to opine that Anti-American thinking is typical for and part of certain other ideologies.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, this very opinionated Caesar article figures prominently here. Almost the entire History section is drawn from this short paper which is thus put on a soap-box.)</p>
<p>Finally, as to the "sourced" comment from Bernard-Henri Lévy ... This single sentence, apparently spoken during an interview, sounds like an emotional outburst. It denotes that Henri-Levi doesn't like the people he labels as "anti-American". Again, I have no idea how you reach the conclusion that this outburst supports your assumption that "Anti-Americanism" is an "ideology". Rkrichbaum 12:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To make one thing very clear: <b>I have not edited this page to suggest that anti-Americanism is an ideology</b>. Consistently, I have tried to balance the two points, while you want to remove the first. And please don't play cat-and-mouse. You asked me why I removed one edit and not the other and I explained why: there's a difference b/w qualified suggestions and statements of fact. And now your launching ad hominem bullshit at me (ya, I've read past the first page of the articles cited here given that I've been watching this page for a year) and, of course, the writers you disagree with. Your (or my) opinion on Caesar is irrelevant. It was published and it's cited by others and we're entitled to use it; you can't just to choose to disregard its points because it doesn't suit your POV. By all means find more sources given that we over-rely on it.</dd>

<li>"In France, hatred of America is the default setting of the majority and needs only occasional refreshment from intellectuals. It is more than a political opinion: it is a unifying factor at times of national division." Philippe Roger in the <i>Times Book Review.</i> Would you call that a description of an ideology? Sure, it's nice and polemical but <i>The Times</i> is citable and I have no doubt one can easily shake down many descriptions of French A-A that cast it in ideological terms. Indeed, France and the Mid East appear to be where it's most applicable.</li>

<dd>I do want to add/emphasize one point: you seem to be under the impression my editing is based on some personal claim that A-A is an ideology. I have nowhere made that claim for the phenomenon as a whole (and good Christ, we can at least call it a phenomenon) and I'm fully cognizant of the fact that speaking of Anti-Americanism<b>s</b> may be more appropriate across geo-specific, topic-specific frames of reference; indeed I would personally come down near that stance (the only critique that I think basically approximates a globabally uniform ideology is "America <b>as</b> capitalism", which gets at least some play from Venezuala to France to Iran to North Korea). But you seem to be suggesting we abrogate the use of ideology <i>entirely</i> in this discussion, which simply doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:30, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to have an idiosyncratic understanding of the term ideology. Please take a short look at the respective Wiki article and explain how "anti-Americanism" would fit. You cite in your bullet list above the claim that a "full-fledged ideologically based form of Anti-Americanism" exists. Well, that's something different from an ideology, don't you think? Ideologically BASED - That is indeed what the article of Caesar implies and Fleming/O’Carroll attempt to show. They claim that (communist) ideology(ies) or theories ARE anti-American, at their core, irrationally or whatever. The alleged anti-American attitude or sentiment is claimed to be incorporated into them, or a hidden motive.</dd>

<dd>There is also a Marxist tradition of using the term ideology - in the sense of "false consciousness". In this sense, you could say that rhetoric hostile to the US may be ideological, because it may be suspect of personalizing, distorting or simplifying issues that are better understood by an unbiased scientific critique of institutions. In Germany, there is an entire faction of Leftists, self-declared "Anti-Deutsche" (anti-Germans), who often take the view that criticisms of US policies are "anti-American". They also get a little hysterical at times.</dd>

<p>An important point not brought up in this article is that since the US is a nation of imigrants, Americans are not ethnically or racially different than their counterparts in the rest of the world. In other words, the differences are created by the temperment and personality differences of "<b>those who left</b>" verse "<b>those who were left behind</b>". This could help explain stereotypical American traits such as aggression or material indulgence. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrando03_055a.html" title="User:Brando03">User:Brando03</a> 24:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Anti-Americinism is often a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> word that is used to label criticism or suggestions as irrational. <i>Still no cite. Chomsky, please--somebody.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Groups described as Anti-American are highly diverse, for example: French intellectuals, Americans critical about the U.S. policies (if the target's nationality is known to the speaker, the word <a href="../../../u/n/a/Unamerican.html" title="Unamerican">unamerican</a> is often used), Islamist fundamentalists and Latin American entrepreneurs. Independent from which definition is used, the phenomenon is seen to have increased significantly since the beginning of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<p>I've reverted to Marskell's latest compromise version. It's more balanced, and moves the detail out of the intro into the body of the article. The burning flag picture is more suitable for the lead. Maybe the Guantanamo protest could go further down in a section where it's topical. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 13:26, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just defining the term leaves understanding of anti-Americanism fatally flawed. We could as well just simply say that anti-Americanism is opposition to U.S. policies as this the general view held by all sources and leave more accurate definition to a relavant section, but we need to cover the summarized reasons of anti-Americanism and its significance in 21th century international politics. Why is burning flag more suitable?

<p>The flag burning is more suitable for the intro because it's more general. The Guantanamo protest is better for <i>Post Cold War era</i>. The detail belongs in the body of the article. The bullet-point intro reads as tendentiously hostile to the US, and concentrates too much on the present day. I also dislike the bullet points, mostly for aesthetic reasons. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 02:22, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What does "more general" mean? Burning flag is a rare and extreme protest, it's very nnpov. See, when you look at, for instance, article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a>, it doesn't first depict a picture of sliced Palestinian/Iraqi girl. A protests against Guantanamo Bay is an excellent picture, because it's a protest about such a common concern of what is generally understood as Anti-Americanism. Eh, summarizing reasons of Anti-Americanism is "details"? If that's details, then what is not details?</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not a dictionary, so it should actually be a primary content of the summary (along with consequences of anti-Americanism). Anti-Americanism was nearly unexistant term until the 21th century, and nobody really connects the current phenomenon to anything earlier, so yes, it should focus on this day. Great, if you don't bullet points don't remove content but improve Wikipedia by modifying it to non-bullet form.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristinam_ebaf.html" title="User:Christinam">Christinam</a> 17:16, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since you seem interested: I happened upon this article only some three weeks ago and was surprised that something inept and biased as this was allowed to stand at Wikipedia where everything should be neutral. I was less than surprised when a person going by the moniker "marielleh" made some urgently required changes and I supported these. You may recall that this was accompanied by a number of contributions to the talk, see above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now christinam made other changes, rendering a new and better intro to the article (without changing anything below). In contrast to the previous version that you seem to support with great vigor, christinam's version was written in clear language, well sourced (I added a few myself) and unbiased.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is a mystery to me why someone would cling to an intro that pretends to give a definition, however oddly worded ("denotes an often disparate range", "an undifferentiated" but nevertheless "coherent" ... "phenomenon that configures", my goodness, all these big words) - when a definition that many agree upon let alone a scientific one does not exist, and we have to rely on the actual usage of the term - which was clearly outlined by christinam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not one of your cited sources bear out what you or whoever formulated this insist to put in the intro: that "anti-Americanism" has been described as "an actual ideological movement and belief system" or a "phenomonen", however "undifferentiated", "that configures the United States and the American way of life as threatening, independently of the real attributes of the nation".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you believe otherwise, provide the quotes verbatim. I asked you before, and you took it as a personal insult, for whatever reason. Can you quote where Rubinstein/Smith or Caesar describe anti-Americanism as a "undifferentiated/coherent" phenomenon "that configures the United States and the American way of life as threatening, independently of the real attributes of the nation" (don't forget the last part). And please explain how a phenomenon configures something. Thank you. Rkrichbaum 01:23, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Did you read my above comments in full? "Any hostile action or expression that becomes part and parcel of an <b>undifferentiated</b> attack on the foreign policy, society, culture and values of the United States" That's the Rubinsteing/Smith quote verbatim, cited in O'Connor. There a large number of other quotes I noted to you above.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I read your comments in full. Your two annotations do not bear out what your definition says. In your definition, "undifferentiated" is a qualification of the "phenomenon" that somehow configures the US as threatening, "independently of the real attributes of the nation". The Rubinstein/Smith quote that you cite from O'Connor qualifies as "undifferentiated" not some phenomenon, but an "attack on the ... US", which simply means that an "anti-American" attack in their opinion does not signify a specific criticism. They do not say that such an attack is "independent(ly) of the real attributes of the nation".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The rest is uncollaborative in the extreme. I added "disparate range" precisely to address concerns brought up here; if you think it "too big", choose other diction. "Coherent" <i>is used in the negative</i>: "cannot be isolatated as a coherent phenomenon."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Coherent" is used in the negative, but it immediately follows the sentence discussed above, and you begin with a qualification: "However".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"However, it has also been suggested Anti-Americanism cannot be isolated as a coherent phenomenon ..."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Which posits a contradiction to the preceding sentence, suggesting that the "phenomenon" previously characterised as "undifferentiated" must have been described as "coherent" - otherwise it would make little sense to "also" suggest otherwise.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>it has also been suggested Anti-Americanism cannot be isolated as a coherent phenomenon and that the term is merely a rough composite of stereotypes, ..."</i>. - Another, minor criticism here: I think it is more accurate to say here that "the term signifies" a rough composite rather than "is" one. Anti-Americanism is a rough composite of several things, but not "the term". Rkrichbaum 12:32, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you honestly think an intro that starts with a dig at the U.S. media and subsequently defines the concept in terms of anti-Bush sentiment is less biased then we obviously have a problem here. This article tries to make clear that the phenomenon (is that really a big word?) is as old as the country.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the "dig" has been removed, the anti-Bush thing, or rather mentioning that the rising level of what is labelled anti-Americanism is very much dependent on current policies of the US is pertinent. Whether it is appropriately positioned at the beginning of the article may be worth debating. But there are many sources to the effect that anti-Americanism is directly related to the role of the US on the world stage, which obviously has changed over time. Before WWII, as you yourself have noted, the term didn't even exist. Claiming that "the" phenomenon is as old as the country is absolutely, totally, and hopefully not purposely misleading.

I'll tell you what will happen to this intro: it will stand, maybe a month or two, but probably not a quarter, and some Pro-American newbie will come along and think "what is this bullshit?", gut it and we'll have the same problem with the opposite POV. Well written? Points 1, 2, 3:</p>

<dd>Hostile has entirely different meaning than criticism and opposition. As research on the subject universally points out, the vast majority of anti-Americanism is criticism and opposition.

<dd>Christina's definition may be characterised as "ostensive". Which makes sense since "the term is difficult to define verbally, either because the words will not be understood or because of the nature of the term". The "intensional" definition previously attempted was vague, unauthoritative and in part self-contradictory, as has been pointed out to you numerous times by now.</dd>

<dd>And on what basis have you decided "sentiment" is better? Every one of your cites uses "-ism". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:39, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO (and, contrary to certain insinuations, I cannot speak for others), the "-ism" is misleading. People might infer that it implies "a school of thought" which it doesn't. At least not necessarily. Rkrichbaum 11:56, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Last things, first: if every one of our sources uses "-ism", then we to use it to. You can't cherry-pick the terminology that suits your POV. The book cover <i>says Anti-Americanism</i> (hey wow, matches our article title) and it has a picture of an American flag being burnt, which is indeed a common symbol of Anti-American protest. There are 100-odd pics here <a href="http://www.theodora.com/flags/burning/flag_burning_32.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theodora.com/flags/burning/flag_burning_32.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> that you might check.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So the book cover repeats the title and the first word of the first paragraph. How is this overredundancy useful? It has a picture, presumably a collage produced by a graphics artist, depicting a symbolic act of disrespect, with connotations of violence and gloom. I have been at many protests, also against US policies, and there was never an American flag being burnt. In Europe, at least, this is not a "common form of protest" against the US. I realize that elsewhere they seem to like burning up stuff more often, be it effigies or whatever, but the flag burning seems to be mostly an issue in the US, with the proposed law against it and so on. I do not put much stake in this, but what I most dislike about this picture is that it is unspecific and not authentic. Why not take a real photo of a real protest and explain what the protest was about? Rkrichbaum 13:22, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>How was the old line less vague? It matches the dic-defs and, no, there was no self-contradiction. Now we have: "...is a sentiment against the United States." This isn't ostensive--it's non-denotative to the point of being trivial. I don't understand what the problem with "hostile" is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look at dict definition of hostile, it's pretty different from opposing. As stated by your sources, majority of those anti-American opinion do not have anything fundamental against U.S. itself: they just oppose U.S. political policies since 2000-2001.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristinam_ebaf.html" title="User:Christinam">Christinam</a> 22:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The lead is supposed to be summative; this lead is a grab-bag of details.</p>
<p>And I'm not going to take the bait on use of the term in the 19th century.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How about this?</span></h2>
<p>Expanded beginning: User:Marskell/AA. There's some good new info here, such as first use of the term and the long excerpt from Philippe Roger is definitely a plus. To anticipate the first objection, "irrational" is sourced to Hollander--in fact, the title of the book is <i>Anti-Americanism:Irrational and rational</i>. O'Conner calls it the the "most detailed study" of the topic so I think it's a fair source, though no, I haven't read it. Basically, any theoretical angle on the topic gets a mention in this intro. The "use of the term" is just that--etymology and deployment in context.</p>
<p>Oh, and to be clear about one thing: everything Christina added is still here under "The world at large" (come up with a better section heading if you like). In fact, I expanded it slightly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:38, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am going to revert to Christina's last version. The current definition still leaves much to be desired whereas Christina's last version is concise, easier to understand and omits unnecessary attempts of defining something that cannot be easily defined, and references that do not fit, apperently.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<p><i>"Contemporary analysis of anti-Americanism typically focuses on ...</i></p>
<p>Superfluous - it is enough to say what it focuses upon, nobody is interested that "contemporary analysis of aA tpically" does.</p>
<p><i>"Interpretations of anti-Americanism have often been polarized. It has been described as an undifferentiated [1] ..."</i></p>
<p>Rubinstein/Smith do not say that the "phenomenon" of anti-Americanism is undifferentiated, they say that only attitudes that are part and parcel of an "undifferentiated attack" on the US etc should be considered anti-American (presumably in the the context of their study).</p>
<p><i>"... and irrational phenomenon [2] that configures the United States and the American way of life as threatening in their entirety [3]."</i></p>
<p>Caesar does not say that anti-Americanism configures the US and the Awol as "threatening in their entirety". He says it configures "something associated with" the United States, something "at the core of American life", is deeply wrong and threatening."</p>
<p>When it is further mentioned that <i>"the term merely signifies a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices and criticisms towards Americans or the United States [4]."</i> it should also be mentioned that the term has also been described as "la lutte contre un système, contre une conception de l'homme et d'un mode de vie." (Roger Garaudy, Qu’est-ce que l’anti-américanisme&#160;? <a href="http://www.philosophie.org/garaudy1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.philosophie.org/garaudy1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.philosophie.org/garaudy1.html</a>).

<p>Let me try to explain this in a different way. The question in this article goes like this: Is Anti-Americanism something of unknown origin that exists <i>independently of the policies and real attributes of the United States</i>, or is it a pejorative label applied to criticism of the U.S. to try and discredit that criticism? To use that photo--a protest against U.S. <i>policy</i>--in the article is to clearly support the second position. I called it <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> because even if you provide links to opinion pieces about Gitmo and hostility to the USA, you are still using them to synthesize an interpretation of the term 'Anti-Americanism' that is not, to my knowledge, mentioned in any of those sources, however "overwhelming" they might be. --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada"><font color="red">█♣█</font></a> ▪ <a href="../../../r/e/h/User_talk%7ERehpotsirhc_1b9c.html" title="User talk:Rehpotsirhc">Talk</a></sup> 17:46, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just don't see that. We show the photo and say "some people think Gitmo has contributed to hostility towards the US, which may be seen as a compoment of 'anti-American sentiment' [cite]". All we need is a source saying that Gitmo has contributed to anti-Americanism -- there must be 100s. Of course different people have different views on what anti-Americanism <i>is</i>, or even whether it exists as something coherent.

Here is one I found after a couple of minutes gooling <a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/worldandus/archives/2005/02/the_economist_p_1.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/worldandus/archives/2005/02/the_economist_p_1.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<dd>I read and understood your comment. You might want to note that the source you posted doesn't appear to actually discuss the concept of Gitmo in the context of the term Anti-Americanism, but the issue of sources is periphial anyway. The picture, sourced or not, simply unbalances the article. The article is not about anyone and everyone who disagrees with one or more policies of the United States for whatever reason. It is about a specific type of opposition that exists outside of the realm of policy, the existence of which is fiercely debated. The inclusion of the picture amounts to a very strong stance in that debate. --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada"><font color="red">█♣█</font></a> ▪ <a href="../../../r/e/h/User_talk%7ERehpotsirhc_1b9c.html" title="User talk:Rehpotsirhc">Talk</a></sup> 22:54, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Democrats in Europe and elsewhere who once thought religiosity, a belief in capital punishment and rank hostility to the United Nations were intermittent or diminishing features of the United States now see them as rising and perhaps permanent. Such feelings have been fortified by Mr Bush’s doctrine of preventive war, <b>----&gt; Guantánamo &lt;----</b>, opposition to the world criminal court and a host of other international agreements. One way or another, it is said, people are turning off America, not so much to hate it as to look for other examples to follow—even Europe’s.

I just don't see how having the picture -- together with an appropriate source -- unbalances the article. Recent developments which may increase anti-American sentiment <i>according to some people</i> are perfectly appropriate in the article on anti-Americanism. Unless you think that we shouldn't give any specific examples at all? The article is full of references to far more minor influences on public opinion (e.g. American English usage). I will give up eventually, I just honestly don't understand quite what you're getting at. Regarding sourcing, you're shifting your ground. First it's OR becuase there's not source linking Gitmo to anti-Americanism, and that's why we can't have it (your comment at 18:08). Apparently now we can't have it even if it isn't OR.

<dd>You're right--there has been a lot of shifting around in this discussion, and it isn't helping to make what is admittedly a pretty fine point any clearer. So let me establish something first: my objection is to the inclusion of the photo, not the information. A picture creates a powerful impression that it is hard to "take back" with words, and so has a special capacity to unbalance an article. Please don't try and apply my argument to any text or other things that are not a photo.</dd>

<dd>Now, let's forget about OR for a second. The idea that Anti-Americanism is something that can be increased or decreased by the policies of the United States is itself both a matter of debate and a central theme of the article. Labeling the photo 'Anti-Americanism,' as I said, is taking a clear side in this debate. Including the photo without this claim is more subtle, but equally harmful. When a reader unfamiliar with the term and the debate scrolls down to the subhead, he will see the photo (which will be assumed to be an example of Anti-Americanism whether or not it is labeled, sourced, disclaimed, weasel-worded, or whatever) and this will foster an impression that Anti-Americanism is simply criticism of the US or its policies. The fact is, most people who use the term use it in an entirely different sense that has little or nothing to do with policy. This is why inclusion of the photo is unbalancing regardless of whether or not any claims in its caption are sourced.</dd>

<dd>To go back to what I said about OR--I think if you'll take a second look at your source, you'll see that it is unsuitable to be used to address the question of whether or not the protest qualifies as Anti-Americanism. You'll need a little more than cameos from the words 'Guantanamo' and Anti-Americanism'. Earlier, I was doing a poor job of saying that if you actually find a source that discusses this, I feel like I might be more receptive to the picture's inclusion, WITHOUT the caption that arbitrarily labels it Anti-Americanism. But this feeling of mine is mitigated by extreme doubt that you'll ever find such a source. It seems as if the reason you're so confident that you're going to find this source--that discusses Gitmo <b>in the context of Anti-Americanism</b>--is because you're simply replacing the term 'Anti-Americanism' with something along the lines of 'criticism of the United States' in your mind, which makes it almost self-evident that you will find it. What you are actually looking for is a study or opinion piece from a reputable source that argues Gitmo protests are an example of Anti-Americanism, without taking it for granted. --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada"><font color="red">█♣█</font></a> ▪ <a href="../../../r/e/h/User_talk%7ERehpotsirhc_1b9c.html" title="User talk:Rehpotsirhc">Talk</a></sup> 04:29, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I won't repeat what Rkrichbaum has said below. Regarding my source, <i>it does discuss Guantanamo in the context of anti-Americanism</i>! It lists several causes of anti-Americanism, in which Guantanamo is included. What more do you want? Also, the caption does not "label" any anti-Americanism (or at least it need not). It would say that "Some people [cite] think that Guantanamo has contributed to anti-Americanism". <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 18:41, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Why the Guantanamo photo is not inappropriate</b></p>
<p>rehpotsirhc says: "The idea that Anti-Americanism is something that can be increased or decreased by the policies of the United States is itself both a matter of debate and a central theme of the article. Labeling the photo 'Anti-Americanism,' ... is taking a clear side in this debate."</p>
<p>This interpretation of the images' content and function seems to be lacking. Let's approach this from a neutral POV. What is depicted here is a reenactment of a scene: prisoners of war in a typical subdued position and clad in prisoner garment typical either for the Guantánamo camp (or similar facilities e. g. Abu Ghraib) or rather for prisoners on their way there. The viewer will immediately recognise this from press fotos that show such prisoners in similar clothes and positions.</p>
<p>How does this refer to "Anti-Americanism"?</p>
<p>First, the captives are held because of their suspected actions and/or attitudes that are "Anti-American". Whether or not these anti-American attitudes and actions are rational or irrational, maybe based on concepts and views that configure the US and the American way of life as threatening, is subject to debate and analysis by experts and commentators. The picture does not make any comment on this either way. The reenactment simply demonstrates goings-on that are undisputed. Goings-on that are clearly related to the (at least suspected) anti-American activities of the Afghan or Arab POW in Guantánamo. (Reputable sources in support of the view that they are anti-American can be provided.)</p>
<p>Second, the reenactment is a protest by anti-American protesters. Whether or not these anti-American protesters act rationally or irrationally, maybe based on concepts and views that configure the US and the American way of life as threatening at its core, is subject to debate and analysis by experts and commentators. One commentator e.g. ascribes "antipathy for the US" as a motive to those with "defense of democracy agendas" that seek legal action against the US for her treatment of prisoners in Guantánamo:</p>
<p><i>"Or consider the assault on our terrorist incarceration center at Guantanamo Bay. (...) According to The New York Times white shoe law firms have been mobilized by anti-American radical and lifelong advocate of Communist causes Michael Ratner to obstruct America's war effort and attempt to free the soldiers of the enemy.</i> (...)</p>
<p><i>The shared antipathy for the United States between open self-declared enemies like Galloway and Zarqawi and "liberals" who detest both is what allows liberals -- like the Wall Street lawyers mobilized by Ratner -- to be recruited to the destructive agendas of the anti-American jihad.</i></p>
<p><i>As noted, their entrance into the jihad is through such defense of democracy agendas as the abuses at Abu Ghraib (...), the detaining of al-Qaeda terrorists at Guantanamo and the effort to strengthen internal security controls."</i> <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18223" class="external free" title="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18223" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18223</a></p>
<p>Third, nowhere in the image is a clue to the effect that "anti-Americanism" might change if policies of the US are being changed.</p>
<p>Therefore it is impossible to conclude that the image, or using it as an illustration for "anti-Americanism", takes a stance in the discussion whether or not "anti-Americanism" can be characterised as rational criticism or irrational prejudice.</p>
<p><br />
As to the possibility of increasing or decreasing anti-American sentiment by changing US policies, the image itself does not contain any clues in favor of either position. People who use the term in a sense that has little or nothing to do with policy might argue that the anti-American protester will quickly find another topic once the camps are closed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what has emerged from Guantanomo may have increased anti-American sentiment. At least claims to this effect have been made by reputable sources that can be cited:</p>
<p>"<i>Testimonials and photographs of atrocities emerging from Guantánamo feed anti-American sentiment.</i> 'Guantánamo provides rhetorical fodder for politicians seeking to bring down United States-allied rulers in their own countries,' the New York Times reported. 'It offers a ready rallying point against American dominance, even in countries whose own police and military have been known for severe violations of human rights.'" Marjorie Cohn, professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, President-elect of the National Lawyers Guild, and the US representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists. <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/052305B.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/052305B.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/052305B.shtml</a> Rkrichbaum 17:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rkrichbaum, I think you misunderstand my argument. You said: "the reenactment is a protest by anti-American protesters." In other words, you just asserted the protestors are Anti-American without question, when my point is precisely that it is very debatable whether or not those protestors are part of the phemonenon known as Anti-Americanism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let's examine what we know about these protestors. We know that they oppose a policy of the United States--the detainment of captives at Gitmo; our knowledge ends there. So is this Anti-Americanism? <b>Only if Anti-Americanism is simply criticism of the United States</b>, outlined by the article as one POV. If Anti-Americanism is the phemonenon described by Revel and most of the other sources for the article, if it doubtful that the Gitmo protests would be classified under it, because they are simply a manifestation of criticism of policy--and only one policy at that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe you didn't read carefully and missed the quote of a noted commentator who described critics of the practices in Guantánamo as participants in an "anti-American jihad". I did not assert anything, my account was merely descriptive. As I pointed out earlier, a widely accepted scholarly definition of "Anti-Americanism" within the realms of political science does not exist. Semantically, the term denotes attitudes and activities in opposition or hostile to (anti = against) the US (government, e.g.). Protests against policies (and no, it is not "only one policy", how did you reach that conclusion? A whole bunch of issues are involved here: torture, due process, detainment of foreign nationals, invasions without UN authorisation; more generally: role of the military, self-assertive attitude of the US on international stage, etc. etc.) that are well known and debated worldwide are often characterised as anti-American. More specific characterisations are subject to debate among experts and commentators, as I noted above. Rkrichbaum 12:00, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
