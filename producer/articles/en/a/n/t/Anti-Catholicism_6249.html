	    <p><b>Anti-Catholicism</b> is <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>, hostility or <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">prejudice</a> directed at Catholics or the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, which can range in expression from individual <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatred.html" title="Hatred">hatred</a> to institutionalized, violent <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution.html" title="Persecution">persecution</a>. The term also applies to the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution.html" title="Religious persecution">religious persecution</a> of Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>In the early Modern period, the Roman Catholic Church struggled to maintain its role in the face of rising secular power in Europe. As a result of these struggles and public reaction to ecclesiastic corruption such as sale of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indulgence.html" title="Indulgence">indulgences</a>, there arose a hostile attitude towards the power of the Pope and the Roman Catholic clergy. This hostility is referred to as "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-clericalism.html" title="Anti-clericalism">anti-clericalism</a>". To this was added the epochal crisis over its spiritual authority represented by the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> giving rise to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarianism.html" title="Sectarianism">sectarian</a> conflict. In contemporary times anti-Catholicism has assumed various forms, including persection of Catholics as religious minorities, assaults by governments upon Catholic faithful, discrimination, and virulent attacks on clergy and laity.</p>

<p>Beginning with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> Protestants attacked the Pope as representing the power of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Christ_9bb9.html" title="Anti-Christ">Anti-Christ</a> and the Roman Catholic Church as the <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whore_of_Babylon_ec5d.html" title="Whore of Babylon">Whore of Babylon</a> prophesised in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelations_885a.html" title="Book of Revelations">Book of Revelations</a>.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>25.6. There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ: nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is that Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition, that exalts himself in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God.</i></dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Edit section: England">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">England</span></h4>
<p>Anti-Catholicism in England has its origins with the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Reformation_c56d.html" title="English Reformation">English Reformation</a> under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>. The <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Supremacy_cf2e.html" title="Act of Supremacy">Act of Supremacy</a> of 1534 declared the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_crown.html" title="English crown">English crown</a> to be 'the only supreme head on earth of the Church in England' in place of the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>. Any act of allegiance to the latter was considered treason. It was under this act that saints <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_More_90f1.html" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fisher_3323.html" title="John Fisher">John Fisher</a> were executed.</p>
<p>Although the Act of Supremacy was repealed in 1554 by Henry's daughter, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary I</a>, who was a staunch Roman Catholic, it was reenacted in 1559 under <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who took public or church office was forced to take the <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath_of_Supremacy_13f0.html" title="Oath of Supremacy">Oath of Supremacy</a>, and there were penalties for violating that oath. Attendance at Anglican services was also made obligatory. Those that refused were fined as <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recusant.html" title="Recusant">recusants</a>.</p>
<p>In the time of Elizabeth I, the persecution of the Protestants during the reign of her half-sister <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Mary_I_1795.html" title="Queen Mary I">Queen Mary I</a> was used as anti-Catholic propaganda in the hugely influential <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs_5a46.html" title="Foxe's Book of Martyrs">Foxe's Book of Martyrs</a>. The Convocation of the English Church ordered in 1571 that copies of the "Book of Martyrs" should be kept for public inspection in all cathedrals and in the houses of church dignitaries. The book was also exposed in many parish churches alongside the Holy Bible. The passionate intensity of the style and the vivid and picturesque dialogues made it very popular among Puritan and Low Church families down to the nineteenth century. The fantastically partisan church history of the earlier portion of the book, with its grotesque stories of popes and monks contributed much to anti-Catholic prejudices in England as did the story of the sufferings of those Protestants burnt at the stake by Mary and the notorious <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Bonner_e7bc.html" title="Edmund Bonner">Bishop Bonner</a>.</p>
<p>In 1570, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_V_cc8c.html" title="Pope Pius V">Pope Pius V</a> sought to depose Elizabeth with the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_bull.html" title="Papal bull">papal bull</a> <i><a href="../../../r/e/g/Regnans_in_Excelsis_e186.html" title="Regnans in Excelsis">Regnans in Excelsis</a></i>, which declared her a heretic and purported to release her Roman Catholic subjects from allegiance to her. This rendered Elizabeth's subjects who persisted in allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church politically suspect.</p>
<p>The failed invasion of England by the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Armada_a625.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> has been cited as an attempt by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> to put into effect the Pope's decree, and to enforce a claim to the throne of England he held as a result of being the widower of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary I of England</a>.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's persecution of Roman Catholic <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionaries.html" title="Missionaries">missionaries</a> led to many executions at <a href="../../../t/y/b/Tyburn.html" title="Tyburn">Tyburn</a>. Those priests who suffered there are accounted <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrs.html" title="Martyrs">martyrs</a> by the Roman Catholic church; and, more recently, a convent has been established nearby to pray for their souls.</p>
<p>Later episodes that deepened anti-Catholicism in England include the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder_Plot_714f.html" title="Gunpowder Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>, in which <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Fawkes_ff0e.html" title="Guy Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> and other Roman Catholic conspirators attempted to blow up the English Parliament while it was in session. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_London_0aa9.html" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire of London</a> in 1666 was blamed on the Roman Catholics and an inscription ascribing it to 'Popish frenzy' was engraved on the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monument_to_the_Great_Fire_of_London_d999.html" title="Monument to the Great Fire of London">Monument to the Great Fire of London</a>, which marked the location where the fire started (this inscription was only removed in 1831). Later, the "<a href="../../../p/o/p/Popish_Plot_2e18.html" title="Popish Plot">Popish Plot</a>" involving <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titus_Oates_d8da.html" title="Titus Oates">Titus Oates</a> further exacerbated Anglican-Roman Catholic relations.</p>
<p>The beliefs that underlie the sort of strong anti-Catholicism once seen in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> were summarized by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blackstone_f558.html" title="William Blackstone">William Blackstone</a> in his <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England_e5f9.html" title="Commentaries on the Laws of England">Commentaries on the Laws of England</a></i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As to papists, what has been said of the Protestant dissenters would hold equally strong for a general toleration of them; provided their separation was founded only upon difference of opinion in religion, and their principles did not also extend to a subversion of the civil government. If once they could be brought to renounce the supremacy of the pope, they might quietly enjoy their seven sacraments, their purgatory, and auricular confession; their worship of relics and images; nay even their transubstantiation. But while they acknowledge a foreign power, superior to the sovereignty of the kingdom, they cannot complain if the laws of that kingdom will not treat them upon the footing of good subjects.

<p>The gravamen of this charge, then, is that Roman Catholics constitute an <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html#I" title="List of Latin phrases">imperium in imperio</a></i>, a sort of <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_column.html" title="Fifth column">fifth column</a> of persons who owe a greater allegiance to the Pope than they do to the civil government, a charge very similar to that repeatedly leveled against <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>. Accordingly, a large body of British laws, collectively known as the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_law.html" title="Penal law">penal laws</a>, imposed various civil disabilities and legal penalties on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recusant.html" title="Recusant">recusant</a> Roman Catholics. These laws were gradually repealed over the course of the nineteenth century with laws such as the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Emancipation_Act_29a4.html" title="Catholic Emancipation Act">Catholic Emancipation Act</a> of 1829.</p>
<p>In spite of the Emancipation Act, however, anti-Catholic feeling continued throughout the nineteenth century, primarily as a response to the influx of Irish immigrants into England during the Great Famine</p>
<p>Even now, however, a member of the British Royal Family automatically gives up his chances of succeeding to the throne when marrying a Roman Catholic. (Note that this only applies to Roman Catholic partners.)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ireland's Roman Catholic majority has been subject to persecution from the time of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Reformation_c56d.html" title="English Reformation">English Reformation</a> under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>. This persecution intensified when the Gaelic clan system was completely <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_re-conquest_of_Ireland_f2a6.html" title="Tudor re-conquest of Ireland">destroyed by the governments of Elizabeth I</a> and her successor, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_83ee.html" title="James I">James I</a>. Under the impact of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_Laws_82c5.html" title="Penal Laws">Penal Laws</a> and the Plantations of the 16th and 17th centuries, a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Ascendancy_791b.html" title="Protestant Ascendancy">Protestant Ascendancy</a> was established. The lands belonging to the former Clan chieftains were seized by the Crown and distributed to a new class of Protestant landowners from Britain.</p>
<p>In order to cement the power of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Ascendancy_791b.html" title="Protestant Ascendancy">Protestant Ascendancy</a>, political and land-owning rights were denied to Ireland's Roman Catholics by law. Violent persecution also resulted, leading to the torture and execution of many Catholics, both clergy and laymen. Many have since been <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonization.html" title="Canonization">canonised</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatification.html" title="Beatification">beatified</a> by the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican.html" title="Vatican">Vatican</a>, such as Saint <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Plunkett_4fab.html" title="Oliver Plunkett">Oliver Plunkett</a>, Blessed <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermot_O%27Hurley_583f.html" title="Dermot O'Hurley">Dermot O'Hurley</a>, and Blessed <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Ball_65a1.html" title="Margaret Ball">Margaret Ball</a>.</p>
<p>Centuries of government policies, as well as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> groups such as the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Order_4694.html" title="Orange Order">Orange Order</a> continued to enforce Protestant dominance. Although the Protestant Ascendancy was overturned in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_628e.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> (later the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_Of_Ireland_0274.html" title="Republic Of Ireland">Republic Of Ireland</a>) when this State was created in 1921, it has continued to persist in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. This has resulted in the present day sectarian conflict between Protestants and Catholics there (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a>).</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Reformation_0a02.html" title="Scottish Reformation">Scottish Reformation</a> resulted in Scotland's conversion to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> through the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>. This resulted in an intense hatred of anything affiliated with Roman Catholicism in the centuries since. Violent persecution has periodically broken out, leading to events such as the torture and execution of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John_Ogilvie_c9aa.html" title="Saint John Ogilvie">Saint John Ogilvie</a>, a <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest.</p>
<p>For several centuries, the very existance of Catholicism in Scotland was treated as a blemish upon national honor. Movements such as the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanters.html" title="Covenanters">covenanters</a> and the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> continued to instil a strong Protestant, anti-Catholic view upon both the public and the State. In the last 150 years, Irish immigration to Scotland increased dramatically and as a result prejudice has grown as Scots have been exposed to Roman Catholics. The growth of the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Order_4694.html" title="Orange Order">Orange Order</a> underlines the religious prejudice, especially in the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> area.</p>

<p>John Highham described anti-Catholic bigotry as "the most luxuriant, tenacious tradition of paranoiac agitation in American history".<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The bigotry which was prominent in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> was exported to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society. The first, derived from the heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the sixteenth century, consisted of the "Anti-Christ" and the "Whore of Babylon" variety and dominated anti-Catholic thought until the late seventeenth century. The second was a more secular variety which focused on the supposed intrigue of the Roman Catholics intent on extending medieval despotism worldwide.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Historian <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Schlesinger_Sr._6f23.html" title="Arthur Schlesinger Sr.">Arthur Schlesinger Sr.</a> called anti-Catholicism "the deepest-held bias in the history of the American people."</p>
<p>The roots of American anti-Catholicism go back to the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, whose ideas about Rome and the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papacy.html" title="Papacy">papacy</a> traveled to the New World with the earliest settlers. These settlers were, of course, predominantly Protestant. A large part of American culture is a legacy of Great Britain, and an enormous part of its religious culture a legacy of the English Reformation. Monsignor John Tracy Ellis, in his landmark book American Catholicism, first published in 1956, wrote bluntly that a "universal anti-Catholic bias was brought to Jamestown in 1607 and vigorously cultivated in all the thirteen colonies from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>." Proscriptions against <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholics.html" title="Catholics">Catholics</a> were included in colonial charters and laws, and, as Monsignor Ellis noted wryly, nothing could bring together warring <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> ministers and <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> divines faster than their common hatred of the church of Rome. Such antipathy continued throughout the 18th century. Indeed, the virtual penal status of the Catholics in the colonies made even the appointment of bishops unthinkable in the early years of the Republic.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jay_7ffe.html" title="John Jay">John Jay</a> in 1788 urged the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> legislature to require officeholders to renounce foreign authorities "in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil." <a href="http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/annotation/march-2002/religion-founding-fathers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/annotation/march-2002/religion-founding-fathers.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Anti-Catholic animus in the United States reached a peak in the nineteenth century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the influx of Roman Catholic immigrants. The resulting "nativist" movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, was whipped into a frenzy of anti-Catholicism that led to mob violence, the burning of Roman Catholic property, and the killing of Roman Catholics. The nativist movement found expression in a national political movement called the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Know-Nothing_Party_f9e0.html" title="Know-Nothing Party">Know-Nothing Party</a> of the 1850s, which (unsuccessfully) ran former president <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millard_Fillmore_5e1f.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> as its presidential candidate in 1856. Similar sentiment was also manifested in the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. The case of the murder of Father <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Coyle_dcfe.html" title="James Coyle">James Coyle</a>, although also motivated by ethnic bigotry, was a prime example of anti-Catholic violence in the US.</p>
<p>In 1834, lurid tales of sexual slavery and infanticide in convents prompted the burning of an Ursuline convent in Charlestown, Mass., setting off nearly two decades of violence against Catholics. The resulting anti-Catholic riots (which included the burning of churches), were largely centered in the major urban centers of the country and led to the creation of the nativist Know-Nothing Party in 1854, whose platform included a straightforward condemnation of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>By 1850 Catholics had become the country’s largest single religious denomination. And between 1860 and 1890 the population of Catholics in the United States tripled through immigration; by the end of the decade it would reach seven million. This influx, largely Irish, which would eventually bring increased political power for the Catholic Church and a greater cultural presence, led at the same time to a growing fear of the Catholic "menace." The American Protective Association, for example, formed in Iowa in 1887, sponsored popular countrywide tours of supposed ex-priests and "escaped" nuns, who concocted horrific tales of mistreatment and abuse.</p>
<p>As the nineteenth century wore on animosity waned, as Protestant Americans realized that Roman Catholics were not trying to seize control of the government. Nonetheless, fears continued into the twentieth century that there was too much "Catholic influence" on the government, and presidents who met with the pope were criticized.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Nevertheless, the powerful influence of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and other nativist organizations were typical of still-potent anti-Catholic sentiments.</p>
<p>During the 20th century, suspicion of the political aims and agenda of the Roman Catholic Church have been revived several times.</p>
<p>In 1928 the presidential candidacy of <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Smith_22a8.html" title="Al Smith">Al Smith</a> was greeted with a fresh wave of anti-Catholic hysteria that contributed to his defeat. (It was widely rumored at the time that with the election of Mr. Smith the pope would take up residence in the White House and Protestants would find themselves stripped of their citizenship.)</p>
<p>In 1949, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Blanshard_68d0.html" title="Paul Blanshard">Paul Blanshard</a>'s book <i>American Freedom and Catholic Power</i> portrayed the Roman Catholic Church as an anti-democratic force hostile to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_religion.html" title="Freedom of religion">religion</a>, eager to impose itself on the United States by <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott.html" title="Boycott">boycott</a> and subterfuge</p>
<p>As Charles R. Morris noted in his recent book American Catholic, the real mainstreaming of the church did not occur until the 1950’s and 1960’s, when educated Catholics—sons and daughters of immigrants—were finally assimilated into the larger culture. Even so, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> was confronted during <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1960_d54d.html" title="United States presidential election, 1960">his 1960 presidential campaignn</a> with old anti-Catholic biases. He eventually felt compelled to address explicitly concerns of his supposed "allegiance" to the pope. Many Protestant leaders, such as Norman Vincent Peale, publicly opposed the candidacy because of Kennedy’s religion. And after the election, survey research by political scientists found that Kennedy had indeed lost votes because of his religion.</p>

<p>Catholicism in Poland, the religion of the vast majority of the population, was persecuted under the Communist regime from the 1950s. Current Stalinist ideology claimed the Church and religion in general was about to disintegrate. To begin with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Cardinal_Wyszy%C5%84ski_1ed2.html" title="Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński">Archbishop Wyszyński</a> entered into an agreement with the Communist authorities, which was signed on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">14 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> by the Polish episcopate and the government. The Agreement regulated the matters of the Church in Poland. However in May of that year, the Sejm breached the Agreement by passing a law for the confiscation of Church property.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">12 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, Wyszyński was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pius XII as another wave of persecution began in Poland. When the bishops voiced their opposition to state interference in ecclesiastical appointments, mass trials and the internment of priests began - the cardinal being among the number of its victims. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">25 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> he was imprisoned at Grudziądz, and later placed under house arrest in monasteries in Prudnik near Opole and in Komańcza in the Bieszczady Mountains. He was not released until <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">26 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he never stopped his religious and social work. Its crowning achievement was the celebration of Poland's Millennium of Christianity in 1966 - the thousandth anniversary of the baptism of Poland's first prince, Mieszko I. During the celebration, the Communist authorities refused to allow <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_VI_4529.html" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a> to visit Poland; they also prevented Cardinal Wyszyński from attending overseas celebrations. Wyszyński triumphed in 1978, when Karol Cardinal Wojtyla of Krakow was elected <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>, followed by a spectacular papal visit to Poland in 1979. Cardinal Wyszyński did not turn a blind eye on the civil unrest in 1980. When the Solidarity trade union was created in Poland, he showed his anxiety for the welfare of the people and peace in the country by appealing to both sides, the government as well as the striking workers, to be responsible for their actions and their consequences.</p>
<p>Cardinal Wyszyński, often called the Primate of the Millennium, died on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">28 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> at the age of 79. Throughout his life, he always attached much importance to his fellow human being. Not only did he preach that honour and conscience are the most important values, he also bore witness to this with his social involvement and great patriotism. He is regarded as one of the greatest moral authorities of the 20th century. To commemorate the twentieth anniversary of his death, the year 2001 was celebrated as the Year of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński.</p>
<p>In 2000 a motion picture was made about the life and imprisonment of Wyszyński entitled "The Primate - Three Years Out of a Thousand", directed by Teresa Kotlarczyk. The title role was played by Andrzej Seweryn.</p>
<p>In the CBS miniseries Pope John Paul II (based upon the life of the Polish pope), Cardinal Wyszyński was portrayed by English actor Christopher Lee.</p>

<p>Anti-Catholic stereotypes are a long-standing feature of Anglo-Saxon literary, sub-literary and even pornographic traditions. <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_fiction.html" title="Gothic fiction">Gothic fiction</a> is particularly rich in this regard with the figure of the lustful priest, the cruel abbess, the immured nun and the sadistic inquisitor appearing in such works as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Italian_f8b8.html" title="The Italian">The Italian</a></i> by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Radcliffe_6914.html" title="Anne Radcliffe">Anne Radcliffe</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Monk_457c.html" title="The Monk">The Monk</a></i> by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Lewis_fb60.html" title="Matthew Lewis">Matthew Lewis</a>, <i><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melmoth_the_Wanderer_567c.html" title="Melmoth the Wanderer">Melmoth the Wanderer</a></i> by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Maturin_c846.html" title="Charles Maturin">Charles Maturin</a> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pit_and_the_Pendulum_3606.html" title="The Pit and the Pendulum">The Pit and the Pendulum</a></i> by <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such gothic fiction may have inspired <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Reed_8397.html" title="Rebecca Reed">Rebecca Reed</a>'s <i>Six Months in a Convent</i> which describes her alleged captivity by an Ursuline order near Boston in 1832 <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>Her claims inspired an angry mob to burn down the convent, and her narrative, released three years later as the rioters were tried, famously sold 200,000 copies in one month. In another bestselling fraudulent exposé, <i>Awful Disclosures of the Hotel-Dieu Nunnery</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Monk_0626.html" title="Maria Monk">Maria Monk</a> claimed that the convent served as a harem for Roman Catholic <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priests</a>, and that any resulting children were murdered after baptism. Col. William Stone, a New York city newspaper editor, along with a team of Protestant investigators, made inquiry into the claims of Monk, inspecting the convent in the process. Col. Stone's investigation concluded there was no evidence that Maria Monk "had ever been within the walls of the cloister".</p>
<p>Reed's book became a best-seller, and Monk or her handlers hoped to cash in on the evident market for anti-Catholic horror fiction by their offering. The tale of Maria Monk was, in fact, clearly modelled on the gothic novels that were popular in the early 19th century, a literary genre that had already been used for anti-Catholic sentiments in works such as Matthew Lewis' The Monk. Monk's story explores the genre-defining elements of a young, innocent woman being trapped in a remote, old, and gloomily picturesque estate; she learns the dark secrets the place contains, and after harrowing adventures makes her escape. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Catholic church has been a target for satire and humor, from the time of the Reformation to the present day. Such satire and humor ranges from mild burlesque to vicious attacks. Catholic clergy and lay organizations such as the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_League_%28U.S.%29_0b27.html" title="Catholic League (U.S.)">Catholic League</a> monitor for particularly offensive and derogatory incidences and voice their objections and protests.</p>

The Roman Catholic Church's doctrines, the priest sex abuse scandal, and "idolising saints" were top issues for those who disapproved.

<p>According to James Martin, S.J. the U.S. entertainment industry is of "two minds" about the Catholic Church. He argues that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the one hand, film and television producers seem to find Catholicism irresistible. There are a number of reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes - to say nothing of the symbols of the sacraments - are all things that more "word oriented" Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of film and television. You can be sure that any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue. (See, for example, <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_Days_054c.html" title="End of Days"><i>End of Days</i></a>, <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma_%28film%29.html" title="Dogma (film)"><i>Dogma</i></a> or <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stigmata_%28film%29.html" title="Stigmata (film)"><i>Stigmata</i></a>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, the Catholic Church is still seen as profoundly "other" in modern culture and is therefore an object of continuing fascination. As already noted, it is ancient in a culture that celebrates the new, professes truths in a postmodern culture that looks skeptically on any claim to truth, and speaks of mystery in a rational, postEnlightenment world. It is therefore the perfect context for scriptwriters searching for the "conflict" required in any story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin argues that, despite this irresistible fascination with the Catholic Church, the entertainment industry also holds the most obvious contempt for the Catholic Church. He suggests that, "It is as if producers, directors, playwrights and filmmakers feel obliged to establish their intellectual bona fides by trumpeting their differences with the institution that holds them in such thrall."</p>
<p>However, Martin suggests that "it is television that has proven the most fertile ground for anti-Catholic writing. Priests, when they appear on television shows, usually appear as pedophiles or idiots, and are rarely seen to be doing their jobs." <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&amp;textID=606&amp;issueID=281" class="external text" title="http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&amp;textID=606&amp;issueID=281" rel="nofollow">The Last Acceptable Prejudice</a></p>

<p>In October 2006, top Catholic leaders in the State of Minnesota took a rare step in collectively calling on University of Minnesota President Robert Bruininks to reconsider the university's plan to stage a controversial play that they viewed as anti-Catholic. "The Pope and the Witch", a satire depicting the pope as a paranoid, drug-addled idiot and the Vatican as corrupt, drew the ire this fall of a national Catholic group and some local bloggers. Archbishop Harry Flynn of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, along with bishops from Crookston to Winona, wrote to Bruininks calling the play offensive to the state's 1.6 million Catholics. They urged Bruininks to rethink the staging of the play in March 2007.</p>
<p>Dennis McGrath, spokesman for the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, said that he couldn't recall a time when the state's bishops had made such a combined request. The University has indicated that it has no plans to stop the play from being performed.<a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/local/15916107.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/local/15916107.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
