<dd>I think it works. Pretty. While it would be better to have many different voices, (which can be hard to gather, especially for a volunteer job, unless you have a nearby supply of talented graduate students you can tempt with wine and food) -- I think you can get a pretty good result this way. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 02:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My turn - sounds good enough for Wikipedia, though the bass - well, it's echoey. That's the only word. Sort of shallowly cavernous - oxymoron I know, but it's basically all right. How is this done, BTW? I'm intrigued, knowing virtually zilch about recording techniques. Press on!

<dd>Hm. Good enough for Wikipedia? Good enough to bother doing 40 more measures? (That was just one measure!) That's my real question. I agree with you on the bass. It's hollow and boomy sounding with no core, and the vowels are really off. I tried to do it so that if it weren't transposed it would be really bright, which helped a little bit, but it's still decidedly not right. I'll experiment with that part a bit more, see if I can do anything.</dd>
<dd>As for how I'm doing it, this is my first attempt at such things. Since I spent all my spare money on a lovely new Mac, since my PC died a horrible and untimely death, I didn't have extra money for, say, a good mike or fancy editing software, so I'm just using the computer's mic and <a href="../../../g/a/r/GarageBand_026a.html" title="GarageBand">GarageBand</a>. I think it worked reasonably well for A Chantar, but I don't <i>really</i> think the mic is good enough for when I get into my high range and let loose, but perhaps it'll do. The tuning is difficult to get right, though. When I sing completely alone in a dry room, especially out of my range, I tend to drift a little bit, since I don't have perfect pitch (I think most people do drift a little), so it was really difficult to get the first tracks in tune enough. I was trying to match pitch with my crummy keyboard at first, but that didn't work very well, since it's in a decidedly equal temperament, which is my least favorite thing to sing such music in. Once I got a couple of the voices laid out it was easy enough to stay in tune, but the tuning could still be better, I think. I'll keep playing with it. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 22:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just uploaded a new version (same link). It's a bit ragged, and has already drifted up a semi-tone... argh. Not sure what to do about that, I'll probably have to record it all again, but I think the bass and tenor sound a <i>lot</i> better. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 00:18, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds better, though, right? I'm trying it with a drone now, to see if I can stop the drifting, but 1) I'm tired now and 2) it sounds a bit straitjacketed, but that might just be because of 1. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 03:33, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(arbitrarily de-indenting) It <i>does</i> sound better, indeed. Are there times of day you prefer singing?

<dd>I like to sing on a day when I've slept in just a little, about an hour after a good brunch. For some reason those seem rarely to occur. I generally like to sing in the afternoon best, when I've properly woken up but am not exhausted yet. Yay! Weekend! Although I have to sing ungodly early every Sunday, which kinda cuts into the weekend to an unreasonable degree, but at least it's singing for money, so that's good. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 03:42, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Me again - it does sound a lot better, specially the bass. Definitely worth persevering with. The only I would say is that whatever equipment you're using does rather have a panic attack when your voice climbs up to hit whatever high note that is on "saison", though "Le courant" sounds fine.

<dd>1) Personally I don't like them. I think they're great on lizards and frogs and rock bands, but on composers? eh.

<dd>Well, indeed, it was truly wonderful! Somewhat surprisingly, though, there wasn't a single "early music" song on the whole concert! It was all "early American!!" Their sound is unearthly, regardless of WHAT music they're singing - it just transports you to another sphere somehow. Amazing. I succumbed &amp; bought both of their "early American" CD's. Ran into a guy who I'd sung shape-note music with, who I hadn't seen for ages. That was kind of neat - he's going to come to one of OUR concerts soon - I'm always recruiting! I want to add a couple of lines to their article about their branching out into American music, but not tonite!! <a href="../../../m/p/w/User%7EMpwrmnt_03dc.html" title="User:Mpwrmnt">Mpwrmnt</a> 10:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I had done everything up to the last 2 steps (edit/save). That's easy - I'll just do it myself next time. BUT it looks like at the same time they were vandalizing one choir, they were adding a link to another choir with an existing article, which was lost with your revert.

<p>Hello Antandrus, you've answered some questions for me before, and now I need your help again. I was told to write an essay on the origins of the orchestra, and my teacher sugested to include information about the king's 24 violins of Louis IV (of which I've found plenty of information) and also of the Dresden orchestra. Of the latter I have only found that it was created in the year of 1584, but i need to know more about its characteristics, what intruments it had, how many were they, what was their repertoire, what were their stylistic characteristics, etc. Thank you very much for all your help, sincerely, Charly. --Cha daniels 04:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would also strongly recommend looking at the history of the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venetian_school.html" title="Venetian school">Venetian school</a>, since they used a <i>lot</i> of instruments at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Marco_di_Venezia_ccc1.html" title="San Marco di Venezia">Saint Mark's</a>. Many people who trained and worked there moved elsewhere, especially Germany, and doubtless influenced what happened at Dresden (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Leo_Hassler_f9f4.html" title="Hans Leo Hassler">Hans Leo Hassler</a>, possibly, as well as others). A lot of the action in early large instrumental ensembles was in north Italy and Germany, especially before the <a href="../../../3/0/_/30_Years_War_0a32.html" title="30 Years War">30 Years War</a> shut everything down for most of the early 17th century. Look also at the orchestration for <a href="../../../o/r/f/Orfeo.html" title="Orfeo">Orfeo</a> for a good bit to write about (Monteverdi was at Venice for a while too...)

<dd>The article in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Grove_f9ac.html" title="New Grove">New Grove</a> on Dresden gives some good information; I see that the court of Saxony employed a lot of instrumentalists; indeed they may have been consciously competing with the Venetians some of the time. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 04:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While giving the article "Doorbell" a routine copy edit, I found that the version I started from—the latest version at that point—showed vestiges of vandalistic attention that had been lavished on it at different times. I looked into "History" and found, for instance, that "inside the building," which makes sense in connection with doorbells, had been changed to "inside the turkey," which does not, and had then become "inside the turnkey," which also does not but may have been provided by a well-meaning person.</p>
<p>A parallel sequence went like this: "In most wired systems..." to "In most sex positions..." to "In most set positions..." In both places, I've restored what I think should be there. I don't know much about doorbells or wiring, however, and I wonder whether the rest of the article is all right.</p>
<p>I'm posting here because your name came up in History as a dedicated reverter (sorry, but them who has gets, you know). The dates in History suggest that the Doorbell article may not be on anyone's watchlist. Do you know who the local doorbell expert is?

<dd>Thanks! Comparing Yuckfoo's version and mine, and assuming that Yuckfoo knows doorbells, it seems that the only remaining question is whether the last word should be "light" or "horn." Another part of the article says deaf people use a light as the signal.</dd>

<p>Can you discuss it with me on Warhol's Discussion page?? Thanks. Thanks. (I don't really, really, statataterrrrr)!! --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 05:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. No I have not seen any double portraint of Andy - its my own (obvious) idea. And the EMPTY SPACE in the article WITHOUT HIS 2ND IMAGE is HORRIBLE!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>i'M SURPRISED A NATURE LOVER LIKE YOU LIKES ANDY!!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, can you support me on this "goofy" idea? I do not think it goofy at all - unless you think him goofy! It's also, obviously, from FILM - Motion Pictures are merely slight variations of highly similar images! And Andy asleep, seems to wake up when we have a DOUBLE of him - one for each eye!!</p>

<dd>No, I,m not goofy myself - except for the fact that I think him a Media Genius, perhaps second only to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_McLuhan_b107.html" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>!&#160;! --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 06:18, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Antandrus, thank's for anwering so fast on the orchestration article, I posted another comment about expanding the article with basic things of Orchestration and some quotations from orchestration books.

<p>I'm sorry if I'm coming off as a SPAZ, but HOLY SHIT. Wikipedia is seriously run by anti-Islamic bigots. They just delete all my COMPLETELY VALID comments on the talk page for no reason at all. Well, only one reason, because they are anti-Islam and anti-Arab and do not want my comments to be given the light of day. Fuck wikipedia, why should I even bother registering at this site in which a contributor cannot even have his <i>comments</i> on a <i>talk page</i> seen before being deleted with no reason given.

<p>Hi, Antandrus. Can we sprotect Mauna Loa for a while? An entire section of the article was destroyed back on November 21, and no one noticed for a month!! This is crazy: one of our featured articles is being trashed under the weight of vandals.</p>

<dd>Thanks a lot. I've noticed that there is something about volcanoes that attracts wacko anon vandals. Are they volcano-phobes? I don't know. If it were up to me, I would leave all FA volcano articles permanently sprotected. This is less radical than making all articles (in effect) be sprotected.

<p>I took a hike to the top yesterday actually and took a picture from the exact same spot. I know where I took the picture for sure. I took it before I reached the top, so there's no way I was looking from the west. I think the pictures look the same, here it is...</p>

<p>Antandrus, may I ask you to have a look at my new page: <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenia_%28music%29.html" title="Parthenia (music)">Parthenia (music)</a>. This is my very first entire contribution to Wiki, and I would like to ensure that it 'conforms'. As a lover of this music like myself, and an experienced editor, I am sure you can improve on the layout or whatever is missing. 'Parthenia' was a serious lacuna in Wiki, and I'll now link the mentions in John Bull etc. to the new page. Any editing, comments, criticism, will be gratefully received.

<dd>I agree about LorenzoPerosi. Funny enough I have come across at least two other users who, in my opinion, are both a) very knowledgeable musicians making some excellent contributions and b) contentious and somewhat incivil editors. It is too bad! As for the Paulus article, I have set up a little project for myself to create/improve articles in that sphere, i.e. American composers/musicians I am fond of for one reason or another, like <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominick_Argento_42a8.html" title="Dominick Argento">Dominick Argento</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Taaffe_Zwilich_17a0.html" title="Ellen Taaffe Zwilich">Ellen Taaffe Zwilich</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliot_Forbes_0d0a.html" title="Elliot Forbes">Elliot Forbes</a>.

<p>You know, removal of false aligations from my talk page that isn't even posted by a Wikipedia personel is totally within my rights. And, subsequentally, I demand that it is removed. Demand because</p>
<p>A) It is a false allegation that was made by non-wikipedia personel B) You protected it in the first place C) I don't want it there</p>
<p>And, quite frankly, both locking and banning me was uncalled for.</p>
<p>At any time YOU COULD HAVE checked the validity of the claim (and I don't act like I understand how the notifications work, all I know is that placing a tag can put a page on a list). Isn't it your responsibility to verify a claim before making an action? Anyone could take an existing notification of ban and post it on another persons talk page. User:72.187.119.195</p>

<dd>The warnings on your talk page are quite appropriate, considering your unproductive and disruptive behavior. We are a project to build an encyclopedia, not a free-fire zone for trolling.

I don't really know a whole lot about Wikibooks, but maybe it's worth looking into?

<p><font color="black">Hi there, I was recently contacted by a user who I'd like to keep anonymous who says that his/her edits are being reverted unfairly, and the reason being that an admin is saing he is a sockpuppet even though I assume his edits were perfectly fine and not against Wikipedia Policy in any way, I've emailed him and he says he is going to send me links of these examples of unfair reversion shortly and that he believes that this particular Administrator is picking on him unfairly, I'm not saying that he is right or wrong and that the Admin is right or wrong. At the minute I have no evidence except for his email, but hopefully he/she will shortly send me the evidence of this matter. I also provided links on the email about administrator abuse and a link to send a message directly to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, but I told he/she that this should be a last resort. This user also says that he/she has contacted other Admins to investigae this, but he is asking for my help so I am trying to do my best (he also pointed out that he noticed on my User Page I would like to be a admin some day and that he would happily nominate me if I could help him - but I'm not doing it for that, I don't even think I'm experienced enough to be an admin!). Anyway I would just like some adivce on this matter. Also the user claimed that he had to create a new account to lose the watchful eye of the Admin who he believes is treating him unfairly, and that he was an experienced user. But please do not add this user to the sock puppet page as he is not really a sockpuppet and not vandalising Wikipedia at all, please could you help me to help him and if you will need the links to these unfair reversions, I will send them to you as soon as I get them (but please tell me if you will need them or any other data). I'm not taking sides with anyoe over this matter as I do not know the facts so I'm just trying to help this user get to the bottom of this so he can continue editing Wikipedia! Please Help soon and please reply on my talk page.</font></p>

I explained my concerns on his talk page...and for some reason, he chose to be obtuse and added a citation for the fact that 6am is, in fact, morning.
