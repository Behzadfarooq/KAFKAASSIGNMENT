<p>Violation of Wikipedia article guidlines. No refrences or citation to prove point in the first paragraph that either of organization made any racist statements: <i>In Russia the issue of Racism is present in the statements of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democratic_Party_of_Russia_aca5.html" title="Liberal Democratic Party of Russia">Liberal Democratic Party of Russia</a> and Russian <a href="http://www.dpni.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.dpni.org/" rel="nofollow">Movement against illegal immigration</a> (Russian language site).

<p>People who wrote this simply don't have any idea about the actual subject. Everything written here is what the Western Rusophobic (they all are, try BBC.com: to an uneducated person it will seems Russia is wrose than hell itself) media tells you. Now, I can't, of course, deny that racism in Russia exists, as it does in all other countries. But this very article is simply wrong. Please don't call me names, I am not a fanatical patriot or whatever and I very much support the West. I rather simply want this article to be as unbiased as possible, making corrections to all the points. So, for example, take skinheads. Do you really think all Russian males are skinheads, everyone kills black people etc.? Of course not, we - Russians - are afrain of them as much as blacks are. It is just a very undesireble element of our society and it is very much condemned. But this article doesn't mention it. The reader will get the feeling that any foreigner here will be killed the second he walks out of the airport, then ritually burned etc.</p>
<p>Ok, I can go on forever. Basically, my point is simple: to every point against there should be a point pro. Russians as people are not racist. We love and care for everyone. If a foreigner walks into a Siberian village, the people there will give him everything and do everything to make him feel good. There are people who are racist, but why, you know, label them as the whole Russian population?</p>
<p>End.</p>

<dd>I took out the entire first paragraph as it completely unsabstantiated by any citation of any actual statements from LDPR and DPNI that would expose them as racist. They are nationalistic, and oppose illegal immigration, but there is nothing racist about it. This section was written by someone who likes to make up facts, rather then report them. Someone on the left, as usual.</dd>

<p>There are a number of questionable and clearly biased points in the article, for example there is no official policy to discriminate against Caucasian males marrying Slavic women, there are only some xenophobic individuals in Russia who resent this. Nonetheless, marriages between Caucasian males and Slavic women are very common in Russia, while the marriages between Caucasian females and Slavic males remain a social taboo in many Caucasian societies and are very rare. Also with all due respect Nick Gabrichidze's opinion about discrimination towards Caucasians is the opinion of only one man and is not enough to claim it as a new phenomenon. Finally, the level of hostility towards for example Georgians (who share the same Orthodox Christian faith and related culture with Russians) is nowhere near the level of antagonism between Russians and Chechens which is an exceptional case due two years of violent conflict in Chechnya. (Not to mention what some Caucasian peoples for example Armenians and Ossetians have traditionally close and friendly relations with the Russians).

<dd>I find it ridiculous to inovoke "Movement against illegal immigration" as a society for segregation. The whole problem with illegal immigrants is that they are way far from the best representatives of the ethnicity. And the same was 30 year ago: Georgians I've seen in Tbilisi and I've seen in Minsk markets are two different nations. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:19, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Simulatity in religeous beliefs is rarely a factor to stop ethnical or racial discrimination hence the christiany of Georgians isn't an proof that this group does not suffer from the discrimination.</p>
<p>Skinheads may be a British invention but when it comes to sheer numbers, levels of violence and hatred of foreigners a damning new report suggests Russia has become the bovver boys' blood-soaked new playground. It may be a country that vilifies fascism more than any other and arguably had to make the most appalling sacrifices to defeat Nazi Germany 60 years ago but this is where skinhead culture has taken hold like nowhere else.Ell (t) 19:21, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This usage is unconfirmed in mainstream usage; even worse that the Russian version.

<p>I was never in my life interested in Russian politics and almost never read any Russian news in last 7 years (except of sites with Russian anecdotes, like kulichki.ru). This discussion made me to do this, and I see there is a whole huge problem all over Russia: millions of immigrants from China, Korea, Vietnam. Compared to these, a handful of caucasians in Moscow is but a tiny sparkle in the overall flame. Does anyone want to write an article? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:33, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Unofficial remark</b>: Seems like you know more about his problem then we do. If you would take your time to write an artickle about this problem instead of deleting everything what hurts your feelings (or every issue you personaly are not familiar with), and harras every user(ers) you dislike it will be much appreciated. However the problem you have mentioned (prejudice against migrants from East Asia) is not a new type of phobia, but a "good" 'al <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinophobia.html" title="Sinophobia">Sinophobia</a> so possibly you should visit this section at wiki and add your contribution there.</p>

<dd>You may get more traction if you include an extensive account of violent crimes, intimidations, rapes and kidnappings commited by the "immigrants" against native Russian population. Where is the expose on how "Caucasians" throw out poor pensioners out their own apartments and force them to hand it over, where is the account of drug dealing, where is the account of muslim illegals building mosques on top of Russian war dead cemeteries, where is the account of Russian citizens kidnapped for slavery going back to 1970's, where is the account of "Caucasians" setting up ethnic schools in Moscow where they force out ethnic Russian students, where is all the "good stuff"? The hypocrisy and racism of the left-wing fascists has reached stupendous proportions and must be, and will be, dealt with.</dd>

<p>Anyway, I will go away from this topic for two weeks. But after that please be prepared do defend each and every word in the article.

<p>If you want to discuss it, okay then. Just argue here please, instead of removing parts of artickle and waiting for our reaction, OK?</p>
<p>"<i>You better go and read the rules of <b>editing</b> in wikipedia, not only how to fight with other editors</i>"</p>
<p>Ok. If you promice to read <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikiquette</a> we will read the rules ones again. <b>One of the autors</b> Amsterdam 1:06; 16-06-2005</p>
<p>How about you refreshing wikiquette first, from the very first items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume good faith. It was not me who started looking some additional motives in my attitude, which is crystall clear: no unverified info in wikipedia. FUI, references to newspapers serve only as confirmations of some generalizations. But these generalizations must be presented as expert's opinions, not as wikipedia editor's opinions. Please start from finding reputable experts that can confirm the word "state-sponsored" in this article.</li>
<li>Sign and date your post. "One of the authors" is not really a signature.</li>
</ul>
<p>From my side, I did not remove material uncommented. My comment was in edit summary. When you restored after disagreeing with me I did not go into edit wars. I simply have no time for writing much now. But after two weeks I will start seriously objecting to 80% of the article, here in the talk page.</p>
<ul>
<li>About "almighty master": this is a very ridiculous claim. Did I block you? Did I threaten you in any way? Every editor is an almighty master in the sense they may request confirmations of what is written in the article. How about learning "avoid personal attacks" part of wikiquette?</li>
<li>The logic in my "Russian Empire" reference is that my history of edits clearly show that I have no history of taking a Russian side (and I am not Russian, by the way; if you know Russian language, I can tell you how an army sergeant mocked about my last name: "Kazhdoe govno konchaetsa na "o", kazhdyj govnyuk konchaetsa na "yuk"." However this did not make me russophob. I somehow saw the difference between idiots that exist in every nation and the nation itself and don't think that this funny say is an evidence that <i>"the Russian language embeds certain stereotypes"</i>, as you have it written in the article.</li>
<li>If you don't like the b-word, I can type much longer phrases, kind of "false and misleading statements loaded with POV of the editor", although I am not sure you will like it better, since it has basically the same meaning.</li>

<dd>It is Russo phobia and it is existing term in Russian language (mostly by right wing but who cares) but I unlike caucasophobia which made it's way into English, I do not know how the prejudice against Russians is called in Eng. However the phenomena itself definitely exists: but not among Caucasians who simply are defending themselves against aggression. But the treatment of Russians as an "untermensh" during WW2,or discrimination against ethnically Russian Latvian non-citizens in contemporary <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> are definitely an evidence of institutionalized Russo-phobia. As any other form of ethnicity related bigotry it also exists at the street level, but only solid historical facts are those above I think. It should be said though that leaving the events of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> occupation aside, Russians as an ethnicity rarely suffered from the "<a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogroms.html" title="Pogroms">pogroms</a>" and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> even in the countries where they have been a minority.

As for Gabrichidze's own speculations on how and where the Russian's experienced a hatred towards themselves and what name for this phenomenon is appropriate, I suggest he brings this up at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussophobia_b9bb.html" title="Talk:Russophobia">talk:Russophobia</a> which should perhaps evolve into an independent article, now being a redirect to <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a>.

<p>One more, rather strange factor, which played role, but I don't put it in the article. At least in my university foreign students were freed from study of the most dreaded discipline, "History of the CPSU"! This was usually the punchline: "they have money, they have our girls,... and they don't have to learn the "history of cpsu"!!!!" or "... they don't have to study materials of twenty CPSU congresses!" Funny as it is, the phrase reflected the whole set of privileges for foreign students. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:02, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

A russian boy in a room with africans was very friendly: he showed them ways around, helped them with various everyday things.

<p>I object to this new name for purely technical reasons. The article, as it currently stands, is devoted to many ethnic prejudices in Russia of which several are directed to groups which are of the same <i>race</i> as Russians: Jews (chapter <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism_in_Russia_b2dc.html#Anti-semitism_in_Russia" title="Racism in Russia">Racism_in_Russia#Anti-semitism_in_Russia</a>), and people from Caucasus (chapter <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism_in_Russia_b2dc.html#Racism_towards_peoples_of_the_Caucasus" title="Racism in Russia">Racism_in_Russia#Racism_towards_peoples_of_the_Caucasus</a>). So while certainly repugnant prejudices, these are not technically "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>". It would be more correct to call the article Ethnic prejudices in Russia (and of course such an article would be better based on solid sources rather than arbitrary picked news reports, but that's perhaps unattainable).

<dd>I'd say that the term "prejudice" is too mild for the topic of the article. Prejudices it is, like, Estonians speak and think slowly, Ukrainians love bacon and don't like to share it, chukchas are well,... chukchas etc. The article speaks not about "<a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinions</a>" (<a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">prejudice</a> is a groundless negative opinion), but about dislike, discrimination, hatred, i.e., <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude.html" title="Attitude">attitudes</a> which is actually covered by phobia (attitude) article I separated from the main <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a> article, but was surprized by everyone wanting to delete it.

<dd>I agree "prejudices" may be too soft. But "Ethnic conflicts" seems too broad. The article is about poor treatment of non-Russian minorities, discrimination and sometimes violence, but the treatment mainly by "Russians" and Russian authorities of non-Russians specifically due to their being "non-Russian". The conflict between, say, Chechens and Osetins is also an "ethnic conflict in Russia", however it would not fit into the context of the article. Any other ideas? -<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 05:04, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Racism" was coined to refer to Nazi ideology (translation of German "Völkisch"), and this certainly applied to Jews. (and neo-Nazi skinheads are directly inspired by it.) "Race" in English used to have a wider range of meaning including <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic_race.html" title="Nordic race">Nordic race</a> vs. <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpine_race.html" title="Alpine race">Alpine race</a> vs. <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_race.html" title="Mediterranean race">Mediterranean race</a>, or simply nation as in the book "History of the Irish Race". More recently the meaning has mostly narrowed to continent-level racial groupings because of the tendency in the post-WWII USA and world in general to efface conflicts between "white" groups and concentrate on conflicts with African and Asian peoples and their diasporas. However, Americans condemning current negative attitude towards Arabs in USA do not hesitate to call it "racism" even though most Arabs are technically <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasoid.html" title="Caucasoid">Caucasoid</a>. As for news reports, they are legitimate examples, although they should not be considered to imply that Russia is worse than other countries, unless they cover statistics instead of just individual incidents. By the way, what is stereotype of Chukchis? <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chukchi_people.html" title="Chukchi people">Chukchi people</a> mentions stereotype but doesn't say what it is. --<a href="../../../j/w/b/User%7EJWB_e997.html" title="User:JWB">JWB</a> 22:26, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The reality is that people do get attacked and killed by Russian nationalists. They don't like Nazi flags, because their ancestors probably died in the war with Nazis, but they like Commie flags. However, Communism opposes Nationalism as an ideology. So, my point is that they don't know what the heck are they doing and what they want. These kids are also nationalist who like Beria. I am Georgian and vast majority of Georgian people don't like Beria. If you are from the eastern Ukraine you might like him. Obviously, our opinions simply don't matter. Anti-Caucasian sentiment is basically a propaganda by some Russian politicians which is not planned well. That is what this picture shows.

<p>Sorry , I never called you an ignorant person, I only said you are ignorant about this particular subject (attitudes and ideology of Russian nationalists). Vast majority of Russians don't like Beria as well. National-Bolsheviks are not part of "propaganda by some Russian politicians" but the most extreme anti-Putin group in Russia (which recently abandoned its neo-Stalinist ideology). Most Russian nationalists rarely use "Commie" flags but rather flag like this for example<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Romanov_Flag.svg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Romanov_Flag.svg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. In any case this is not the issue here, we already have one picture of National-Bolsheviks in the article and its fine. The second picture however is totally out of contest since 90% + of Russian nationalists with anti-Caucasian sentiments not only would not admire Beria but would more likely use crimes of Beria and Stalin to further justify their hostility towards Georgians. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 16:12, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fisenko, I don't want to argue with you. I respect your position and would rather work with you than arguing endlessly. Yes they were communists but they had nothing to do with Georgian character, culture or identity. So it’s pointless to mention about their Georgian background. My background is Scottish/Irish/English but i feel 100% Canadian. But as I said before, I rather work and co-operate with fellow Russians on Wiki articles. So let’s end this pointless discussion.

<p>This is a flag of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanov.html" title="Romanov">Romanov</a> dynasty and official flag of the Russian Empire until 1914. Russian nationalists often use this flag to show their opposition to "democratic" (meaning pro-Western/liberal) Russian elite (esp. under Yeltsin) who re-introduced white-blue-red flag after the Soviet Union collapse.

<b>Oppose <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">User:Fisenko</a></b> and <b>agree</b> with Luis. Most people in the Westren World identify Stalin as Russian. Most of Fisenko's discussions are his own personal opinions than valid points and I am not gonna comment on them. In fact, I really don't care about the Russian Skinheads, let Russians worry about them. I simply don't see any difference between so-called Russian Nationalism and Soviet Union. Most Russians are very proud what hey have done during the past two centuries. It is also my opinion and I would appreciate if Fisenco does not turn red on this comment. Georgians have lots of culture than being proud of Stalin and Beria. We can give them to you as your May day present which you still celebrate and very proud of it. <a href="../../../s/o/s/User%7ESosomk_cf5f.html" title="User:Sosomk">Sosomk</a> 18:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Russian Nationalism is an ideology with little in common with Marxist-Leninist ideology of the Soviet Union. The best description of these differences can be found in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn_2d89.html" title="Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>'s article <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060140437/104-3743042-9105513?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060140437/104-3743042-9105513?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">The mortal danger: How misconceptions about Russia imperil America</a>. PS <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_Day_2f10.html" title="May Day">May Day</a> is celebrated as national holiday in most countries of the world exept United States, Canada and few others.

<dd>I don't argue with you. You can be as Nationalist and proud as you want. Victory day of Russia is a holiday for Russians and not for everybody. One totalitarian government beat another one. However, I did loose my ancestors in the WWII, but the fake holiday like that is not celebrated in Georgia. Obviosly, it is a matter of opinion.

<p><b>Oppose</b>Soory, Fisenko but bunch of war veterans getting together does not mean a National holiday of Georgia. As you know Saakashvili denied Putin's invitation on May Day last year. Georgia is a democratic country unlike Russua and people don't get shot for getting together and talking about their memories of war. <a href="../../../s/o/s/User%7ESosomk_cf5f.html" title="User:Sosomk">Sosomk</a> 09:09, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added a lot of tags. I realize there are some sources given, but with such controvertial material, each statement must be carefully sourced, and when the source is less than 100% authoritative, its identity must be made explicit in the statement of fact. I will check the given sources to see which facts can be sourced. After that time, though not sooner than 3 days hence, I will begin removing unsourced material. <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 17:31, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cool down here. Unless you have serious objections to some statements, tagging every second sentence is rather frivolous. In this way you can litter 80% of wikipedia. Unless you state reasonable doubts in truth of some phrases, destroying an article on a whim in 3 days is bad idea. Wikipedians have real life, you know, they are not going to jump thru your hoop right away. Even votes for deletion take 5 days. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

If you think these policies are "frivolous" then go say so on the policy talk pages. I have lived in Russia myself and none of the statements I tagged are obvious.

<p>The term "anti-national sentiment" makes no sense semantically and, consequently, does not convey the focus of this article, which is racism. I've read that the purpose for changing the title from "Racism in Russia" was to allow for coverage of a broader topic; but the title "Xenophobia in Russia" will better accomplish that goal by using a well-known term to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Another concern of mine is that the article generally avoids the term "racism" (it only appears once in the prose). What may seem like a minor issue of semantics is actually quite serious, because it conceals the fact that <i>unadulterated</i> racism and neo-Nazism exist in Russia, and that they have reached proportions far greater than in any other European country.</p>

<dd>Xenophobia/racism strongly disagreed. "Nationalism", "ethnic prejudices" may be. Please suggest other versions, but please don't move without consensus. The article "conceals" nothing. In wikipedia we avoid slapping strong words in main titles. Redirects are welcome. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 21:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
