<p>I have no problem with there being an article with this title, but I don't believe the POV content of this one is what we should have. I was ready to add anti-Islamic contents being made by several conservative US Congressmen, but when I see what's here, I'm inclinded to ask that this be totally rewritten, or deleted. - <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>I have taken a first attempt at rewriting this into something meaningful, but this article needs a total overhaul. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>The opening of the article is ridiculously inaccurate. Anti-Islamic sentiment did <i>not</i> begin as a result of the Crusades. It began much earlier. In fact, it was one of the factors that motivated the Crusades. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>
<p>Tee hee--ain't it though? Strange there was no mention of that mighty Moorish air force.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenBudney_873b.html" title="User:LenBudney">Len</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I took a stab at shaping the beginning based on your comments and info in the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusades</a> articles. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_C._Carlson_36c3.html" title="User:Stephen C. Carlson">Stephen C. Carlson</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the historical basis for any of this besides hypothesis and a random quote? How did Christendom respond to the Muslim conquest of Egypt? What about the battles between the Byzantines and the Muslims? Yes, the Crusades were important in defining Western attitudes to Islam, but the way this article has it, they were practically the sole factor. Hardly. The propaganda statement is an abject lesson in what an anachronism is, while the section which makes it seem that Jews are the only people to defend Islam is a "wee tad" too bizarre for comment. Is it at all possible to rise above agendas, political and otherwise, and have someone who actually knows the subject matter write something here? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I cut down the article to a stub; any improvement of it is welcome. Probably needs a lot more stuff on 20th cen. attitudes, too. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_C._Carlson_36c3.html" title="User:Stephen C. Carlson">Stephen C. Carlson</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>"The context of a holy war gave rise to the perception that Islam is a religion of the sword and led Europeans to assume that it is an inherently violent religion."</p>
<dl>
<dd>This doesn't seem right. Surely the attempt by Islamic armies to conquor the world, Europe inclusive, had something to do with it. Does this have something to do with how it's fashionable in university circles to try to lay all "blame" of badness with Europeans vs what acidemia recognises as the <i>infallablely wonderful Islamic Empire of peace, tolerance, science and enlightenment</i> vs <i>the barbaric European hordes</i>? Rightly or wrongly, this is how the thinking on the matter has developed over the last few years. It seems that in the post September 11 fallout, any kind of anti-Islamism was associated with the right wing, so overnight acidemics went from scorning Islam as being backwards and oppressing women to saying it liberated women and was the best thing since sliced bread and how much the rest of the world should recognise it owes it.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>As the article develops I hope that it can explain what "anti-Islamism" is supposed to be. If someone thinks that Muhammad was not a saint, is that "anti-Islamism", or does the attitude in view only cross the line to anti-Islamism if someone thinks that Muhammad was a prophet from Hell? Is it any non-favorable opinion of Islam, or only irrational hostility? Is hostility to Al Qaeda "anti-Islamism" for example? Must this antipathy be directed against Islam per se, to be "anti-Islamism"; or, is it antipaty only to "Islamists"? Where does the "ism" come from? Is there really an idealogy implied as there is, for example, in "anti-semitism" or "anti-Americanism"? <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> 23:44 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>

Worldwide, millions of Muslims have been murdered in the past few decades, by people such as Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, etc? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:39, Oct 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The National Islamic Front in Sudan has killed largely Christians and animists, but also hundreds of thousands of Muslims, especially among the Beja, Fur, Massaleit, Tama, and Nuba peoples. Its militias have also taken Muslim slaves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Armed Islamic Group in Algeria has murdered more than 100,000 Muslims in the last decade. In Chechnya, another 100,000 people, one-10th of the population, has been killed and almost half the population is displaced. In Afghanistan, the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies killed thousands of Shia. In Mauritania, tens of thousand of Muslims are held as slaves. Tens of thousands more died in the Kashmir conflict and in the civil wars in Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone. Thousands more have died in Nigeria and Indonesia. The Burmese junta drove out more than a quarter million of its Rohingya Muslims in the early 1990s. In India last year some 2,000 Muslims were slaughtered in Gujarat, some disemboweled or burned alive while police stood by or joined in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yet these events are passed over in silence, even within much of the Muslim world. Meanwhile, the perpetrators of many of these atrocities sit in the UN condemning events in the West Bank.</dd>

<p>I will take this one on, give me time and I'll re-write this article on Anti-Islamism, starting in Mecca in the 7th century through the crusades and up to the extreme christian right and the hindufication of all things indian. --<a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_1f5d.html" title="User:Omar">Omar</a> 15:32, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this article useful?</span></h2>
<p>The first meaning that came to my mind reading this link was that it was about opposition to the political <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> movement. In fact, it appears to be a redudant article, duplicating the sense of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>. If there truns out to be no good justification for this article, I propose that the content of this artuicle be merged into the Islamophobia article, and this page turned into a redirect.</p>
<p>And on content: I dispute that Daniel Pipes has ever called Islam as a whole evil -- his motto, if you like, is that moderate Islam is the solution to extermist Islam ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:23, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, and I've decided to "be bold" and redirect it. There seems to be no difference in practice between the meanings of the two terms. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:41, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit war</span></h2>
<p>Can the people involved in the edit war explain their positions here on the talk page? I've put the page on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia:Requests for page protection</a></p>
<p>I've not done anything, but I'll start: there may be a useful distinction between "Anti-Islamism" and "Islamophobia" to be made (though I'm not so impressed by the suggestion); but in any case there is not enough substance here to support two articles: a single article explaining to two side-by-side is almost certainly better for readers. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 20:10, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>For a start, I would demand empirical evidence that there is a difference in usage between the two terms before attempting to create one... - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 22:47, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>My position, as mentioned during this "revert-war", is that the title of article "Islamophobia" itself is POV. IMO the title suggest that fear of Islam is irrational, which is not an opinion shared by everyone, especially not those on the side criticising Islam. (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_van_Gogh_2c07.html" title="Theo van Gogh">Theo van Gogh</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pipes_f5d3.html" title="Daniel Pipes">Daniel Pipes</a> and others..) To redirect "Anti-Islamism" to the article "Islamophobia" would be to suggest that all anti-Islamism is about an irrational fear. That is as POV as it can get! The title "Anti-Islamism" on the other hand is quite neutral. Cphka 09:57, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a serious matter, but it is in conflict with the policy to follow the most common name for something when naming pages. The article need not be POV if the problems with the title are clearly laid out, and it is not the purpose of Wikipedia to carry out language reform. The Islamophobia article documents usage of the term in the media: no documentation of alternate names have been proposed. I have a particular problem with the name "Anti-Islamism", in that <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> is a very widely used term for a class of political positions, and so the name is very suggestive of a political reaction, and not of a religious or cultural reaction. If you want to pursue a different article name than Islamophobia, I siggest you either show this term is used as you say, or coin a better term (perhaps, egI <i>Anti-Islamic positions</i>). ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 20:47, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article "Anti-Islamism" is, I think we can all agree to that, about a HIGHLY controversial subject. IMHO, neutrality should in these cases be more important than the "rule of following the most common name". In this case it is because I cant see how critics of Islam, should be able to get their side of the discussion presented in a fair way, in an article which title suggest they are suffering from a mysterious mental illness called "Islamophobia". To explain somewhere in the article, that it is controversial to claim that critics of Islam are more or less suffering from insanity, is simply not enough. But again if it is the rule of Wikipedia, that using the most common media-word is more important than neutrality, then please follow that rule! I cant find a title that is more used in the media than "Islamophobia". Apart from that, I agree that "Anti-Islamism" is not the ideal title. "Islamism" should be avoided, for the reasons mentioned. <i>Anti-Islamic positions</i> I think is actually not a bad suggestion for a new title, or maybe it could be <i>Anti-Islamic criticism</i>?

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Policy</span></h3>
<p>In case the editors involved are not aware of Wikipedia policy, the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3 revert rule</a> says that no editor should revert another editors edits 3 times in any 24 hour period. So far, <a href="../../../1/4/8/User%7E148.244.150.58.html" title="User:148.244.150.58">User:148.244.150.58</a>, <s><a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">User:Yoshiah ap</a></s>, and User:Cphka have violated this rule. Two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unreverting is easy, and the page is such a mess in any case that nothing is at stake in repeatedly reverting these edits.</li>
<li>Unrepentant violation of the 3 revert rule will temporarily lose you your editing prinvileges and/or have your IP address blocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've changed the boilerplate to something I hope will be less contentious, by splitting the difference between the alternate states. Please do not revert it without explaining your reasons for finding what I have written unsatisfactory here, on this talk page. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 21:10, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As a matter of fact, I have taken special care to do no more than 3 reverts each day. If you look, I revered 3 times on the 11th, 3 times on the 12th, and twice on the 13th. Please do not make false accusations.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 02:10, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You did not violate the letter of the rule, and I am very sorry for having said that you did; I had not looked closely enough at your edits. Nonetheless, your close spacing of rvs was not really in the spirit of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, and I do not consider your editing behaviour to have been entirely constructive in this dispute. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 14:23, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really dislike this article. It serves no useful purpose, housing almost no content not available elsewhere on wikipedia, but labelled in a misleading way that leads to ugly tension. I've had a reminder to sort out this article sitting at the top of my reminders list since the 12th November, and the only idea about it that has at all appealed to me is to put it up for VfD...</p>
<p>Feelings aside, the phrasing I put together for the NPOV sticker was a compromise position designed to end the edit war we had back then. Given this history, I think it is only responsible to tamper with the wording <b>after explaining what the change is and why here on the talk page</b>. Anything else risks conflagration. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">User:Mustafaa</a>: please justify your change! I think I won't agree: the current wording of the lead paragraph indicates that the term is being used in this article to be about criticism about Muslims, and not about Islamism, contrary to the obvious meaning of the word, and without any authoratative precedent for this usage. We agree about the badness of the term, but I think moving the article, hopefully prior to a merge, is the right way to go about solving the problem; I don't see the sense in changing what is already a counterproductive article, especially to merge it with an article that doesn't already discuss <i>positions against Islamism</i>.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">User:OneGuy</a> has a history of being a POV warrior, for those who have not seen his work elsewhere. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 21:41, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah - I see your point. I hadn't really thought about that, but certainly the current actual (as opposed to ideal) content of this article would call for a merger with Islamophobia. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 21:53, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
