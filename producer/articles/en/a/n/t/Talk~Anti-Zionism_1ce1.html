<p>Several days ago I removed the following quote, to general consensus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Tanya Reinhardt, Professor of Linguistics at Tel Aviv University who said she was speaking as one who loves the country and its people, "Being against Israel is the best act of solidarity and compassion with the Jews that one can have. ... The system of prisons that Israel is building is also a prison for Israelis. This small state is making itself the enemy of the entire Arab world and now the Muslim world. A state with this strategy does not have a future, so the solution for the Palestinians is also the solution for Israel."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote itself has been placed in the Anti-Zionism and antisemitism section, yet does not refer to either anti-Zionism or antisemitism. Rather, it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> intended to refute other points made about anti-Zionism and antisemitism.

<dd>I believe the Reinhardt quote is extremely relevant (having put in there in the first place). Zionism as an ideology supports the estbliahment of a Jewish state in Palestine; i.e. Israel. Reinhardt directly challenges that notion by questioning whether or not Israel serves the needs of Jewish people. Additionally, there are a number of quotes throughout the article that seem to designed to drive home the idea that anti-Zionists are Jew-haters. Reinhardt, a Jewish Israeli, directly refutes these ideas in the quote provided. It is there for purposes of balance considering the overwhelmingly Zionist POV saturating this article. I think it should stay. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 12:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Have you reviewed <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which forbids addition of material if "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source"? That is exactly what you are doing here. Reinhardt is not talking about the linkage between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, which is the subject of the section. Indeed, she's not even talking about anti-Zionism. If you wish to "balance" the "overwhelmingly Zionist POV saturating this article", you'll need to do it with sources discussing anti-Zionism and antisemitism. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 12:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anti-Zionism is a broad topic, which includes criticism of Israeli policies. Reinhardt's quote strikes me as obviously relevant. Would we otherwise have to stick to people who specifically say they're defending or attacking "anti-Zionism" by name? I don't think this is there to advance an opinion either, but to provide a balanced discussion of the topic. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 14:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's plenty of balance in the article, and on top of being a <i>linguist</i>, not an expert on Zionism or antisemitism, Reinhardt refers to criticizing Israel, which Zionists do every day, and not to anti-Zionism nor antisemitism. The claim that she is referring to anti-Zionism is pure OR. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your intellectual dishonesty knows no limits. Muir, a historian, is entitled to talk about statistics, but Reinhardt, a linguist, is not entitled to talk about Zionism?</dd>
<dd>Also, Reinhardt is to be excluded, because she talks about criticism of Israel, not anti-Zionism, but Kaplan and Small are to be included, although their survey is about attitudes toward Israel, not about anti-Zionism?</dd>
<dd>I support the inclusion of the Reinhardt quote. It's relevant and on-topic, <i>given the general tone of the section in which the concepts of anti-Israel attitudes and anti-Zionism are freely mixed</i>. It isn't true that Reinhardt has no consensus.--<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 16:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Clearly Zionism and Anti-Zionism are topics which relate to Israel and criticism of Israel at a fundamental and primary level. The connection here is not original research any more than the inclusion of Bauer's statement in the immediately previous paragraph which does not use the word "Zionism" either. Both discuss being against Israel. If there is better material, I would be happy to substitute it, but I also think it should be kept until that time, as the response to the previous statement is otherwise lost. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 17:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that an opposing opinion would be appropriate here, but the Reinhardt quote isn't addressing the same issue as the paragraph its responding to. There are many better quotes out there. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to discuss <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natan_Sharansky_7856.html" title="Natan Sharansky">Natan Sharansky</a>'s criteria for when anti-Zionism constitutes anti-semitism and see if someone has responded to him. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, but why was the quote removed? The issue here, I'm pretty sure, is whether the material is relevant or not, not whether it addresses the exact point made by the previous author. Pro-Life and Pro-Choice don't address the exact same point either, but we also recognize that they're discussing the same issue. Alternatively, you could consider the claim that <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrats</a> just want to raise taxes. If responding, someone had said "What Democrats acknowledge that Republicans don't is that the government has to pay for certain services like healthcare and education, and this actually costs money," would we say that wasn't relevant because it didn't address whether Democrats want to raise taxes? The problem, of course, is that you're suggesting the one side should entirely frame the debate in the other's terms, by arguing that anybody who fails to use their terms is not relevant. This clearly violates NPOV, while serving no apparent purpose. I'd ask, if you think that other material would better fit here, that you find that material, not simply keep deleting what we have, which creates a clear NPOV problem which everybody seems to acknowledge.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 22:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Also, until fairly recently, <i>The Socialist Worker</i> was specifically mentioned by WP:RS as a non-reliable source. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, as I just said I think you're misusing <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a> to require that all material be framed in the terms used by one side. That's not enforcing NOR; that's simply enforcing a single POV. Indeed, it seems the only way you'd admit relevance to this section is if an opponent started their sentence "Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism because [quote till end of sentence]." But according to this standard, Bauer's statement doesn't qualify either. Where does he say he's talking about anti-Zionism? If you can explain why Bauer's statement is not OR but Reinhardt's is, I'll rethink. Otherwise, it looks like you're trying to wikilawyer disfavored information out of the article. Regarding the other questions, I'll have to go back and check. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 23:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Jay, I think the two quotes could hardly even be more on point. Bauer says if you're against the existense of Malaysia, you're anti-Malay. Reinhart says that "Being against Israel is the best act of solidarity and compassion with the Jews that one can have." She says "A state with this strategy does not have a future, so the solution for the Palestinians is also the solution for Israel." I would call that directly related. In any case, who said wanting to abolish Israel is anti-Zionism? I'd suggest we need to take a little step back here. Bauer is presenting an argument, and Reinhart is addressing that argument. If two quotes should ever go together, I think it might be these two... <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 00:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ha, well, what's your source? The connection from Reinhart is hardly less obvious, while you just got done saying obviousness isn't even the issue. I'm not playing games; I think both statements are relevant. I'm just not sure how you're saying one is and the other isn't.

<dd>Allow me to insist that if we're going to use only those materials specifically related to the purported link between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, then neither Kaplan and Small nor Muir's review of their survey belong in this article. To use Jayjg's expression, none of K&amp;S's questions are about abolishing Israel. They ask, rather, whether interviewees think that Israel intentionally targets civilians. Is anyone responding "yes" necessarily anti-Zionist? I don't think so. A person may support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish country, yet believe the present Israeli government to be very wrong.</dd>

<p>Here's an interview with Reinhart, where I think she makes the point pretty clearly<a href="http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/757" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/757" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Elmer: I want to talk to you about the political uses of anti-Semitism. Tel Aviv University has published a report entitled Anti-Semitism Worldwide wherein it claims: "The barriers between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism have been lifted and the two merged." What are your thoughts on conflating anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reinhart: I haven't seen the specific report, but the claim is of course very widespread. Usually the source of this claim that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism is Israeli propaganda, and its very well-oiled branches of the pro-Israel lobby across the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The supposition in this claim is that if you look at Israel's behaviour, it is essentially alright: it is a country defending itself, and it is doing what is necessary to defend itself - there isn't anything peculiar about it. Therefore there must be some hidden reason why people criticize Israel and object to Israel's acts in the Territories, and what could that reason be if not anti-Semitism? The reason that it is picked on is because it can work - given that there was, and is, anti-Semitism, given the horrible history of the Jewish people, people do have fears of anti-Semitism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I don't like the term anti-Zionism to define opposition to Israeli policies, because Zionism - the way it is perceived by most Israelis - is that Jews are entitled to a State of their own. It is the liberation and self-determination of the Jewish people motivated by the Holocaust and their fate in exile.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So would we say she's talking about the alleged connection between anti-Zionism and antisemitism here? Indeed, she does say at the end that she likes to avoid the term anti-Zionism. So does that make it irrelevant? I actually think it lays out the complexity of the issue perfectly, and why we can't artificially require that people refer to the word "anti-Zionism" in order to be considered relevant to this debate. It violates WP's fundamental policy, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> ("The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views.

<dd>Jay, what you're saying simply doesn't make sense. Relating to the Bauer quote, what you're saying is that we'd have to take the quote about destroying Israel, and then another souce (potentially a dictionary, although you haven't provided one), and then engage in original research to decide that the one was talking about the other. This is not what <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NORprohibits</a>. As editors, we have to be able to look at different sources and make basic decisions about which topics are relevant, based on what those sources and other sources say.

<p>Reinhart is a linguist, and you have a direct quote from her on the subject already: "I haven't seen the specific report, but the claim is of course very widespread. Usually the source of this claim that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism is Israeli propaganda, and its very well-oiled branches of the pro-Israel lobby across the world." Why on earth would you insist on including a quote from Reinhart to begin with, and all the more so, why a that mentions neither anti-Zionism nor antisemitism? Why wouldn't you be fighting to include an actually relevant statement she has made? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think the Reinhart quote is a very appropriate other-side to Bauer's. Bauer's is an important theoretical point, that opposing a country means opposing its citizens, and even the members of that ethnic/religious group. This, of course, is the basis for many of the subsequent arguments that anti-Zionism is necessarily antisemitic. The quote from Reinhart, then, makes the direct response: no, opposing Israel can in fact be done in support for Jews in Israel and around the world. This is extremely apropos to the question. The other quote you mention is an attack on motives, which may also be relevant, but doesn't really address Bauer's statement. Basically, Bauer's is a theoretical argument, which I think deserves the theoretical response. Ideally Reinhart could be fleshed out with others so we didn't have to quote her so much (doing so might also clarify that Reinhart does not speak for all anti-Zionism) but I think the response as a starting point is actually pretty good. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 17:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I understand that, you think Reinhart's statement is a good counter-argument to Bauer's. The problem is, it's original research; that's why most original research is included, as a counter-argument to something else in an article. Please find a counter-argument to Bauer that is actually talking about anti-Zionism and antisemitism, ideally from a better source as well. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:15, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You asked why I thought this section was appropriate, and I told you. If you're going back to the OR argument, I again strongly disagree. As I noted, your standard would not allow the Bauer quote either, since that requires an evaluation of Bauer's statement to decide that it is in fact on topic. Moreover, the second quote you just suggested unequivocally establishes that this is not original synthesis, but well-established synthesis endorsed by the author herself. Did you look at <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanya_Reinhart_eee7.html" title="Tanya Reinhart">Tanya Reinhart</a>'s WP page, incidentally? You seem to initially have had her name wrong. It appears she is well-published on the issue. The possibility that others could be more published is not a reason to remove her, unless you find such an individual to replace her. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 18:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can't take two different quotes from the author made at separate times, to separate audiences, synthesize them, and then claim the first is about the same thing as the second. Quote her talking about antisemitism or anti-Zionism, please. Also, please stop quoting letters to the editor from poets/authors of childrens books. Let's take this article seriously. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I would be willing to remove the Rosen quote, as I am not familiar with his notability, if the Reinhart quote is retained. Reinhart has written a number of books and articles on the subject, and is responding directly to the issue and to Bauer's argument. I'll try this compromise, pending opposition by others. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 22:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Except that this material does not advance any position that I hold, and even so, you are taking this into complete absurdity. When you put the Bauer and the Reinhart quotes together, you get an issue, with two major sides represented. You get the "Opposing Israel is opposing Israelis" view, and then you get the "Opposing Israel is supporting Israelis" view. This is the discussion we're giving: does opposing Israel mean opposing Israelis? The thing is, if we can't present both sides of this argument, then we simply can't present the argument at all, since it then could never be NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What NOR is saying, one has to think, is that you can't synthesize material in a way that promotes one viewpoint <i>over</i> others. It cannot prohibit the inclusion of a particular viewpoint in a paragraph because doing so would allegedly synthesize and "promote" that viewpoint simply by including it. The question would necessarily be if you're promoting it in a non-NPOV manner, not simply promoting it to a state of equality with other positions. Otherwise, a paragraph on any contentious issue would be impossible, since you could never decide that two people were talking about the same thing, unless they used exactly the same words in exactly that sentence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You must realize that one could cripple WP by taking the concept of "no original synthesis" to a logical extreme. In any instance, you could simply say "Your decision to include that is synthesis that promotes your view point." How does one disprove this? Perhaps if you can answer that, I'll see where you're coming from. Otherwise, you still haven't explained how Bauer is relevant by Reinhart isn't. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 23:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

The Jeruslaem Post reported that “…a recent AJC-sponsored survey, of young American Jewish adults, found that only about one third said caring about Israel was an important part of their Jewish identity” … “In a wider survey taken in 2000, supporting Israel was ranked 11th in a series of 15 significant values for American Jews.“ <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1159193522995" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1159193522995" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and in “A survey two years ago by Steven M. Cohen, a sociologist at New York's Hebrew Union College, found that just 17% of American Jews called themselves Zionists.” … “In Mr Cohen's survey, only 57% of American Jews said that ‘caring about Israel is a very important part of my being Jewish’, down from 73% in a similar survey in 1989.” <a href="http://www.nif.org/content.cfm?id=2853&amp;currbody=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nif.org/content.cfm?id=2853&amp;currbody=1" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Could we come up with a better formulation that better represents the wide diversity of Diaspora opinion on Israel.? <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 13:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most western anti-Zionists deny vehemently that they are anti-Semites or that anti-Zionism can be equated with antisemitism. Israelis and Zionists outside Israel often respond that a demand to destroy or abolish the state of Israel is intrinsically anti-Semitic, however. One problem in this conflict arises from the absence of an agreed definition of key terms such as "antisemitism" and "Zionism," and the fact that many western anti-Zionists either do not accept the concept of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">a right to national self-determination</a> (for any nation, not just a Jewish nation) or do not accept that Israel represents its fulfillment. This debate is complicated by two further factors: the habit of genuine anti-Semites of using the term "Zionist" as a <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonym</a> and/or <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a> for "Jew," and the tendency for radical <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> elements to use the rhetoric of traditional European antisemitism. These rhetorical cross-currents make it nearly impossible for Zionists and anti-Zionists to converse across the gulf of hostility and incomprehension which has grown up over the past decades. The distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism is, however, recognised by a wide range of Jewish commentators. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Sacks_628d.html" title="Jonathan Sacks">Jonathan Sacks</a>, the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, said in 2002: "I see three distinct positions: legitimate criticism of Israel, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionism can certainly become a form of anti-semitism when it becomes an attack on the collective right of the Jewish people to defensible space. If any people in history have earned the right to defensible space it is the Jewish people. But anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are different things. We're hearing more voices in Britain now who are denying Israel's right to exist and I have to fight that - but I don't confuse that with an assault on me as the bearer of a religious tradition."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>However, in 2003 he said "Today's anti-Semitism has three components: The first is anti-Zionism, the notion that Jews alone have no right to a nation of their own, a place in which to govern themselves. No. 2—all Jews are Zionists and therefore legitimate targets like Wall Street Journal journalist <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pearl_f170.html" title="Daniel Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a>. No. 3, Israel and the Jewish people are responsible for all the troubles in the world, from <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a>. Put those three propositions together and you have the new anti-Semitism."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> In a major essay in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nation_3a20.html" title="The Nation">The Nation</a></i> in January 2004, historian <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Klug_eea2.html" title="Brian Klug">Brian Klug</a> took issue with the equation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism, arguing that this actually emptied the term "antisemitism" of any content. He concluded "when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
