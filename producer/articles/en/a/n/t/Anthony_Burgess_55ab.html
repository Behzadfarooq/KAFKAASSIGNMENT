<p>His mother, Elizabeth Burgess Wilson, died when Burgess was one year old, a casualty of the 1918–1919 <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_flu.html" title="Spanish flu">Spanish flu</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandemic.html" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a>, which also took the life of his sister Muriel. Elizabeth, who is buried in a Protestant cemetery in Manchester (the City of Manchester General Cemetery, Rochdale Road), had been a minor actress and dancer who appeared at Manchester music halls such as the Ardwick Empire and the Gentlemen's Concert Rooms. Her stage name, according to Burgess, was "The Beautiful Belle Burgess", but there has never been any independent verification of this — no playbills have yet been discovered that include the name. His grandmother, Mary-Ann Finnegan, is thought to have come from <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary.html" title="Tipperary">Tipperary</a>.</p>
<p>Burgess described his father, Joseph Wilson, as descended from an "Augustinian Catholic" background. Burgess's father had a variety of means of earning a living, working at different times as an army corporal, a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookmaker.html" title="Bookmaker">bookmaker</a>, a pub piano-player, a pianist in movie theaters accompanying silent films, an encyclopedia salesman, a butcher, a cashier and a tobacconist. Burgess described his father, who later remarried a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub.html" title="Pub">pub</a> landlady, as "a mostly absent drunk who called himself a father". The adjective he used to describe the relationship he had with his father was "lukewarm". Burgess's grandfather was half-Irish.</p>
<p>Burgess was raised by his maternal aunt, and later by his stepmother, whom he detested (he was to include a slatternly caricature of her in the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Enderby_%28fictional_character%29.html" title="Enderby (fictional character)">Enderby</a> quartet of novels). His childhood was in large part a solitary one, during which he felt "perpetually angry" and resentful. He lived in Dickensian circumstances, his home being shabby rooms above an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off-licence.html" title="Off-licence">off-licence</a> and newsagent's-tobacconist's shop that his aunt ran, and above a pub.</p>

<p>Burgess was to a large degree an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autodidact.html" title="Autodidact">autodidact</a> but was nevertheless fortunate, in view of the straitened circumstances in which he grew up, to receive a formal education of a high standard.</p>
<p>He first attended St. Edmund's Roman Catholic Elementary School and moved on to Bishop Bilsborrow Memorial Roman Catholic Primary School in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moss_Side_fc2d.html" title="Moss Side">Moss Side</a>. For some years his family lived on Princess Street in the same district.</p>
<p>Good grades from Bishop Bilsborrow resulted in a place at the noted Manchester Catholic secondary school <a href="../../../x/a/v/Xaverian_College_b749.html" title="Xaverian College">Xaverian College</a>, run by the Xaverian Brothers along religious lines. It was during his teenage years at this school that he lapsed formally from Catholicism, although he cannot be said to have broken completely with the church. His history teacher at Xaverian College, L.W. Dever, is credited with introducing Burgess to James Joyce's writings.</p>
<p>Burgess entered the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_University_of_Manchester_bd2e.html" title="Victoria University of Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a> in 1937, graduating three years later with the degree of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> (2nd class honours, upper division) in English language and literature. His thesis was on the subject of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlowe.html" title="Marlowe">Marlowe</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tragical_History_of_Doctor_Faustus_a15d.html" title="The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus">Doctor Faustus</a></i>.</p>
<p>Burgess wrote that as a child he did not care at all about music. One day he heard on his home-built radio "a quite incredible flute solo, sinuous, exotic, erotic" and became spellbound. Eight minutes later the announcer told him he had been listening to <i><a href="../../../p/r/%C3%A9/Pr%C3%A9lude_%C3%A0_l%27apr%C3%A8s-midi_d%27un_faune.html" title="Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune">Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</a></i> (<i>Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun</i>) by <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Debussy_89de.html" title="Claude Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>. He refers to this as a "psychedelic moment... a recognition of verbally inexpressible spiritual realities". Suddenly music was very important to him. He eventually became of the opinion that music before the time of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Richard Wagner">Wagner</a> was orchestrally naive - it had little appeal to him. He announced to his family that he wanted to be a composer ("like Debussy" he said), but they were against it because "there was no money in it."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Music was not taught at his school so at about age 14 he strived to become a self-taught pianist, and in his spare time he would eventually turn himself into a composer<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Burgess's father died of flu in 1938 and his stepmother of a heart attack in 1940.</p>

<p>In 1940 Burgess began a rather unheroic wartime stint with the military, beginning with the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps_7dd3.html" title="Royal Army Medical Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a>, which included a period at a field ambulance station at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morpeth%2C_Northumberland_30e0.html" title="Morpeth, Northumberland">Morpeth</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. During this period he sometimes directed an army dance band.</p>
<p>He later moved to the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Educational_Corps_9a52.html" title="Army Educational Corps">Army Educational Corps</a>, where among other things he conducted speech therapy at a mental hospital. He failed in his aspiration to win an officer's commission.</p>
<p>In 1942 the marriage took place in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth.html" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> between Burgess and a Welshwoman named Llewela Jones, eldest daughter of a high-school headmaster. She was known to all as "Lynne". Although Burgess indicated on numerous occasions that her full name was Llewela Isherwood Jones, the name "Isherwood" does not appear on her birth certificate, and this appears to have been a fabrication. Nor was Lynne related to the writer <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Isherwood_b690.html" title="Christopher Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a> as many people had believed. Lynne and Burgess were fellow students at the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_University_of_Manchester_bd2e.html" title="Victoria University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>. Their marriage was childless, and, to put it mildly, explosive and tempestuous.</p>
<p>"I really do think, allowing for everything, Lynne was one of the most awful women I've ever met", one friend of the Burgesses once declared. But as Burgess's biographers have pointed out, Lynne provided much unacknowledged help to Burgess as he sought to establish himself as a writer - both financial and as his muse. Lynne died of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis.html" title="Alcoholic liver cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> in 1968.</p>

Here he was a training college lecturer in speech and drama, teaching German, Russian, French and Spanish. An important role for Burgess was the help he gave in taking the troops through "The British Way and Purpose" programme, which was designed to reintroduce them to the peacetime socialism of the post-war years in Britain and gently inculcate a sense of patriotism. He was also an instructor for the Central Advisory Council for Forces Education of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Education_%28United_Kingdom%29_5b82.html" title="Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Education</a>. On one occasion in the neighbouring Spanish town of La Linea, Burgess was arrested for insulting General Franco. It is not known if he spent a night in the cells, but he was released from custody shortly after the incident.</p>
<p>Burgess's flair for languages was noticed by army intelligence, and he took part in debriefings of Free Dutch and Free French who found refuge in Gibraltar during the war.</p>

<p>Burgess left the army with the rank of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant-major.html" title="Sergeant-major">sergeant-major</a> in 1946, and was for the next four years a lecturer in speech and drama at the Mid-West School of Education near <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton.html" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> and at the Bamber Bridge Emergency Teacher Training College (known as "the Brigg" and associated with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Birmingham_7145.html" title="University of Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>), which was situated near <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston.html" title="Preston">Preston</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of 1950 he took a job as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_school.html" title="Secondary school">secondary school</a> teacher of English literature on the staff of Banbury Grammar School (now defunct) in the market town of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banbury.html" title="Banbury">Banbury</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxfordshire.html" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a> (see <i>The Worm and the Ring</i>, which the then <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayoress.html" title="Mayoress">mayoress</a> of Banbury claimed libelled her). In addition to his teaching duties Burgess was required to supervise sports from time to time, and he ran the school's drama society.</p>
<p>The years were to be looked back on as some of the happiest of Burgess's life. Thanks to financial assistance provided by Lynne's father, the couple was able to put a downpayment on a cottage in the picturesque village of <a href="../../../a/d/d/Adderbury.html" title="Adderbury">Adderbury</a>, not far from Banbury.</p>
<p>Burgess organised a number of amateur theatrical events in his spare time. These involved local people and students and included productions of <a href="../../../t/2E/s/T.S._Eliot_43ca.html" title="T.S. Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a>'s <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i> (Burgess had named his Adderbury cottage Little Gidding, after one of Eliot's <i><a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Quartets_6b0b.html" title="Four Quartets">Four Quartets</a></i>) and <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldous_Huxley_db2b.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>'s <i>The Gioconda Smile</i>.</p>
<p>It was in Adderbury that Burgess cut his journalistic teeth, with several of his contributions published in the local newspaper the <i>Banbury Guardian</i>.</p>
<p>The would-be writer was a habitué of the pubs of the village, especially The Bell and The Red Lion, where his predilection for consuming large quantities of <a href="../../../c/i/d/Cider.html" title="Cider">cider</a> was noted at the time. Both he and his wife are believed to have been barred from one or more of the Adderbury pubs because of their riotous behaviour.</p>

<p>At the end of 1953 Burgess applied for a teaching post on the island of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sark.html" title="Sark">Sark</a>, but did not get the job. However, in January 1954 he was interviewed by the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Office_6483.html" title="Colonial Office">Colonial Office</a> for a post in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaya.html" title="Malaya">Malaya</a> (now <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>) as a teacher and education officer in the British colonial service. He was offered the job and accepted with alacrity, being keen to explore Eastern lands.

<p>Burgess was stationed initially in <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuala_Kangsar_f511.html" title="Kuala Kangsar">Kuala Kangsar</a>, the royal town in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perak.html" title="Perak">Perak</a>, in what were then known as the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federated_Malay_States_d719.html" title="Federated Malay States">Federated Malay States</a>. Here he taught at the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_College_Kuala_Kangsar_b3f4.html" title="Malay College Kuala Kangsar">Malay College</a>, dubbed "the Eton of the East" and now known as Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK).</p>
<p>In addition to his teaching duties at this school for the sons of leading Malayans, he had responsibilities as a <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_system.html" title="House system">housemaster</a> in charge of students of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preparatory_school_%28UK%29_c111.html" title="Preparatory school (UK)">preparatory school</a>, who were housed at a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_architecture.html" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</a> mansion known as "King's Pavilion".

It had also gained notoriety during World War II as a place of torture, being the local headquarters of the <i><a href="../../../k/e/m/Kempeitai.html" title="Kempeitai">Kempeitai</a></i> (Japanese secret police).</p>
<p>As his novels and autobiography document, Burgess's late 1950s coincided with the communist insurgency, an undeclared war known as the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayan_Emergency_6711.html" title="Malayan Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a> (1948-1960) when rubber planters and members of the European community – not to mention many Malays, Chinese and Tamils – were subject to frequent terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>Burgess and his wife had a reputation in Malaya for bolshiness. And so, in the aftermath of, but not necessarily consequent upon, an alleged dispute with the Malay College's principal, J.D.R. Powell, about accommodation for himself and his wife, Burgess was posted elsewhere. The couple occupied an apparently rather noisy apartment in the building mentioned above, where privacy was supposedly minimal, and this caused resentment. This was the professed reason for his transfer to the Malay Teachers' Training College at <a href="../../../k/o/t/Kota_Bharu_a856.html" title="Kota Bharu">Kota Bharu</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelantan.html" title="Kelantan">Kelantan</a>. Kota Bharu is situated on the Siamese border (the Thais had ceded the area to the British in 1909 and a British adviser had been installed).</p>
<p>Burgess attained fluency in Malay, spoken and written, achieving distinction in the examinations in the language set by the colonial office. He was rewarded with a salary increment for his proficiency in the language. Malay was still at that time rendered in the adapted Arabic script known as <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawi.html" title="Jawi">Jawi</a>. He spent much of his free time engaged in creative writing — "as a sort of gentlemanly hobby, because I knew there wasn't any money in it" — and published his first novels, <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_for_a_Tiger_e77e.html" title="Time for a Tiger">Time for a Tiger</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Enemy_in_the_Blanket_6760.html" title="The Enemy in the Blanket">The Enemy in the Blanket</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/e/d/Beds_in_the_East_61d4.html" title="Beds in the East">Beds in the East</a></i>.

During his time in the East he also wrote <i>English Literature: A Survey for Students</i>, and this book was in fact the first Burgess work published (if we do not count an essay published in the youth section of the London <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a></i> when Burgess was a child).</p>

<p>About this time Burgess "collapsed" in a Brunei classroom while teaching history. He was expounding on the causes and consequences of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Tea_Party_3189.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a> at the time. There were reports that he had been diagnosed as having an inoperable <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_tumour.html" title="Brain tumour">brain tumour</a>, with the likelihood of only surviving a short time, occasioning the alleged breakdown. Burgess has claimed that he was given just a year to live by the physicians, prompting him to write several novels to get money to provide for his widow. This is inaccurate, and has been explained by Burgess's biographers by reference to his (mild but mischievous) <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythomania.html" title="Mythomania">mythomania</a>. There was no tumour, nor was a tumour ever diagnosed. He was, however, suffering from the effects of prolonged heavy drinking (and associated poor nutrition), of the often oppressive Southeast Asian climate, of chronic constipation, and of overwork and professional disappointment. As he put it, the scions of the sultans and of the elite in Brunei "did not wish to be taught", because the free-flowing abundance of oil guaranteed their income and privileged status. He may also have wished for a pretext to abandon teaching and get going full-time as a writer, having made a late start.</p>
<p>Describing the Brunei debacle to an interviewer over twenty years later, Burgess commented: "One day in the classroom I decided that I'd had enough and to let others take over. I just lay down on the floor out of interest to see what would happen." On another occasion he described it as "a willed collapse out of sheer boredom and frustration". But he gave a different account to the British arts and media veteran <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Isaacs_5007.html" title="Jeremy Isaacs">Jeremy Isaacs</a> in 1987 when he said: "I was driven out of the Colonial Service for political reasons that were disguised as clinical reasons."</p>

<p>Burgess was repatriated and relieved of his position in Brunei. He spent some time in the neurological ward of a London hospital (see <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doctor_is_Sick_8733.html" title="The Doctor is Sick">The Doctor is Sick</a></i>) where he underwent cerebral tests that, as far as can be made out, proved negative.</p>
<p>On his discharge, benefiting from a sum of money Lynne had inherited from her father together with their savings built up over six years in the East, he decided he had the financial independence to become a full-time writer.</p>
<p>The couple lived first in an apartment in the town of <a href="../../../h/o/v/Hove.html" title="Hove">Hove</a>, near <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, on the <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex.html" title="Sussex">Sussex</a> coast (see the Enderby quartet of novels).

This is about a mile from the Jacobean house in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burwash.html" title="Burwash">Burwash</a> where <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudyard_Kipling_8a10.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> lived, and also one mile from the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robertsbridge.html" title="Robertsbridge">Robertsbridge</a> home of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Muggeridge_a42d.html" title="Malcolm Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a>. Finally, when Lynne came into some money as a result of the death of her father, the Burgesses decamped to a terraced town house in the Turnham Green section of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiswick.html" title="Chiswick">Chiswick</a>, a western inner suburb of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. This was conveniently located for the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_City_30ff.html" title="White City">White City</a> BBC television studios of which he was a frequent guest in this period.</p>

<p>The trilogy joined a family of such Eastern fictional explorations, among them <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">Orwell</a>'s Burma (<i><a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Days_6215.html" title="Burmese Days">Burmese Days</a></i>), <a href="../../../e/2E/m/E.M._Forster_ed0f.html" title="E.M.

Burgess was working in the tradition established by <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudyard_Kipling_8a10.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Kipling</a> for India and, for Southeast Asia in general, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Conrad_a506.html" title="Joseph Conrad">Conrad</a> and <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._Somerset_Maugham_0e2f.html" title="W. Somerset Maugham">Maugham</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Conrad, Maugham and Greene, who made no effort to learn local languages, but like Orwell (who had a good command of <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_language.html" title="Burmese language">Burmese</a>, necessary for his work as a police officer) and Kipling (who spoke <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, having learnt it as a child), Burgess had excellent spoken and written <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_language.html" title="Malay language">Malay</a>. This linguistic command results in an impressive authenticity and understanding of indigenous concerns in the trilogy.</p>
<p>Burgess's repatriate years (c. 1960-69) produced not just <a href="../../../e/n/d/Enderby_%28Anthony_Burgess%29_d0f1.html" title="Enderby (Anthony Burgess)">Enderby</a> but the neglected <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Right_to_an_Answer_ae78.html" title="The Right to an Answer">The Right to an Answer</a></i>, which touches on the theme of death and dying, and <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Hand_Clapping_%28novel%29_f3e3.html" title="One Hand Clapping (novel)">One Hand Clapping</a></i>, partly a satire on the vacuity of popular culture. This era also witnessed the publication of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Worm_and_the_Ring_a005.html" title="The Worm and the Ring">The Worm and the Ring</a></i>, which was withdrawn from circulation under the threat of libel action from one of Burgess's former colleagues.</p>
<p>A product of these highly fertile years was his best-known work (or most notorious, after <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Kubrick_762f.html" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> made a <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_%28film%29_0d45.html" title="A Clockwork Orange (film)">motion picture adaptation</a>), the dystopian <i>tour de force</i> <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i> (1962). Inspired initially by an incident during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in which his wife Lynne was allegedly robbed and assaulted in London during the blackout by deserters from the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> (an event that may have contributed to a miscarriage she suffered), the book was an examination of free will and morality. The young <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-hero</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_DeLarge_69d1.html" title="Alex DeLarge">Alex</a>, captured after a career of violence and mayhem, is given aversion conditioning to stop his violence. It makes him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy the music (especially Beethoven, and more specifically the Ninth Symphony) that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him.</p>
<p>Burgess followed this with <i><a href="../../../%28/a/n/%28Anthony_Burgess%27s%29_Nothing_Like_the_Sun_5513.html" title="(Anthony Burgess's) Nothing Like the Sun">Nothing Like the Sun</a></i>, a fictional recreation of Shakespeare's love-life and an examination of the (partly syphilitic, it was implied) sources of the bard's imaginative vision. The novel, which made some use of Edgar I. Fripp's 1938 biography <i>Shakespeare, Man and Artist</i>, won critical acclaim and placed Burgess in the front rank of novelists of his generation.</p>

<p>By the 1970s his output had become highly experimental, and some see a falling-off in this period. Indeed, Burgess has been considered by some critics to be uneven in the quality of his output, and he has been faulted for what has been called a "novelettish kind of dialogue". The bold and extraordinarily complex <i><a href="../../../m/2F/f/M_F_fb27.html" title="M/F">M/F</a></i> (1971) showed the influence of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss_37a9.html" title="Claude Lévi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a> and the structuralists, and was later listed by the writer himself as one of the works of which he was most proud. <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard%27s_Roman_Women_cb04.html" title="Beard's Roman Women">Beard's Roman Women</a></i> is considered by some to be his least successful novel (plea of mitigation: it was written entirely while on the road in his <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford_Dormobile_85b2.html" title="Bedford Dormobile">Bedford Dormobile</a> campervan). Burgess has frequently been criticised for writing too many novels and too quickly. All the same, <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard%27s_Roman_Women_cb04.html" title="Beard's Roman Women">Beard</a></i> was revealing on a personal level, dealing with the death of his first wife, his bereavement, and the affair that led to his second marriage.</p>
<p>In another ambitious and unashamedly modernist fictional expedition, <i><a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Symphony_0d39.html" title="Napoleon Symphony">Napoleon Symphony</a></i>, Burgess brought <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonaparte.html" title="Bonaparte">Bonaparte</a> to life by shaping the novel's structure on <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._3_%28Beethoven%29_2c37.html" title="Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)">Eroica</a></i> symphony. This daring fictional experiment contains among many other assets a superb portrait of an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> society under occupation by a Christian western power (<a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_French_Empire_8d79.html" title="First French Empire">France</a>). The novel showed that while Burgess always regarded himself as little more than a student and epigone of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">Joyce</a>, he was able at times to equal the master of modernism in literary sophistication and range.</p>
<p>There was a triumphant return to form in the 1980s, when religious themes began to weigh heavily (see <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kingdom_of_the_Wicked_c82c.html" title="The Kingdom of the Wicked">The Kingdom of the Wicked</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_of_Nazareth_d017.html" title="Man of Nazareth">Man of Nazareth</a></i> as well as <i><a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthly_Powers_a253.html" title="Earthly Powers">Earthly Powers</a></i>). Though Burgess lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth, the influence of the Catholic "training" and worldview remained strong in his work all his life. This is notable in the discussion of free will in <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i>, and in the apocalyptic vision of devastating changes in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> – due to what can be understood as <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satanic</a> influence – in <i><a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthly_Powers_a253.html" title="Earthly Powers">Earthly Powers</a></i> (1980). That work was written in the first instance as a parody of the blockbuster novel.</p>
<p>He kept working through his final illness, and was writing on his deathbed. A late novel was <i><a href="../../../a/n/y/Any_Old_Iron_1858.html" title="Any Old Iron">Any Old Iron</a></i>, a generational saga about two families, one Russian-Welsh, the other Jewish. It encompasses the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, World War II, and the early years of the State of Israel, as well as the imagined rediscovery of King Arthur's Excalibur. <i><a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Dead_Man_in_Deptford_a2a9.html" title="A Dead Man in Deptford">A Dead Man in Deptford</a></i>, about Christopher Marlowe, is a kind of companion volume to his Shakespeare novel <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/Nothing_Like_the_Sun%7E_A_Story_of_Shakespeare%27s_Love_Life_4923.html" title="Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life">Nothing Like the Sun</a></i>. The verse novel <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/Byrne%7E_A_Novel_1c08.html" title="Byrne: A Novel">Byrne</a></i> was published posthumously.</p>

<p>Burgess began his career as a critic with a well regarded text designed originally for use outside English-speaking countries. Aimed at newcomers to the subject, <i>English Literature, A Survey for Students</i> is still used in many schools today. He followed this with <i>The Novel To-day</i> and <i>The Novel Now: A Student's Guide to Contemporary Fiction</i>.</p>
<p>Then came the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">Joyce</a> studies <i>Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for the Ordinary Reader</i> (also published as <i>Re Joyce</i>) and <i><a href="../../../j/o/y/Joysprick.html" title="Joysprick">Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce</a></i>. Also published was <i>A Shorter 'Finnegans Wake'</i>, Burgess's abridgement.</p>

<p>Burgess wrote full-length critical studies of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway and D.H. Lawrence. His <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninety-nine_Novels_e67c.html" title="Ninety-nine Novels">Ninety-Nine Novels</a>: The Best in English since 1939</i> remains an invaluable guide, while the published lecture <i>Obscenity and the Arts</i> explores issues of pornography.</p>

<p>"I start at the beginning, go to the end, then stop", Burgess once said.</p>
<p>He revealed in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Seymour-Smith_a974.html" title="Martin Seymour-Smith">Martin Seymour-Smith</a>'s <i>Novels and Novelists: A Guide to the World of Fiction</i> (1980) that he would often prepare a synopsis with a name-list before beginning a project. But Seymour-Smith wrote: "Burgess believes overplanning is fatal to creativity and regards his <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconscious_mind.html" title="Unconscious mind">unconscious mind</a> and the act of writing itself as indispensable guides. He does not produce a draft of a whole novel which he then revises, but prefers to get one page finished before he goes on to the next, which involves a good deal of revision and correction."</p>
<p>His output from when he began writing professionally in his early forties until his death was to produce, at a minimum, 1,000 words of fair copy per day, weekends included, 365 days a year. His favoured time for working was the afternoon, since "the unconscious mind has a habit of asserting itself in the afternoon".</p>

<li>Burgess had a long-term grievance about being confused with two members of the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Five_bcf7.html" title="Cambridge Five">Cambridge Five</a>: one of the five was <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Burgess_bd5c.html" title="Guy Burgess">Guy Burgess</a> and another <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Blunt_4480.html" title="Anthony Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a>. Unfortunately, by the time they achieved notoriety, Anthony Burgess's pen-name was well established. He succeeded in extracting an apology from the Paris-based <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Herald_Tribune_e6b0.html" title="International Herald Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a></i> in 1983 after the newspaper referred to him in print as "The spy, Anthony Burgess". <i>The <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">Sunday Times</a></i> newspaper perpetrated a similar error in 1999, referring to "the other British defectors, Anthony Burgess, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Duart_Maclean_4f32.html" title="Donald Duart Maclean">Donald Maclean</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Blake_671b.html" title="George Blake">George Blake</a>".</li>

<li>Burgess is believed by some, though this is highly conjectural, to have engaged in low-level espionage during his Gibraltar, Malaya and Brunei years and possibly later. See, for example, the London <i><a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_on_Sunday_2c7f.html" title="Mail on Sunday">Mail on Sunday</a></i>, "The greatest story Anthony Burgess never told: his life as a secret agent"; and many other media articles in this not very authoritative but intriguing vein. It is speculated that he may have provided his superiors (the Colonial Office and perhaps the Kuala Lumpur-based British intelligence authorities, and later <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a>) with information about any <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> actions or sympathies, however trivial, among his colleagues and students and, after his return from the East, among the people he met and associated with. Since lives were at stake during the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayan_Emergency_6711.html" title="Malayan Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, this would not have been an unusual or exceptionable activity – in fact it might well have been regarded as irresponsible not to assist in this way. The term used for an operative of this type and pay-grade was "ground observer", and he would have been providing his information to <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a>'s East Asian operation through Singapore. His biographer Roger Lewis claimed that while at the Malayan Teachers' Training College in Kota Bharu, Burgess "was part of a secret plan, in 1955, for the chief ministers of Malaya and Singapore to meet the leader of the outlawed Malayan Communist Party in a jungle clearing".</li>
<li>Military authorities who came across a copy of Joyce's <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnegans_Wake_199e.html" title="Finnegans Wake">Finnegans Wake</a></i> in Burgess's possession in 1941 thought it was some kind of code book.</li>
<li>Burgess published a fictional work in the <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Fleming_7c1f.html" title="Ian Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> genre which he entitled <i>Tremor of Intent: An Eschatological Spy Novel</i> (1966).</li>
<li>He wrote the preface to the Bond novels under the Coronet imprint.</li>
<li>Burgess prepared a screenplay for the James Bond feature <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>, which <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_R._Broccoli_b00b.html" title="Albert R. Broccoli">Albert R. Broccoli</a> produced in 1977. It was turned down. Burgess wrote: "My script...was rejected, but my oil tanker (a camouflaged floating palace for the chief villain) was retained."</li>
<li>Burgess's biographer <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Lewis_6bd6.html" title="Roger Lewis">Roger Lewis</a> claimed that when he returned from his Burgess research trip to Malaysia in 1999, he met an ex-spy who "told me that Burgess had had dealings with the CIA and that the mind control experiments in A Clockwork Orange, which was written in 1961, were not the novelist's invention....I was told to look closely at what was written on the college pennants that the novel's main character, Alex, had on his bedroom wall: South 4; Metro cor-skol blue division; the boys of alpha. This, I was told, was an encryption. The words could be decoded to give the map reference to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Bliss_de94.html" title="Fort Bliss">Fort Bliss</a>, Texas, where experiments on interfering with the alpha wavelengths of the human brain were being conducted. The word bliss, moreover, appears on this same page six times".</li>
<li>When he asked the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> if it would be in a position to release its files on John Wilson (Anthony Burgess), Lewis received this response: "We must neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of any records. It has been determined that such information would be classified for reasons of national security under sections 1.5(c) (intelligence sources and methods) and 1.5(d) (foreign relations) of Executive Order 12958."</li>

<li>Burgess was dismissed as literary critic for the English provincial newspaper the <i><a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Post_68dc.html" title="Yorkshire Post">Yorkshire Post</a></i> after he wrote a review of his own <i><a href="../../../i/n/s/Inside_Mr._Enderby_d246.html" title="Inside Mr. Enderby">Inside Mr. Enderby</a></i> and it appeared in the newspaper. The novel had been published under the pseudonym Joseph Kell, and the newspaper's editor did not know that Kell was Burgess. Burgess protested, to no avail, that <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Scott_51ea.html" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a> had also once reviewed one of his own novels. The offending review, which was not at all commendatory, read in part: "This is, in many ways, a dirty book. It is full of bowel-blasts and flatulent <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borborygms.html" title="Borborygms">borborygms</a>, emetic meals...and halitosis. It may well make some people sick....It turns sex, religion, the State into a series of laughing-stocks. The book itself is a laughing-stock."</li>
<li>When Burgess applied for the job of schoolteacher at Banbury Grammar school in 1950, he claimed in his résumé to be the co-author, with "Dr. H.P. Bridges", of a soon-to-be-published work entitled <i>Engelsk Grammatik</i>. This was a complete fabrication.</li>
<li>London's <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i> newspaper published in the 1960s a number of comically puritanical letters written by Burgess purporting to be from an Indian Muslim named "Mohammed Ali", who expressed for the benefit of <i>Mail</i> readers his utter disgust at the degradation of contemporary western morals.</li>
<li>In the novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Enemy_in_the_Blanket_6760.html" title="The Enemy in the Blanket">The Enemy in the Blanket</a></i>, Burgess calls the state's main town <i>Kenching</i>, which is "urine" in Malay, while another place is named <i>Tahi Panas</i> ("steaming excrement").</li>
<li>Burgess was dismissed from a job he held for a short time as a pub pianist after he insisted on playing, in its entirety, the Jupiter part of <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Holst_6fa2.html" title="Gustav Holst">Holst's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Planets_3af3.html" title="The Planets">The Planets</a></i>.</li>
<li>James Joyce's <i><a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses.html" title="Ulysses">Ulysses</a></i> was banned in Britain when Burgess was a teenager. When he was 15 he travelled to France to procure a copy, which he smuggled back into England "cut up into sections and distributed all over my body".</li>

<ul>
<li>Burgess's multilingual proficiency came under discussion in <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Lewis_6bd6.html" title="Roger Lewis">Roger Lewis</a>'s <a href="../../../a/_/l/Anthony_Burgess%7E_A_Life_49cc.html" title="Anthony Burgess: A Life">2002 biography</a>. Lewis claimed that during production in Malaysia of the BBC documentary <i>A Kind of Failure</i> (1982), Burgess, supposedly fluent in Malay, was unable to communicate with several waitresses at a restaurant where they were filming. It was claimed also that the documentary's director deliberately kept these moments intact in the film in order to expose Burgess's linguistic pretensions. There was a mixed response to the charge. For example, one critic appeared to accept the veracity of the claim, saying it "had me laughing immoderately", while another dismissed it as "another of Lewis's little smears". A letter from David Wallace that appeared in the magazine of the London <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_on_Sunday_18bb.html" title="Independent on Sunday">Independent on Sunday</a></i> newspaper on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">25 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> shed light on the affair. Wallace's letter read, in part: "…the tale was inaccurate. It tells of Burgess, the great linguist, 'bellowing Malay at a succession of Malayan waitresses' but 'unable to make himself understood'. The source of this tale was a 20-year-old BBC documentary....[The suggestion was] that the director left the scene in, in order to poke fun at the great author. Not so, and I can be sure, as I was that director…. The story as seen on television made it clear that Burgess knew that these waitresses were not Malay. It was a Chinese restaurant and Burgess's point was that the ethnic Chinese had little time for the government-enforced national language, <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahasa_Malaysia_4084.html" title="Bahasa Malaysia">Bahasa Malaysia</a> [i.e. Malay]. Burgess may well have had an accent, but he did speak the language; it was the girls in question who did not." Lewis may not have been fully aware of the fact that a quarter of Malaysia's population is made up of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Min_Nan_c360.html" title="Min Nan">Hokkien</a>- and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Cantonese (linguistics)">Cantonese</a>-speaking <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Malaysian_8a23.html" title="Chinese Malaysian">Chinese</a>. However, Malay had been installed as the National Language with the installation of the Language Act of 1967. By 1982 all national primary and secondary schools in Malaysia would have been teaching with <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahasa_Melayu_27dd.html" title="Bahasa Melayu">Bahasa Melayu</a> as a base language (see Harold Crouch, <i>Government and Society in Malaysia</i>, Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996).</li>
<li>During his years in Malaya, and after he had mastered <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawi.html" title="Jawi">Jawi</a>, the Arabic script adapted for Malay, Burgess taught himself the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a>, after which he produced a translation of Eliot's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Waste_Land_0ba4.html" title="The Waste Land">The Waste Land</a></i> into Persian. It was never published, in Tehran or elsewhere. He also worked on an anthology of the best of English literature translated into Malay, which also failed to achieve publication.</li>
<li>Anthony Burgess, known in Argentina as the British Borges, and <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_Luis_Borges_2dc9.html" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, known in Britain as the Argentine Burgess, each spoke both English and Spanish fluently. But when Burgess and Borges met, each decided it would be unequal and unfair to the other, and inappropriate, to plump for either of the two languages when conversing. So the polyglot pair forged a compromise, deciding to conduct their lengthy, wide-ranging philological and literary conversations in <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_language_82eb.html" title="Old Norse language">Old Norse</a>. (However, this may be apocryphal: another account has them merely reciting a poem in Old English together.)</li>

The <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_and_tonic.html" title="Gin and tonic">gin and tonic</a>, preferred beverage both of Burgess and of his first wife Lynne</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Burgess was by most accounts a heavy consumer of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverages.html" title="Alcoholic beverages">alcoholic beverages</a>, especially of <a href="../../../c/i/d/Cider.html" title="Cider">cider</a> during his Banbury/Adderbury years, of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy.html" title="Brandy">brandy</a>-and-<a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger_beer.html" title="Ginger beer">ginger</a> in the East, and, throughout his life, of <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">gin</a>. He did not drink as heavily as his first wife Lynne, an <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic.html" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a> who lost her life to <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liver_cirrhosis.html" title="Liver cirrhosis">liver cirrhosis</a>; yet when the couple were living at Etchingham, they are reported to have consumed half a dozen bottles of gin a week.</li>
<li>Burgess created his own <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocktail.html" title="Cocktail">cocktail</a>, called "Hangman's Blood". He described its preparation as follows: "Into a pint glass, doubles [i.e. 50ml measures] of the following are poured: <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">gin</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rum.html" title="Rum">rum</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_wine.html" title="Port wine">port</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy.html" title="Brandy">brandy</a>. A small bottle of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stout.html" title="Stout">stout</a> is added and the whole topped up with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne_%28beverage%29.html" title="Champagne (beverage)">Champagne</a>... It tastes very smooth, induces a somewhat metaphysical elation, and rarely leaves a hangover."</li>
<li>In his middle years Burgess often drank <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>, and in Malaya the two brands he enjoyed were <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Beer_a5af.html" title="Tiger Beer">Tiger</a> and Anchor beer, brewed in both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. He reveals in his autobiography that, when <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_for_a_Tiger_e77e.html" title="Time for a Tiger">Time for a Tiger</a></i> was published, he asked the manufacturer, then Fraser and Neave, for a complimentary clock with the Tiger beer slogan on it. The brewery declined to offer this or any other freebie. Fourteen years later, when Burgess was better known, it relented: the clocks were apparently no longer available, but in 1970 the company told Burgess he could consume any of their beers free of charge while in Singapore, with their compliments. "But it was too late." Burgess wrote, "I had become wholly a <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">gin</a> man."</li>
<li>Burgess cut his alcohol consumption to some extent in later life. "I drank too much until I was 50", he wrote. He often substituted <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea.html" title="Tea">tea</a>. For his morning "cuppa", he habitually suffused up to six tea-bags per small teapot. And when drinking tea from a (pint-sized) mug at other times of the day, multiple tea-bags were also used. His preferred brand of tea was <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twinings.html" title="Twinings">Twining's</a> Irish Breakfast. He said of his dietary habits late in life: "I drink two gallons of overstrong tea each day and mumble a bit of stale bread."</li>

<li>He was <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short-sighted.html" title="Short-sighted">short-sighted</a> — myopic from the age of 10 — although reluctant to wear spectacles. He claimed that he once walked into a bank, leaned against the counter and ordered a drink.</li>

<li>He was diagnosed by a physician in <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Tunbridge_Wells_f353.html" title="Royal Tunbridge Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, Kent, as suffering from <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buerger%27s_disease.html" title="Buerger's disease">Bürger's disease</a> — his heavy alcohol consumption contributing to the condition. He described the symptoms thus: "toothache in the right calf, and a sudden accession of pins and needles, like a monstrous toilet flush, in the right foot."</li>
<li>During his Malayan years he went down on one or more occasions, as most then did, with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dengue.html" title="Dengue">dengue</a> (sandfly fever) and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>.</li>
<li>Burgess suffered what was reported as a collapse in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunei_Town_6111.html" title="Brunei Town">Brunei Town</a> in 1959, apparently occasioned by overwork, indications of incipient (rather than chronic) <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a>, and poor <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrition.html" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a>. He had to be airlifted to England for tests and treatment. When he was repatriated, he was treated by the neurologist <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Bannister_324d.html" title="Roger Bannister">Roger Bannister</a>, who in his days as an athlete had been the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. Burgess claimed to have been trepanned by Dr Bannister.</li>
<li>He suffered from what he referred to as the Writer's Evil (<a href="../../../h/a/e/Haemorrhoids.html" title="Haemorrhoids">haemorrhoids</a>).</li>
<li>Burgess had a bout of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chickenpox.html" title="Chickenpox">chickenpox</a> in 1969.</li>
<li>He had <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_blood_pressure.html" title="High blood pressure">high blood pressure</a>, which caused problems with his arteries.</li>
<li>Burgess was addicted to <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>. He was diagnosed with <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in October 1992, and was shortly thereafter to die of the disease at the age of 76.</li>
<li>He walked with a limp and often carried a stick.</li>
<li>He was un<a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcise.html" title="Circumcise">circumcised</a>.</li>
<li>He used <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dexedrine.html" title="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</a> to aid concentration while working. On unproductive days, he would take two or three Dexedrine tablets, washed down with a pint of <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_and_tonic.html" title="Gin and tonic">gin and tonic</a> (with ice cubes - he described unchilled gin as "an emetic").</li>
<li>His mitral valve was leaky.</li>
<li>Burgess nursed a lifelong hatred for <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_fitness.html" title="Physical fitness">physical fitness</a> and its advocates and exponents. He conceived this antipathy in wartime Gibraltar, where the army put himself and other soldiers through a compulsory, and gruelling, programme of exercise. "Keep-fit men", he once stated, "are no good in bed." One of the reasons he apparently despised the Welshman J.D.R. ("Jimmy") Howell, headmaster of the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_College_0c37.html" title="Malay College">Malay College</a> where he taught in the 1950s, was that Howell was an enthusiastic rugby player.</li>

<li>Burgess made no secret of his determination throughout his career to thwart <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a> authorities worldwide. "I will, naturally, cheat the fiscal tyrants, but it would be inhuman not to", he wrote.</li>
<li>Burgess's preferred medium of payment for his work, he indicated, was "non-taxable cash", and he maintained one or more <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_bank.html" title="Swiss bank">Swiss bank</a> accounts.</li>
<li>He kept to a strict personal rule of not accepting a publisher's advance on work not written.</li>

<li>Burgess was a currency smuggler. His house in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bracciano.html" title="Bracciano">Bracciano</a> was, he wrote, paid for "by smuggling dollar royalty cheques into the [Italian] peninsula and paying them into the bank account of an expatriate American sculptor living near Rome".</li>
<li>His move to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monaco.html" title="Monaco">Monaco</a> in 1974 was prompted by the knowledge that there is no income tax in the principality, and moreover that his widow Liana would not be required to pay death duties on his estate.</li>

<p>For a brief period during his studies of the Malay language and culture during the late 1950s, Burgess seriously considered becoming a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>.</p>
<p>Explaining the allure of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> in a 1969 interview with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a> scholar Geoffrey Aggeler, Burgess remarked: "You believe in one God. You say your prayers five times a day. You have a tremendous amount of freedom, sexual freedom; you can have four wives. The wife herself has a commensurate freedom.

<p>He later fantasized: "Four wives and an incalculable number of offspring, all attesting my virility and sustained by my patriarchal authority."</p>
<p>In the novel <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Five_32f5.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Five">1985</a></i> (1978), Burgess imagines what Britain might be like if a virile, triumphant Islam won far-reaching influence in the country.</p>

<li>Ironically in view of this, Burgess has been dubbed "the Godfather of <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">Punk</a>" because of the vivid nihilist world he created in the novel <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i>.</li>

<li>Anthony Burgess was known to many people in Italy, where he lived for several years, as Antonio Borghese.</li>
<li>He also published under his real name John Burgess Wilson and the pen-name Joseph Kell.</li>
<li>Burgess considered the composer <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Bourgeois_4151.html" title="Derek Bourgeois">Derek Bourgeois</a> to be his alter ego.</li>
<li>There is a prominent <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th-century.html" title="17th-century">17th-century</a> Anthony Burgess, also a writer. A <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastor.html" title="Pastor">pastor</a> at a church in <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutton_Coldfield_73c8.html" title="Sutton Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a>, Anthony Burgess was the author of such works as <i>The Doctrine of Original Sin</i> and <i>A Vindication of the Moral Law</i>. The modern Burgess had an ambivalent attitude towards conversion. He tended to contrast, in certain respects unfavourably or at least cynically, the camp of cradle Catholics, in which was included such writers as <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilaire_Belloc_fcde.html" title="Hilaire Belloc">Belloc</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">Joyce</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Braine_e432.html" title="John Braine">Braine</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lodge_%28author%29_6833.html" title="David Lodge (author)">Lodge</a> and himself, with that of converts such as <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_Manley_Hopkins_d51a.html" title="Gerard Manley Hopkins">Hopkins</a>, <a href="../../../g/2E/k/G.K._Chesterton_e29d.html" title="G.K.

So it may be significant that his namesake Pastor Anthony Burgess's most important work is entitled <i>Spiritual Refining: The Anatomy of True &amp; False Conversion</i>. Still regarded as useful, it remains in print, and is published by International Outreach Incorporated.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th-century.html" title="20th-century">20th-century</a> Anthony Burgess of note, also a writer. Like his more famous namesake, Anthony Burgess was fascinated by musical theatre and authored two acclaimed works on the subject, <i>The Notary in Opera</i> (1994) and <i>The Notary and Other Lawyers in Gilbert and Sullivan</i> (1997). A noted linguist, notary public and sometime Master of The <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Scriveners_52c3.html" title="Worshipful Company of Scriveners">Worshipful Company of Scriveners</a> of the City of London (aka The Mysterie of Writers of the Court Lettern), Anthony Burgess was a partner in the firm of Cheeswright, Casey &amp; Murly. He lived from 1925 to 2006. Given their shared interest in opera and foreign languages, it is interesting (though idle) to speculate on whether the two Anthony Burgesses ever met.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st-century.html" title="21st-century">21st-century</a> Anthony Burgess, a banker who is head of European mergers &amp; acquisitions at <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Bank_93b5.html" title="Deutsche Bank">Deutsche Bank</a>.</li>
