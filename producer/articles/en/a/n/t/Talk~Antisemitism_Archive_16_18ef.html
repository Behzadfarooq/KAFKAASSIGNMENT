<h2><span class="mw-headline">Semitic-speaking people</span></h2>
<p>Semite. 1. A member of a group of Semitic-speaking peoples of the Near East and northern Africa, including the Arabs, Arameans, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Ethiopians, Hebrews, and Phoenicians. 2. A Jew. 3. Bible. A descendant of Shem.</p>
<p>This article is an exmaple of liguistic hijacking.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Untrue. The article reflects the term in the way it is used. And the problem you raise is dealt with:</dd>
<dd><i>The term has always referred to prejudice towards Jews alone, and not to other people who speak semitic languages (e.g., Arabs) and this has been the only use of this word for more than a century. In recent decades some people have argued that the term anti-Semitism should be extended to include prejudice against Arabs, since Arabic is a semitic language. However, this usage has not been widely adopted.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Despite the use of the prefix "anti," the terms Semitic and Anti-Semitic are not antonyms</b>. To avoid the confusion of the misnomer, many writers on the subject (such as Emil Fackenheim of the Hebrew University) now favor the unhyphenated term antisemitism.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe a couple of sentences could be added to this, but it's not reasonable to suggest that the article does not deal with the term anti-Semitism in a NPOV-way, I think. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 13:50, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For better or worse, English is not a particularly logical language. "Anti-Semite" does not mean "against Semites", though that would make sense in a theoretical way, and some people have recently tried to re-define it that way for political reasons. The history of the term anti-Semite is complex and interesting; I recommend you study it. Since your objection to this article appears to be based purely on an objection to a well understood English term with a long history, I'm going to remove the NPOV marker; an article is not POV simply because you think the English language is biased.

<dd>The best example, in the UK, is the word <i>swearing</i>. From the religious (Christian POV) swearing is "A profain Oath" it is n't just naughty words, like fuck etc. How ever various people wanted to claim a religous prohibition against words like 'fuck' etc. So they stole the term, so in the moder UK, the commandment. "Though shalt not swear" is taken to mean don't use these naughty words. Were as really it should stop Christians "swearing on the bible", in court the should "affirm" instead. So the word swearing has been hijacked. This subject should be renamed "discrimination/racism against Jews". This article just promotes the hijacking.--<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">Jirate</a> 15:23, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word means what it means, and when people want to look up this topic on Wikipedia, they will look under anti-Semitism. If your campaign to get the English language to be less "abusive" in this area is ever successful then your suggestions might have value.

<dd>Anti-Israel activists often object to the term "anti-Semitic", assuming that Jews have "hijacked" the term "Semite" for their own use, part of their on-going "campaign" to disenfranchise and abuse Arabs. This notion is often expressed in the specious argument "Arabs can't be anti-Semitic, they're Semites as well." Of course, this ignores the fact that even Jews can be anti-Semites. More importantly, it shows a profound ignorance of the history of the term itself, which was invented and intended by the German anti-Semite Wilhelm Marr to describe Jews only, and which was used exclusively that way for a over century now. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 13:59, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)--<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">Jirate</a> 14:18, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I think you are confusing Israeli (vs. anti-Zionist) and Jew (vs. anti-Semite) here. anti-Semitism targets Jews not Israelis. In fact many Jews opposed it, a century ago and many anti-Semites supported the creation of Israel, with for example Adolf Eichmann (and he's certainly one of the most murderous anti-Semites in history) going on a visit to Palestine to find out if that could be the solution to the "Jewish question". I'm not trying to be flippant and insensitive, but sometimes it looks to me like Zionists have adopted a point from the anti-Semitic agenda, for very good reasons, but personally I still regard it as a "victory" for anti-Semitism. Some Jewish anti-Zionists I know say that the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust was to "build the walls around the ghetto higher".

<p>It's always amusing to come to a new forum and discover the same silly and ignorant argument being repeated. It happens every time with "anti-semitism"; no matter how carefully and precisely the origin of the term is explained -- as a te`rm coined by Jew-haters to describe their own hatred of Jews -- some people would rather snark than read and think. Guinea pigs are neither pigs nor from Guinea. The Holy Roman Empire was not holy, Roman, nor an empire. And "antisemitism" doesn't mean "opposition to Semites". Sure, there was linguistic hijacking -- by Wilhelm Marr, for the purpose of prettying up his (highly intellectualized) hatred.

<dd>The hyphen is irrelevant, other than the apparent confusion it causes some folk etymologists (and some people who are offended that there's a special word for Jew-hatred.) The original word was German: <i>antisemitismus</i>. The German language runs words together to form compound words. English generally does not do that, and instead hyphenates to produce the same result. "anti-semitism", "anti-Semitism", and "antisemitism"are simply alternate orthography for the same thing. <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">Jpgordon</a> 22:12, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These definitions are a bit puzzling. Are any usage references provided by the American Heritage Dictionary or Websters showing "anti-semitism" meaning hatred of any Semitic people other than Jews? Seems doubtful to me, since (at least until recently) there hasn't been any particular tradition among English-speaking people of organized and systemic prejudiced against other Semitic peoples based upon their Semitism. (Sure, there's the generic racism against anyone non-white and non-European, but that's a fairly different category of bigotry.) <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">Jpgordon</a> 22:12, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i think there should be recognition that many Arabs consider themselves Semitic (even though this may be semantically incorrect)and following from that, when they are actually looking for an article on anti Arabism, they may incorrectly look to the Anti Semitism page.</p>
<p>Could someone well versed with the issues, look into this topic, anti arabism and racism&#160;?</p>
<p>i tried to do it, but this is a sensitve issue and i may have inadvertently stepped on some toes, in my few amaturish attempts.</p>

<dd>Well, now that Ashcroft has time on his hands, perhaps he can be induced to explain why locking up 5,000 Arabs in the US indefinitely without due process, right to counsel, notifying their families, etc. (with a net yield of zero terrorism-related arrests, detentions, deporations, or anything else) is not antiArabism, just good security. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 17:43, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A few points. For the unsigned question above, it is completely accurate to refer to Arabs as a Semitic people; nothing semantically incorrect there. The article does discuss accurately how and why the expression "anti-semitism" is a synonym for "hatred of Jews": it was coined by a Jew-hater to describe his fellow Jew-haters, and though it seems contrary to common sense, word etymologies and meanings sometimes are contrary to common sense. I'm not sure what relevance Gzuckier's comment has; the assertion that the term "anti-Semitism" does not mean "opposition to all groups classified as Semitic" does not in any way deny that anti-Arabism exists (which it obviously does.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 18:04, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a matter that has been gone over and over and over in archived discussions. In its original technial sense, no one was "semetic:" the term refers to a family of languages and Arabic is a semetic language as is Hebrew. In the technical sense, no one is a "semite," there are only speakers of a "semetic" language. In the 1800s a German coined the term "Anti-Semitism" -- a <i>neologism</i> -- to refer to race-based hatred of Jews. The term "Anti-Semitism" does not refer to anything else. It doesn't mean "people who hate semitic languages" for example. Now, I admit that the history of these words is not "logical" but the history of language and words and ideas seldome is logical. Why do people drive on parkways and park on driveways? Language just doesn't make sense like that. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<dd>I feel strongly that this article should be marked "No Neutral Point of View Possible" because in the four-way collision between: anti-Semites wanting to repeat slanders while claiming their motivation is scholarly, investigative, or whatever; Jewish supremacists who want to tar all opposition with the brush of racism; persons interested in European social history; and the rest of us, there does not seem to be a single point all parties are willing to agree on.

<p>You are saying that the article is "controversial," <i>not</i> that its neutrality is in question. "Neutral" does not mean that all parties agree. In fact, that no one agrees may be a sign of "neutrality. However, I would even balk at labeling the article controversial. You seem to be saying that the <i>topic</i> is controversial. Well, if that is the case, of course some of the controversy will leak into the article. But that doesn't make the article controversial. It is the topic itself that is conctroversial. Instead of having a warning tag "This article is controversial" it is better to say, somewhere in the first paragraph, that anti-Semitism is a controversial topics because people who claim to be victims of anti-Semitism and people accused of anti-Semitism seldom agree on what anti-Semitism is. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<dd>Zain left a note on my page asking for help with his edit: "The <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, Islam's holy book, criticizes those Jews who corrupted and are not following the Hebrew Bible .For Jews and Christians (and others) who (1) believe in God (2) believe in Hereafter (3) Lead righteous life, will receive recompense from their Lord." <a href="http://www.submission.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.submission.org/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Zain, the problem with this, as I see it, is twofold, First, you're introducing a quote from a religious text published out of context by an unidentified website in California. That aside, the quote doesn't say much, and is arguably quite sinister. It says that those who, in the opinion of whoever is interpreting the Qur'an at any given time, hold certain beliefs and lead a life that, in the opinion of the person interpreting the Qur'an, is a <i>righteous</i> one, where the word "righteous" is not defined, then those people will received recompense in a life to come — which implies they may not receive recompense in this life. And so this is a problematic quote to insert as evidence of anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This section is about anti-Semitism and Islam so what the Qur'an says is relevant so long as those accused of being anti-Semitic refer to the Qur'an to back up their views. Have prominent Muslim religious or political leaders quoted from the Qur'an when trying to prove a point about Jewish people? If so, it would make sense to quote someone doing that to back up Jayjg's point. Or have prominent Muslim leaders said "Muslims shouldn't pay attention to what the Qur'an says about Jews: it was all written a long time ago", because that would back up Zain's point.</dd>

<dd>okay, you misunderstand the policy that Wikipedia is not a dictionary. It is true that articles are not "really" about definitions. But that does not mean that the history of definitions and usages, and etymologies are irrelevant. How people use a term is important to understanding it, and how the definitions and uses have changed over time is almost essential to understand any debates over a term. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 22:30, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did the latest addition of another Der Sturmer caricature improve the article? I don't think so. BTW, it tells only one half of the story: in addition to alleging that the Jews were controlling world financial system, Hitler insisted that at same time they were communists. (even in the same phrase, e.g. in Jan. 30, 1939 speech to the Reichstag). <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 10:45, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the sake of argument, to grant that the addition of this Der Strümer caricature does not improve the article, please note Wikipedia's Revert Policy, which I shall quote for you: "Note that reverts are not appropriate if a newer version is no better than the older version. You should save reverts for cases where the new version is actively worse." Ergo, your rationale for deleting the addition is in contravention of Wikipedia policy. Furthermore, what can you mean by criticizing what sides of a "story" it tells? It is a classic 1930s caricature exhibiting major racist ideals. Hitler also claimed the Jews were subhuman and all manner of absurd accusations; A caricature is not required to reflect <i>all</i> of Hitler's dogmas to qualify as a valid exhibition of 1930s German anti-semitism.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>While I do not have a specific objection to this particular cartoon, I must point out that you are consistently misinterpreting/misapplying the Revert Policy. Additional materal can indeed detract from the quality of an article, if the information is irrelevant, or the point is already made, or made better in other ways. Too much is as bad as too little, and Humus Sapiens's point is also correct; if 200 new cartoons were added, surely the article content would be significantly worse, and reversion would be entirely justified. <a href="../../../m/i/e/Mies_van_der_Rohe_807b.html" title="Mies van der Rohe">Mies van der Rohe</a>'s dictum "Less is more" is as applicable to article content as it is to architecture. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:48, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand what you are trying to say about the Revert policy. I do not think your concerns apply here. The Revert Policy statement I quoted applies well to Humus Sapiens' first reasoning for deleting the cartoon, in which he/she stated that the addition does not improve the article. An addition has to render an article <b>actively worse</b>. I responded to the second reasoning, criticizing the non-inclusion of communist affiliation in the cartoon, separately and without recourse to that policy. What's more, I made no argument disputing that 200 more cartoons would be significantly worse. They certainly wood. Since there is no where near that number, the point is moot.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 01:35, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO, an intro should be as clean as possible, and unless one wants to muddle the topic, there is no reason to add clutter.

To your point: AFAIK, we are not in the business of making articles nice or ugly, our goal should be to make them encyclopedic. I believe there is no reason for the second Der Sturmer picture at all, since this is not <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Sturmer_aaa2.html" title="Der Sturmer">Der Sturmer</a> article.

<p>You've mistunderstood the use of the term "ugly". The page looked ugly like that, regardless of the contents of the cartoon. It was a <i>layout</i> issue, not a <i>content</i> issue.

<p>Regarding the "Money is the God of the Jews" anti-Semitic cartoon. The source cites it as: "published by Julius Streicher, of Der Stürmer . (Der Giftpilz, a children's book--online German Propaganda Archive, Professor Randall Bytwerk, Calvin College) 1938." From this I understood that it was originally from the children's book, but can anyone speculate about the meaning of the phrase "by Julius Streicher, of Der Stürmer," because I took it to mean it was also published by the Paper.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Anti-Semitism section</span></h2>
<p>Merging the New Anti-Semitism article back here is a bad idea for two reasons. First, the information was removed because it was more controversial than the rest of the article, and therefore it was hoped it would bring some semblance of peace to the main article by moving it elsewhere. Second, this article is already 44K in size, and adding it back will make it closer to 60K, thus requiring an inevitable hiving off of a sub-article anyway. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:23, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article used to link to <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_anti-Semitism_3fd5.html" title="Modern anti-Semitism">Modern anti-Semitism</a>, which is far to POV to link to.</p>
<p>The concept of "new anti-Semitism" needs discussing however, and I've tried to give it brief, NPOV coverage in this article. I'd like to enter into discussion about the wording, etc.</p>
<p>If one day <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_anti-Semitism_3fd5.html" title="Modern anti-Semitism">Modern anti-Semitism</a> becomes a sensible article, we can link to it again, and shorten the coverage of it in this article. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 16:23, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Clarification: I didn't think that <i>you</i> would not revert me, having seen your behaviour at [Noam Chomsky]]. But I would expect more general community support. Also, the vote has not gone against me. Besides you and me, only three people have voted. One did not even bother giving a reason.

<dd>You made the first revert, while I was in the middle of writing the version with the edit summary "(NPOV)". You then made a further two and so did your mate Mrfixter.

It's rather astonishing that after breaking the 3RR you refer to someone who did not do so as a "revert warrior"; less surprising is claim that the fact that you did not revert a 5th time is "gracious" on your part and "letting me have the last word", rather than recognition that if you continue to act as a revert warrior you <i>will</i> be banned. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:46, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p>RE: "the Ukrainian Jews did not oppress other Ukrainians". The Ukrainian Jews lived in separate communities and acted as agents on behalf of the Ukrainian nobles. Shahak's point is that the massacres would probably still have taken place, even if the nobles' intermediaries hadn't been Jewish. Consequently it is a <b>misnomer</b> to describe the massacres as anti-semitic.</p>

<li>Besides which: proper encyclopedic language would reduce that to, "Israel Shahak has drawn parallels...", which leads to the question of "Who is Israel Shahak", and the answer is "an Israeli chemist", and then the next question is "what's so important about the historical perspective of an obscure chemist?" --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 06:02, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As a chemistry professor Shahak had a highly analytical mind which he also applied to Jewish history. He argued that all nation's histories were initially written from the perspective of that ethnic group. Later on, they went through a period of critical self-analysis in which other view-points were considered. This, he argues, has largely not happened with Jewish history.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher, who held a PHD in chemistry, applied her analytical skills to political therory and developed <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatcherism.html" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Responses to anti-semitism</span></h2>
<p>I believe a section/article on jewish and non-jewish responses to anti-semitism would be a valuable contribution to this article and category. This article, although quite thorough on the topic of anti-semitic beliefs and acts, doesn't detail the different Jewish responses to those beliefs and acts. In addition, there have been notable non-Jewish responses that should be detailed, as well. Do you all think this is best done in a separate article? I would be interested in any ideas before I start it (also, if it already exists somewhere, can someone please point it out to me?).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanations of antisemitism</span></h2>
<p>Explanations of antisemitism is probably a required topic but quite difficult to write. The literature is huge and there are many diverging perspectives and academic disciplines involved.</p>
<p>I removed the existing section "Scientific attempts to explain anti-Semitism". First of all the word "scientific" is generally not used about historical and cultural explanations, and thus sounds extremely pretentious. Secondly such a section requires a minimum of completeness and balance. To simply include one person (<a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_B._MacDonald_335e.html" title="Kevin B. MacDonald">Kevin B. MacDonald</a>) whose theories belong on the fringes of academic discourse, and who many people regard as an antisemite simply doesn't work</p>
<p>Until someone has the time to write a good overview with bibliographical pointers, it's better to leave out the section altogether. Any biased selection would be clearly POV.</p>

<dd>I don't agree with the summary deletion of the section. There is some attempt made to balance it, as it says "These conclusions have been heavily criticized by <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_%28magazine%29.html" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a> and others, including John Tooby, past president of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society." If you think it needs work, by all means have at it. You can't just delete something because you deem it to be incomplete. It seems to me your very objections and rationalizations here in this Talk section would make an excellent basis for revising the section.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>"There is some attempt made to balance it". Well, let me try to make this point clearer. Imagine an article about the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>. Imagine a section called "Scientific explanations of the American Revolution". Imagine that this section only discusses a single theory of a single author who happens to explain everything in terms of a masonic conspiracy. Then som "balance" is introduced by mentioning that "these conclusions have been heavily criticized". Do you see why it won't work? A biased selection of theories will inevitably make it POV.</dd>

<dd>That's exactly my point. The preferred solution would be to complete it, not delete it. Also, you might want to consider changing the section title to "<i>Purported</i> scientific attempts to explain anti-Semitism" or something similar to signify that it is just a theory and not commonly accepted. Another way is not to give it a section of it's own, since it is so small, and rather incorporate it elsewhere in the article. Your reasonings here seem sound and to my way of thinking ought to be used to rebut the theory. Wholesale deletion might appear in the derogatory light of censorship. That reasoning (so called scientific) is by no means novel or limited to that fellow. We've all come across it from time to time haven't we?
