<p>The template editing navigation bar is not required in Templates, and is clearly a bad idea here. The Anti-Semitism template is <i>not</i> one that is likely to need editing very often, but <i>is</i> one that is likely to attract vandals of a, well, anti-Semitic kind. I note that <a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> has stated he has the Template on his watchlist, and implied that he is prepared to guard the template from vandalism 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, as he is well aware, few people edit for those kinds of prolonged stretches; indeed, someone who does is likely to have Ben accuse them of being some sort of committee or team, and ask for them to be CheckUsered. In fact, user Ben Houston seems rather free with the accusations of "teams" doing various things, including reverting this template. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't care what you do with the template, but claiming you can 3RR people for "tag-team reverting" is stupid. Tag-team reverting, as you call it, is the functional manifestation of a significant disagreement with your change, and a sign you should discuss the idea first. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a reasonably objective viewer (I have, like, 3 edits to Israel-Palestine-Jew anything) I believe Houston's proposed change would do no harm. You can hardly even see the little links it adds to start with, few drive-by vandals would notice the little tiny 3pt letters. It wouldn't really help anything either, but just letting him add them is probably the simplest solution to this problem. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:44, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looks like vandals don't need the edit macro to vandalize the template. It is clear that this is not a random or an anti-Semitic vandal (as per your fears) but rather someone moderately sophisticated who knows of the editors involved. The vandalism lasted 3 minutes btw. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 11:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it's not a random vandal, but a stalker who was drawn here, intent on harassing because of the attention you have drawn to this. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:03, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>How interesting that Bhouston implies that "someone moderately sophisticated who knows of the editors involved" is <i>ipso facto</i> not an anti-Semitic vandal. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:07, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Could have been anti-Semitic, it seemed overly stereotypical, the edit summary was too referential and strangely that account was made weeks before it made that single edit -- it came across as more as how Jayjg described him/her than an anti-Semitic vandal, but you are right that motivates can be multiple. I suggest that someone with blocking powers block it. And yeah, its probably best from your position to make tangential insinuations than deal with the actual content of the dispute. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 19:25, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm fairly certain that our friend Jay here checkuser'd the account. If this assumption is correction, I would also bet that he shared results with our friend SlimVirgin here. Both users are familiar with me, and have their own opinions of me, as do many wiki-users. Sadly. those opinions are often based in ignorance. Suffice it to say that I am not an anti-semite, nor was I stalking anyone, although I have partaken in my share of trolling. I just happened to spot a trace of the revert war when perusing recent changes (which is how I prefer to read and edit wikis), and thought it would be lol to come and vandalize it. I am quite familiar with both Slim and Jay, and although I feel I've resolved my personal conflicts with them, I am also aware of their coordinated attempts to control content relevent to their interests. Whether this is PoV pushing or not, I have yet to evaluate. (It appears not to be,to be truthful, but still rather suspicious, and disruptive in its own right). Anyway, that's all I'll say on this subject for the moment. --Collateral Damage 01:44, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My guess — and I can only guess, your allegations notwithstanding — is that he has not check-usered you, because you're almost certainly a banned editor or a deceptive sock, so if he'd done a check user, you'd likely be blocked by now. My speculation, of course. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I do suppose that it is possible that he did not. I thought that someone had just neglected to block me, as I kinda took it as a given that the account would be easily identified as a sleeper account of either a vandal or a troll. (Your presumption that I am a sock of a banned editor is, fyi, right on the dot, and to be frank, I'm surprised this account is not already blocked). --Collateral Damage 01:54, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a minor edit and I'll leave it now, since pushing it further would risk <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. But still, I didn't cause the conflict by myself, you and SlimVirgin insisted on repeatedly reverting my minor and harmless change based on my continued exclusion from a set of articles that appear to have been chosen arbitrarily by SlimVirgin. Like most of the changes I have pushed for in the NAS article, I expect this template to incorporate my minor but simply logically suggestion eventually anyhow. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 19:00, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the overall subject of vandalism of this template, I'd say I have to agree with Collateral D. This edit war is the most unusual and pointless I've ever seen and deserves to be targeted <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">regardless of WP:POINT</a>. Though this edit war is not particularly damaging to anyone, the unique nature of this argument over ways to prevent vandalism before any has occered deserves to be highlighted somehow. I'd like to encourage the tnavbar revert war to stop immediately. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">M i</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusaabdulrashid_053f.html" title="User talk:Musaabdulrashid">c</a> 22:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tend to support removing the edit template here. Unlike articles, templates tend to be pretty static, there really doesn't need to be an edit template here - if someone needs to add or delete from the template they'll know how to do it without a special link at the bottom. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is some important context here that I should share. I strongly believe that SlimVirgin and Jayjg revert my edits on a set of articles whether or not my article edits are legitimate. I have complained about it before here on AN/I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive134#How_does_one_deal_with_false_accusations_and_WP:OWN_on_a_sensitive_topic.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive134#How_does_one_deal_with_false_accusations_and_WP:OWN_on_a_sensitive_topic.3F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I collaborated recently on the creation of the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Template%7EIsrael-Palestinian_Conflict_a5c9.html" title="Template:Israel-Palestinian Conflict">Template:Israel-Palestinian Conflict</a>, which went very well. During that collaboration I discovered the tnavbar macro and applied it to 4 templates that were missing it at the same time. One of those templates was <a href="../../../a/n/t/Template%7EAnti-Semitism_9331.html" title="Template:Anti-Semitism">Template:Anti-Semitism</a>. Only that addition was reverted repeatedly for what I believe were unique and invalid arguments -- it just further proves to me that I am targeted to be treated unfairly by these two. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeodar_6d01.html" title="User:Deodar">Deodar</a> 23:22, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gabriel, I agree. This isn't an article, and edits to it will be few and far between. Any editor wanting to make a legitimate edit will know how to do it.

I note that you never made an argument for keeping the macro in on this page nor have you or Jayjg responded to tjstrf claim above that leaving it is in harmless and the right course.

<p>I'm not going to remove it, but to include Norman Finkelstein in the Anti-Semitism template is pure lunacy.</p>
<p>He is a Jew, a son of holocaust survivors. He isn't a holocaust denier. He doesn't hate, or spread hatred, against Jews.</p>
<p>He writes primarily about the state of Israel's conduct in terms of aggression against Palestinians and neighbouring states, and how those who question or oppose such conduct are, more often than not, branded as anti-Semites and the like.</p>
<p>Ironically, this is the very reason why he is, like Chomsky, often ignorantly branded an anti-Semite.</p>
<p>I'll keep my eye on this page to the best of my abilities. I would like there to be a discussion on this subject, as I really feel he has absolutely no place on this page.</p>
