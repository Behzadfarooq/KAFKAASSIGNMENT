<p>Some say Zionism is racism. Others say anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. But I don't think either of these points of view are appropriate for Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 04:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html#Anti-Zionism_and_antisemitism" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism#Anti-Zionism and antisemitism</a>. There is a valid debate as to whether anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism.

<dd>Sure, and there's a valid debate over whether Zionism is a form of racism. A connection is not enough, putting <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Zionism_3921.html" title="Category:Anti-Zionism">Category:Anti-Zionism</a> inside <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Semitism_9b00.html" title="Category:Anti-Semitism">Category:Anti-Semitism</a> implies that anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism. Since that's contested, it shouldn't appear in Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 07:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is where you are incorrect, I believe. It does <i>not</i> imply that anti-zionism is a <u>form</u> of anti-semitism; rather, that the two are related, which is undeniable. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 12:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But "related" is not enough for categorisation. If we make every related category a parent of each category, the categorisation would be a mess. There has to be a clear containment relationship, not just a "see also" relationship. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 22:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe you are incorrect according to wikipedia guidelines. Per <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">WP:CAT</a>“If you go to the article from the category, will it be obvious why the article was put in the category? Is the category subject prominently discussed in the article?” The subject is prominently discussed in the article under <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html#Anti-Zionism_and_antisemitism" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism#Anti-Zionism and antisemitism</a>. And regarding NPOV, the definition per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is “representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source.” It is fair and without bias to say that there is significant discussion as to whether anti-zionism is a proxy for anti-semitism. The category does NOT mean containment, that is tantamount to saying that it is a proper subset. Oftimes articles are proper subsets of categories, but not always. There is linkage, there is reliable and verifiable discussion, and thus the category is proper. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 03:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's not enough. There has to be some kind of containment relationship, not just linkage. That's why they're considered "supercategories".

<p>Saying that the two are related is not giving one any undue weight. To say there is no relation is patently false, wlthough at wikipedia, we are more interested in verfiability than truth, and this is verifiably. Lastly, it is self-evident that it belongs in the category. Once again, being in the category does not make anti-Zionism a form of anti-semitism. What is DOES say is that there is a distinct linkage between the two, which cannot be argued. Does <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Defamation_League_171d.html" title="Category:Anti-Defamation League">Category:Anti-Defamation League</a> mean that everything the ADL does is related to Anti-Semitism? Does <a href="../../../c/r/u/Category%7ECrusades_d77d.html" title="Category:Crusades">Category:Crusades</a> means that EVERYTHING about the Crusades is anti-semitic? Of course not. But there is distinct, verifiable, reliabley sourced connections between those categories, and it is likely that someone coming to articles in those categories is interested in the anti-semitism overtones/relationship/discussion. Here too. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 12:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Being a supercategory suggests a parent-child relationship, which does not apply here. Suggesting that anti-Zionism is in any way a sub-field of anti-Semitism is highly contested and not at all self-evident. Categorisation is not appropriate for the presentation of POV. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 19:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems we disagree only on one point. Does a category being placed in another category imply that the former category is a proper subset ("containment" is the language that you used) or does it imply that there is overlap, but not necessarily total ("relationship" is the language I used). If wikipedia believes unequivcably the former, then I concede you would be correct, but if wikipedia believes unequivcably the latter, then you should concede that I am correct. If there is no consensus, then we should seek to acheive one. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That the ADL is chiefly concerned with anti-Semitism is uncontroversial. That the Crusades were anti-Semitic is uncontroversial. That anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism, which is the equivalent assertion here, is your own POV. Indeed, given that most anti-Semites are likely to be anti-Zionist (rather than the other way around), there's a better case for making the categorisation go the other way, though that would still be an inappropriate POV. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 20:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The phrase "Anti-Zionism" means different things to different people and when reading it one needs to consider its context, who is saying it and how it is used. On the one hand there are people who hate Jews and Israel and anything to do with either. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racist</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazi</a>, and many <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fundamentalism.html" title="Islamic fundamentalism">Islamic fundamentalist</a> groups who spout and promote anti-Zionism are at the same time rabidly anti-Semitic (or antisemitic) and there is absolutely <i>no</i> difference between <i>their</i> anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism since anti-Semitism is the broader and wider phenomenon, so that <i>that</i> kind of Anti-Zionism could unquestionably be a sub-category of antisemitism. On the other hand, there is an anti-Zionism that many reasonable and even Jewish people have that is in <i>no way</i> connected to anti-Semitism. The opposition of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi Judaism</a> to secular political Zionism is well known. The <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a> movement was strongly and openly opposed to any form of Zionism. There are genuine Jewish and non-Jewish scholars, intellectuals and liberals who do not accept the tenets and views of modern or ancient Zionism and they may even speak out and argue against it. None of these latter forms of anti-Zionisms are in any way connected to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAntisemitism_57dc.html" title="Category:Antisemitism">Category:Antisemitism</a>. Haredi Jews, Reform Jews, Liberal Jews and non-Jewish thinkers and academics who oppose modern-day secular political Zionism cannot be called "anti-Semites" and it would be ridiculous to even attempt to class them as such. Thus, because the situation here is ambiguous and subject to misunderstanding, miscategorization, and perhaps even (unintended or deliberate) false and misleading editing and categorization by editors who may not (want to) understand the delicate nuances here, this category should not be a sub-category of antisemitism. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 22:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's some history about the Jews who opposed Zionism during and before WWII, when Zionism was simply one minor Jewish viewpoint among many. It was acceptable among Jews to criticize Zionists until 1967.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Coffee House<br />
American Jewish Commttee Report Goes After Liberal Anti-Semites<br />
By M.J. Rosenberg<br />
[URL:<a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jan/30/american_jewish_commttee_report_goes_after_liberal_anti_semites" class="external free" title="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jan/30/american_jewish_commttee_report_goes_after_liberal_anti_semites" rel="nofollow">http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jan/30/american_jewish_commttee_report_goes_after_liberal_anti_semites</a>] ... And even the more virulent critics can hardly be called anti-semitic. Anti-semitism refers to hatred of Jews as a race. Before 1948, millions of Jews would have categorized themselves as anti-Zionist especially in Poland where the Socialist and anti-Zionist Jewish Bund was so powerful.</p>
<p>Anti-Zionist Jews were among the leaders of the fight against the Nazis and were at the forefront of every ghetto uprising. It is almost sacreligious to take the term anti-semite and apply it to Jews who are part of a long standing and quite venerable Jewish tradition. Were the socialist, Bundist and anti-Zionist Jews who fought and died in the Shoah fuelers of anti-semitism?</p>
