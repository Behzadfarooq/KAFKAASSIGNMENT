<p>While your bot may do much help, it is also changing a lot of non-vandalism edits rather arbitrarily. What are you going to do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi! Looks like your bot got into a revert war on the PS3 page recently where it started reverting everything back to a vandalized version, starting at 18:19 07/01/06. Did it about 3 times until two posts in a row caused it to start reverting things to a good version. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndyLawSteve_5076.html" title="User:IndyLawSteve">IndyLawSteve</a> 19:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This bot keeps "vandalizing" pages by reverting back to vandalism whenever I try to revert a vandalized page. Example can be seen on the "Auto-Fellatio Redirect Vandal" long-term abuse page. Some vandal vandalized the page, I reverted it, and the bot reverted MY reversion and slapped me with a warning for "vandalizing." I then attempted a revert once more, and was again thwarted by this rogue bot. And the bot gave me a "final warning." Fix or shut down this bot ASAP.

<dd>In fairness, I wouldn't call what the bot did vandalism. Blanking an article is not the means by which it should be deleted. The bot has no understanding of the content nor its validity, it merely looks for significant changes to articles, based on their size, who edited it, the edit summary, and other factors. The bot did not create the "vandalism" however it does seem that it restored it. Besides, blanking the article doesn't remove it's history, as a true deletion does. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(tlk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malo_4444.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malo">(cntrbtns)</a></small> 23:07, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jimbo, note no speedy tag on the first blanking. I have no idea how on earth a bot is susposed to detect a "good faith" blanking - it's a blanking, there's no real way to detect em one way or another. It won't revert if the speedy tag is added to it but other than that, it fits the technical criteria of a blanking. As for human oversight, it gets looked at on occasion but at close to 1500 bot reverts a day (and me having only having 48 hours in a day to do 96 hours of work&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 00:27, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll second this. Your "Anti-Vandal" bot seems to be doing MUCH more harm than good. Recently I attempted to revert a vandal's work, only to have your Anti-Vandal Bot revert my reversion back to the vandal's page, and slap my talk page with a warning for "vandalizing." Now your bot seems to be protecting the vandalized page from my further attempts to revert the vandalism. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Chatterjee_e86b.html" title="User:Dr Chatterjee">Dr Chatterjee</a> 02:06, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm going to have to agree. You openly admit that you don't have the time to properly oversee this things.

<p>Well, I spoke with Jimbo, he wasn't aware that it was in fact another copy of Tawkerbot2 running here (and thought it was another bot - hence the concerns) With all due respect to Edmondjohnson I rather have one problem in 100 edits than have 99 acts of vandalism go un-fixed for a long amount of time due to the fact that there are only so many RC patrollers out there. I think most people on this site are aware of the bots, and their limitations and from what I've heard, people rather have bots running - I get more complaints when the bots die then I seem to get about bad reverts. It's not like it's not clear that it's a bot and that I haven't made the warning messages pretty understanding in case it's a false positive to avoid newbie biting -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 05:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me respond with all due respect: you are probably right that this bot does much more good than bad, but that should not prevent you from actively seeking ways of minimizing erroneous reversions. The big problem here, as I see it, is that there is no expedient and reliable way of making it clear that something is not vandalism. After trying to do a legitimate revision several times and having it reverted--even after leaving a message here--I think most people will do what I did: give up. And, in the long run, that will have a negative effect on the quality and comprehensiveness of information available here. <a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEdmondjohnson_1fce.html" title="User:Edmondjohnson">Edmondjohnson</a> 21:36, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed the problem above of the bot reverting back to a vandalized version multiple times. I have two ideas for a solution. First, perhaps the bot could be limited to the number of reverts it does to the same version (with the potential vandal's edits and AntiVandalBot's edits, the situation may attract attention anyway). Second, perhaps the bot could have a list of trusted users, like a list of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_admins.html#Active" title="List of admins">active admins</a> and maybe veteran <a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikipedia%7ECounter-Vandalism_Unit_8507.html" title="Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism Unit">vandal fighters</a> (those approved for <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">VandalProof</a>?), that it would not revert. From the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pie.html" title="Pie">pie</a> edit above, perhaps not reverting other bots, especially vandalism reverting bots, might be a good idea, too. Even if the other bot is malfunctioning, it might not be a good idea to revert it automatically with another bot since it may hide the problem, although people watching recent changes may notice. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:22, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does AntiVandalBot add 2 line returns before the first edit to a userpage? Is it so it doesn't have to check to see if it is the first edit to the page or not to allow for proper spacing after a previous edit? Anyways, not a big deal, just curious.

<p>Dear AntiVandalBot,</p>
<p>Your automated thing refuses to let me fix a faulty move and re-move done by two inexperienced editors who are fighting each other. Instead of using the move tab, they have been copying and pasting and using redirect on both the article and the talk page, ending up with a situation where the edit log is almost impossible to find. So, I tried fixing this by doing their thing in revert and then do a proper move back to the article's established name. However, as soon as I empty the page <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zar%27it-Ayta_ash-Shab_incident_ff08.html" title="Zar'it-Ayta ash-Shab incident">Zar'it-Ayta ash-Shab incident</a>, which I must do in order to be able to move the identical content from <a href="../../../a/y/t/Ayta_ash-Shab_Zar%27it_incident_7887.html" title="Ayta ash-Shab/Zar'it incident">Ayta ash-Shab/Zar'it incident</a> (which is the wrong name), the automated bot instantly reverts it, making it impossible for me to finish what I'm doing. It apparently reacts within seconds, thus making these clean-ups impossible. So, 1) Could you please sort out the mess on those two pages, as you probably can stop your diligent but stupid robot while you're doing it, and 2) perhaps you should look into the possibility of introducing at least 10-15 seconds delay into an otherwise good bot.</p>
<p>So, to help you along, what needs to be achieved is a restore whereby article, talk page and edit log all reside under the name <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zar%27it-Ayta_ash-Shab_incident_ff08.html" title="Zar'it-Ayta ash-Shab incident">Zar'it-Ayta ash-Shab incident</a>, i.e. to the situation that existed before <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYousaf465_3422.html" title="User:Yousaf465">User:Yousaf465</a> did his first move, while <a href="../../../a/y/t/Ayta_ash-Shab_Zar%27it_incident_7887.html" title="Ayta ash-Shab/Zar'it incident">Ayta ash-Shab/Zar'it incident</a> only has a redirect to it.

<p>After Tawker's first reaction where he seems to have misunderstood what was required, my further explaining and reminder (chapter 'Look up again') are still left unanswered. In short now: I risked to make 'Rumold' a redirect page myself (hoping AVB doesn't again intervene) and created the four other firstname redirection pages. So everything should be finished for Saint Rumbold and all its aliases.<br />
BUT there is also still an article 'Saint Rumold of Malines' though the saint was never known that way: There is only one (non-wiki-)'Saint Rumold of Malines' on the web, with a link under 'Saint Rumold', the 'of Malines' is even in that single article not part of the name. Thus, please <b><i>DELETE the 'Saint Rumold of Malines' page</i></b> that is just taking up space and comprises a <i>depricated name of the city</i> of which Saint <span style="white-space:nowrap">Rum(b)old</span> is the patron saint. I do not know whether the 'proposed for deletion' tag would be opportune in a redirect page, that's why I ask Tawker's assistance. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> 2006-06-25 03:39 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a link on the Gundagai page to a commercial venture near the bottom of the page then reference 2. Does wiki have commercial ventures signposted with links to them? Is the Gundagai page being vandalised? There is angst in this town (Gundagai) re the stuff I have put up re an Aboriginal massacre so not suprised if some here try and delete any talk re it as its a very sensitive topic around the area. Can someone check that commercial link at reference 2 on the bottom of the Gundagai page. I'm new here and dont know how to do stuff yet. Cheers.</p>

<p>I keep posting accurate information about All Headline News and the bot keeps editing it out as "vadalism." The latest changes to the article are accurate. If you'd like to see the grammatical errors for yourself visit: www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs.</p>
<p>There you will find the errors as well as the unattributed articles. If you have time, simply revert to any major news outlet like AP, Reuters or the BBC and you will find these same stories on their sites. AHN plagiarizes. I am a writer for a major news organization and I would just like the public and AHN clients to know the shoddy product found at www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs. My language on this message may seem bias but the article I posted is accurate. Thank you</p>

<p>Hi. Your bot incorrectly targetted an edit I did two days ago. My changes to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Torres_e2af.html" title="Francisco Torres">Francisco Torres</a> were not vandalism. They mostly involved fixing a very obvious stylistic problem (a sentence that stopped abruptly with no ending) and provided more detail.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I made a change to the List of NUS (Australia) Office Bearer Pages.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Office_Bearers_of_the_National_Union_of_Students_of_Australia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Office_Bearers_of_the_National_Union_of_Students_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Office_Bearers_of_the_National_Union_of_Students_of_Australia</a></p>
<p>I changed the faction that Belinda Cooper, Queer Officer (WA 2005) belonged to from "unaligned" to GenderFuck Group.</p>
<p>I imagine the problem is the partword "fuck". However not only is this a legitamate group, but it is certainly NOT degrogatary in anyway.</p>
<p>GenderFuck is the particular practise of Drag (a form of cross-dressing) that tries to break down culturally normalised stereotypes in a upfront manner. The people that engage in this form of drag are proud and this change simply reflects Belinda's political alliances within the NUS structure. Although the genderfuck group was only ever small, it was something that she helped setup and actively worked on during her term.</p>
<p>Of course I understand the problem with the word "fuck" but in this context it is exactly the title that the group is called and their isnt an alternative name... if this change isnt possible then the next best thing is to leave it as unaligned.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi - this wasn't vandalism; it was just me not getting things quite right and having to make too many edits in a row, I think.</p>
<p>What I was attempting to do (and finally accomplished) was to add the "don't wikilink" comment to each section of the list, as people tend to edit only the section they're updating. Folks were continuing to wikilink names that don't have articles; since I spent a fair amount of time deleting all that wikilinking (but not the names themselves), I'd like to try to keep more from being created. I realize that it's probably a losing battle; but someone might get the message somewhere along the line.</p>
<p>I don't know what triggered the bot. If it wasn't the multiple edits, it may have been that I originally tried to use [[ WIKILINK ]] as part of the comment to illustrate what wikilinking was (there may be those unfamiliar with the term).</p>
<p>Thanks for your diligence.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Quite a useful bot you have there. I just wanted to mention that its recent reversion of this edit (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Deletion_sorting/Ready&amp;diff=70279101&amp;oldid=69985705" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Deletion_sorting/Ready&amp;diff=70279101&amp;oldid=69985705" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) was in error -- that was not vandalism, just me cleaning up the deletion-sorting queue. Not sure what would distinguish an edit like that from a vandalistic one, except perhaps that it was on a project page where I had already made a large number of non-vandalistic edits.

<p>I suggest eliminating this page because the necessary information has been included in the bilingual education page. It pretty much says the same things, and the comments made about foreign parents wanting to keep their children immersed in their native language is irrelevent to the issue of bilingual education in the US and elsewhere, where it's simply implied that it is applied only to citizens or permanent residents.</p>

<p>The problem is he is using a dynamic IP so it is hard to keep track of him and probably impossible to block him effectively.</p>
<p>His domain name is www.heureka.clara.net and all the pages he is linking to are subpages of that site. Is it possible for vandalbot to be programmed to delete this material on sight?
