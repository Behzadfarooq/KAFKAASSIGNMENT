<p>This entry dances around the fact that "anti-racism" is founded on the belief that one's "race" is immaterial as far as the society or "culture" is concerned. So "racism" creates artificial barriers to the unity of all in whichever enlightened society you choose to pick. This seems patently false. Like most entries on race and ethnicity in wikipedia, this one lacks balance and promotes the term it attempts to describe. Promotion is fine but it should be clearly stated.</p>
<p>The notion that there are no material differences among groups lies at the heart of this "movement". It is classically religious.--129.119.68.34</p>
<dl>
<dd>So if there ARE "material differences" that would justify racism?? Not necessarily. Paradoxically, many anti-racists have not held this view at all - but have seen the white race as (at least a little) "superior" to others. They have none the less felt that even "inferior" human beings are "equal" in their entitlement to justice. (Being "equal before the law" for instance). You don't have to have the idea that every individual - and every group of individuals - have precisely parrallel abilities and faults to hold the idea that they should all be treated the same regardless.</dd>

<dd>The idea that plain justice and simple common sense need to be labelled "left wing" in order to attack them is very revealing. This isn't a simple "left-right" issue, nor one that one should necessarily be "even-handed" about (do you really want to give equal time to the KKK??). Many highly conservative people (God bless 'em) are decidedly non-racist, if not exactly anti-racist.</dd>

<p>This article needed a major overhaul. Anti-racism did not begin with anthropologists in the 1920s and '30s. If John Brown isn't an anti-racist, I don't know who is. The primary impetus for anti-racism in the modern world has not come from the UN, but from the Civil Rights movement in the U.S., and similar movements around the world. The article in the new version is still way to centered on America (a discussion of the abolition movement in England, for example, would be nice, as would some mention of Ghandi.) But hopefully this is a place for others to start. (Most of my discussion is based on James Loewen's in "Lies My Teacher Told Me".</p>
<p>Also note that I've cut the paragraphs below from the article completely, largely because they seemed irrelevant to me. The claim that anti-racism originated in the '60s is simply false. The fact that the Democrats were white-only is less significant than it seems -- they were the Southern party after the Civil War, remember? George Dunn seems like a footnote; the fact that racism didn't appear just means a shift of language, which might be interesting, but hardly means that resistance to white supremacy didn't exist. The list of UN documents seems pretty unimportant compared to the overall achievements of anti-racism. That's just my POV, of course; if other's disagree, they're welcome to put them back in the article....</p>
<p>Although many now consider it fundamental to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_justice.html" title="Social justice">social justice</a>, anti-racism is a recent development. The <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_feb2.html" title="1968 Democratic National Convention">1968 convention</a> was the first the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">United States Democratic Party</a> held without whites-only delegations. One of the first figures in the Roman Catholic Church to identify racial segregation as a sin, Fr. George Dunne, S.J., died only in 1998. Even the word "racism" did not appear in many dictionaries before the Second World War.</p>

<li>The 1950 UNESCO Statement on Race, followed in 1951 by the UNESCO Statement on the Nature of Race and Race Differences [need links]. Both statements asserted that biological differentiation of races is without foundation, and that race is a social myth rather than a biological phenomenon.</li>

<p>I find it very strange that an article on Anti-Racism uses the term "Indian" so much, while not a paticularly racist word, I think this article should use Native American instead as I belive it's probobly best for an Anti Racism article to use Politically Correct Terms <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathawk_f102.html" title="User:Deathawk">Deathawk</a> 23:46, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
