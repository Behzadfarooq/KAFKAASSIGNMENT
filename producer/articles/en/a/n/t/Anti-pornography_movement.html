<dl>
<dd><i>"Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials."</i> Section 2354<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-pornography_movement.html" title="Edit section: Feminist objections">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Feminist objections</span></h2>
<p>Feminist positions on pornography are diverse. Some feminists, such as <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Russell_1b87.html" title="Diana Russell">Diana Russell</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Dworkin_4ba1.html" title="Andrea Dworkin">Andrea Dworkin</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharine_MacKinnon_f828.html" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Brownmiller_c6cb.html" title="Susan Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorchen_Leidholdt_e146.html" title="Dorchen Leidholdt">Dorchen Leidholdt</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Morgan_d74a.html" title="Robin Morgan">Robin Morgan</a>, argue that pornography is degrading to women, and complicit in violence against women both in its production (where, they charge, abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where, they charge, pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_harassment.html" title="Sexual harassment">sexual harassment</a>). Many feminists differentiate between different sorts of porn and may see some as fairly harmless. Those that favour a complete ban on pornography are actually a small minority, but they tend to receive more attention in the media. The majority of feminists would consider porn to be a small issue.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, anti-pornography radical feminists formed organizations such as <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_Against_Pornography_6b71.html" title="Women Against Pornography">Women Against Pornography</a> that provided educational events, including slide-shows, speeches, and guided tours of the sex industry in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Square_cdcd.html" title="Times Square">Times Square</a>, in order to raise awareness of the content of pornography and the sexual subculture in pornography shops and live sex shows.</p>
<p>The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of <i>Ordeal</i>, in which <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Boreman_9ab1.html" title="Linda Boreman">Linda Boreman</a> (who had allegedly been abused in the making of <i><a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_%28film%29_f946.html" title="Deep Throat (film)">Deep Throat</a></i> under the name "Linda Lovelace") stated that she had been beaten, raped, and pimped by her husband <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Traynor_de1d.html" title="Chuck Traynor">Chuck Traynor</a>, and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in <i>Deep Throat</i>, as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence (some made against members of her family), to make other pornographic films. However, in the documentary "Inside Deep Throat", directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato interviewed several people connected with the filming of "Deep Throat", including director Gerard Damiano and co-star Harry Reems, and all stated that Lovelace was not forced in any way to participate in the film, and specifically that they never saw a gun on the set. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches. Boreman's criticism focused feminist attention not only on the effects of the <i>consumption</i> of pornography (which had dominated feminist discussions of pornography in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>), but also the effects of the <i>production</i> of pornography, in which abundant evidence has shown that abuse, harassment, economic exploitation, and physical and sexual violence are rampant. This evidence has received additional publicity because of the testimonies of other well known participants in pornography such as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traci_Lords_8a29.html" title="Traci Lords">Traci Lords</a>, and expressed in recent feminist works such as <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Cole_d1c0.html" title="Susan Cole">Susan Cole</a>'s <i>Power Surge: Sex, Violence and Pornography</i>. MacKinnon applies the critical test to determine whether the production of pornography is exploitative: would women <i>choose</i> to work in the pornography industry if it were not for the money? Critics note that this test fails to distinguish pornography from any other industry.</p>
<p>Some anti-pornography feminists -- Dworkin and MacKinnon in particular -- advocated laws which would allow women who were sexually abused and otherwise hurt by pornography to sue pornographers in civil court. The <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipornography_civil_rights_ordinance.html" title="Antipornography civil rights ordinance">antipornography civil rights ordinance</a> that they drafted was passed twice by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> city council in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, but vetoed by Mayor Donald Fraser, on the grounds that the city could not afford the litigation over the law's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutionality.html" title="Constitutionality">constitutionality</a>. The ordinance was successfully passed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> city council and signed by Mayor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hudnut_81b5.html" title="William Hudnut">William Hudnut</a>, and passed by a voter initiative in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellingham%2C_Washington_1fe8.html" title="Bellingham, Washington">Bellingham, Washington</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, but struck down both times as unconstitutional by the state and federal courts. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> case without comment.</p>
<p>Many anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others -- including <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Brownmiller_c6cb.html" title="Susan Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a>, Janet Gornick, and <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Kaminer_c93b.html" title="Wendy Kaminer">Wendy Kaminer</a> -- objected that legislative campaigns would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of free speech, or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> and entangling it in political squabbles (Brownmiller 318-321)</p>
<p>Many anti-pornography feminists describing themselves as "sex-radical" and "sex-positive" such as <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Simonton_228e.html" title="Ann Simonton">Ann Simonton</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikki_Craft_af1b.html" title="Nikki Craft">Nikki Craft</a> and other members of Media Watch have advocated working against pornography and been arrested for public nudity and apply civil disobedience against corporations by ripping up single copies of magazines that contained violent pornography that they insist glorify rape as sexual entertainment. They advocate rejecting corporate control of sexuality as exemplified in publications like <i>Hustler</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>, protesting particularly what they see as the dangerous conditioning practice of intermixing <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexual_behavior.html" title="Human sexual behavior">sexuality</a> for titillation and entertainment as in pornography and other mainstream media for the purpose of achieving <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgasm.html" title="Orgasm">orgasm</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>'s 1992 ruling in <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Butler_8538.html" title="R. v. Butler">R. v. Butler</a> (the "Butler decision") fueled further controversy, when the court decided to incorporate some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In <i>Butler</i> the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law <i>could</i> be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Legal_Education_and_Action_Fund_ea3a.html" title="Women's Legal Education and Action Fund">Women's Legal Education and Action Fund</a> (LEAF), with the support and participation of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharine_MacKinnon_f828.html" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Dworkin_4ba1.html" title="Andrea Dworkin">Andrea Dworkin</a> opposed LEAF's position, arguing that feminists should not support or attempt to reform criminal obscenity law.</p>
<p>Controversy between anti-pornography feminists and their critics grew when the Canadian government raided and prosecuted <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glad_Day_Bookshop_fb95.html" title="Glad Day Bookshop">Glad Day Bookshop</a>, a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> bookstore in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, in its first obscenity prosecution under the <i>Butler</i> criteria. The bookstore was prosecuted for selling copies of the <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sado-masochist.html" title="Sado-masochist">sado-masochist</a> magazine, Bad Attitude. In 1993, copies of Andrea Dworkin's book <i>Pornography: Men Possessing Women</i> were held for inspection by Canadian customs agents <a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had also been banned from Canada under a law that she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt the whole of Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance; Dworkin did not support the decision; and the impoundment of her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) was a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the <i>Butler</i> decision.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, the late 1970s saw a wave of radical feminism. Groups such as Women Against Violence Against Women and Angry Women protested against the use of sexual imagery in advertising and in cinema. Some members committed arson against sex shops. However, this movement was short-lived. Its demise was prompted by counter-demonstrations by black women and disabled women. Pornography was seen by the latter as a very minor issue that had been prioritised by White middle-class women above the discrimination that black women and/or disabled women were facing.</p>

<p>Other feminists are against censorship; some describe themselves as <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex-positive_feminism.html" title="Sex-positive feminism">sex-positive feminists</a> and criticize anti-pornography activism. They take a wide range of views towards existing pornography: some view the growth of pornography as a crucial part of the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_revolution.html" title="Sexual revolution">sexual revolution</a> and they say has contributed to women's liberation; others view the existing pornography industry as misogynist and rife with exploitation, but hold that pornography could be and sometimes is feminist, and propose to reform or radically alter the pornography industry rather than opposing it wholesale.

Johnson</a> to appoint a commission to study pornography.</p>
<p>In 1970, the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography concluded that <i>"there was insufficient evidence that exposure to explicit sexual materials played a significant role in the causation of delinquent or criminal behavior."</i> In general, with regard to adults, the Commission recommended that legislation "should not seek to interfere with the right of adults who wish to do so to read, obtain, or view explicit sexual materials." Regarding the view that these materials should be restricted for adults in order to protect young people from exposure to them, the Commission found that it is "inappropriate to adjust the level of adult communication to that considered suitable for children." The Supreme Court supported this view.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A large portion of the Commission's budget was applied to funding original research on the effects of sexually explicit materials. One experiment is described in which repeated exposure of male college students to pornography "caused decreased interest in it, less response to it and no lasting effect," although it appears that the satiation effect does wear off eventually ("Once more"). William B. Lockhart, Dean of the University of Minnesota Law School and chairman of the commission, said that before his work with the commission he had favored control of obscenity for both children and adults, but had changed his mind as a result of scientific studies done by commission researchers.

<p>President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> announced his intention to set up a commission to study pornography, apparently with the goal of obtaining results more acceptable to his conservative supporters than the conclusions of the 1970 Commission. The result was the appointment by Attorney General <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Meese_3b63.html" title="Edwin Meese">Edwin Meese</a> in the spring of 1985 of a panel comprised of 11 members, the majority of whom had established records as anti-pornography crusaders.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

A workshop headed by Surgeon General <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._Everett_Koop_99a4.html" title="C. Everett Koop">C. Everett Koop</a> provided essentially the only original research done by the Meese Commission. Given very little time and money to "develop something of substance" to include in the Meese Commission's report, it was decided to conduct a closed, weekend workshop of "recognized authorities" in the field. All but one of the invited participants attended. At the end of the workshop, the participants expressed consensus in five areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) "Children and adolescents who participate in the production of pornography experience adverse, enduring effects,"</li>
<li>(2) "Prolonged use of pornography increases beliefs that less common sexual practices are more common,"</li>
<li>(3) "Pornography that portrays sexual aggression as pleasurable for the victim increases the acceptance of the use of coercion in sexual relations,"</li>
<li>(4) "Acceptance of coercive sexuality appears to be related to sexual aggression,"</li>
<li>(5) "In laboratory studies measuring short-term effects, exposure to violent pornography increases punitive behavior toward women" According to Surgeon General Koop, "Although the evidence may be slim, we nevertheless know enough to conclude that pornography does present a clear and present danger to American public health"<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>

<p>The most concerted opposition in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> comes from the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediawatch-uk.html" title="Mediawatch-uk">Mediawatch</a> group.
