<p>Hi Antonio - just saw you note on my talk page. I've fixed those typos at <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libyan_Arab_Airlines_52c7.html" title="Libyan Arab Airlines">Libyan Arab Airlines</a> for you. As you say, that IP address was blocked when somebody else (not you) was using it - I've unblocked it now, so you shouldn't have any problems.

<p>Some advice concerning the dirty dozen page: 1) try not to take anyone's comments personally. 2) it is not your page, just as none of the pages I have worked on are not "my" pages. All articles belong to the open community and are always ongoing works-in-progress. Respectfully, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<p>Antonio, it's probably best to copy any different text from one article to the other, and make one of them a redirect. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>Em . . . why did you move Mexico City to Mexico City, Mexico? Is there <i>another</i> Mexico City? If not, then it should go in merely as Mexico City.

<p>Hello, Antonio. I noticed a recent comment of yours on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_30d1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">Wikipedia talk:Staying cool when the editing gets hot</a> about the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mercado_fe07.html" title="Walter Mercado">Walter Mercado</a> article. You wrote, "Tell me, if I attempted to make it look like a fan page would I have talked about his rumored (keep in mind I said rumored, Im not saying he is) homosexuality??" My answer is, "Eh? Why not?" If I were writing a fan page about, say, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Turing_37ec.html" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a>, I expect I'd mention his homosexuality...! From your statement it looks like you're suggesting that homosexuality is a bad thing. (I'm not saying that you <i>are</i> saying that; just that that's what it <i>looks</i> like!) I don't know what your views on this subject are, and I'm not writing this to try to find out what your views are or to try to change them or anything like that, but I just thought I should advise you that it's probably best not to make that sort of suggestion... But anyway, best of luck with the article-writing...&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 19:53 May 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, okay, thanks for explaining! I misinterpreted your comment, and I expect I overreacted. Sorry about that. But all is clear now.&#160;:) I just did a Google search for Walter Mercado, and one of the top matches I found was a page of "<a href="http://isd.usc.edu/~retter/latpnotables.html" class="external text" title="http://isd.usc.edu/~retter/latpnotables.html" rel="nofollow">Notable Lesbian/Gay/Bi/Transgender People of Latino/a Descent and Friends</a>"(!) - a rather strange title, but I think it confirms that people do indeed speculate about the issue. Furthermore, he is listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of famous gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of famous gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>, under "Persons of debated sexual orientation", where it says, "More information about what is known about each individual's sexuality should be available in the individual's biography." So I think that means that we have a moral obligation to say what is known about Walter Mercado's sexuality on his biography page.&#160;:)</dd>

<p>Hello, Antonio. I've replied to you on <a href="../../../o/l/i/User_talk%7EOliver_Pereira_9db3.html" title="User talk:Oliver Pereira">my talk page</a>, not that I've said much. Do you mind people doing this? I must admit that I get confused when conversations are split across different pages! -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 23:36 May 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see you have done a lot of hard work on some boxing notables. Are you interested in doing a little bit more work to help me out? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacques_Delson_916a.html" title="User:Jacques Delson">Jacques Delson</a></p>
<p>Your offer to help is much appreciated. I created a template for each of the "years in sport" and so far have inserted them back to 1950. Stuff before 1950 I'll do later because it requires a different template. In the meantime I need someone who knows and loves boxing to help (plus others to help in other specific categories). Go to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950_in_sports.html" title="1950 in sports">1950 in sports</a> and you will see a template almost filled in. Note, in boxing I already put something in. Now, Antonio, don't get carried away, but each year from 1950 up needs good boxing stuff inserted. Don't put every fight that ever happened otherwise you will ruin the page and others will come along and add so much stuff it will become impossible. This is just a "highlight" page in sports, so keep it to the 2 to 4 (maximum) important fights of the particular year - no comments, just facts like you see there as a sample on the 1950 page. (Don't put in your favorite boxer no matter how tempting -- be objective.) Thanks, I know you will do a great job. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacques_Delson_916a.html" title="User:Jacques Delson">Jacques Delson</a></p>
<p>P.S. See <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_sports.html" title="1980 in sports">1980 in sports</a> too. The page is still basic, but it has some good boxing events, but 5 is too many. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacques_Delson_916a.html" title="User:Jacques Delson">Jacques Delson</a></p>
<p>Great job you are doing, Antonio! Note that between date and next text you should put space - space. Makes reading on screen a lot easier. I changed <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_in_sports.html" title="1985 in sports">1985 in sports</a> so you would see.

<p>This is ambiguous. 500,000 dollars a year to 90 million dollars a year? Or 90 million dollars overall after 10 years? Please clarify. Also, please try to use the preview feature of Wikipedia instead of saving a revision every minute, this reduces the number of edit conflicts, makes it easier to generate diffs and saves harddisk space (every revision has to be stored). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 07:57 19 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey! How's it going?&#160;;) Thanks for your message on my talk page this morning. It hadn't been <i>that</i> long since my last message, had it? Okay, well, I'll try to write more often if you want me to... I'm actually trying to stay away from Wikipedia these days, as I have lots of work to do, but as you can see I'm not being <i>entirely</i> successful there... I see that you've discovered <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_controversial_issues_fbb2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of controversial issues">Wikipedia:List of controversial issues</a> - that's a new one to me! I suppose that <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_attention_a7b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing attention">Wikipedia:Pages needing attention</a> would list articles which deviate significantly from NPOV, but which aren't necessarily difficult to keep NPOV once they have been made so, while <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_controversial_issues_fbb2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of controversial issues">Wikipedia:List of controversial issues</a> would list articles which don't necessarily deviate significantly from NPOV at the moment, but which are difficult to keep NPOV on a long-term basis. Erm, did that make sense? Probably not... But is the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Casablancas_e983.html" title="John Casablancas">John Casablancas</a> article inherently difficult to keep NPOV? I would have thought that when enough facts have been gathered, the article should be all right, but maybe I'm wrong... In any case, hopefully it won't ever be as tricky as the likes of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_control.html" title="Gun control">gun control</a>!

<p>Hi Antonio, just got your note about controversial articles (I've been away from the Wikipedia for a few days which is why I've not replied before).

<dd>Actually, I don't mind the "middle name" bits at all, I rather enjoy them. What bugs me is them always being on a separate line in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">VfD</a> without any indentation.

<dd>No no no, you misunderstand. I even like the "middle names" on the VfD page. The indentation I speak of is when you put the stars ** or colons&#160;:: at the beginning of a line, and your sigs there usually don't get that. I'll give examples of a couple of ways they could be done better, in the VfD context:</dd>

<p>Antonio, please note that</p>
<ul>
<li>the above so-called <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuckM_f89b.html" title="User:ChuckM">User:ChuckM</a> is in fact Jacques Delson. He has also gone by the name of <b>Joe Canuck</b>, <b>DW</b>, <b>Olga Bityerkokoff</b>, <b>Black Widow</b>, <b>Ron Davis</b>, <b>Triton</b> and others.</li>
<li><b>ChuckM</b> more generally known by his earlier name DW is one of wiki's most notorious trolls, who has been <b>banned at least three times</b> for downloading images while refusing to offer any proof that they are not copyright, for threatening other users and acting in a manner that Jimbo and most of the people who came in contract with him found unacceptable in the extreme. On the basis of the evidence that he is yet another version of DW mascarading under a phoney name, because he is a multiple banned user and because of his conduct tonight he was nominated tonight by Evercat for his fourth ban.</li>
<li>He has spent tonight placing bizzarre messages on people's pages. In yours he is pretending not to be whom most of wiki know's damn well he is. For the evidence, see <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Canuck_b0aa.html" title="User talk:Joe Canuck">User talk:Joe Canuck</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the people who received his nonsense tonight reverted to remove it. Indeed he turned some pages tonight into edit wars, with most of wiki binning his stuff (even Brion!) and he repeatedly trying to reinstate it, with his usual threats. He did that to Mav, to Evercat, to Camembert, to me and a host of others. The best thing to do with ChuckM is simply to ignore him. For the evidence of who he eally is, see <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Canuck_b0aa.html" title="User talk:Joe Canuck">User talk:Joe Canuck</a>. For his standard conduct and evidence of his behaviour, read the talk pages of any of the above, but specifically <a href="../../../d/w/_/User_talk%7EDW_f7d3.html" title="User talk:DW">User talk:DW</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlack_Widow_b7b1.html" title="User talk:Black Widow">User talk:Black Widow</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Canuck_b0aa.html" title="User talk:Joe Canuck">User talk:Joe Canuck</a>. After their banning, their threats were moved to their talk pages from elsewhere so a record could be kept.

<p>Antonio- You mentioned on the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saved_by_the_Bell_9547.html" title="Saved by the Bell">Saved by the Bell</a> page that the show was inspired by the success of <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_90210_a55f.html" title="Beverly Hills 90210">Beverly Hills 90210</a>. This clearly cannot be the case, as 90210 first aired in 1990, three years 'after' the first Saved by the Bell show. You really need to be more careful about making assumptions like this when writing articles. I have already made the appropriate changes, and I don't mind, but you do seem to make a lot of these errors. You should preview your articles and make sure that the facts that you state are supported by other sources. -<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> 21:57 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Antonio, thank you for your comments on my talk page. However, I was looking at some of your other submissions, and I wanted to make another small suggestions. Some of your stories seem to be one-sided, and slightly fanatical. It would be best to turn the tone of your stories down a little bit, and be more objective. In particular, your articles on The Craft (movie, and the actresses who starred in that movie are great because they didn't exist before. However, it's important to mention the other movies that those actresses were in. All of them have been in other major movies (<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_History_X_6ef8.html" title="American History X">American History X</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Records_a120.html" title="Empire Records">Empire Records</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scream_%28film%29.html" title="Scream (film)">Scream</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half_Baked_05e5.html" title="Half Baked">Half Baked</a>), and it is important to talk about the actresses' impact in all of the films that they have been in. If you devote the majority of the article to <i>The Craft</i>, then it makes it seem like their other roles are not as important. Also, in all of the articles, you state that <i>The Craft</i> had far reaching effects on fashion, the gothic movement and New Age philosophies. In actuality, gothic fashions were already in place, and the movie simply represented that fashion sense. It would be more accurate to say that the high profile movie brought the gothic culture to a larger audience. As for the term <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a>, that is an extremely broad category, and I don't think that the film really has a significant impact on the New Age movement at all. Basically, it's great that you have devoted such a large amount of time to filling in these blank pages, but you should try to make the articles more balanced in their perspective. Thanks again! -<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> 22:55 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have just been made a sysop! Sysops basically can't do anything: They cannot delete pages arbitarily (only obvious junk like "jklasdfl,öasdf JOSH IS GAY"), they cannot protect pages in an edit war they are involved in, they cannot ban signed in users. What they can do is delete junk as it appears, ban anonymous vandals, remove pages that have been listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> for more than a week, protect pages when asked to by other members, and help keep the few <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected pages</a> there are, among them the precious <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, up to date.</p>
<p>Note that almost everything you can do can be undone, so don't be <i>too</i> worried about making mistakes. You will find more information at <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a></b>, please take a look before experimenting with your new <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">powers</a>.

<p>Please stop adding shabby new articles to the new articles section (BTW your articles do already get listed on the Main Page very often because of their great quality). I just updated that section already with the best new articles of the past 2 days. We want to only show off our best examples esp in the new articles section. And simply adding an entry without taking out something else breaks the formatting of the page and makes it look really bad to people with standard screen resolutions.

<p>However, I have had a careful think about the whole purpose for the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_aviation.html" title="List of years in aviation">List of years in aviation</a>, and some pages linked to it. Wouldn't this page be better set out as a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline.html" title="Timeline">Timeline</a> of <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">Aviation</a>? Or you could merge it with <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_transportation_technology.html" title="Timeline of transportation technology">Timeline of transportation technology</a>? Besides there is already a <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation_history.html" title="Aviation history">Aviation history</a> article, which should be expanded with the information that might appear on these pages. That way all the facts are on one page not a hundred different pages. As I understand the list pages, they should refer to already written articles, not articles waiting to be written. I know you have made an attempt to document the years with the years 1980-1987, but they are really timelines that would be better pulled into one article. The current pages all stem from one article (<a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">Aviation</a>) and then only from a <b>"See also:"</b> link. They could become a group of orphan pages unless they link logically into the written text of a whole lot of other articles. At present these pages are difficult to navigate and do not link to each other. Also, most of the facts are fairly trivial - especially by the 1980's - I would be inclined to move the information to something more appropriate.

<p>Antonio, thanks for your kind words about the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evo_Morales_d746.html" title="Evo Morales">Evo</a> article. A couple of comments: I noticed you Wikified some dates. According to the page <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_only_links_relevant_to_the_context_57f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context">Wikipedia:Make_only_links_relevant_to_the_context</a> the only dates that need to be linked are birth and death and anything REAL big in between. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What should not be linked:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>dates of marriage, book publication, and other dates between the big two unless they bear some kind of significant connection with the date. That Bob Dylan arrived in New York City in 1961 is significant because it was a zeitgeist event. Ask yourself, "Would this event ever appear on a timeline under this date?"</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>By this criterium, most of the dates in the article do need to be wikified.</p>
<p>Also, I started each new sentence with a new line so that the DIFF program can distinguish more clearly between sentences when you are comparing versions. I forgot where I found this tip; somewhere here.</p>
