<p>Hello. Well, I suppose that indicates you are still interested&#160;:-) It would be nice that we have an email adresse so the MC can directly contact you. It is much easier than going to each one wikimail.<br />
There is work ongoing on guidelines and rules right now. You may either participate on that matter actively, or give your opinion on the various points (comment on meta as well if you wish).</p>
<p>(there has not been much on the ml about that topic recently, except for Jimbo that we should progress on the matter&#160;:-))</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding me of your admiration for my mediating skills, which I suppose I earned from the little bit of mediation I did around <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Theory_a1dc.html" title="Gaia Theory">Gaia Theory</a>. There's not a lot of gratitude or praise that gets expressed around here, especially compared to all the arguing, and so I appreciate your compliments a lot. Now that you mention it, I think I'd liked to have been on the arbitration committee, but I don't think I'd like to give up my anonymity (e.g. if my name got out, George Bush would send people to my cave in Afghanistan and they'd take me some place where there are no Internet connections). Also, I don't think my reputation here is only for peace, love and understanding (to quote <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Costello_678e.html" title="Elvis Costello">Elvis Costello</a>), so in the end I doubt I'd have been invited to arbitrate. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 03:27, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was it bad of me to remove my comment on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">wikipedia:requests for mediation</a>? I felt later that I had mispoken. Is there some better way to handle this? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 06:00, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it is perhaps inappropriate to remove the middle of a discussion like this. It tends to make discussions look very weird. Not anyone will appreciate perhaps looking like a fool talking to himself&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Perhaps would have it been better to just wait</dd>
<dd>or to write below that the discussion was no more relevant, so we could entirely remove it&#160;?</dd>
<dd>just my fellings.</dd>
</dl>
<p>should I put it back? I don't want to do anything to be provacative, so any advice on whats best to do now is appreciated. Thank you... <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 06:28, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anthere, an anonymous user has made some additions which has the whiff of self-promotion in the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_succession.html" title="Ecological succession">ecological succession</a> article. I moved the offending material to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Talk%7EEcological_succession_8432.html" title="Talk:Ecological succession">Talk:ecological succession</a>, in the hope that somebody more knowledgeable in ecology could have a look at it. From my limited ecology background, it looks somewhat dubious but has some salvageable content in it. Have a look if you get the chance and let me know what you think.

<p>Anthere, thanks for putting a (temporary?) end to the edit war. What do you propose now? Given the entrenched positions that seem to have emerged here, I'm not too hopeful that a compromise can be worked out between the editors without someone else giving a "ruling", if that's the appropriate term to use.

<p>Hi, Ant. Good work you are doing on the mediation committee if I didn't tell you before. I've decided to start my own intra-wikipedia association (why not!) that is going to concern itself with volunteerism regarding the dispute resolution process. I'd encourage you to join, or comment, or both and tell the other mediators about it too, mediators can join, arbitrators are discouraged from joining; please read about it: <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffice_of_Members%27_Advocates_fa1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Office of Members' Advocates">Wikipedia:Office of Members' Advocates</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 00:48, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anthere, and welcome to the Office of Members' Advocates. As the de-facto interim coordinator I've added a link to your talk page on the talk page of the association; if you want to add any more contact information that you feel comfortable with please do so. I've started writing a few other pages and if you want to contribute to any of those pages or do some editing that would be great. Once we have a few more members we might try to have a membership meeting to discuss how we might act as a group or help each other with our new-found volunteer role. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 04:11, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anthere! I was just rereading <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_law_to_ban_conspicuous_religious_symbols.html" title="French law to ban conspicuous religious symbols">French law to ban conspicuous religious symbols</a> and I realised that there's no real explanation of why people might be in favour of this law.

1)I have nothing to hide and I wish that to be clear. 2)I did what I did as a political act of martyrdom in an effort to change the system, therefore I want a public trial in which I will be able to give my reasons for what I did and to talk about pathological behaviors of the group which I believe led to my punishment. You can talk privately to my adversaries, if you like, but I would rather talk publicly.<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 02:42, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

Hi, Anth. I read the links you gave me to the mail postings and I read the part of the mediation article that dealt with privacy. I will read more when I find time. I really appreciate the analysis you gave of the situation on the mail list, which is the first I've read that seems at all sympathetic to me. I was mildly irritated by Mav's response, perhaps not surprisingly. I am not sure what about it you might want me to address, because I don't read him as saying anything very committal regarding how he would like to proceed. Also, I don't feel like I've read a reason for keeping communications between me and the mediator (i.e. you) private. To make this private would be a very big concession for me, so I would like to read a good reason for it. Thanks again for agreeing to this unpleasant job. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 16:26, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

Unfortunately, Cyan made a kind of bet with Lir which he seems to think he lost, and has banned himself seemingly forever as a result.<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 22:31, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suppose you will want to research this matter in an independent way, but there is a lot to read in lots of obscure places, so let me know if you would like me to list or rank what I think are the important things to look at. I hope my recent edits and footnoting to old pages won't make you have to do a lot of re-reading, but a lot of them I think are essential to represent the situation fairly and others provide what I think are helpful links to evidence to support my claims.<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 00:29, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />

<p>But...point is...would you also care to define what your claims are exactly&#160;? Could you list these ones as well&#160;?</p>

Wow. I really appreciate you exhorting Mav to see my actions as political. It was mostly the comment he made about this in his reply that irritated me. I've been without sympathy here for so long that your mediation feels like advocacy on my behalf. For a pure articulation of my complaints against Mav, I recommend the recently updated <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Mav_3bc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mav">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mav</a>. The other links I gave you above after "see also" are also good links for my perspective. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Lir_45b2.html#DNA_is_the_genetic_code_of_life" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Lir">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Lir#DNA is the genetic code of life</a> provides an example of a long and failed attempt to resolve a single point with Lir that motivated me to take the radical actions that I did. I dissected it from several parallel threads of conversation on <a href="../../../d/n/a/Talk%7EDNA_0ebe.html" title="Talk:DNA">talk:DNA</a>, which is probably the most important and relevant document. Unfortunately, it is very very long, and I think hard to interpret as a chronological record of what happened, and I think that is why nobody seems to have thoroughly researched the facts before making accusations against me. At this moment in time (i.e. before anybody reverts my changes), I think <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_168_fc32.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/168">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/168</a>, after my many edits, is fair in the accusations it makes against me and I think at least alludes to nearly all of the facts I consider relevant.<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 01:02, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You probably saw this if you have looked at recent posts to Talk:DNA, but it's a fairly succinct statement of my position regarding that page and those users, in which I allowed myself to show more righteous indignation than I do on the requests for comment page narrative.

<p>About public mediation: I read the comments on the BBS site. I suppose there is a "grandstanding" element to what I want public mediation for, but it's also about justice. Mav dragged my name through the mud--through a lot worse mud than was deserved, I believe the facts show. While it's true that I am trying to heap some deserved mud on him at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Mav_3bc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mav">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mav</a>, I doubt my claims against him have been read by nearly so many people or are so trusted as the claims he has made against me. An aspect of the injustice done to me is <i>publicity</i>, which is why I want my vindication to take place prominently and publicly. Without public vindication--instead of quiet re-awarding of admin status--many people will live with the memory of my supposed bad behavior, and relatively few people will consider Mav guilty of anything or learn anything about how not to mediate a public discussion of controversial behavior in the future (a lesson I think this community needs). A substitute for public trial would be a public apology, such as I mentioned to you in private e-mail. But I don't see that Mav has any incentive to make such an apology. I doubt he will ever come to <i>feel</i> apologetic, plus you can't force him to make it, and I doubt there is anything I am willing to give him in return for it. So the only way I can feel <i>guaranteed</i> of coming away from this process with justice served is for a public trial. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 21:38, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anthere! I've been going over what you added to the article yesterday (you made some really good points). I need you to explain exactly what you're saying here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>They have highlighted the tensions provoked by the revendication of religious and group identities, like the formation of clans, for instance. They regret frequent violence toward themselves as well, in particular toward female teachers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know what you mean by "revendication" - do you mean the creating/formation; the claims/demands; reclaiming, etc? And the word "clan" is mostly used to mean a Scottish family... do you mean a "gang" (this could imply that they are violent), or would "group" be better? So far I've only done the "Background and Stasi Commission" section.

<p>The consensus to remove recipes can be observed at the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranswiki_log_fe21.html" title="Wikipedia:Transwiki log">Transwiki log</a> or at in the page history for <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>.

Any article I find that has both a recipe and encyclopedic information in the same page, I transwiki the recipe and add a link to the new location in the page. Again, no one has reverted any page I've done this to. These non-actions on the part of the community suggest to me that the wikipedia editors believe recipes belong at the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Cookbook">Wikimedia Cookbook</a>, and not in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGentgeen_2e43.html" title="User:Gentgeen">Gentgeen</a> 18:36, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Fluffy, thanks for the lovely photos, those puppies are cute!</p>
<p>I don't know whether you want me to comment at all on the bit you deleted, but one thing I really did want to say: I think when people don't reply, the usual reason is that they don't have any answers. It's an extension of the wiki-way really - if you don't know, leave it, someone else will fix it later. But then if no one knows the answer then there is a disheartening silence. I don't believe it's a reflection on what has been said or who said it, it's just we are all struggling to see how this thing might work and what we need to do to get it there. Anyway, I just wanted to say how much I value working with you, especially with all the thought you put in to <i>how</i> this is going to work.

<p>I apologise for those who will find themselves blocked by "mistake", but I am very serious here. No edition of the two paragraphs is to be done. I think I indicated that clearly on top of the page. I do not think the comments can escape anyone. For edition by people not involved in the conflict, I could be nice enough to unban them under promise they will be careful. Thanks&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">FirmLittleFluffyThing</a></p>
<p>[Peak:] Dear Ant - I think your general strategy is absolutely right - it is the one I had been arguing for for a long time ("community defense with support from sysops"), but you have (no doubt, inadvertently) rewarded 168...'s subvandalism by in effect freezing the page at his version, instead of the "near-consensus version" that was worked out on the Talk page last month, and which had been up until 168... decided to initiate this latest round of subvandalism. I say "subvandalism" because this time, Lir was not involved at all so previous attempts to justify his behavior as a defense against Lir now ring very hollow.</p>
<p>And speaking of Lir, <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">User:Eloquence</a> says that the highest Wikipowers-that-be decided that keeping Lir around is the best way to keep him (Lir) on a tight leash. Do you think that 168... understands this? If not, then (assuming you haven't already done so), you might try to explain the wisdom of the "community defense with support from sysops" policy in relation to this approach to handling Lir. That is, 168...'s "civil disobedience" campaign (or more accurately now, incivil disobedience campaign) for banning Lir seems to have been premised on a flawed assumption about technicial aspects of a "ban". <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 17:18, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC) P.S.

<dd>[Peak to Ant and Kingturtle:] I would also like to register my appreciation for Anthere's hard work. In addition, as someone who has spent many weeks trying to achieve some kind of consensus at DNA, I can say that the mistake wasn't UNPROTECTING the page; rather, it was un-de-sysoping 168... prematurely. That sent a wrong signal to everyone, including 168....</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>that is possible. Well, we try our best, and sometimes make mistakes&#160;:-) It is not easy to be in someone else shoes&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to take this opportunity to suggest that, so far as I have been able to tell, Mav has never done anything wrong in the 168... affair. The root problem here is simply Wikipedia's weak defense against Lir's brand of subvandalism. This is what led 168... to the conclusion that a campaign of "civil disobedience" was necessary; this was fine until he started abusing his sysop powers to favor his personal preference. Of course, he attempted to justify this on the grounds that it was all against Lir, but if you followed the logic of his justification, you would see that 168... was in effect proclaiming that he, as sysop, could do anything he liked, without any external constraint whatsoever. <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 05:09, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think Peak, that you should try to sum up your opinions on the request for 168 page. I suppose it is already there, but that page is quite undigest. In case 168 does not come back, this page and this case will become bogus (let's hope we learn from it); in case 168 comes back, it will be a background to help arbitration to understand the case. Your opinion will be important to them I suppose.</dd>
<dd>I personally will not give my opinion on this, and will not put my name on any poll or on any vote on any related matter. As a mediator in that affair, I think I must not do it. I have no decision role here. However, where my role is, is to insure that people are taken some of the pain back from them, that they feel better. That they do not feel excluded. When 168 feels that he is not treated fairly, then I am concerned. But I will not judge whether he is right or wrong in his perception some people were not fair to him. Yes&#160;?&#160;:-)</dd>

<p>I accept your apology, except there really is no need for you to apologize -- I entirely understand your reaction, moreover, it was the strength of your reaction that called my attention to my mistake. So I really do thank you. The important thing is that we can communicate. I am sure there are others who read my post and had the same reaction as you, but who kept it to themselves. I am so glad you did not. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I see you posted a request for an advocate on the AMA page. As you probably noted, current guidelines would suggest that you not be the advocate, since you have already been the mediator in this case. Anyway, I take it you are asking for somebody else to do the job, not volunteering to do it yourself. Do you have any ideas about who should take it? For myself, I am reluctant, because I was involved in a separate dispute with <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> recently, and your request seems like it should be filled by someone the parties might consider neutral. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:46, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
