<p>Hi Anthony. I saw your post on the Englisc list. With regards to <a href="../../../w/u/l/Wulfrun.html" title="Wulfrun">Wulfrun</a>, I thought it worthy of mention that one is supposed to use the 'move this page' mechanism to rename pages, rather than copy-and-paste, which seems to be what you did in copying content from <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Wulfruna_3071.html" title="Lady Wulfruna">Lady Wulfruna</a> to <a href="../../../w/u/l/Wulfrun.html" title="Wulfrun">Wulfrun</a>.</p>
<p>The rationale is that the 'move this page' mechanism preserves edit histories, so we can see who contributed which paragraph. Right now the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wulfrun&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wulfrun&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history for Wulfrun</a> makes it appear that you wrote the entire article; if moved properly, it wold include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Wulfruna&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Wulfruna&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history for Lady Wulfruna</a>.

<dl>
<dd>No need to apologize, if you created the page in error initially. I didn't realize that was the case, so sorry if I seemed overzealous in describing the page move procedure.

<p>The new title is really cumbersome, surely something shorter could be found. 'Internet service' would do fine... we don't need to distinguish it from some other non-subscription Internet service also named "There". What other "There"s are there? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:43, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re: the new "There" disambiguation, I'm really not sure that mere dicdefs warrant creating a disambiguation. We wouldn't do this for <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a>, for instance. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:45, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think in general, disambiguation on Wikipedia is only used to disambiguate one proper noun from another proper noun, not to disambiguate a proper noun from a dictionary definition. There are many examples of common dictionary words that are also used as proper nouns (<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">Apple</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a>, any number of musical groups or movie titles), but we don't disambiguate since there is only one encyclopedic meaning (ie, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia rather than a dictionary). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In other words, unless there is some reasonably well-known movie or book or album titled <i>There</i>, I'd be in favor of just moving it back to <a href="../../../t/h/e/There.html" title="There">There</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:54, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anthony Appleyard! I know you haven't any idea who I am, but I've been perusing the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falconry.html" title="Falconry">falconry</a> article of late (more about that in a sec) and just noticed your name in the history. I've been lurking on the Old English mailing list for quite some time now, so imagine my surprise and delight to see a familiar name in an unexpected place. I took Paul Remley's Old English classes at the University of Washington and heard your name mentioned favorably more than once in that context, as well. —<a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECKA3KA_bd1e.html" title="User:CKA3KA">CKA3KA (Skazka)</a> 08:39, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please, as near to verbatim as you can remember what did they say about me? Thanks. Anthony Appleyard 10:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oops! I didn't mean to tease you. I'm afraid I can't remember any specifics, but I can assure you that it was good. I would <i>certainly</i> remember much better if it had been scandalous! I seem to remember that one such exchange was between Professor Remley and a young woman graduate student who was taking the class for a second time. I forget her name, but she had very dark hair, probably dyed, and I know she was a mother. She was speaking of you fondly and Remley was smiling that sheepish smile that seems to go along with just about every topic he converses about. Unfortunately, at the time, I hadn't yet subscribed to the mailing list, so hearing your name didn't cause me to sit up and take notice. It wasn't until I joined the list and saw your name that my ears pricked up and I thought to myself, "I know that name. Isn't that the fellow that Professor Remley and that girl were talking about in class? He wrote something, didn't he? Curses! Why didn't I pay closer attention?" Or something to that effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have put the deleted training matter back, as a pointer to a page <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falconry_%28training%29.html" title="Falconry (training)">Falconry (training)</a>, which includes a boldface warning that the page is not a training manual. Anthony Appleyard 10:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for doing that. It sounds like an excellent solution, assuming that the information in the piece was accurate. Someone who didn't sign his post (I feel reasonably safe in assuming it was the same individual who deleted it in the first place) replied to my query saying that, indeed, there was almost nothing in it worth saving. I take it you see that assessment as overly harsh …</li>
</ul>

<p>It's fun to finally talk to you. I just Googled you (quite a Web presence you have, I must say!) and it looks like we share some mutual interests. —<a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECKA3KA_bd1e.html" title="User:CKA3KA">CKA3KA (Skazka)</a> 05:02, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid I owe you an apology. Earlier, when I told you that I remembered you being discussed in my Old English class, it seems I was mistaken. I saw an old classmate on the bus last weekend and I brought it up. It turns out they were talking about Professor Andy Orchard, director of the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto and editor of the Anglo-Saxon England series. When I saw your name associated with the Old English mailing list, my feeble little mind seems neatly to have slid Anthony Appleyard into the slot previously occupied by Andy Orchard as though it were a perfect fit. Please accept my sincere apologies for a mistake that must've been at least briefly disorienting for you. If there are medievalists whispering behind your back at the University of Washington, then I'm certainly not privy to it.

<p>On to the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falconry.html" title="Falconry">falconry</a> article. There's been a bit of activity there that gives me pause. Someone's gone in and removed the Training section. The comments he left on the talk page indicate that he thought it so terrible that it didn't even bear keeping. I know <i>nothing</i> about falconry, but I found that section to be interesting reading. If it was truly as inaccurate as he says, then good riddance to bad baggage; but I wonder if we might not be seeing a bit of partisanship in a controversial area.</p>
<p>If falconry is a topic you know something about, would you mind popping on over to the article and giving it a look-see? Thanks! —<a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECKA3KA_bd1e.html" title="User:CKA3KA">CKA3KA (Skazka)</a> 08:39, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, moving it to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifold_%28topology%29.html" title="Manifold (topology)">Manifold (topology)</a> was almost certainly the wrong destination.

<p>I would like to discuss your article on the cowboy Buck Rogers. You seem to be working from memory. You mention stories from the 1920s with Tom Mix and Buck Rogers, but by that time Tom Mix (his real name) was a famous cowboy actor, and a story with him as a character would have to be a movie spin-off. So where does Buck Rogers come in? I think there was a cowboy Buck Rogers, but where did he appear? In magazines or in books or in films? With Tom Mix or not? More info is needed.</p>
<p>Buck's real name, by the way, was originally Anthony. Buck was a nickname, but I have not seen any hard evidence that he was named after the cowboy. If he ever had any other name, it was in one of the late versions -- novels or computer games -- not in the first fifty years the character was around. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 00:53, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My memories of WWII are pretty dim -- I was born in 1942. But I certainly remember Tom Mix comic books, and I don't doubt your memory. But, for the article, we need more than a memory. We need to find out where these stories appeared, in what medium, and when. Anything you can add to what you've already said should help. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 13:03, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia calls for the use of "&amp;...;" HTML character entities for a reason - they work cross-platform. See: <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#diacritics" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#diacritics</a>. It's a Bad Thing to go into articles and replace them all with Windows-specific (or any other OS-specific) characters. You are breaking Wikipedia for zillions of other users when you do that. — <a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a> <a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESmccandlish_7912.html" title="User talk:Smccandlish">[talk]</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smccandlish_3ff9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smccandlish">[contrib]</a> - 00:14, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If so, why do English Wikipedia edit pages display below the edit window a big list of clickables to insert the "Windows-specific" characters that display as themselves in edit mode? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 06:03, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because it's a poorly-thought-out experimental feature. See <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#diacritics" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#diacritics</a>. It's there for a reason. Even if the character insertion "feature" (which is a fairly recent innovation) were not problematic, there is no global call out to wiki-editors of the world to go through articles and convert entities to characters that, at best, require a rich UTF-8 font to display, so I don't see why you'd feel compelled to go on a conversion spree; "leave well enough alone", as the saying goes. This isn't meant to sound overly critical, but please look at your own Talk page. I've yet to see on <em>anyone</em> else's talk page such a laundry-list of disgruntled comments. You are doing things that a lot of other editors are disagreeing with, on a regular basis. Please take a step back and re-evaluate. PS: Someone else went on an entity conversion spree in the same article I'm responding about, shortly after you did, and they also got the same message from me after I reverted those changes; and someone else did the same thing to another article last week, which I also reverted. I'm not singling you out - it's not a personal thing. HTML entity codes are a well-established standard (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>), and Wikipedia's own documentation (whatever it's feature-of-the-week may be; the "Wikipedia:*" documentation supercedes any such features) <em>says to use them</em> (<a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#diacritics" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">source</a>). They are renderable regardless of operating system and regardless of what fonts are installed (barring very strange end-user behavior like removing all fonts from one's system that have these characters in them at all). — <a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a> <a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESmccandlish_7912.html" title="User talk:Smccandlish">[talk]</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smccandlish_3ff9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smccandlish">[contrib]</a> - 07:54, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did this:-</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I temporarily edited a Wikipedia page to contain πλεονασμóς so it showed in the editor window as the &amp;--; codes, and also so it showed in the editor window as the Greek letters (as here: <i>πλεονασμóς</i> ("excess"). πλεονασμóς).</dd>
<dd>I went into "show preview" mode.</dd>
<dd>I saved the resulting HTML page to my PC.</dd>
<dd>I examined the resulting local file with an MSDOS ascii text editor which displays all high-order characters distinctively.</dd>
<dd>I found that the resulting code in the page which Wikipedia's server sent to my computer, contained exactly the same code when Wikipedia's server translated from the &amp;--; codes and when translated from the Greek letters representation.</dd>
<dd>Therefore it seems that, if, as likely:-
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia pages are stored internally in the format seen in edit windows.</dd>
<dd>When a user is reading a Wikipedia page (without editing it), Wikipedia's server translates it into normal HTML code so it displays as usual, and (in this case) in both instances sends Greek letters to the user's computer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The user's computer displays the same from the &amp;--; format and from the Greek letter format, and the only result of using the &amp;--; format is to make the text less legible as seen in the editing window.</dd>
<dd>If some non-Windows computer (e.g. a Mac) systematically displays different according to whether the edit window version displays the &amp;--; format or the <a href="../../../w/y/s/Wysiwyg.html" title="Wysiwyg">wysiwyg</a> format, I will accept that I w as wrong. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 11:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The clickable entities below the edit field insert unicode characters. They are not windows specific, and they <i>are</i> cross platform. I have a mac and a linux box, and the unicode characters work just fine for me. It's true that people who edit with non unicode compliant browsers can muck up those characters, but wikipedia has a unicode standard now (the database stores, and the edit windows display UTF-8. It has been so for quite a while, and our multilingual support would be impossible without this), therefore it may even be more relevant to tell those editors to switch browsers, than to tell the other editors not to use the symbols. In short, continue using unicode. I do it. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 10:20, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd also come to Anthony's defence here. Wikipedia supports unicode characters and modern browsers do too. Unicode is not Windows specific. Also, despite the fact the &amp;...; markup resulting in correct renderings in any character set, they break search engines. Since all modern browsers support or can support Unicode, I too say keep using Unicode characters. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 13:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I concede &lt;bow&gt;. I'm still going to write with &amp;-entities, though, since I've already memorized them, they are a standard, and they work.

<dd>First, "bailing water" is never spelt <i>baling water</i> and I doubt you'd find that in Chambers.</dd>
<dd>For the parachute bailing, we use British English almost exclusively for the most part in Australia too, yet I've never once seen this use of bale (as in "bale out of an aircraft") although it is evidently an alternate spelling of bail. But since "bail out of an aircraft" is the way it's spelt at least 50% of the time in Britain and close to 100% of the time elsewhere (<a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bai2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bai2.htm" rel="nofollow">according to this WorldWideWords article</a>), don't you think this information should go at the <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail.html" title="Bail">Bail</a> disambig page on Wikipedia -- and there is already a link to this from <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bale.html" title="Bale">Bale</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 01:49, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been trying to figure out what happened to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocentric_model.html" title="Geocentric model">Geocentric model</a>. As best I can tell, you merged it into <b>Ptolemaic system</b>, then shifted all the material from Ptolemaic system back to Geocentric model. I really wish you hadn't done that. First of all, since one person in a fairly small group had spoken against a merge, it would have been nice to wait a few more days to see if a consensus would be reached. Second, having decided to go forward with the merge (and I do agree with "Be bold"), it would have been nice to give more thought to the direction in which the merge should go. Third, once you did go forward with the merge, and then apparently decided you had done it the wrong way, it still would have been a good idea to leave it for a couple of days so that interested parties could look it over. Now it's more difficult to figure out just what was included or left out. This merge would probably have taken place sooner or later, and maybe it was time, but please, when you do this again, be less hasty in the actual process. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 17:14, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Anthony Appleyard/2006 –</p>
<p>I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see <a href="../../../c/u/r/Talk%7ECurrent_events_efc4.html#Another_Proposal:_Overhaul_of_the_Current_events_page" title="Talk:Current events">the current events talk page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_current_events_2230.html" title="British and Irish current events">British and Irish current events</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_current_events.html" title="Canadian current events">Canadian current events</a>) into fewer continental articles.

<ul>
<li>Anthony, Many of your recent contributions in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">Laser</a> article have been improvements, but I don't think the change of the history section to a strictly chronological timeline format is one of them. For one thing, you've turned the section into one long list. As discussed at <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbedded_list_d7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Embedded list">Wikipedia:Embedded list</a>, this is considered poor style. Natural flowing text is preferred. More importantly, the strict chronological format disconnects logically related developments (for example, the story of Gordon Gould's patent litigation with Bell Labs) from each other. Rather than follow each important thread of development of laser history, the reader has to read through the entire section and sort out what developments are more and less closely related. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Photon_5b8f.html" title="User:The Photon">The Photon</a> 02:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The trouble is that I have waded through too much "natural flowing text" looking for a bit of information, where a timetable format would have been clearer. And all the nuisance "essay style" "varying the expression" to make the job more difficult:-</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes the date is in one place in a sentence, sometimes in another place.</dd>
<dd>Sometimes a date is replaced by a reference to a previous date and an addition sum to do.</dd>
<dd>A clear repeat of a name or date is replaced by an unclear periphrasis or ambiguous pronoun.</dd>
<dd>Events listed out of time order.</dd>
<dd>Etc. See <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elegant_variation.html" title="Elegant variation">elegant variation</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"<i>this is considered poor style</i>": it may be not good essay style, but "good essay style" is often hard to search through for any desired bit of information. We are writing for information here, not for prettyness and literary effect. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 05:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When I mention "preferred style" I am not describing so much "essay style" but Wikipedia style, which is developed by consensus among many editors. As I mentioned above, the Wikipedia preferred style is to minimize the use of lists within articles. One indicator of the preferred style, and the strength of the preference among other editors, is the example of existing featured articles. I have randomly checked four technical FA's and I didn't see any examples of the timeline style in the history sections. I don't recall ever seeing this style in FAs I've read in the past. Can you point out an example of an article that has been made FA with this style?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case I happen to agree that the Wikipedia preferred style is the most clear. This does emphasize "teaching" the reader rather than making it easy to search for individual facts. Remember, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indescriminate collection of information (a big pile of facts).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the style issue I can see that sometimes a timeline makes it easier to find a certain fact, but really only if the fact is "what happend in a certain year"? Putting events in time order only helps you find a fact if you already know when it occurred. And the time an event occured is only sometimes the most important information about that event --- it's usually more important how it relates to certain other events, for example as a cause or effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that often in Wikipedia, writing style (elegant variation, or ambiguous pronouns) sometimes makes it harder to read an article than it should be. These issues could also occur in a timeline format. The solution is to edit to improve the style, as your other edits in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">Laser</a> have done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, I don't agree that your other two bullet points are problems. Often its more important that one event happened X years after another one, than to know the specific year. This can emphasize the short or long time it took for some development to occur. And as I mentioned above, presenting events in strict chronological order is not the clearest way to present them. For example, in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">Laser</a> article, the history of the theory, the history of the experimental demonstrations, the history of applications each gets grouped together in a seperate paragraph. If the important relations between certain events aren't clear from this presentation, it can be improved within the essay style. One option to clarify the chronological relationship between events in different threads of laser development might be to add a graphical timeline to the article as an image.</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I answered your question on the article's disc.-page. After all, I was the one who wrote the sentence. To make things easier, I repeat here what I wrote there:</p>
<p>"Er" replaces "der Tauchretter", to avoid too frequent a use of the latter. As you know, we in Germany are somewhat complicated with our language. E.g. we use the articles "er" = "he" and "sie" = "she" not only for persons, but for things as well, where you only use "it". That's what happened in the sentence you asked about. If I'm totally mistaken, Mark Twain has written about it most amusingly. Well, that's how we are&#160;;-)</p>

One of the oldest vodka distilleries in Poland (which means in the world as well) is <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polmos_%C5%81a%C5%84cut_b6d5.html" title="Polmos Łańcut">Polmos Łańcut</a> so I made an article about them today. The Łańcut distillery has 10 main brands, so I started to make stubs for them to avoid red links in the main article. I made 6 out of 10 so far. In the vodka articles I give only the main information. I write about the taste of it, but I add "according to the producer..." to keep it NPOV. I can write something else, but I don't know what. I tried to keep it NPOV already, so without a hint I cannot see by myself what is wrong.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 20:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On June 21, 2005, you wrote in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> that in the Zabad inscription, the word Allah is spelt alif lam alif ha. But it looks to me as though it's spelt alif lam alif lam ha (see <a href="http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/zebed.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/zebed.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which doesn't seem to work in Internet Explorer but does work in Firefox).

<ul>
<li>A reading "alif lam alif lam ha" would represent a pronunciation "Alālah" or similar, not "Alāh" or similar. The vertical stroke attached to the right side of the <i>ha</i>, may be one of these:-</li>
<li>Part of the <i>ha</i></li>
<li>A spurious <i>lam</i> or <i>alif</i> started as a handwriting blunder and continued into a correct <i>ha</i>.</li>
<li>Starting to write the <i>ha</i> with the writing tool in the wrong place.</li>

<ul>
<li>The reason I asked was that a friend of mine is an adamant believer in the idea that the word Allah should not be used for God by Christians. He claims that this inscription should be read al-'ilah, "the god" (as in Greek, ho theos). Makes sense, but maybe you can give me a reference to support the reading of alif lam alif ha, with no second lam? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Kvaalen_2860.html" title="User:Eric Kvaalen">EricK</a> 11:53, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Religious doctrine now is not necessarily the same as religious doctrine in AD512 when this inscription was made. OK, it may be <i>al-ilah</i>. I have updated <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Arabic_alphabet_a367.html" title="History of the Arabic alphabet">History of the Arabic alphabet</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 12:11, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would have left that sentence which you just deleted in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>, but perhaps modified. In any case, I'd still like to know what those who have written articles on this have to say. Did you have a source that said it was alif lam alif ha (without a second lam)? The article references I've seen don't look too easy to find. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Kvaalen_2860.html" title="User:Eric Kvaalen">EricK</a> 23:28, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is what I suggest you do: Take the pages you want to change so drastically, duplicate them into your user space as subpages, edit all the content. Once you've gotten it into a state where you feel it can adequately replace the history and invention pages without all the interlinked mess, start a discussion in either or both of those pages. Let other editors review your changes and once the content is agreed upon you can submit them.

<p>Hi. I can see you obviously have strong feelings about this and a lot of desire to improve Wikipedia's coverage of this area. However, I would like to give you some advice. Firstly, I would strongly advise you to withdraw the RfAr you started on this matter - it is very unlikely to have the results you want. Secondly, while there is certainly too much material on the matter for everything to be kept in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_radio.html" title="History of radio">History of radio</a>, there is almost certainly not enough to maintain a number of different articles. I would suggest having <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_priority_controversy.html" title="Radio priority controversy">Radio priority controversy</a> OR Tesla-Marconi controversy OR <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention_of_radio.html" title="Invention of radio">Invention of radio</a>. It is very unusual for Wikipedia to have two articles detailing different sides of the same argument, so I think it's very unlikely that the two articles you have created, one each 'for' Tesla and Marconi, will last. (To give you an example, we don't have World War II (Impact on Hitler and World War II (Impact on Stalin).</p>
<p>I also recommend that if you are actively working on significant revisions to these subjects then you do it in a subpage of your userpage - that way the work you are doing won't be interfered with by other editors, and it won't be flagged for deletion.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 15:06, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

You might do well to take his advice, which closely parallels the same advice I gave in the last section, and work on the pages in your userspace. Once completed we can discuss in in the talk section of the history and invention pages. People are trying to work with you, you might accept the cooperation. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">Sparkhead</font></b></a> 16:31, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You're making <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Radio_f3c8.html" title="History of Radio">History of Radio</a> bigger by moving more information into it. That article is already too large.

Stop editing these articles at least until the Arb is completely rejected, or the various AfD's go through.

<p>HI Anthony,</p>
<p>I've had that happen to me before too. Did you basically create a stub, or was it deleted non-notable? Sorry, I didn't look... but the trick is to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't start the article with basically nothing. Play with in your user space until you get at least a couple good paragraphs and perhaps an image. More would be better, of course.</li>
<li>Put something clarifying its notability in the very first sentence. Which is standard practice anyhow.</li>

<p>Is there a reason you prefer using tocleft on the paraquat article? It seems rather cramped where it is.

<p>I haven't really checked, but I guess you add tocright or tocleft to quite a few articles, depending on whether there's an image in the top right position. If so, why do you do that?

<p>Hi. I wonder why you move the TOC to the right. The default position is the toc to the left with the text below and under it, and I would think that it is not a good idea that the TOC is inconsistent from page to page. Perhaps for really huge articles that would be appropriate, but if you have up to say 10 sections in an article, I would think one better stick to the default. Wonder what you think. You can reply here.

<dd>I've tidied the quack bit, and I'm OK with that. I'll leave the pond for now. that leaves the pike etc. I know that pike eat ducks, and I'm a Brit too. However, ducks are a worldwide group, many living in areas where pike don't occur. It seems parochial to single out one predator in one country. if this stands, why not have lots of sentences on the lines of "in Florida they are eaten by snapping turtles, in India by White-breasted Sea-eagles, In singapore by...".

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>Thanks for your many recent contributions to Wikipedia relating to dinosaurs. Many of these articles are in need of care, so I appreciate your attention.</p>
<p>However, I'm unsure why you keep adding this assertion into <i><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brachiosaurus.html" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, nostrils big enough for the animal to breathe through, with the head so small compared to the body, would be so big that they would have to be on top of the head.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This type of assertion needs a source. One paleontologist (Witmer, 2001) has shown the nostrils were near the tip of the snout. Unless there is more recent evidence, cited in a paleontological paper, the above sentence cannot be used in Wikipedia. It has been removed for the second time. You are free to add it as long as you provide a citation such as a more recent study which refutes Witmer's paper.

<p>Hi Anthony, I'm a bit confused why you keep wanting to add that Baynet ISP entry to this dabpage? I've do research into it and I cannot find any places that people make the mistake of refering to "Baynet" and "Bayonet" (although there's plenty the other way round). Plus I'm inclined to think that the ISP isn't really notable anyway, given it doesn't have an article <small>(for example could you tell me its URL?)</small>. It's worth remembering that dabpages are not there to list dictionary definitions and everything that could potentially be meant be a term - they're there to help readers find the article they intended to get in the first place. I find it very unlikely that anyone searches for "bayonet" intending to find the ISP "Baynet".

<p>The CRS are mentioned in an enormous number of French songs, short stories, political tracts, comic books and so on.

<p>Can you provide a source to support the black powder loading of <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot_gun.html" title="Riot gun">riot gun</a> munitions? I know that ammo for the 37mm M203 clones often uses BP substitutes to keep working pressures low (and I've also seen fishing bobbers used as projectiles), but I've also seen cross-sections of the 40mm grenade rounds that use a specially shaped powder combustion chamber to give a breif burst of high pressure (to ensure a clean burn of the smokeless powder) followed by expansion into a large chamber to reduce the pressure propelling the round. There's probably little tactical reason to prefer smokeless vs. BP, but BP and most BP substitutes do significantly increase maintainence requirements, due to the large quantities of potentially corrosive residue. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 15:08, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When a teargas grenade gun (if it is powered by an explosive cartridge like ordinary guns) is fired, does it make a visible muzzle flash? If so, how much? Please comment on any faults or errors or omissions in the files at the 2 above links.</p>

</ul>
<p>Yes, and it can be quite large. Most of them use black powder launch charges, which cause a flash, and a shower of sparks up to 6 feet long from the muzzle. Here are some pics:</p>

<p>Yes and No. Some launchers do expel a shower of sparks and some don't. It depends on the launcher make and the make of the riot ammunition from various company's.

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Just a note, when replying to numbered comments, (# at the start), using the normal indentation method (:, and * and etc) starts the following number over at the beginning, thus making it hard to figure out the total count in a long list of numbered comments. In order to comment withing numbered lists, you can use #: or #* . (Number symbols, for numbered comments, plus the indentation symbol). These make indents while maintaining the numbers of the following statements.

<p>Just to let you know for future purpose, Googling porn stars is not a good technique to use because porn websites frequently use Googlebombing to multiply the number of hits a particular porn actor has. So, it's best to never use Google as a reference for porn AfD's. =) <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 22:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am sorry to inform you that your Request for Adminship (RfA) has failed to reach sufficient <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> for promotion, and has now been delisted and archived. Please do not look upon this outcome as a discouragement, but rather as an opportunity to improve. Try to address the concerns raised during your RfA and, in a few months' time, resubmit your request. Thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia in this capacity! <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 13:56, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Though it sometimes sounds like just boilerplate, it's true that a lot of second RfAs are successful if the candidate works on whatever deficiencies were raised during the first one. I think you'd do well if you wanted to run again. You'd definitely have my support.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 17:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I see others recommending three months, but you have a long history, so maybe longer? On the other hand, you got pretty specific criticism at your RfA, so if you try to address those concerns, two months would probably be fine. I'd suggest continuing to participate in AfDs and maybe some <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">DRVs</a> to see critique of closures there. You might also participate in RfA as a&#160;!voter, as that is a good way to find out what the consensus expectations are. I could give you a point-by-point on recommendations to improve (a sort of editor review) if you want.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with Kchase, it was a bit obvious that most of the processes were new to you, but if you stick around and participate in the areas Kchase mentioned the next RFA shouldn't be a problem. You can look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_GRBerry_57fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/GRBerry">GRBerry's</a> RFA for comparison: His edit count numbers and service time aren't overwhelming, but he was well enough known from his contributions in Wikipedia space that his request met with unanimous support.

<p>OK, here goes. I'm largely basing this on the things in A1 in your RFA. First, I'd suggest carefully reading the policies and process guides for the areas you want to be involved in. Then get involved in them, observe and participate in discussions of whether policy is being properly applied, and then go read the policy again to form your own opinions about it. Things rarely sink in on the first read, and there are some pretty fine points to some of them.</p>
<p>Participation in the processes on the level of an editor helps to prepare you for performing the admin functions. If you'll be speedying articles, do a little <a href="../../../n/p/p/WP%7ENPP_2bb0.html" title="WP:NPP">new page patrolling</a> to learn the criteria. If you'll be blocking folks for vandalism, do some <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">recent changes patrol</a>. As the last neutral said, you have to warn vandals, because they're not supposed to be blocked if they haven't received 4 warnings. I've found <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_RC_monobook.js_df47.html" title="User:Voice of All/RC/monobook.js">this tool</a> invaluable for warning users quickly and reporting them to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">AIV</a> in a snap. To proactively find vandalism, <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_Anti-vandal_tool_1cdb.html" title="User:Lupin/Anti-vandal tool">User:Lupin/Anti-vandal_tool</a> is good. <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">AIV</a> also gives a quick guide to when it's appropriate to block vandals. In practice, many admins will block faster, but AIV describes the ideal.</p>
<p>Participate in RfAs for other candidates. It helps you to find out what the community's expectations are, and to see areas that I haven't noticed where you can improve. When you do run again, check out <a href="../../../g/r/f/WP%7EGRFA_5f5a.html" title="WP:GRFA">WP:GRFA</a> and the more succinct <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Your_RfA_1917.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Your RfA">User:NoSeptember/Your RfA</a>. During RFA week, stick to areas you're comfortable with; a minor error can cascade into no consensus, especially if it was early in the process (I had <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Kchase02_f3b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Kchase02">my own cockup</a>, but it was in the last 24 hrs). When the sting of it all wears off, go back and read the criticism again. I intentionally didn't cover points where you got good advice during the RFA.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that your RFA barely failed, and mostly because of some things that you did during the process. It looked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Anthony_Appleyard&amp;oldid=96376191" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Anthony_Appleyard&amp;oldid=96376191" rel="nofollow">like this</a> half way through. With any luck, your second RFA will end that way.
