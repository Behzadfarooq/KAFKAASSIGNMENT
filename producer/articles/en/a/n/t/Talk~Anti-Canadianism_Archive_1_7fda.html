<li>Haha. You crack me up. The problem is the entire article reeks of anti-Canadianism from an American point of view. Again, I asseverate my opinion: this is not really an article about anti-Canadianism. Just a perception of anti-Canadianism through the lenses of an American.</li>

Maybe he's not a Canadian in <i>spirit</i>, but he lost the 1995 referendum, and thus, still resides in Canada and must pay the GST.

<dd>Lots of things wrong with your arguments. According to the first link provided above, you did say only Canadians can be left-wing or right-wing. "not a Canadian. This makes him neither left nor right." Secondly Rene Levesque was well-known for being a social democrat. He nationalized everything. "Really, how old are you? It's not me who seems to be disagreeing with this article. There seems to be a lot of people who don't agree with this article." Er, no. If you actually go through the history of this article and the AfD, you'll note that the article being voted on had no actual substance; it was a silly copy and paste. That's what was "Not really needed here" according to some of the merge and delete voters, and the keep voters wanted what had been written here- "some sources of people hating Canadians must be around somewhere", "there is definitely enough anti-Canadianism down there to warrant an article," "<b>Keep</b>, <b>expand</b>, and <b>verify</b>." No one had a problem with what you deleted. What you had deleted hadn't actually been written yet. In fact there seemed to be no moral objections. Anti-Canadianism will never be as weighty as anti-Semitism. You are getting upset over a very silly issue. While we're on the issue of the article's history, no, I did not start the article, as you insist below. It started out as a silly copy and paste by someone and a few other editors, including myself, turned it into an article. "Am I not entitled to condense information in a manner that is both informative, succint and yet germane to the topic of the article at hand?" What on earth is informative about "<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>'s 1995 satirical [Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]"? Canadian Bacon <i>what</i>? Why is it in this article? What's the relation to anti-Canadianism? Finally, your replacement of one image with a copyrighted image may not be fair use. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Cæsar is turn’d to hear</a></small> 16:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Are these even arguments?</span></h2>
<p>Really. Are these even arguments? Have you even read the article yourself? Other than Volitare, Brazil and Bouchard, it reeks of utter anti-Canadianism by an America. I'm glad its a mangled train-wreck. In fact, I'm hoping this article/"stub" gets deleted in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Oh by the way, I think you need to get that "Canadian" off your name, CanadianCaesar. Looks like you aren't really that Canadian after all, eh?</p>
<ul>
<li>By the way, I looked at the achives of the debate over whether this article should be deleted. The archives show that most of the people wanted to either merge this article with Canada or delete it all together.
<ul>
<li>The article has significantly changed since the AfD debate. Anyway, I don't think "it reeks of utter anti-Canadianism by an America." ("an America"?) It does not endorse any views, but reports them, or at least it did until you deleted everything you didn't agree with. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Cæsar is turn’d to hear</a></small> 06:26, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah yes, your political correctness provides me with yet another reason to laugh. Really, are you so grammatically perspicacious in public as you are right now? Please remember that, as I have so wisely pointed out, that despite your mumblings and ramblings, there are only THREE NON-AMERICAN ANTI-CANADIAN VIEWS: BRAZIL, VOLITARE AND QUEBEC. Doesn't this reek of anti-Canadianism by an American?
<ul>
<li>By the way, just for the record, most of the views expressed here either belong in the following articles: Canadian Culture, Canada, Quebec Sovereigntist Movement or Canada-U.S. Relations.
<ul>

<dd>You still haven't resonded to the logic above. I have no idea how anyone can get this upset over something so trivial. What this article started out as, it is not anymore.

<dd>Your arguments are inane as they are puerile. "Why cant we have anti-Canadianism" when we have "anti-Australianism" or "anti-Americanism?" Is that what you are corroborating the legitimacy of this article upon? Just because Australia has an "anti-Australianism" or "anti-Americanism" doesn't have any bearing in our discussion. Stop trying to deflect the focus of our argument. The main issue here is the legitimacy of this article which, in accordance to the first post, was founded as a silly "post-up" from the anti-American site. This is VANDALISM. As you have explicitly stated, Wikipedia is a congregation of impartial and diaphenous, "non-nonsense" content, not content that is "copied and pasted" for childish reasons. Your punctiliousness and alacrity to ensure that Wikipedia is neutral and informative is admirable. So why in the hell can you not summon the courage to delete this page, as this page is founded on childish and biased pretenses?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moreover, I find it interesting how you have brung up anti-Australianism and anti-Americanism. First things first: in the wake of the recent war in iraq and Afghanistan, it is clear that America is seen as the "Great Satan" around the world. Although I do like America, I would challenge you to name one country where it's people (not the government) align themselves with America. i would also like to remind you that Australia also participated in the war in Iraq, thus generating hatred among the Middle East. As a matter of fact, its embassy in Indonesia (or somewhere near that place) was bombed. Need I remind you the Bali Bombings in October of 2002? These actions are clear indicators of anti-Australianism and Americanism, thus giving at least SOME legitimate grounds to the article. On the contrary, other than Pat Buchanan and Ann Coulter, i would challenge you to find any country whose people's openly dislike Canada.</p>

<dd>The point I think I have stood by in relation to the article is that there is a difference between attacking something and reporting on something that is attacking something. What matters to me is not that x is true but that a notable y said x. Note that the version I have been reverting to had an actual reference section. It did not try to hide anything; unflattering evaluations of Canada could be included if they were verifiable. I believe also that an article with a history of vandalism and good edits must be maintained at a good version. Vandalism is reverted, or, if the article originated as nothing but nonsense, it is deleted or rewritten. I do, as a side note, have a soft spot for vandalized redirects that, turned into nonsense articles, are brought to AfD. This article originated as nonsense. But I do not believe vandalism in the history gives the article an irrideemable existence. I also believe patriotism should not stand in the way of the truth; in fact, in order for patriotism to be meaningful it must address the truth and adapt. Note also the image in the version I have been reverting to is public domain; the one now is fair use. I take the flag as it was meant, as satire. I do not find the article offensive because, as I have said, anti-Canadianism will never be as weighty as anti-Semitism. If it only reports on what other people are saying, it is not an attack on me or my country. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Cæsar is turn’d to hear</a></small> 08:49, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, in a nutshell, this debate is over whether or not the article should be deleted?

<ul>
<li>He does seem to be going back and forth from that argument to what the article should say; why he takes such interest in editing the article if he wants it at AfD instead is beyond me. I don't think he really understands our deletion system, as he seems to be challenging me to speedy it. It would most certainly not be a candidate. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Cæsar is turn’d to hear</a></small> 21:48, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I initially nominated this for AfD and you'll note if you look it was a "talking point" nomination. I wanted it confirmed one way or the other and enough people said keep.

<li>What are you expecting. Dear god it can't be deleted just on a whim. I quote from <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_Bold_7281.html" title="Wikipedia:Be Bold">Wikipedia:Be Bold</a>, "If someone writes an inferior article, a merely humorous article, an article stub, or outright patent nonsense, don't worry that editing it might hurt their feelings. Correct it, add to it, and, if it's total nonsense, replace it." It is perfectly allowed to write over nonsense. It doesn't contaminate the whole article. Only an AfD can do it, and the result was keep.

<p>I don't think another AfD for this article is really going to change anything. I participate in AfD on a pretty regular basis and looking at the previous debate I can tell you that another debate would easily result in a 'keep' decision. I think it might even qualify for a speedy keep depending on who nominated it. At this point I think the article just needs more work.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comments from Evanx</span></h3>
<p>Looking at the debates and the previous AfD, I believe there is substantial support for the article. The issue is then if it is notable enough, which is provided by references. Hence, if such a phenomenon proves to exist, and that it fits the polciies of Wikipedia, it should then be allowed a place in it. An AfD without valid justification is just wasting the community's time and effort. I reccomend looking at the <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOWBALL_47ec.html" title="WP:SNOWBALL">WP:SNOWBALL</a> essay for why such a case would prove fruitless.</p>
<p>The proper cause of action is to improve the article with NPOV statements that will lend credit to all parties involved. Otherwise, the vandals will inevitably face a ban or AfC, both of which are very unpleasant scenarios.</p>
<p>I reiterate that the premise for everyone is to be involved and work cooperatively despite divergences in opinion, towards a common goal of improvement.</p>

<p>Ok, it looks like improvement to the article needs to start with getting good references.

<li>This is ridiculous. A month ago, I thought this article would be deleted on the grounds that the page itself was founded on vandalism itself. Why are we still having this discussion? The fact of the matter is somebody should delete this page immediately. It distorts the reality of true anti-Canadianism and provides a fallacious view of anti-Canadianism itself. The entire article itself needs citing.</li>

<p>For example, "Many, like Conrad Black or David Frum have chosen to leave the country feeling that Canada is unsalvageable."</p>
<p>"In 2006, right-wing American strategist Paul Weyrich said Canadians are "so liberal and hedonistic" that they have a philosophy of "cultural Marxism"."</p>
<p>"Dislike for Canada may rise for two reasons: a general dislike for "the West", in which Canada is included, or a specific objection to policies and attitudes of Canada and Canadians.

<li>You're absolutely incredible. No matter how many times something is explained to you, you regress back to your old arguments which have no known basis in Wikipedia policy, precedent, or practice. Yes, you requested deletion. Why are we still having this argument? Because you are not the owner of Wikipedia. We do not take marching orders from you and we may not agree with everything you say. Or any of it. You have way too high an opinion of yourself. You say "The fact of the matter is somebody should delete this page immediately." Um, what "facts" are you speaking of? Can you point out how this fits the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Criteria for speedy deletion</a>? It's not pure vandalism because a few people have made good edits to it; its nothing like the original version which you insist is vandalism. What you're referring to is not fact but <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a>. And really, the only thing wrong with those quotes is that they offend your sensibilities. "Many, like Conrad Black or David Frum have chosen to leave the country feeling that Canada is unsalvageable." Inaccurate how? "In 2006, right-wing American strategist Paul Weyrich said Canadians are "so liberal and hedonistic" that they have a philosophy of "cultural Marxism"." Inaccurate how? "Dislike for Canada may rise for two reasons: a general dislike for "the West", in which Canada is included, or a specific objection to policies and attitudes of Canada and Canadians. The latter type is generally limited to the few countries who have a history of important disputes with Canada." Inaccurate how? I know you like to live in a fantasy world where everyone loves Canada and thinks of it as a peacekeeping nation, but in reality the common view of Canadians as peacekeepers went down the drain in the early 1990s when Canadian soldiers in Yugoslavia committed those human rights abuses. If you went to the Middle East, I bet some of them would dislike Canada as part of the "West". I advise you to read through all of the talk page, note the many opinions besides mine (1) in favour of keeping this article and (2) convinced another AfD would be pointless, and then go back to doing something constructive, presuming you have ever done anything constructive on Wikipedia, ever. (I noticed on your talk page, under the heading "Please stop" that you have a history of this sort of thing). Oh, and on I final note, I know I'm patriotic enough that I don't need to know your opinion on whether I'm anti-Canadian; those personal attacks have never had any affect on me no matter how many times you repeat them. I also support abolishing the monarchy. I view that as an essentially patriotic standpoint as well. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 04:04, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Once again, CanadianCaesar, you have shown what as asinine person you. Your exgesis made absolutely no sense and lacked any iota of a logical syllogism. You say that I am not the owner of Wikipedia, yet you go on to say that, "We do not take marching orders from you and we may not agree with everything you say. Or any of it. You have way too high an opinion of yourself." So how am I "incredible" when I "regress back to my old argument?" You're not the owner of Wikipedia, so I take it that I don't need to take "marching orders" from you either. Really, what good is it being a lawyer if you can't even use logical deduction? The fact of the matter is (Just for the record, it's a figure of speech), half of the article is based on utter opinion, biases and stereotypes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, your reference to my three examples are just nuts. For the record, let's see those three "facts" again:</p>
<p>"Many, like Conrad Black or David Frum have chosen to leave the country feeling that Canada is unsalvageable."</p>
<p>"In 2006, right-wing American strategist Paul Weyrich said Canadians are "so liberal and hedonistic" that they have a philosophy of "cultural Marxism"."</p>
<p>"Dislike for Canada may rise for two reasons: a general dislike for "the West", in which Canada is included, or a specific objection to policies and attitudes of Canada and Canadians. The latter type is generally limited to the few countries who have a history of important disputes with Canada."</p>
<p>I'd like to know which one of these "facts" are actually facts? If the first one is (as you say) is accurate, then I guess it's also safe to say (for example) that Canada is the best country in the world because its been ranked 10 times by the UN HDI Index. I guess it's safe to say that (for example) America sucks because many liberals in America feel that America is "unsalvageable." I guess it's also safe to say that most Mexicans feel Mexico is "unsalvageable" because many Mexicans have moved to America. And, finally, I guess it's also safe to say that most Germans are Nazis because Hitler was Austrian-German. The truth is, none of the statements are true, and even if they were, they would have no proof to corroborate it. Similarily, where is the proof that "Conrad Black" or "David Frum" feels that Canada is unsalvageable. They may have given up their Canadian citizenship, but where is the proof that both men feel that Canada is "unsalvageable?" And what does "unsalvageable" refer to? Does it refer to Canada's policy? It's politics? Or it's people? The same idea can be used for the second statement. "Cultural marxism?" Please. Are you this myopic that you can't even see two meters in front of you? Canada is a parliamentary and socially democratic country. You mention that other nations dislike Canada as a "Western" nation. However, cultural marxism states that the government (taking its cue from Marxism) controls cultural facets of the society, by regulating the media and spewing forth propaganda. What country doesn't do that? Liberals in America have hardly a voice in politics, just as much as conservatives in Canada have hardly a voice in politics (Actually, that's not true. The current Prime Minister of Canada is conservative). And if Weyrich is going to attack Canada as culturally marxist, then he should also attack the policies of Great Britain, the Baltic countries and Japan (just to name a few) as these countries are much more socially progressive than we are. Need I remind you that most buses and streets in England are monitored by CCTV cameras?</p>
<p>And finally, I don't need this lecture on the Wikipedia Criteria deletion or any of that utter crap. What is your point in trying to tell me that what I'm saying does not cut the mustard for the Wikipedia Deletion Criterion? Again, I reiterate. This site was founded on vandalism, as you clearly state that this page was made by a person who copied and pasted the anti-American page. If you are so alacritious and perspicacious in your attempts to make Wikipedia a non-biased and informative source, what justifies the creation of this page? After all, it was founded by a person who thought that it would be a "practical joke". I've noticed that you've never really addressed me directly on this issue, so I'm just curious as to why you can't answer this question. If your going to lecture me on the etqiuette of Wikipedia, then you need to look in the mirror and see the double standards that you are using. Wake up and smell the coffee. Stop acting like an administrator on Wikipedia, because (frankly) as far as I am concerned, your not. This argument is a waste of my and (and, I'm presuming) your time too.</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I have never supported the monarch crown and never will. I don't know why it's there on my homepage, but I'm going to delete it. "Immediately." <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadia_5804.html" title="User:Canadia">Canadia</a>, 6:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See, this is the problem. You think the <i>statements</i> have to be true. They don't. What has to be true is that these things were <i>stated</i>. This isn't an essay designed to show Canada sucks. This is an article designed to show what anti-Canadianism looks like. What's "incredible" (not incredible in a good way, but incredible meaning astounding) is that you can't grasp that this "site" (it's actually an article- Wikipedia is a website) isn't doomed for deletion just because the first version was weird. See <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenu.html" title="Xenu">Xenu</a> for a featured article that started out as a weird copy and paste. The article doesn't belong to the creator and we don't have to justify the creation- the article has been changed and I justify its <i>existence</i> because I feel anti-Canadianism is notable- a real discussion involving important albeit stupid people, referenced in fiction such as Blame Canada. Finally, as for me not being an adminstrator because you don't think I'm one, well, I am an administrator, I can delete pages (and have deleted hundreds of them), and I can protect pages. And yes this is a waste of my time. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 06:50, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, I never implied or said the statements had to be true. Quite the opposite. I'm saying that for the statements to be true, they need to be corroborated by a verifiable source. I also like your second point where you say that this article isn't designed as a Canada sucks page. Well, not exactly. How can people get the impression that Canada doesn't suck when people read statements like, "Canada is unsalvageable" and "If Canada were to break into pieces, America would pick up the parts." I understand that the main purpose is to show what anti-Canadianism looks like and, in the process, is supposed to show the truth about Canada. The problem is that people don't exactly see that message and therefore have a negative and, more importantly, <i>distorted</i> view of Canada. I fail to see how the comments of three American Conservative commentators and one French philosopher (who, by the way, wasn't even referring to Canada, as "Canada" was only comprised of New France and Acadia at the time) reflect true anti-Canadianism. Even you feel that albiet ant-Canadiasm is "notable," not everybody feels the same way as you (and I justify this statement on the grounds that everybody in Wikipedia is entitled to their own opinion) and most of the people you are debating with are "idiots," (such as the person who referenced the fiction "Blame Canada"), so these "people" lose their credibility when they tread on the subject of anti-Canadianism. If you really want to end this useless and puerile argument, then delete this page. Again, it's an absolute waste of my time. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadia_5804.html" title="User:Canadia">Canadia</a> 9:02, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If anyone reading this cannot help but feel that Canada sucks, then that person has some really serious issues regarding independent thinking. The fact is, Wikipedia has many articles that go over criticisms things receive- but people reading over this stuff <i>do not have to believe everything they read</i>. I've always had some fear that the age of independent thinking is coming to a close, and if you're going to argue that information should now be destroyed because there's a real fear that the masses will believe that stuff is frightening. And really, you say it doesn't reflect real anti-Canadian. Then please, by all means add real anti-Canadian discussion to the article. Your final statement, "If you really want to end this useless and puerile argument, then delete this page," says that you are unwilling to compromise and must absolutely have your way. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 19:38, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't see how anybody who reads this article would not get a warped and distorted view of Canada. Have you read the article yourself? According to the article, Canada is a "few acres of snow" that is "culturally marxist," "unsalvageable" and "not a real country." How can anybody not be swayed by this crap? As I have strenuously and vociferously maintaned, most of the stereotypes of Canada are utter biases. (See above) I'm not trying to dampen the independent thinking that Wikipedia subscribes to. I know that Wikipedia is a diaphanous source of information where articles can be presented in the way that people believe it should. If <i>you</i> think that the creation of the an "anti-Canadian" page is an example of "independent thinking," then for it. But you need to understand that for every viewpoint, there is a counterbalance viewpoint. Just because you believe that this article warrants a creation doesn't give you legitimate grounds to change and edit what you feel is felicitious. (Same goes for me) My proposal is this: lock the article down tentatively and get some constructive dialogue going. As far as I'm concerned, this arguing is a waste of my time and is tempered by my going to revert the article back to what I think is the right revision. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadia_5804.html" title="User:Canadia">Canadia</a> 11:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Where does the article say Canada is "unsalvageable" and "not a real country"? Again, it says that people have said these things. Of course these are biases. That's what the article is about. And yes, I have read the article. I'm not swayed by it because I know these are just other people's opinions. It doesn't give any view of Canada, it gives a view of anti-Canadianism. It's offensive by nature, but that doesn't mean you have to agree with it. It's always about what you think is the right revision. You, you, you. If you want balance try adding to the article instead of deleting things mercilessly. How can anyone feel bold enough to expand and reference it when you're destroying it every day? Something there now won't be there tomorrow. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 03:35, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yet again, we see the utter inanity and biasness that permeates your argument. Who are you to tell me not to delete things mercilessly? Aren't you doing EXACTLY the same thing? Again, pot calling the kettle black. You can't accuse me of doing something you yourself is commensurately guilty of. "Where does the article say Canada is "unsalvageable?" Right under "Views from the right" when somebody gratuitously put Conrad Black and David Frum as "believing Canada is unsavlageable." Even as you admit, these are biases. And as we know, biases have absolutely no place in Wikipedia because it's a source of information that is supposed to present information neutrally and fairly. Your argument to tell me to try to "balance the article by adding to it" is also ridiculous. Since when did you get this idea that I agreed with any of the original stuff that was put on the article? You say that I always change the article to what I think "is the right revision," yet you try to ask me to add to the article that reflects your opinion. Go figure. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadia_5804.html" title="User:Canadia">Canadia</a> 8:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
