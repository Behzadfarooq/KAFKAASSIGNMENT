<p>Hi <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a>,</p>
<p>It has to be un-controversial. See the very lengthy discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mordechai_Vanunu#Whistleblower" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mordechai_Vanunu#Whistleblower" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you're not sure, check the policy <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">here</a>. Because it is controverisal to associate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, it's best to leave the category out. Cheers. --<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 19:41, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a>, thanks for the link. I think it would be more a propos if we were discussing whether a specific individual were an antisemite, and whether to put him in the category of AS people, or whether to put Anti-Zionists in such a category. But we're not doing that. Anti-semitism is virtually <i>always</i> controversial. But what isn't controversial is whether notable people have linked it to AZ (or the AZ folks themselves have). That's not something we can disgaree about, or is a matter of POV. It's just true. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 20:02, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anti-semitism is almost always controversial, I agree, but this article has to do with political zionism more than racism. I've got no doubt that someone researching anti-Semitism will find their way here via "new anti-Semitism". I understand that notable people have associated AZ with AS, but thats a controversial association (which the article asserts), and <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">WP:CAT</a> is clear. With these points in mind, I think it would be better to have the category removed.

<dd>Yes, the article has an entire section dedicated to it, however, the association between AZ and AS is rather contested. Should anti-Zionism be categorized as anti-Semitism, I have to say, no. Per <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">WP:CAT</a>, <b>unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category</b>.

<p>Why does Anti-Isreali redirect to this page that pretty much states that if you have legimate concerns with the way the state of Isreal conducts itself you are an anti-semitic racist. Either seperate Anti-Isreal and Anti-Zionism or make this page less biased, btw oh so many statements on this page need citations, just worried that if one spent the time to do it it will just be erased, as much constructive criticism on any page that has anything to do with the Jewish ethnicity, Judaism, or Isreal is (perhaps this page would also be better if the distinction between the three were made).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">opposition to one of the opinions above</span></h2>
<p>This is an opposition to the MR./Mrs. opinion sited in one of the sections above. There is a huge difference between anti-zionism and anti-semitism. If you wanna go back in history you can find find that the word semitic refers either to Jews/Arabs, thus Arabs cannot be anti-semitic, but most of them are anti-zoinist.</p>
<p>Second, when someone is anti-semitic he is against all the jews (and also Arabs consequently), but when someone believes in anti-zionism then he/she is agains jews who went to palestine and agree that Israel is a country that should be built by force. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by A J Damen (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_J_Damen_95ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/A J Damen">contribs</a>) 18:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I'd consider that to be only half true. Yes, an anti-zionist is opposed to Israel in its current form, and not necessarily anti-semetic, but I would argue that anti-semetism relates only to world Jewry regardless of whatever quasi-relavent link there might be to Arabs. A similar cultural/linguistic bond exists between the English and the French. Is anglophobia applicable to Frenchmen? -- <a href="../../../w/o/z/User%7EWozocoxonoy_c5a6.html" title="User:Wozocoxonoy">User:Wozocoxonoy</a> 13:30 GMT 31/01/07</p>

<p>I saw a number of edit reverts so wanted to try the idea that "rights" are defined somewhere else (and thus should be stated as to where this right is derived from) whereas you can make your own "claims" without need of any {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}s.

<p>Related to the point made above: the article explains anti-Zionism as something that is motivated by Arab discontent, either practical or ideological, and anti-Semitism. I think that there should be a section which explains opposition to Zionism on the plain logical basis that it is a claim only, and, whether framed in terms of a 'claim' or 'right', the reasons given for that putative claim/right really are (to betray my own opinion on the matter) lacking to the point of absurdity considering that the claim/right is one as substantial as to a homeland or State.</p>

<p>Without a clear definition of what 'anti-Zionism' is, there is always going to be a great deal of contention as to what content is acceptable for inclusion. There isn't a single reference which addresses the specific phenomenon of 'anti-Zionism'. The article cites a number of references to different individuals and organizations, with writings on Zionism, Israel, and opposition to both for various reasons as perceived by the author. The sources are, though generally <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, often politically motivated on one side or the other.</p>
<p>This collection of opinion amounts to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, with topics and quotes collected from a wide range of sources. The sources have all been selected to back or refute a particular point of view. For example, "Types of anti-Zionism", near the introduction, describes what is qualified for inclusion in the rest of the article. There are four "types" mentioned in this section, and many more introduced throughout the article (Jewish anti-Zionism, Soviet anti-Zionism, etc). Who has decided these are the types of anti-Zionism? <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Barnett_0d39.html" title="Thomas Barnett">Thomas Barnett</a> alludes to one (without explicitly stating what is written for the article), and the others are completely unsourced.</p>
<p>I have been involved with this article off and on for almost two years. It is in desperate need of a cleanup. I do not know how this can be accomplished without a clear indication of what the article is about.</p>
<p>If there is a single scholarly work on anti-Zionism is a specific phenomenon, someone please let me know.</p>

<dd>I'd like to second this request, based on the same sentiments. Looking on Google and Dictionary.com, I can't find a single definition of anti-Zionism other than here and on a geocities website of a clearly very pro-Zionism group. From my little looking into this article, it seems that it is basically simply a discussion of opposition to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, which has been labeled "anti-Zionism." As far as anti-Zionism as an established and recognized movement of its own, I can't seem to find it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If that's the case, we could still have an article, but it seems it should be clear about what it is: a neologism for opposition to Zionism. Then we could explain the various forms of opposition to Zionism, noting that some opposition takes extremist forms, in addition to whatever else is relevant. I would generally say the article should not pretend anti-Zionism is an established movement then, however, but simply discuss it as opposition to Zionism, in the various counties, shapes and forms. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 21:49, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having given it a little thought, my feeling is that the article should probably be rewritten as an article on opposition to Zionism, not an article on the term anti-Zionism. This is based on a few things 1. From Google searching, the far and away primary usage of the term seems to be to criticize anti-Zionism, and to paint it as anti-semitic. 2. I believe most opposition to Zionism has a rather more specific basis than "anti-Zionism." Labeling all opposition to Zionism as "anti-Zionism" misses the point that it may be pro-something else. 3. While anti-Zionism as such may exist, I'm not sure it justifies an article by itself. If it does, it would probably be a short one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that means changing the article's title, but I think the substance should refrain from pretending that anti-Zionist is an accepted phrase by people who object to Zionism in one form or another. That would mean describing opposition to Zionism more and anti-Zionism less. Other thoughts? Are there other articles on more specific objections to a Jewish state? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 14:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anti-Israel redirects here. I think this article should have the title changed to "opposition to Zionism" and focus specifically on opposition to politicial zionism, not the state of Israel. After more than a centurty of active political Zionism, someone must have surely written and published a comprehensive work on opposition to Zionism which can be used for a foundation. --<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 20:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Do we need a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> source to tell us that when people critisize "Zionists" or ""Zionist regimn" or "Zionism" they mean the homeland (or the right to a home land) of the Jewish people&#160;?</li>
<li>Has any one of you &lt;b? ever spoken with Arab speaker about Israelis or zionists&#160;? they use one name for all&#160;: "Yahoud" (in Arabic - a jew). so even if King did not say it the issue need be clear on the article anti-Zionism - is in many cases - anti-semitism. maybe we should have a section titled "When anti-zionism is <b>not</b> antisemitism&#160;?"

<dd>I would like to clarify something, and that is the difference between anti-zionism and criticism of Israel. Anti-zionism is opposition to the existance of Israel. Critizing Israel can occur without being anti-zionist, meaning without wanting to wipe Israel off the map. If you want Israel wiped off the map, which is the definition of anti-zionism, that is a clear antisemitic belief in my opinion.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 02:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The source is “The Socialism of Fools: The Left, the Jews and Israel” by Seymour Martin Lipset; in Encounter magazine, December 1969, p. 24. As for the Electronic Intifada link, the author doesn't state that that specific quote is actually false, he just questions it based on some statement in the Harvard Crimson and other dark mutterings and speculation; most of his article is about other authors, other actual fake quotes, and a polemic about Israel since King's time. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 05:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seymour Lipset was an ardent Israel supporter and his claims are unverifiable, since they were conveniently made after King had passed away. A source does not suffice; it must be a verifiable source (which is what I asked for in the first place), and the Electronic Intifada article provides enough elements (e.g. the lack of a single 1968 reference to King's alleged speech at Harvard that year) to cast doubt on the whole story of his equating anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism. Surely the Harvard Crimson would have reported on a speech by Dr. King? If it did, surely some pro-Zionist site would have come up with a scanned version of the relevant Crimson article, in rebuttal of the Electronic Intifada site? This is not a matter of "anyone writing anything on the Internet"; it's a matter of a website doubting that Dr. King spoke at Harvard in 1968 and of no-one being able to prove that he did. --200.117.49.56 00:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Congressman Lewis' quotation of King is nearly identical to Lipset's and has the same problem as the latter: it makes mention of a Harvard speech by King that is not documented anywhere else. The King quote should go because (a) it comes from partisan sources, and (b) a reasonable, well-grounded doubt has been cast on it.200.43.26.153 16:46, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well grounded? I don't call doubt based on extremist websites like electronicintifada.net to be well grounded doubt, especially since they never explicitly say it is fake. Instead they mainly focus on how Dr. King isn't a reliable source. And Congressman Lewis' quotation is not the same, because he is very different.

<dd>Your assertion that EI is extremist is your POV. Moreover, as I'm becoming tired of repeating, they raise the point that no other source exists confirming King's alleged speech at Harvard. Harvard has a newspaper and it didn't report on King's speech -- very curious, since King was a celebrity by then. Even if you consider EI to be extremist, this is a fact. Nobody has come up with DIRECT evidence of King's speech. It's all hearsay from people with an axe to grind. All we rely on is an Anti-Defamation League booklet, and Lewis' probable quoting thereof.200.117.181.207 04:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

MLK made a speech at harvard. EI is extremist because it specificly says on their home page "The Electronic Intifada (EI), found at electronicIntifada.net, publishes news, commentary, analysis, and reference materials about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict from a Palestinian perspective. "<a href="http://electronicintifada.net/new.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://electronicintifada.net/new.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> From that there, we can assume that they won't publish the zionist perspective, or provide a balanced, accurate report on Israel or zionism. Instead they will attempt to invalidate their arguements. From what I have read of their articles, this seems to be the case. I doubt John Lewis has something to prove by supporting zionism, and he did know MLK personally, so he would have been able to varify that this was MLK's view. --<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 04:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

Except that it has been reported that he said the anti-zionism comment in reputable journals, and only now on some extremist website is there anything that says otherwise. So I view those contentions as irrelevant. What's left? Having lost the debate about <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">reliable sources</a>, you now say that the statement is irrelevant. That's not true. Dr. King is an important figure in American history. What people remember about him is his dedication to civil rights and equality. And when confronted by someone about Zionism, he told that person that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. Its entirely germaine (on point in every way). And it isn't to us to apply formal logic rules to a statement in order to exclude it on the grounds that (according to you) it doesn't make sense. King thought it made sense, apparently.

The Rebbe zt"l was quite strongly opposed to especially religious Zionism. He was just concerned for the safety of the Jews in Eretz Yisroel. If there had been no danger from the Arabs, he would probably have supported dismantling the entire state. According to Lubavitch, the state is the least bad thing we can have right now, so we have to maintain it. A view that definitely has merit. But to portray them as being Zionists? Not quite.

<dd>1. Chabad is not pro-Zionism, it's anti-Zionism, Zionism being defined as the belief that Jews ought to set up a secular state during the time of exile. This can be backed up by numerous statements of the Rebbe Rashab, the Previous Rebbe, and the Rebbe.</dd>
<dd>2. Nowhere in the link Jenny provides is this contradicted. It doesn't speak about the insitution of the state or the government there at all. It simply speaks of how Chabad runs programs for the benefit of the Jews living in Israel, not for the benefit of the state. There's no comparison.</dd>
<dd>3. What Chussid writes: "Ask any (serious) Lubavitcher whether he is a Zionist and he will tell you you are insulting him" is accurate.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Equating Anti-Zionism to antisemitism not scientific</span></h2>
<p>The whole section on the correlation between Anti-Zionism and antisemitism requires major rewriting -- if not complete deletion.</p>
<p>When Kaplan and Small find "an almost perfect correlation between anti-Zionist attitudes and frank anti-Semitism" they're concluding that both phenomena usually go hand-in-hand -- NOT that they're the same thing. (To understand this, think that you can also find an almost perfect correlation between crashing your car into a tree and driving drunk -- and they're not the same thing.)</p>
<p>Counterexamples of the equation anti-Zionism = antisemitism abound, but I don't see them cited here. No mention whatsoever is made of such well-known personalities as Noam Chomsky or Norman Finkelstein, who can be accused of being anti-Zionist zealots, lefty loonies, etc., but NOT antisemites.</p>
<p>The heading "When anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism" should be removed because it gives the impression that Wikipedia agrees with the ideas ascribed to "some" in the paragraph below it. Alternately, it could be reworded to "When anti-Zionism, according to some, is not anti-semitism", but I think we all agree that it would be an awkward heading, so let's better remove it.</p>
<p>Also, the contents of such paragraph is highly debatable: "Some say that when critism against Israeli policies or the occupation of the Palestinian territories does not cross the line to object to Israel's right to exist it should not be regarded as anti-Semitism." This is a non-scientific claim. The definition of antisemitism used must be coherent with that given by Wikipedia: "Antisemitism (alternatively spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is hostility toward or prejudice against Jews as a religious, racial, or ethnic group, which can range in expression from individual hatred to institutionalized, violent persecution."</p>
<p>"Crossing the line" and denying Israel's right to exist does not automatically mean being hostile or prejudiced against Jews as a group, any more than denying Scotland's right to be an independent country automatically means being hostile or prejudiced against Scotspeople. Please see <a href="http://www.workersliberty.org/node/7203" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.workersliberty.org/node/7203" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> to get a very clear example of someone who is totally opposed to Israel's very existence, yet is fully compassionate about the tragedy of the Holocaust, clears Israel of the odious Nazi analogies and is himself a Jew.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is about information, not about making points. It is a pity that this article uncritically presents viewpoints, such as the equating of antisemitism and anti-Zionism, without a hint of supporting evidence; or that it instructs its readers about when to consider someone an antisemite. Please rewrite this section to meet elementary scientific criteria, or delete it altogether.200.82.50.232 04:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All of your insults notwithstanding, you appear to have missed my point. I did not say what is scientific or not. I said that our job on wikipedia was not to judge how scientific something is, but rather to report it. The fact that such a study took place, the findings (including statistics, etc.) and the conclusions reached by the "scientists" who made the study should be reported. If someone has refuted any of the claims that muir (or anyone else) made, and if his findings comply with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, then by all means that should be reported too. As it is, I could care less what the conclusion is. My position from the beginning was merely to comply with Wikipedia policy. (On a side note, I know that some of the neturei karta pages have been held not to comply with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, something that I understand but do not agree with. However, the sites have been deemed fit for use when presenting what the faction of NK represented on the specific site believes. NK has done a good job of rebutting the claim that anti-Zionism equals anti-Semitism, and I'm shocked that nobody has brought them in yet, on this issue). --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 17:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Almost perfect correlation" not so perfect</span></h2>
<p>The claim "They [i.e. Kaplan &amp; Small] found an almost perfect correlation between anti-Zionist attitudes and frank anti-Semitism" should be deleted. It is literally quoted from the highly partisan Diana Muir article (reference 19) and it is not accurate.</p>
<p>I've taken the trouble to go over K&amp;S's study and nowhere do they find an "almost perfect correlation". In fact, what they state is:</p>
<p><i>It is noteworthy that fewer than one-quarter of those with anti-Israel index scores of only 1 or 2 harbor anti-Semitic views (as defined by anti-Semitic index scores exceeding 5), which supports the contention that one certainly can be critical of Israeli policies without being anti-Semitic. However, among those with the most extreme anti-Israel sentiments in our survey (anti-Israel index scores of 4), 56% report anti-Semitic leanings</i>.</p>
<p>In other words, more than 75% of moderate critics of Israel are not antisemitic, and even among the most radical detractors of the country, fully 44% don't harbor antisemitic sentiments. That doesn't qualify as the "almost perfect correlation" that Muir (but not Kaplan and Small) finds.</p>
<p>I still believe the section on anti-Zionism and antisemitism should be completely rewritten or deleted altogether. To begin with, and if nobody objects, I'll delete the sentences which have been picked up from Diana Muir's inaccurate article. 200.82.66.34 00:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>i believe it's customary to explain an npov tag somewhere here... but since you mention npov, just above the disputed paragraph, surely everything from "They argue either that the Holocaust represented excessive persecution" to the end of the section can go? this is the article on anti-zionism, and the section describes/states the views of religious anti-zionists. the views of 'religious zionists', <i>lehavdil</i>, go in the relevant article, wherever that is. at most a see also might be appropriate, maybe.</p>
<p>on j n z perhaps it would help if the n y t cite were sourced directly to the paper. but more generally, no-one is claiming j n z is non-partisan, but why should it not be used as a source on satmarer &amp; other anti-zionist pronouncements on zionism. is there r s for their inventing such quotes?&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 14:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's JAZ, not JNZ. JNZ is an NK website. JAZ was founded by the Satmar Rov - see my latest addition to the section. But I also don't see the point. I also don't understand Jayg and Humus' pushing for 'WP:RS' because it would be a 'mailbox'. As I have pointed out before, at the bottom of every page it says that they are located at Wilson Street 183 in Brooklyn, NYC. Is that a PO Box? Does not seem like it to me. I can't go there to check, since I am B"H in Yerushalaim Ir HaKodesh. But if Jay and/or Humus, both of whom live in the USA, are so eager to denounce JAZ for being an anonymous PO Box organization, I wonder whether they have visited Wilson Street 183 and concluded that it houses a post office?

<p>With all respect, I don't know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor, in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around. I don't think this is the way to make people feel welcome on Wikipedia. Chussid should not make personal attacks, but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history. Any normal person in Chussid's position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks, which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 18:42, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The makers (webmasters) do not want the website to be identified as 'Satmar', because in much of the Jewish world, that will lead people to automatically dismiss the website as belonging to an irrelevant group of extremists. Like it or not (I for sure don't like it), you cannot deny the fact that the vast majority of American (and non-American) Jews do not particularly like Satmar. So to get their message across to the greater Jewish world (which is the focus of JAZ.com), they have to avoid characterizing themselves as a Satmar website. -<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChussid_2126.html" title="User:Chussid">Chussid</a> 16:25, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's discouraging to see people quoting the most partisan sources rather than the objective ones. Case in point, the Kaplan &amp; Small survey I've been referring to. Instead of quoting the actual survey, which is available on the web, some contributors prefer to quote from a heavily lopsided interpretation of the same. Another example is Martin Luther King's quote, which appeared in just one partisan source (which is an ADL booklet, not an independent magazine as erroneously claimed) and has since been challenged.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Threats</span></h2>
<p>The above discussion ("npov... now that you mention it") is closed. I was unable to convince Jayjg of the site's authenticity, so I gave up. Instead, I reconstructed the entire section, using <i>only</i> reliable sources. The sources I used are all scientific publications, from universities. After reconstructing the section, using only <i>reliable sources</i>, I received an emailed threat from Jayjg, who is a very senior administrator here and also a Jewish Zionist. He threatened to permanently ban me from Wikipedia. This just for the information of the community. This shows what his real objectives are. His objective is not to maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - it is to censor anything about Haredi Jewish anti-Zionism. He is completely obsessed with deleting anything even remotely inferring that the vast majority of Haredim (especially Hasidim) have always been and still are strongly anti-Zionist. Now that I have completely re-written the section, and he no longer has any ground to complain of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, he falls into plain threats. I am quite shocked.

<p>The Haredi section is poorly written, and is full of rambling, confusing, and run-on sentences.

<li>meshulam, that para in the source contains this sentence: "All Orthodox Jews, and notably the Hasidim, strongly opposed the Zionist movement from its inception, and while some Orthodox groups later embrace[sic] the Zionist cause, many groups remain resistant." so can we rv your 1st excision? furthermore your "historical anti-Zionist conceptions, inclinding isolation", could be misinterpreted as an attempt to justify your, somewhat tendentious, claims above. &amp; should haredi anti-zionism be ignored here because of the other article?</li>
<li>re the rest, obviously i know nothing about the 'threats' or whatever they may actually be, but if anyone has reason to suspect sock/evasion why can't they just collect evidence and report it as appropriate?

<dd>As to the first exclusion, it seems that two difference sentences in the article contradict one another. Why chose one over the other? Indeed, in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredim_and_Zionism_2261.html" title="Haredim and Zionism">Haredim and Zionism</a>, there is reference to a sefer Eim HaBonim Semeichah that has a very uncharacteriztic outlook on Zionsim (seemingly in favor) that is undoutedly written by a respected Haredi rov. There is plenty of reason to keep out a statement as blatantly POV as the one that I erase. Furthermore the "historical anti-Zionist conceptions..." statement is a direct quote, and is a far cry from what Daniel575/Chussid was claiming the article said. I have made my opinion clear: the entire statement should be removed for being superfluous and incorrect. But if it must stay, at least it should comply with Wikipedia's standards. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 03:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Diana Muir</span></h2>
<p>I have removed (twice by now) the following paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A formal, academic survey of attitudes towards Jewish people and Israel was recently conducted among 5,000 participants in ten European countries. Kaplan and Small of Yale University published the results in the <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>. They found an almost perfect correlation between anti-Zionist attitudes and frank anti-Semitism. People who believed that the Israeli soldiers "intentionally target Palestinian civilians," and that "Palestinian suicide bombers who target Israeli civilians" are justified, also believed that "Jews don't care what happens to anyone but their own kind," "Jews have a lot of irritating faults," and "Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This paragraph has two problems:</p>
<p>1) It's quoted verbatim, and without acknowledgment, from Diana Muir's article that is referenced only later in the section.</p>
<p>2) Diana Muir's article is not reliable. It talks about an "almost perfect correlation between anti-Zionist attitudes and frank anti-Semitism", but nowhere in their survey do Kaplan &amp; Small draw such conclusion. On the contrary, their assertions are far more nuanced: in the case of moderate critics of Israel, just 25% show anti-semitic leanings, and even in the case of the most extreme detractors of the country, fully 44% do not harbor such sentiment.</p>
<p>My stance, thus, has been this: since we do have access to Kaplan &amp; Small's survey, complete with their own conclusions, why don't we better quote directly from it? If someone thinks that K&amp;S's survey supports Muir's assertions, then please quote from the original article, not from Muir's interpretation of it. I personally have not been able to find any reference to an "almost perfect correlation" in K&amp;S.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's any Wikipedia rule about the preferential use of sources, but I believe original sources should have priority over interpretations of those sources. Thus, I have removed Muir, who seems to be making partisan claims, and replaced her with Kaplan &amp; Small, who are the very scientists who conducted the survey. 200.117.181.207 01:48, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SlimVirgin, you may find it noteworthy that Muir's interpretation was originally plugged wholesale into the article, without a source or any reference to Diana Muir, as if it was a direct paraphrase of the K&amp;S study. You seem to be arguing as if it was placed there in good faith. I think, on the contrary, there is evidence which indicates that it was placed there as a distortion or partisan plug. I do have a personal bias because I was the one who pegged Muir in the first place.</dd>

<p>Here's what Kaplan and Small say:</p>
<p>ABSTRACT</p>
<p>[B]ased on a survey of 500 citizens in each of 10 European countries (for a total sample of 5,000), we ask whether those with extreme anti-Israel views are more likely to be anti-Semitic. Even after controlling for numerous potentially confounding factors, we find that anti-Israel sentiment consistently predicts the probability that an individual is anti-Semitic, with the likelihood of measured anti-Semitism increasing with the extent of anti-Israel sentiment observed.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that fewer than one-quarter of those with anti-Israel index scores of only 1 or 2 harbor anti-Semitic views (as defined by anti-Semitic index scores exceeding 5), which supports the contention that one certainly can be critical of Israeli policies without being anti-Semitic. However, among those with the most extreme anti-Israel sentiments in our survey (anti-Israel index scores of 4), 56% report anti-Semitic leanings. Based on this analysis, when an individual’s criticism of Israel becomes sufficiently severe, it does become reasonable to ask whether such criticism is a mask for underlying anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>These paragraphs very clearly and concisely express the authors' thought. They provide nuanced statements, indicating that the "prediction" that an anti-Zionist will be an anti-semite holds true only for the most extreme detractors of Israel, and then by no means in all cases. I suggest that they be quoted textually.</p>
<p>It's better to let the authors speak for themselves, instead of being subjectively interpreted by a journalist with an axe to grind.200.117.181.207 03:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Electronic Intifada as a reliable source</span></h2>
<p>I have added a paragraph indicating that Dr. King's quote's authenticity has been disputed, citing an article from Electronic Intifada: <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/10/2356" class="external autonumber" title="http://electronicintifada.net/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/10/2356" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> "Israel's apologists and the Martin Luther King Jr. hoax", by Fadi Kiblawi &amp; Will Youmans. The article casts doubt on the assertion that Martin Luther King ever spoke at Harvard in 1968, as alleged by the present Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>The article quotes "The Harvard Crimson" as claiming: "The Rev. Martin Luther King was last in Cambridge almost exactly a year ago--April 23, 1967" ("While You Were Away" 4/8/68).</p>
<p>Some other Wikipedians have questioned EI as a reliable source. Since I'm not based on EI's POV, but on the facts they cite, I would like to ask:</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that the Crimson quote in Electronic Intifada is wrong, or a forgery?</p>
<p>I don't believe so, because EI is closely monitored by CAMERA, for instance, and such a big factual error would have been exposed.</p>
<p>If the Crimson quote is correct, then there's reason to doubt that King spoke at Harvard in 1968, independently of EI's POV.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 05:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, there has been a consensus on both of those issues. Electronic Intifada does not satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>. It is essentially a conspiracy theory (inasmuch as the MLK statement is well known, and well-cited, and freuently cited in his name by politicians and civil rights leaders). It therefore must satisfy a higher standard (while it does not even meet the lower standard). It is a partisan jihadist site, from the look of it. And this has been agreed upon by consensus. By contrast, a consensus has determined that there are ample sources for the King quote. Your continued edits are in defiance of that consensus, and constitute a violation of the 3RR policy. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 17:59, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see a clear consensus having been arrived at in the section "Dr. King never said it" and other sections dealing with King's quote. The user jpgordon, for instance, does not agree with your view, and neither does the user bsnowball. In fact, someone suggested what I think is a very good idea, i.e. writing Congressman Lewis and asking if he actually heard Dr. King saying the phrase or is quoting someone else's quoting of King.</dd>
<dd>Also, <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> recommends "A source which is explicit about the data from which it derives its conclusions is more reliable than one which does not. Ideally, a source should describe the collection process and analysis method." In the case of the King quote, this criterion is not met, since neither Lipset not Congressman Lewis are explicit about where they learned of King's answer to the black student. So, while both are highly regarded as writers or politicians, in this particular case they have failed to meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>: the collection process is not described.</dd>
<dd>The fact that "the MLK statement is well known, and well-cited, and freuently cited in his name by politicians and civil rights leaders" is not in itself conclusive, because all of that holds true also for the fake <i>Letter to an anti-Zionist friend</i>, which has been cited by respected politicians like Nathan Sharansky.</dd>
<dd>As for my continued edits, today I edited a different part of the section, and did not touch the King quote. That last edit consisted basically of adding sourced information (from Kaplan and Small's paper) without removing anything. I don't understand why it was reverted. Read both versions and be assured that the revert was unfair. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 19:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article casting doubt on the King quote is a reliable source. It fully satisfies the <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> requirement for a source to be explicit about the data from which it derives its conclusions.</dd>
<dd>In effect, the source explicitly mentions the Harvard <i>Crimson</i> article claiming that Dr. King last visited Cambridge in 1967, not in 1968 which is the alleged date of MLK's speech.</dd>
<dd>Some Wikipedians have claimed that the source is extremist or even jihadist, but have failed to back that claim with solid evidence. Moreover, the site's ideology is irrelevant because the doubts raised are based on a <i>fact</i> (Dr. King's never having set foot on Cambridge in 1968) that is corroborated by another, nonpartisan publication.</dd>
<dd>Both articles used as sources for the King quote, on the other hand, are not equally reliable. They are not explicit about their data in that they don't tell us where they learned about MLK having made his alleged statement. The non-reliability is compounded by the fact that the claim is so vague that it is unverifiable: no date or exact place for MLK's lecture is provided.</dd>
<dd>While I'm not inclined to remove altogether all refererences to MLK's quote, I'm not inclined either to fail to mention the important fact that its authenticity has been called into question. Therefore, I will do so in the near future, if no reasonable objection is raised. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 20:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>on the subject of wpv, <i>the quote from muir just happens to be concocted</i>. she does falsely claim, "The correlation was almost perfect", but our blockquote is an accidental (i assume;) mish-mash of paraphrases so it really can go. the k &amp; s paper also isn't "reviewed by Diana Muir" she just happens to distort its findings in a question begging rant to the effect that criticism of zionism/israel is anti-semitism.</li>
<li>aside from this, there is an obvious problem with including any quote from muir which misrepresents the results of a study (k &amp; s) <i>which we can quote directly anyway</i>. she doesn't offer any analysis, just misrepresentation. this isn't a matter of wp:v/rs, it's basic reasoning: look up the meaning of 'correlation'.</li>
<li>the sock thing: in saying "You yourself quote" sv claims i am (at least one of) the annons/single purpose editors who were involved in this earlier. especially now that you are involved, i think it wise to stress that this is not true, i have signed all my edits to this page thus:&#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 08:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In response to SlimVirgin, and in defense of Bsnowball, I must say it was me, not him, who quoted Kaplan &amp; Small. Academic papers come with an abstract and conclusions, and in both sections the authors customarily summarize their findings. As Bsnowball says, since we do have full access to K&amp;S's article, it's hard to see the need to quote another author who is a historian, not a statistician, and who does distort the paper's findings. Here are a few problems with Muir's review:
<ul>
<li>She speaks of anti-Zionism, but this concept is not mentioned at all by Kaplan and Small. All they talk about is anti-Israel sentiment, which is not the same as anti-Zionism (one may dislike the present Jewish state but not the idea of a country for the Jews...).</li>
<li>She claims that they find an almost perfect correlation between anti-Zionism and frank anti-semitism. Again, those words are not used by the Yale scholars; instead, they claim that extreme anti-Israel sentiment predicts the <i>probability</i> (not the certainty) that someone will also be anti-semitic. This probability is of 56% -- hardly the "almost perfect correlation" one would be entitled to talk about if the probability was 97% or such. Common sense, please!</li>
<li>Muir fails to mention that that probability of someone being anti-semitic applies only to the most <i>extreme</i> detractors of Israel, while moderate critics of the country are not anti-semitic by a more convincing majority of more than 75%.</li>
<li>She dramatically --and disingenuously-- quotes the most loaded questions in Kaplan and Small's "anti-Israel" and "anti-semitic" questionnaires, and claims that a correlation exists between those two subsets of questions, which is not backed by the original.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>With all these problems with Muir's analysis, it looks like quoting the original paper's abstract and conclusions is more than enough to make the point we're trying to make.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 00:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Despite your claims, my objections to Muir have not been discussed. They have been <i>ignored</i>, which is quite another thing. Nobody has answered my claim that she speaks of an "almost perfect correlation" when K&amp;S never use such words and when the probability that an extreme anti-Israeli is also anti-semitic is of barely 56%. These are claims pertaining to the realm of statistics, a field she isn't an expert in, behing a historian by training (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> requires expertise). Also, nobody has explained why we need this redundant summary of the Yale scholars' article when we have the scholars' own summary at our disposal, <i>especially</i> when the former contradicts the latter and uses terms not employed in the paper itself, such as "anti-Zionist" instead of "anti-Israeli." This loose use of terminology may have to do with the fact that she isn't an expert in anti-Zionism, anti-Israelism or anti-Semitism either, which further complicates her prospects of being used as a reliable source.</dd>

<dd>the point is that <i>muir misrepresents a source which we have available to quote from anyway</i>. all you have to do to see this is read both sources. this not a matter of dis/agreeing with her (although that seems to be the main criteria as far as you're concerned), it is a simple verifiable matter of fact that muir lies about the k &amp; s paper. the details are explained by abenyosef above, it's not that complicated. also muir's innane opinions about media bias are irrelevant without anything to back them up.&#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 13:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've already answered that. Quoting myself: "[Muir] speaks of an "almost perfect correlation" when K&amp;S never use such words and when the probability that an extreme anti-Israeli is also anti-semitic is of barely 56%. <i>These are claims pertaining to the realm of statistics, a field she isn't an expert in, being a historian by training (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> requires expertise)</i>."</dd>
<dd>Muir makes statistical claims not being a statistician. Now, according to <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>, one of the criteria to be used in evaluating a non-scholarly source is "Expertise of the originator about the subject." The guideline goes on to exemplify: "An academic expert in one subject is more reliable when writing about that subject than when writing about another. For example, a biologist is more reliable when writing about biology than when writing about nuclear physics."</dd>
<dd>By the same measure, an historian may be reliable when writing about history, but not necessarily so when writing about statistics. Also, she may not necessarily be reliable when writing about sociological issues, which is exemplified by her confusion of the terms "anti-Israel" and "anti-Zionist" (the latter never being mentioned in K&amp;S's paper).</dd>
<dd>The <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> requirement Muir does not meet is, thus, "Expertise of the originator about the subject." She's an expert historian, but her article isn't about history.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 18:53, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> requires that secondary sources be scholarly, or failing that, satisfy a series of other standards (that test reliability). Here, we don't need to get into the second string because the source is scholarly. Muir is a scholar who wrote (and signed) a scholarly article describing the K&amp;S study. Moreover, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, prefers secondary sources over primary sources as a means of interpreting primary source data (because any extrapolation on the part of editors themselves is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> by definition).

<dd>Meshulam, be assured that I won't revert 'so long as you continue to answer my points'. Your characterization of Muir as a reliable source was based on a false premise, i.e. that her article was scholarly. Now that I have proved this to be wrong beyond all doubt, it is clear that she's a non-scholarly source -- and here the expertise requirement becomes important. She's not an expert in mathematics or statistics and therefore she can't make judgments about the degree of correlation between two sets of data. This is the argument you must respond to.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 21:48, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Jayig. Furthermore, the consensus does not require you or Snowball to agree. It requires a majority vote. Since we obviously aren't going to convince each other, let it suffice that a consensus has previously been reached, and further discussion is redundant. You essentially threatened to revert if I do not answer your "points" (which are restatements of your previous arguments). I'm not interested in your threats, and I'm not interested in this discussion.

<dd>And I've answered that Muir's status as a scholar is completely irrelevant when she publishes in a non-scholarly journal. Muir's review is no more scholarly than her personal diary, her letters to her children, or the notes to her husband she sticks on the fridge door, which are also "materials written by a scholar."</dd>

<dd>Of course, ideally the sources for a Wikipedia article should be as variegated as possible; but they must be reliable in the first place. Now Muir's article is <i>notoriously</i> inaccurate and <i>notoriously</i> biased, and I'm beginning to suspect that you're more interested in the bias than in any enlargement of information. She claims that K&amp;S's research is about anti-Zionism, when in fact it's about anti-Israel attitudes, and she doesn't prove that both concepts are equivalent. She makes judgments about the correlation between two sets of data, but doesn't have the expertise needed to evaluate it. She makes general claims about the bias of European journalists, without providing the faintest hint of evidence and without being an expert media analyst.</dd>

The prohibition to use <a href="../../../o/r/_/OR_1d00.html" title="OR">OR</a> applies only to materials added to the Wikipedia article itself, but <i>nothing</i> in Wikipedia policy forbids you to use <a href="../../../o/r/_/OR_1d00.html" title="OR">OR</a> to decide if a source is reliable or not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RfC: Debate about Muir</span></h2>
<p>Question as to whether or not Muir contradicts Kaplan &amp; Small in claiming a correlation between 'criticism of Israel' and 'anti-semitism'. It has been claimed above that <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> rules out reasoning about which source is 'better', or more worth quoting. These statements are representative of the 2 articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Kaplan and Small ask whether individuals expressing strong anti-Israel sentiments... are more likely than the general population to also support in [sic] such old-style anti-Semitic slurs... The correlation was almost perfect." <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/28503.html" class="external text" title="http://hnn.us/articles/28503.html" rel="nofollow">Muir</a></li>
<li>"It is noteworthy that fewer than one-quarter of those with anti-Israel index scores of only 1 or 2 harbor anti-Semitic views (as defined by anti-Semitic index scores exceeding 5), which supports the contention that one certainly can be critical of Israeli policies without being anti-Semitic." <a href="http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/2005-06/kaplan.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/2005-06/kaplan.pdf" rel="nofollow">K &amp; S</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Can we quote from Muir, as these appear to be contradictory? Abenyosef has gone into more detail on the contradictions above. It goes without saying that anyone dis/agreeing with this should check the context of both statements. (PS Have we gotten permission to cite the paper, as requested on the 1st page of K &amp; S?) 07:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball">bsnowball</a> (<a href="../../../b/s/n/User_talk%7EBsnowball_cbb1.html" title="User talk:Bsnowball">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bsnowball_c4ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/bsnowball">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>While the current wording of the Muir quote is an improvement, because it states that the "almost perfect correlation" is Muir's conclusion, not any quoting of the Yale scholars', the quote still should go, precisely because Muir doesn't have the expertise needed to draw that conclusion. She's a historian, not a statistician.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I'm coming to the conclusion that the reference to the Kaplan and Small survey should be removed altogether from this article. The reason Kaplan and Small were included in the first place is that Muir misled us into thinking that their survey was about anti-Zionism. It is not. It's about anti-Israel attitudes. The four questions they ask are about attitudes toward Israeli and Palestinian behavior, not about Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. K&amp;S don't claim to be surveying anti-Zionism and we don't have any evidence that their findings are related to the interviewee's anti-Zionism. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 14:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed from the lead that anti-Zionism may apply to "movements within or outside of Israel to amend specific policies." Can anyone source or explain this? I can't imagine anyone who supports the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, but who merely oppose a few Israeli government policies, having the term "anti-Zionist" correctly applied to them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Harvard Crimson and MLK's quote</span></h2>
<p>The following information is important with regard to MLK's quote equating anti-Zionism to antisemitism, which allegedly comes from a response to a black student at a Harvard lecture in 1968.</p>
<p>King died on April 4, 1968. Four months later, on August 4, 1968, the Harvard <i>Crimson</i> (the university's newspaper) ran a story under the title "While you were away," which is available at the publication's web site <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=157725" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=157725" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. According to the story, "The Rev. Martin Luther King was last in Cambridge [where Harvard is located] almost exactly a year ago--April 23, 1967."</p>
<p>Based on that story, Kiblawi and Youmans <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/10/2356" class="external autonumber" title="http://electronicintifada.net/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/10/2356" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> conclude that "If this is true, Dr. King could not have been in Cambridge in 1968," and, therefore, there are "reasons for casting doubt on the authenticity of this [King's] statement."</p>
<p>Since Kiblawi and Youmans use flawless logic based on data that comes from a verifiable source, they appear to be themselves a highly reliable source.</p>
<p>For that reason, I'm inclined to add a small paragraph after the article's reference to King's quote indicating that doubt has been cast on its authenticity. Which I will do, if no reasonable objection is presented. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 21:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Furthermore, this is a new discussion, since I'm providing new information, namely the Harvard <i>Crimson's</i> web site in which you can find the article that confirms that MLK couldn't possibly have admonished a student at Harvard in 1968.

<dd>In March 1968, the Harvard College Class of 1968 <b>invited</b> Rev. King to speak <b>at Class Day</b> to ensure that the Vietnam War, civil rights, and urban affairs were addressed directly during Commencement week ceremonies. According to the Harvard Crimson, this was the first time a Harvard senior class independently invited its own speaker for Class Day exercises. It is interesting to note that members of the Class of 1968 were freshmen when King delivered his 1965 Memorial Church sermon and led the marches in Selma.</dd>

<dd>He was <b>invited</b> to talk <b>at Class Day</b> in March 1968. But Class Day is held in early June, so that King didn't deliver the speech, because he was murdered in April. His wife Coretta spoke in his place. According to Harvard: "King accepted the invitation before he was assassinated in April. His wife spoke in his place." <a href="http://www.commencement.harvard.edu/background/class_spk.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commencement.harvard.edu/background/class_spk.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for Kiblawi and Youmans, I've already addressed that. You don't need to be an astronomer to claim that the sun is round. And if you have established that King visited Cambridge for the last time in 1967, you don't need to be a historian to conclude that he can't have been there in 1968. Of course, you've got to have evidence that he last visited in 1967 -- and Kiblawi and Youmans provide it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To put it another way, expertise is needed to make expert claims. But the claim that a person who last visited a city in 1967 can't have been there in 1968 is not an expert claim; it's a commonsense conclusion that can be drawn by anyone, you, me, or Kiblawi and Youmans.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dd>Kiblawi and Youmans' status as a reliable source is evident not in their making such an easy deduction, but in their giving a credible source for their claim about MLK's last visit to Cambridge, and in their quoting it accurately. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 02:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Around and around and around....</dd>
<dd><b>Original research</b>: You have used original research to justify erasing or altering statements in the article (that are quoted from acceptalbe sources). That is unacceptable under [[WP:OR]. Since it looks as though you have abandoned your attempt to remove properly sourced material from this article, I will leave this issue for now.</dd>
<dd><b>Proper Sourcing</b>: It has already been demonstrated above that electronicintifada.com is not an acceptable source. Furthermore, the article you are quoting is attributed to two characters who are about as far from reliable sources as is possible. Therefore, you are left to argue that, despite their lack of Reliable Source status, their article should be quoted because it makes sense. That is original research. At the risk of repeating myself, I will make this simpler for you: You seem to think that <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> is about the claims made in the artice. Not so. <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> is about the reliability of the source that makes the claim. <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> does claim that the sources of outrageous claims are held to a higher standard of reliability. In this case, the electronicintifada article does not meet the minimum requirements. But since the authors want to make a claim that cuts against conventional wisdom, they must satisfy the higher requirements (which they don't, given that they don't even satisfy the minimum requirements). Your assurances that the article you wish to quote is more reasonable than some other articles on electronicintifada, which according to you contain errors and lies, are irrelevant because you are also not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">reliable source</a>. Those claims are <a href="../../../o/r/_/Wp%7Eor.html" title="Wp:or">original research</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>I think its time to quit, bud</b>: It was friendly advice. Your arguments are weak, and have consistently been rejected. You seem to think that's evidence of our inability to understand how insightful your comments are. I disagree. But it certainly is clear that the 13th 14th and 15th repetition of the same arguments will not yield any more favorable results than the previous 12 repetitions.

Lipset stated he was in the area for a "fund-raising mission," which would seem to imply a high profile visit. Also, an intensive inventory of publications by <b>Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project</b> accounts for numerous speeches in 1968. None of them are for talks in Cambridge or Boston.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Jayjg. We're supposed to believe that the materials that these jokers (K&amp;Y) "unearthed" are accurate, despite the fact that their proponent,[User:Abenyosef|Abenyosef]], admits that the website from which these materials come is full of material that is "highly partisan" and "full of factual errors" (read: lies and propaganda). <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> assumes that the materials are quoted accurately, and constitute the whole truth of the matter, despite the fact that many reliable sources (both in the Wikipedia sense, and in the real-life sense) dispute these materials. Further, <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> wants the analysis proffered by K&amp;Y (a law student, and an entertainer, respectively) to be inserted into the article.</dd>
<dd>There isn't a shred of reliability (both according to Wikipedia policy, and in reality) to the source. And the information being asserted is contrary to all conventional wisdom. Finally,<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> has created a username seemingly for the sole purpose of advancing this material, and other anti-Zionist propaganda, on this article (and apparently no other article). He keeps on referring to the presumpton of good faith, but that presumption is rebuttable. At this point, a consensus has spoken loud and clear, and yet he persists. I believe, at this point, that he has lost the presumption of good faith. At this point, he is merely troll pushing an ideology through the usual misinformation, propaganda, and outright lies.</dd>
<dd>Since it is clear that nothing new will be unearthed in this converstion (and I use that term loosely), I think we have reached its end. The K&amp;Y material stay out, as per the consensus. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 19:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Harvard Crimson and MLK (Part 2)</span></h2>
<p>The arguments presented so far are not completely relevant. Defendent is accurate in stating that MLK could not have been at Harvard "shortly" before his death, unless we interpret shortly to mean "a year ago". Arguments are accurate in that respect. The prohibitions in OR do *not* apply to off-wiki sources. Any web page, or authority off-wiki may do OR without prohibition and we may cite to them without prohibition *from that rule*. OR only applies to wikipedians not doing their own OR. It does not apply to someone else off-wiki doing it and us citing them doing it.</p>
<p>That being said, perhaps we can drop this OR herring and focus on the key issue in this case. That, to my mind, only relies on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, which is to say, is the source reliable and is the argument previously published by a third-party? Or does it meet one of the V exceptions to that general policy? <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point is perhaps moot. The google book I've now cited, references the original Lipset quote exactly which is to a 1968 dinner, not a Harvard appearence at all. It does in addition reference that the quote has been changed and misused over time. This possibly led to the erroneous re-citing at SFGate and this can of worms. I would encourage that editor who evidently cited the original Encounter, to next time actually read it instead of lifting the cite from another (uncited here) work. That would help avoid this sort of thing in the future. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:50, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Another position is that criticism of Israel or Zionism is not in itself antisemitic, but that anti-Zionism can be used to hide antisemitism. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Martin_Luther_King_Jr._96e9.html" title="Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, in response to a question from the audience after a lecture at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> shortly before his death in 1968, is reported to have said:

<p>Please let me know if you have any justified objection to this edit. Keep in mind that, since I'm not a particularly gifted guy, it would be desirable that you explain to me why you're objecting.

<dl>
<dd>The likely objection will be that it's original research, since it's you who has personally found the contradiction, as opposed to some reliable source reporting on it. That said, I do think there's a problem here, which is simply the question of why Martin Luther King is being placed as the primary exponent of the argument that anti-Zionism is a cover for antisemitism. Martin Luther King is a world-famous American civil rights leader and moral authority, but I wouldn't think the primary source for a very widely-discussed theory on contemporary anti-Zionism. I'd say the lack of authentication for the quote is another reason to give it less prominence or remove it, but based on the sources we have, it will probably be hard to get a discussion of the authenticity itself. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 19:12, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>i would want to take that further &amp; claim that under the alleged circumstances (avoiding a question about israel by accusing the questioner of racism) the quote is more/less irrelevent, except as an example of that tactic for avoiding criticism of israel (&amp; if that is needed, we can find more appropriate examples of that) BUT regardless: if we can establish from other sources, such as a biography of king, what his itinerary was, we should be able to settle this without going into it further. can we do this &amp; be finished with it?&#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 19:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mackan79, what you're saying is exactly what Kiblawi and Youmans say in their article: what authority did King have, after all, to talk about these issues he was no expert in?

<dd>Well, my intuition is still that the contradiction is a valid reason for not including the quote at all, but that actually discussing a contradiction between the statement and the Harvard Crimson would be toward the OR end of the spectrum. The problem is, you're using a Harvard Crimson article which wasn't even talking about this quote to establish that King couldn't have said it. That may be correct, but I think it is a case where being correct wouldn't necessarily cut it. My suggestion would remain that you'd probably have better luck removing the quote than expanding discussion on it, for whatever that's worth. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 20:32, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The guys at the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_2c3e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research">Wikipedia talk:No original research</a> page have been providing valuable insights. To the relief of everyone involved (first and foremost myself), they've stated a solid reason why I should'nt point to the conflicting sources: the sources do not unequivocally conflict. In fact, the article says "shortly before his death in 1968", not "in 1968, shortly before his death;" i.e., 1968 is given as the year of King's death, not of his alleged speech. Therefore, it's up to the reader to decide what "shortly" means, and to some readers it may mean 1 year before. On that consideration, I will not make the edit.</p>
<p>For the record, here's the analysis from the contributors to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_2c3e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research">Wikipedia talk:No original research</a>:</p>
<p>Doesn't look like original research to me. You are faithfully reporting what the underlying sources say, and pointing out the apparent contradiction in what you report to the reader. NOR is a policy intended to stop you drawing new, novel conclusions from the sources, and is not intended to prevent you from making straightforward, unoriginal observations in line with the source material. Enchanter 23:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Am I missing something or does the source not actually conflict? It states that MLK said this shortly before his death in 1968. He didn't say it in 1968, his death was in 1968. He said it "shortly before his death" so 1967 might qualify as "shortly". Wjhonson 00:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>IMO this does smack of NOR or POV. Because the dates are not really in conflict, 'shortly' is not a well defined time period, as Wjhonson notes. This is certainly not a good example for clearly conflicting sources. And someone reading this can easily form an impression that WP is trying to convey to the reader that maybe MLK didn't actually make that statement. Crum375 00:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I gather from the above that no unified interpretation of NOR policies prevails. But fortunately there are other, less debatable reasons to avoid making my edit.--<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 14:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it does.

<dd>I just want to point out that I support your desire to make this shorter, but *if* the statement that he made this remark to a student in the audience of a Harvard lecture stands, then the conflicting statement that he made it at a dinner in 1968 also needs to stand. These sources do not agree. However I'd support just saying "he made it" without specifying how, when, where, etc as well.

It's certainly not worth all this tsuris. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 19:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It seems you don't get it straight, Meshulam -- but then you never get things straight. Kiblawi and Youmans have been used as sources in the <i>standard</i> literature -- a UCLA professor published by Harvard. That's as powerful an endorsement as a source can have. Please don't make a further fool of yourself.</dd>
<dd>Also, we're now citing <i>Sundquist's</i> words (not K&amp;S's) that the accuracy of the King quote "has been questioned, and it became the source of a serious hoax." Which is much more than I had gambled for in the first place. Thanks to your stubborness, we've discovered a source that actually says something much stronger about the King quote's credibility than Electronic Intifada.</dd>

<dd>Interestingly, many of you are now agreeing with Kiblawi and Youmans' main thesis -- the King quote doesn't mean a thing anyway, because he wasn't well acquainted with the subject. These two rabid jihadists seem to have put a couple of interesting ideas together after all.

<dd>Segringle, we now have a reliable source (Sundquist) that explicitly states that the quote has been questioned. If we do retain King's quote, we should also retain this reservation. (Perhaps you removed it by accident.)</dd>
<dd>That said, I believe that a new consensus has been developing that King's quote should be removed. The original source was an extremist magazine that had been CIA-funded. The second source, Lewis, says more or less the same words and it is probable it is simply a restating of the first -- and <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a> does caution us that we should check whether different sources are actually separate.

<dd>Actually there are two kinds of sources. Scholarly sources are always reliable. Non-scholarly sources must be checked on a case-by-case basis. The New York <i>Times</i> may not be reliable about WMD in Iraq, but it may be reliable about accidents reported in Staten Island. In this case we have four different non-scholarly sources -- Lipset, Lewis, Kiblawi and Youmans, and, ultimately, Sundquist. The first three can be safely considered to be partisan, although only Kiblawi and Youmans have been described by some here as unreliable; if that's not double standards, what is. Sundquist's reliability has not been objected to.</dd>
<dd>I agree with Humus that King's quote is famous. What it is not is relevant. An encyclopedia should not endorse the popular view that if someone famous says something it immediately becomes true, or even relevant. King's quote is completely irrelevant because he was no Zionism scholar, he was just an enthusiastic supporter of Israel. All of us know of Jews who are proud of their Jewish ancestry, yet fiercely anti-Zionistic (I personally know one who is very close to me, as close as anyone can be). King's quote is simply the opinion of someone who is not well-acquainted with the issues involved.</dd>
<dd>That said, it is probable that the irrelevant King quote will be reinserted over and over again if we remove it, as Humus says. I think we'll have to settle on retaining both King's quote and Sundquist's claim that its accuracy has been questioned.

Also, the sequence [16][17][18] after King's quote would give the impression that [18] belongs in the same category as [16] and [17] (i.e., is further proof for the King quote), when in fact its actual function is to show that the quote has been challenged -- and we don't want to mislead the readers, do we? However, I agree that the name Sundquist is already in the reference and it's not necessary to cite it in the main body, and the reference to the hoax can be made in the footnote too.</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid your latest edits are not making much sense. We use footnotes to give details about sources and to provide accessory information that does not fundamentally change the picture. However, the information that a quote has been questioned is on the same level of hierarchy as the quote itself. If you think it's relevant to cite a famous civil rights leader saying that anti-Zionism is antisemitism, why on earth do you claim it's not relevant to let the reader know that the quote may not be accurate? Citing the King quote in the article and its having been questioned in the footnotes is clearly prioritizing one over the other. That's a clear violation of NPOV.</dd>

<dd>As for "however," let's see what we have here: a) certain people say King made a statement; b) certain other people question the accuracy of the quotation; c) there's a contradiction between the two. <i>All three elements are present in Sundquist's book</i>. He points to the contradiction when he says: "<b>Although</b> the accuracy of the quotation has been questioned and it became the source of a serious hoax, King is said by Seymour Martin Lipset to have replied to a black student who criticized Zionists at a 1968 dinner: 'Don't talk like that! When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism.'" While I'm using the word "however" instead of "although", the semantic content is the same.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The accuracy of this quotation</span></h2>
<p>It doesn't seem useful to link the Sundquist book to this statement. Sundquist does not state that the accuracy of the quotation is in doubt. He cites the Encounter magazine article and that it was also re-printed shortly afterwards in a book. He doesn't say anything which would question the quote. What he does say, is that the quote was later used as part of a hoax, in that it, or a similar quote, appeared in a forged letter purportedly by King. So this wording needs to be re-formed to express what Sundquist is actually saying. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 20:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sundquist makes no judgment about the quote. He doesn't say it's true: witness his careful wording "King <b>is said</b> by Seymour Martin Lipset...". He doesn't say it's false, either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But he <i>does</i> say that the accuracy of the quote has been questioned. His words are unequivocal: "the accuracy of the quotation has been questioned and it became the source of a serious hoax." Not a hypothesis, not mere speculation: he's <i>asserting</i> that the quote was questioned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Understand me: I'm not saying that Sundquist himself questions the quote. I'm saying that Sunquist provides us the information that it's been questioned, and according to Wikipedia policy we can use that information, because he's a RS. Verifiability, not truth -- does that ring a bell?</dd>

<dd>You are completely taking his qoute out of context then. He says it has been questioned, but he doesn't say it is questionable. Plenty of things have been questioned.

However the main theory, that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-qaeda.html" title="Al-qaeda">al-qaeda</a> is responsable, is not questionable. Understand the difference? What we really need is the rest of the quote, a few more sentences before and after to determine Sundquist's real opinion on the issue.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 01:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remain unclear why a disputed comment by Martin Luther King to a student in 1968 get placed as the primary quote regarding anti-Zionism as a cover for antisemitism. There are many things wrong with this: 1. Martin Luther King is not a scholar on Anti-Zionism nor antisemitism, nor is he a prominent voice on the issue. 2. Quoting Martin Luther King in regard to anything, similar to quoting the Pope or Nelson Mandela or Mother Theresa, is a serious NPOV issue, due to their enormous moral authority. Placing it as a stand-alone statement without context is a large NPOV problem by itself. 3. The way we have it, it looks like King was making a categorical pronouncement on anti-Zionism. He wasn't; he was allegedly responding to a student's comment. Taking a statement like that and making it the primary pronouncement on a serious issue is problematic to say the least. 4. The documentation that he even said this is weak and disputed. 5. The alleged statement is from many decades ago, rendering it highly dubious as a stand-alone statement on the issue.</dd>

<dd>From what I've seen, the defense for this is that if we remove it somebody else will reinsert it. That strikes me as a pretty weak defense. Even so, we should at least give the statement some context. This would either be to note the dispute, or to place it further down in the section as a non-central fact in a larger discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 18:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jayjg, I've already compromised and renounced a reliable source that has been used in the standard literature <i>because you didn't like it</i>. Four people here, including the user above and myself, have expressed the opinion that the King quote should be deleted, so that there's no real consensus for retaining it, <i>and I'm prepared to renounce that too</i>.</dd>

<dd>I want to downplay Sundquist's statement that the "accuracy has been questioned" here in this argument. That kind of weasley language sounds like "I heard it somewhere". Even though it's reported by Sundquist, it shouldn't be a major factor in this debate without a proper citation to who, when and how they questioned it. Maybe all they questioned was where it occurred or whether "the" was really "and". Who knows without a firm citation. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 19:04, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe the King quote belongs in this article. The reasons Mackan79 gave are more than enough. But if it is to be included, Sundland's claim that it has been disputed should also be included with equal prominence. NPOV policy mandates: "The only other important consideration is that sources of comparable reputability might contradict. In that case the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches of the same topic exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: divide space describing the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources." Since Sundland is more reputable than Encounter magazine, actually more space should be given to the former than the latter.--<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 19:47, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'd agree with Wjhonson that some context might be given, although that might appropriately go in a footnote. At the same time, I'd say the difference between "questionable" and "questioned" is simply that the former is an opinion, whereas the latter is a fact. In that regard, I think Abenyosef is right that we report facts here, and "questioned" qualifies. If we're going to provide the quote, then, I think it's important to note that the quote has been questioned, as indeed it has, and the fact that it has been questioned should not be relegated to a footnote. Of course, this raises the everpresent problem: How much discussion should we really give this quote? Ultimately that's why I don't think it should be here at all. If it is, though, then I think the sources indeed support that the quote is "questioned," in the factual sense, that people -- according to a reliable source -- have questioned it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 20:16, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed the King quote, and replaced it with a better quote from Laqueur. I've also taken out the Reinhardt and Einstein stuff; neither was talking about anti-Zionism and antisemitism, they were just a bit of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> stuffed into the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:55, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good! A much more nuanced and learned opinion replaces a disputed and oversimplifying statement. To any Jewish anti-Zionist the King quote is simply outrageous, especially in the naked form usually cited.</dd>
