<p>In <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> this need for underwater security was first shown by the achievements of <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogmen.html" title="Frogmen">frogmen</a> against armed forces facilities.</p>
<p>After the late 1950's, the massive spread of sport <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuba_diving.html" title="Scuba diving">scuba diving</a> has caused real or supposed needs at some places for underwater security of valuable underwater objects and underwater <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> sites and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shellfish.html" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a> fishing stocks.</p>
<p>On 12 October 2000 the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Cole_bombing_dedc.html" title="USS Cole bombing">USS Cole bombing</a>, though not carried out by <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogmen.html" title="Frogmen">frogmen</a>, showed that fast decision is often needed; port <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guard.html" title="Guard">guards</a> cannot always afford to wait and see what the intruder does, as a diver swimming at 1 <a href="../../../m/p/h/Mph.html" title="Mph">mph</a> would move 88 feet in a minute, or 110 feet (the length of a <a href="../../../u/s/c/USCG_Patrol_Boat_50e5.html" title="USCG Patrol Boat">USCG Patrol Boat</a>) in 1.25 minutes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-frogman_techniques.html" title="Edit section: Scenarios and considerations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scenarios and considerations</span></h2>
<p>For a while after <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a> sport diving was heard of little or not at all, and (at least in Britain) there were unconfirmed stories among sport divers that some naval security men tended to treat any unidentified submerged diver in a naval area as hostile and summarily settle the matter with a small depth charge from land or from a patrol boat as easier and quicker than sending naval divers down to investigate. But the popularity of sport diving has changed and complicated that. The presence of sport scuba diving complicates the considerations in underwater security; each of these would be more or less likely according to the area's military and political circumstances:-</p>
<ol>
<li>The divers may be ordinary sport divers or civilian work divers without harmful intent</li>
<li>The divers may be intending to illegally remove sea life or valuable objects from the sea bed.</li>
<li>The divers may be commando <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogmen.html" title="Frogmen">frogmen</a> on a <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spying</a> mission.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are various types of places of operation:-</p>
<dl>
<dd>A) Underwater.</dd>
<dd>B) On the surface of water.
<dl>
<dd>These two scenarios are discussed by <a href="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" rel="nofollow">nlsn</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>C) In small boats (e.g. <a href="../../../r/i/b/RIB_969d.html" title="RIB">RIB</a>'s) being used by unauthorized or suspect divers.</dd>
<dd>D) In larger boats being used by unauthorized or suspect divers.</dd>
<dd>E) Arresting suspect divers onshore, before or after they dive.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are these likely theaters of operation:-</p>
<dl>
<dd>a) In an enclosed security area, e.g. a harbor.</dd>
<dd>b) In open water to protect submerged valuables (usually undersea <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeological.html" title="Archaeological">archaeological</a> sites).</dd>
<dd>c) In open water (often on a <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontier.html" title="Frontier">frontier</a>) to prevent underwater <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuggling.html" title="Smuggling">smuggling</a>.</dd>
<dd>d) In open water to protect sea life. (This, on a small scale, may be defined to include various known unofficial actions by inshore <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishermen.html" title="Fishermen">fishermen</a> to protect their shellfish stocks.)</dd>
<dd>e) To prevent unofficial divers from getting the way of other water or shore users.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In most scenarios nowadays #1 or perhaps #2 is likelier, but in war or semi-war conditions or where there is a risk of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> #3 may be likelier than usual.</p>
<p>A police-type technique that is reasonably safe on land may be risky to a scuba diver.</p>
<p>The document <a href="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" rel="nofollow">nlsn</a> leans strongly towards #1, and discusses only non-lethal weapons. But in war and semi-war situations there is more risk of #3 and the choice may be for lethal weapons.</p>
<p>Stunning may be a fairly safe means of arrest on land, but underwater would likely make the diver lose his <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouthpiece.html" title="Mouthpiece">mouthpiece</a> and drown (unless he has a <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fullface_mask.html" title="Fullface mask">fullface mask</a> or some sorts of strapped-in mouthpiece), or lose control of depth with consequent <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barotrauma.html" title="Barotrauma">barotrauma</a>.</p>
<p>According to circumstances, the patrol may need some means of transporting prisoners and/or seized diving equipment away from site.</p>
<p>Many casual sport diving intruders may keep away on seeing visible clearly-marked patrol boats and surface barriers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-frogman_techniques.html" title="Edit section: Sport divers and underwater security">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sport divers and underwater security</span></h2>
<p>Keeping underwater security against frogman intrusion has been complicated by the expansion of <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuba_diving.html" title="Scuba diving">sport diving</a> since the mid 1950's, making it bad policy for most democracies to use potentially lethal methods against any suspicious underwater sighting or sonar echo in areas not officially closed to sport divers. Any routine patrol investigation of all "unidentified frogman" reports would have had to stop because any genuine reports of intruders would be swamped in ever more reports of civilian sport divers who were not in military areas.</p>
<p>For a long time it would be easy for diving professionals and other experienced divers to distinguish a sport diver with an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-circuit.html" title="Open-circuit">open-circuit</a> scuba such as an <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aqualung.html" title="Aqualung">aqualung</a> from a combat frogman with a <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebreather.html" title="Rebreather">rebreather</a>; and legitimate civilian divers are normally fairly easy to detect because they dive from land or from a surface boat, rarely or never from an underwater craft, and willingly advertise their presence for their own safety.</p>
<p>However, particularly in former years when scuba diving was less common, many non-divers, including many police and others, knew little about diving and did not know of this difference in diving gear, but described all divers as "frogmen"; one result was an incident in the inter-ethnic crisis in <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> when a tourist was arrested for suspected spying because a "frogman's kit" was found in his car: it was actually ordinary sport scuba gear.</p>
<p>After about 1990 the rapid growth in the number of sport diving <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebreather.html" title="Rebreather">rebreather</a> brands has clouded this distinction, while advanced sport divers increasingly tackle longer deeper riskier dives using equipment once available only to armed forces or professionals. This means that even "less-lethal" techniques for trapping them underwater, disorienting them, or (especially) forcing them to the surface would be an ever-increasing risk to civilian divers' lives.</p>
<p>In former times, civilian diving was only for work, and needed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_diving_dress.html" title="Standard diving dress">Standard diving dress</a> and big easily-seen surface support craft. Sport <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuba_diving.html" title="Scuba diving">scuba diving</a> has changed that.</p>
<p>Some naval personnel object to civilian divers getting into waters being used for armed forces exercises, or consider any sport diving as intruding into naval and work divers' territory, and may be tempted to take their own action against the "intruders".</p>
<p>Another result of sport diving is a risk of civilians independently re-developing, and then using or selling on the free market, technologies, such as technical advances in underwater communications equipment, heretofore kept as military secrets. <i>(For a loss of military secrecy caused by independent civilian duplication (though not underwater), see <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exocet.html#The_Lokata" title="Exocet">Exocet#The Lokata</a>.)</i></p>
<p>There have been incidents which have demonstrated poor underwater security, when a sport diver with a noisy and bubbly <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuba_set.html#Open_circuit_scuba_sets" title="Scuba set">open-circuit scuba</a> and no combat training entered a naval anchorage and signed his name on the bottom of a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warship.html" title="Warship">warship</a>. Concern at the risk of increasing the sport-diving public's ability to penetrate harbors undetected, and of unofficial groups equipping combat frogmen from the sport scuba trade, might have led to the events listed below under <a href="#Prevention" title="">#Prevention</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charge</a> is effective, and may be lethal, but may cause other damage underwater, and is not recommended in peacetime when the victim may be an intruding civilian sport diver, although it is alleged to have been common practice for some years after 1945 in British naval harbors.</p>
<p>Divers, however, are far less vulnerable to damage by underwater explosion than commonsense would dictate. Since the tissues of the body tend to transmit the shock waves with much the same characteristics as the water around, large distant shocks have little impact on divers. For this reason, the most effective "depth charge" for use against a diver is the common hand-grenade, tossed within a few feet of the diver. The resulting gas cavitation and shock-front-differential over the width of the body is effective in stunning or killing the diver.</p>

After a particular threshold of loudness of the ultrasound, new bubbles form during the low-pressure part and disappear during the high-pressue part: this is <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavitation.html" title="Cavitation">cavitation</a> and can cause injury.</p>
<p>One well-known method is a powerful blast from a ship's ordinary high-power low-frequency <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html" title="Sonar">sonar</a> (commonly used for depth sounding and to detect large objects (including submarines)), which deranges the diver's <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_ear.html" title="Inner ear">inner ear</a> and makes him dizzy and disoriented and tends to force him to surface, or may make him panic and lose his mouthpiece and drown. These large "active sonars" are used to search for submarines and are very powerful. These sonars are usually bow mounted, and if so a diver attacking at the stern would be in the sonar baffle region and unaffected, if he gets close enough first.</p>

<p>Most ships, both military and non-military, carry smaller "navigation" sonars such as depth finders or collision sensors, but their high frequencies and relatively low power lack effectiveness against divers.</p>

<p>Some say that these speculations are mostly fanciful and that since the human body is very close to the impedance of the water around it, the ultrasound tends to pass through the body (perhaps breaking the eardrum, but not killing the diver); but if the sound or ultrasound is powerful it may cause overheating or cavitation damage on the way.</p>
<p>Some say that most deaths of people in the water from sonar have come from a freak combination of the diver's physical condition with local acoustic reflection of high-powered audible sonar that uncharacteristically "focused" the sound on the diver, or matched the resonant frequency of the diver's air cavities.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

The strands are electrified so that any frogman attack on the net will be detected by that strand going <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-circuit.html" title="Open-circuit">open-circuit</a> (not to electrocute him). The grid size best suited to deter divers is 250 x 250 mm = 10 x 10 inches. Testing in the UK showed that a diver using bolt cutters could cut a hole big enough to swim through in 60-90 seconds.</p>
<p>It was found that the net could be evaded by climbing over it, or getting under it, or by using a wire loop to complete the circuit where he cuts each strand.</p>
<p>The net system can be equipped with a gate (operated by an air compressor), to allow traffic in and out of the protected area.</p>
<p>SBS currently supports 15 sites with "Safe Barrier" nets, including four with gates, but they are not making this net system now, due to lack of demand. The price quote for a new net was more than $7,000,000.</p>

<p>It would seem that often a simple way of countering unknown frogmen or other divers would be for a police force or navy base personnel to send their own frogmen to investigate. Combat divers undergo weeks of fulltime underwater training, far more and harder then what most average civilian sport divers undergo; and they would be at full armed forces fitness even before the frogman training starts: see <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogman.html#Frogman_training" title="Frogman">Frogman#Frogman training</a>. Superior underwater combat training would likely decide which two groups of frogmen would win; generally, criminal or terrorist frogmen only have access to types of training which are available to civilians, or at least inadequate facilities.</p>
<p>However, underwater combat between opposing teams of frogmen (although common in fiction (as in the movie <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderball_%28film%29.html" title="Thunderball (film)">Thunderball</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_torpedo.html#Movies_and_fiction" title="Human torpedo">The Silent Enemy</a></i>, and at least one incident in <i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Hunt_1d45.html" title="Sea Hunt">Sea Hunt</a></i>, and often in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic.html" title="Comic">comics</a>) is unusual in reality.</p>
<p>Sometimes diving sea-police have arrested civilian divers for illegal <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spearfishing.html" title="Spearfishing">spearfishing</a> and diving in restricted areas and the like, and naval divers have been sent down to investigate unidentified divers in a naval harbour.</p>
<p>When confronted, sport divers are likelier to obey the patrol divers quietly as ordered; hostiles would be likelier to fight back.</p>
<p>Among the ways suggested of forcing arrested divers to surface would be attaching an inflatable float to each. <a href="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" rel="nofollow">nlsn</a>(page 11)</p>
<p>Objections to the likelihood of this tactic are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>It may result in an underwater knife fight, risky to both sides.</li>
<li>Risk of both sides drowning because of each attacking the other's breathing sets</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf" rel="nofollow">nlsn</a>(page 11).</p>
<dl>
<dd>This risk to the patrol divers depends on the design and resistance to damage of their equipment, e.g. <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevlar.html" title="Kevlar">kevlar</a>-reinforced <a href="../../../d/r/y/Drysuit.html" title="Drysuit">drysuit</a>, and see <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogman.html#Breathing_sets" title="Frogman">Frogman#Breathing sets</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It may be difficult for the patrol divers to find the suspects; but this depends on:-
<ul>
<li>Underwater visibility, which can be from a few inches (as sometimes in British sea) to 100 feet (as often in the tropics).</li>
<li>The suspects using <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-circuit.html" title="Open-circuit">open-circuit</a> scuba in conditions where the patrol divers can follow their exhaled bubbles.</li>
<li>Light level.</li>
<li>Having a <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html#Hand-held_sonar_for_use_by_a_diver" title="Sonar">hand-held sonar</a> of the type that has a screen, e.g. the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html#Hand-held_sonar_for_use_by_a_diver" title="Sonar">INSS</a>, or <a href="../../../n/u/v/NuvoSonic_b52d.html" title="NuvoSonic">NuvoSonic</a>'s diver-portable diver-detector sonar set.</li>
<li>A trained sea mammal leading the patrol divers to their target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the patrol divers are riding suitable <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diver_propulsion_vehicle.html" title="Diver propulsion vehicle">diver propulsion vehicles</a>, they could travel faster and carry better weapons (lethal or non-lethal) and equipment for sonar search and navigation and communication, and perhaps a means (e.g. grab or net) to capture suspect divers in passing and tow them alongside back to the base or patrol boat.</p>
<p>It was thought expensive for a team of patrol divers to be on standby all the time kitted up to dive; but <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> has <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> divers trained to arrest unauthorized or suspect divers underwater and to force them to surface. One common offence there is or was <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spearfishing.html" title="Spearfishing">spearfishing</a> while using breathing apparatus.</p>

<p>Some navies have thought underwater fights to be likely enough for them to design <a href="../../../u/n/d/Category%7EUnderwater_firearms_c190.html" title="Category:Underwater firearms">underwater pistols and rifles</a> for frogmen to use as a lethal weapon; there is said to have been a real incident when Russian frogmen shot two anti-frogman dolphins.</p>
<p>These underwater firearms all fire a pointed steel rod about 4 inches long, not a bullet, for better range underwater. The rifles are more powerful than the pistols (and look more impressive in frogmen's group photographs), but the pistols are more easily swung sideways quickly underwater at a target. They are all more powerful than a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speargun.html" title="Speargun">speargun</a>, and can fire several shots before reloading. Their barrels are not <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifling.html" title="Rifling">rifled</a>; the fired projectile is kept in line underwater by <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrodynamic.html" title="Hydrodynamic">hydrodynamic</a> effects, and is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water.</p>

<p>A reported anti-frogman guard is (or was) <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphin.html" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a> trained to carry on the nose a device which injects a large amount of compressed <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> into the frogman.

It is said that they were trained at <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_Mugu_2d1a.html" title="Point Mugu">Point Mugu</a>.

<li><a href="../../../s/i/e/Siebe_Gorman_9e7b.html" title="Siebe Gorman">Siebe Gorman</a> had a policy in Britain until around <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> of keeping prices of <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aqua-lung.html" title="Aqua-lung">aqualungs</a> too high for most civilians to afford; legal restrictions on exporting <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a> stopped people from importing cheaper foreign aqualungs. See <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_underwater_technology.html#Public_interest_in_scuba_diving_takes_off" title="Timeline of underwater technology">Timeline of underwater technology#Public interest in scuba diving takes off</a> for how this barrier broke down.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subskimmer.html" title="Subskimmer">Subskimmer</a>, which is useful for covert underwater penetration, took decades to develop and passed through at least three firms and is still too expensive for sport divers and sport diving centers. This may be due to interference from <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_%28government_department%29.html" title="Ministry (government department)">Ministries</a>. Or it could have been a commercial decision: the market for sports use was judged to be too small.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/e/Siebe_Gorman_9e7b.html" title="Siebe Gorman">Siebe Gorman</a> consistently refused to sell <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebreathers.html" title="Rebreathers">rebreathers</a> to the civilian public. Mixture <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebreather.html" title="Rebreather">rebreather</a> development was kept away from the public eye and the sport scuba trade until the end of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. As a result, when <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_Oil_5d47.html" title="North Sea Oil">North Sea Oil</a> exploration started in the 1960s, the oil drilling firms needing deep-dive work had to develop <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrox.html" title="Nitrox">nitrox</a> diving techniques independently, from concept up, without using the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Navy_3c76.html" title="British Navy">British Navy</a>'s know-how; and then the Navy revealed that they had used nitrox diving before 1945.</li>
<li>In the U.S., military <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebreather.html" title="Rebreather">rebreathers</a> were not marketed to the public primarily due to cost and attendant <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_liability.html" title="Legal liability">legal liability</a> issues. Legal issues still tend to discourage the development and sale of the rebreather in the U.S., though acceptance and use is growing. The U.S. military has not tried to stop sales of rebreathers to the public in the U.S., as it has realized that recreational SCUBA has now exceeded earlier military SCUBA in quality, and hopes that a similar increase in quality and decrease in price will come from commercial-off-the-shelf rebreather equipment.</li>
