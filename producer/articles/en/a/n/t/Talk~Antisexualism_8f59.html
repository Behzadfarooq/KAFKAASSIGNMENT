<p>- I'd assume the crux of their argument is opposition to sex on, ahem, what could be contrued as less than 'functional' or 'industrious' grounds. The thrwarting of literal 'reproduction', I'd envisage, isn't really the aim of their wrath so much as all that bewildering cultural layering upon the entity of 'sexuality' and 'sexual behaviour' with which we remain so familiar. Quite a poser to consider, tho'... <i>-- 21:05, 17 October 2006 81.109.36.8</i></p>
<p>I think they ether wish that people only had sex for getting children or that all children would be conceived by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_insemination.html" title="Artificial insemination">artificial insemination</a>. This is an impossible dream unless we can find out a way to get ride of human sex drive without making people sterile.</p>

<p>Such substances reduces sexual drive drastically. But they don't make it disapear entiarly unless the person allready have a low leveal of sex drive. The use of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiandrogens.html" title="Antiandrogens">antiandrogens</a> is called chemical <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castration.html" title="Castration">castration</a>. In other words it reduces fretrility as much as sexual drive, if it does not make the person entiarly sterile which might well be the case. We have a long way to go before we can take away sex drive without reproductional consequences.</p>

<p>Oops, I wrote as if <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiandrogens.html" title="Antiandrogens">antiandrogens</a> had the same effect on sexual drive in both sexes! Women produce much less <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgens.html" title="Androgens">androgens</a> than men. But I have no reason to believe that women on average have much less sexual drive. Consequently, antiandrogens don’t reduce women’s sexual drive to the same degree. Something <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transwomen.html" title="Transwomen">transwomen</a> are quite happy for.</p>

<p>this article is not npov, for instance polygamy is certainly not a "destructive" behavior as they claimed. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> 01:03, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not taking a position on the matter, but just summarizing the arguments used by the advocates. Though this is not particularly the place for a debate on polygamy, those who called it "destructive" might have been referring to the fact that in the real world polygamy all too often becomes a matter of old men marrying off their teenage daughters to each other (without too much respect for the wishes of the girls involved). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 04:00, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the article was not making clear that destructiveness is merely an opinion of those who oppose polygamy. plus you seem to be holding some kind of false misconception about polygamy, that is arranged marriage (and is even that really such a bad thing? others would disagree). polygamy and arranged marriages do NOT go automatically hand in hand. rather you are thinking of various random outlier sects and cults. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> 11:26, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well it's not an issue first of all, it's a view.

<p>I think a list with counter-arguments would be very suitable since at several of their opinions is contrary to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">nature</a>. Sure, there is much variation in human <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexuality.html" title="Sexuality">sexuality</a>, but most of this variation is shown by a minority of people. The sexual pattern of the majority have served <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanity.html" title="Humanity">humanity</a> well during our 200,000 years of existence. This includes hidden <a href="../../../o/v/u/Ovulation.html" title="Ovulation">ovulation</a> every three to five weeks, constant <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_drive.html" title="Sexual drive">sexual drive</a>, long term (not necessary lifelong) couples, and the joy of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensual.html" title="Consensual">consensual</a> <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_activities.html" title="Sexual activities">sexual activities</a>. All those traits are at least partly <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary.html" title="Hereditary">hereditary</a>. The idea that sex don’t have to be fun probably originated as way for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">clergy</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a> to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalise.html" title="Rationalise">rationalise</a> their own <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a>. Originally being the ultimate <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice.html" title="Sacrifice">sacrifice</a> celibacy had become the norm. Complete celibacy (not even <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>) will always be a drawback unless the person is <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asexual.html" title="Asexual">asexual</a>. I have made a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_experiment.html" title="Thought experiment">thought experiment</a> about how human sexuality would have been if our ancestors only had sex for getting children. It goes about like this:</p>
<p>“Women get <a href="../../../o/v/u/Ovulation.html" title="Ovulation">ovulation</a> once every four years. They are compleatly aware of it and even publicly announce it by emitting a especially sexy <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scent.html" title="Scent">scent</a>. A woman’s all male friends, neighbours and colleagues compete for having sex with her. The winner chose by the woman have sex with her only once. If they don’t use any <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a> she will almost always become <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnant.html" title="Pregnant">pregnant</a>. The father-to-be stays with her and helps to support her until she stops <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breastfeeding.html" title="Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a>. (In <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter-gatherers.html" title="Hunter-gatherers">hunter-gatherers</a> this coincide with the time when the child can keep the adult’s walking pace.) Soon after that she will get a new ovulation. The father of the first child have to compete with other men to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept.html" title="Concept">concept</a> her once more.” This is ONLY a idea of how it would have been IF our <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary.html" title="Evolutionary">evolutionary</a> history had been different.</p>
<p>Antisexualists point out that sex release <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug.html" title="Drug">drug</a>-like substances in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>. But he same substances are released by eating good food or getting praised. Yet nobody claims that food should be unappetising or that you should never praise anybody! In fact, this system <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolved.html" title="Evolved">evolved</a> to reward us with pleasure only when we do things that we profit from in evolutionary terms. Don’t accuse me for being <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a>!

<p>I don’t like when extreme ideas are presented without any counter-arguments. The followers might come with “factual” arguments which are simply wrong. One example is a Swedish <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> who claimed that there where one million Muslims in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> living on welfare. In reality Sweden have 250 thousand Muslim inhabitants and nobody knows how many live on welfare. Other examples of extreme ideas are <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> and religious fundamentalism.</p>
<p>2007-03-11 Lena Synnerholm, Märsta, Sweden.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of the Swedish Nazi, that person is just factually wrong. For antisexuals, the arguments section just has facts that cause them to have the opinions they do. What their arguing is why they want to be antisexuals, not that there is a specific number of antisexuals in the world or in a certain country. Remember, we have to follow <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and presenting reasons why <i>you</i> think antisexualism is wrong violates this rule. Antisexualism doesn't make any claims in itself, individuals who are antisexual are opposed to sexuality. If there are any specific arguments you want to put there, we can discuss them here first, but saying it's "extreme" is your own point of view and violates the NPOV rule. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 16:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have thoughtfully checked their arguments again. Here comes my criticism:</p>
<p>1. “Sexuality asserts itself in the human mind by releasing neurochemicals comparable to addictive drugs into the brain.” This is true but misleading. The brain have a system of reward to motivate us to do things we benefit from in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary.html" title="Evolutionary">evolutionary</a> terms. Most addictive <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a> mimic the function of the neurochemicals involved giving us pleasure without effort. However, the simularities can help explaining why some people becomes addicted to sex.</p>
<p>2. “Sexuality can lead to discrimination, based on perceptions of sexual immorality and intolerance of certain sexual preferences.” It such caces it is the INTOLERANCE that is the problem. If all harmless sexual activities where accepted the problem would disappear.</p>
<p>3. “Sexual desires could be false assumptions that are foisted on you by society...” Sexual drive is NOT a social construct: it exist as a genuine feeling towards other people! If you doubt that you might as well doubt that hunger is genuine feeling.</p>
<p>4. “Some antisexualists make no distinction between consent and coercion, seeing sex as a means of oppression.” This distinction is very important due to the enomous diffrence in the precived emotions of at least one of the ivolved. The victime ecperience a <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> as something compleatly different than consensual sex!</p>
<p>5. “Some antisexualists see a link between unrestricted reproduction, resource depletion and environmental decay.” This is an outdated idea reminding me of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Robert_Malthus_a4fc.html" title="Thomas Robert Malthus">Thomas Robert Malthus</a>. With widespead use of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraceptives.html" title="Contraceptives">contraceptives</a> and an intension to have few children the supposed link breaks down.</p>
<p>Eventually, I wounder if people really “oppose procreation”. Do they wish for the extincion of humanity!? Such opinions are simply amazing!</p>

<dd>The problem with the article is that it is not very clear. Origen and Ann Lee did not believe that everyone should be castrated or celibate. The point is, there is a difference between describing as a social movement a particular group of people or trend that is distinct from others, and a group of people who are trying to change their entire society). Since Origen and Ann Lee were not trying to tell others to change the way they lived, nor were they making scientific arguments, it is unsurprising that few people have written critiques of their positions. Be that as it may, Wikipedia is not a soapbox or chatroom. Lena, you are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia but you must follow our policies such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 14:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, Origen and Ann Lee viewed celibacy as the ethically and religiously highest calling, and Origen was part of that Quasi-Gnostic-Ascetic current of opinion of the early centuries A.D. which regarded marriage as an extremely poor second-best to celibacy from a spiritual point of view. As the article says, before the modern period you had prosyletizing antisexual religions, while now you also have a secular social reform reform movement which seeks to gain support for itself. Otherwise, I'm not sure I see the great differences which you're implying. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 17:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, well in terms of my point about social movements, the question I would think is, did they see themselves as part of a movement to change all of society so that everyone lives according to their views? Some social movements do just this: in the US, for example, the Civil Rights movements changed the way both Blacks and Whites lived. I think there is an important distinction between a person or group fo people who try to create a voluntaristic community of like-minded people who share a particular path to (God, truth, self-actualization) versus a movement that seeks to change the way all people live. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 11:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To explain myself more specifically, while anti-sexualist religions or religious tendencies have existed for a long time, and there have probably always been individuals with anti-sexualist views, it seems that anti-sexualist individuals not tied to one specific religion only sought each other out and formed a comunity during the Internet age. Therefore many of the sources on non-religion-specific anti-sexualist advocacy will necessarily be Internet sources. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 08:40, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Actually I should change this to, "Some antisexuals claims..." instead, but, as AnonMoos said, it isn't necessarily true, but the article is just pointing out arguments sometimes made by people for antisexualism. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 21:58, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In almost all societies where <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> exist it is only legal for one gender. In the vast majority of cases it is the men which are allowed to have more than one wife at the same time. As such polygamy is a matter of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_inequality.html" title="Gender inequality">gender inequality</a> not of destructive sexual behaviour.</p>

<dd>Polygamy isn't only "a matter of gender inequality" when it's legal for only one gender. You're incorrect because, first of all, whether or not it's legal has nothing to do with the word, and, secondly, polygamy can be practiced by both males and females (which means there is no inherent gender inequality). What you're thinking of is legal <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygyny.html" title="Polygyny">polygyny</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 02:22, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I mixed up <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygyny.html" title="Polygyny">polygyny</a>. But in the societies where polygamy is legal it is almost always so for only one of the genders. That is why I consider it a matter of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_inequality.html" title="Gender inequality">gender inequality</a> in the was majority of cases.</p>

<dd>You're right, in the majority of cases it is a matter of gender inequality. I'm just saying it's not something that <i>has</i> to be true. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 16:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
