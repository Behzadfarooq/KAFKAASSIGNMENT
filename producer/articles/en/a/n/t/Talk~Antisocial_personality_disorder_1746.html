<p>[I have been really bold tonight and added a section on ASPD in fiction. I have tried to chose characters closer to the definition of ASPD as it stands, and is most correctly used today. Obviously many more characters could be added and the definition could be enlarged and improved upon (it's far from perfect), it's just a beginning. So read and give thought before knotting a rope and hanging it from a tree in preparation for lynching me. I believe this whole article needs to veer away from information specific to the psychopath, and, in the strictest sense, inapplicable to ASPD, and into a fuller definition of ASPD as it stands. ASPD is NOT Psychopathy, but it IS an important, lamentably widespead, psychiatric and sociological phenomenon in it's own right, worth far better definition than it is currently getting here. So, what say you? Can we replace the psychopath specific information with more relevant equivalents? A bit at a time, so as to leave no "bald patches"? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 05:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<p>Since someone has gone ahead and recreated the article <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopathy.html" title="Psychopathy">Psychopathy</a>, this article barely serves a function. The grand majority of it discusses psychopathy rather than the DSM-specific nosological category of antisocial personality disorder since most research uses Hare's PCL-R and assessment tools based off it rather than the DSM-IV-TR criteria for APD. If most of the information about psychopathy were trimmed off, this article would have little left besides the DSM criteria. <i>(unsigned comment by <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.217.183.224.html" title="User:24.217.183.224">24.217.183.224</a>)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, the two articles are redundant. Since <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisocial_personality_disorder.html" title="Antisocial personality disorder">APD</a> is the more comprehensive, mature article I think <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopathy.html" title="Psychopathy">Psychopathy</a> should probably be merged with it. APD should remain as the title (with Psychopathy as a redirect) as it is the recognized diagnostic term for the condition. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/0/User_talk%7EBk0_24c3.html" title="User talk:Bk0">Talk</a>) 04:41, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>[One tiny problem, ASPD and Psychopathy are not the same disorder. Hare himself remarked that while all psychopaths have ASPD, only a very small proportion of ASPDs are psychopaths What is more ASPD is no more the recognized diagnostic term for Psychopathy than "infectious disease" is for Malaria. The PCL-R refers only to psychopathy, NOT ASPD, (hence the acronym P-psychopathy C-check L-list <a href="http://www.hare.org/pclr/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hare.org/pclr/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hare.org/pclr/index.html</a> ).</p>
<p>The psychopathy article is only thin (which it is) because all the good information in it was transferred to ASPD where a great deal of it is not entirely relevant. I believe that all the information specific to psychopathy (including the PCL-R) should be removed from ASPD and replaced here. When that is done you won't be left with any more than a link to DSM-IV criteria because of the unreasonableness of the APA (see here for why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive57#DSM-IV-TR_Copyright_question" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive57#DSM-IV-TR_Copyright_question" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive57#DSM-IV-TR_Copyright_question</a> ). When I restored that article I did not feel it right to replace that, or add to the article myself without further discussion so I just restored the "last known version"</p>
<p>Beyond that again, psychopathy, as a term, has an whole legal, medical, judicial and literary history with connotations unrelated to ASPD. Remember this is NOT supposed to be a medical encyclopaedia, but a general one, thus the legal, judicial and literary connotations of a topic should have equal weight with the medical ones. --82.195.137.125 16:08, 26 December 2005 (UTC)]</p>

<dd>The necessity of this article is obvious: As long as there is any doubt whatsoever in scientific circles about the synonymity of ASPD and psychopathy, Wikipedia cannot decide on any position without compromising its neutrality. Psychopathy as an article is required, to make sure no kind of judgment is made. As it is, this article is lacking in the extreme, but it is still a necessary part of wikipedia if all sides of an open discussion (i.e. a challenged theory) are supposed to be shown. Since neither constitutes as a fact, and psychopathy is quite differently defined from ASPD after all, I would include a notice of it being an as-of-yet-unproven hypothesis, but that's it. Its not like any of the articles on philosophy are in the essence very different, yet still they are not deleted. --Stephan, 30 December 2005 19:30PM</dd>

<p>Certainly you are referring to Hare, Robert D., Hart, Stephen D., Harpur, Timothy J. "Psychopathy and the DSM-IV Criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder." <i>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</i> 100.3 (1991): 391-398. First of all, this article was written while the DSM-IV criteria for APD were <b>under development</b>. His criticism of the APD criteria was in response to the DSM-III-R criteria, which were a large list of antisocial behaviors similar to the conduct disorder of the DSM-IV-TR. "The DSM—III—R approach to the diagnosis of APD is based on the assumption that personality traits are difficult to measure reliably and that it is easier to agree on the behaviors that typify a disorder than on the reasons why they occur."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Although the result has been a diagnostic category with good reliability, concerns have been expressed about its content- and construct-related validity, in particular, about its relation to clinical conceptions of psychopathy, in which inferences about affective and interpersonal processes have long played an important role. This is the second major criticism of the current DSM—III—R criteria for APD: They represent a rather radical break with clinical tradition, with clinical practice, with earlier versions of the DSM, and with international diagnostic nomenclature. Specifically, the DSM—III—R criteria exclude, or at least do not explicitly include, such characteristics as selfishness, egocentricity, callousness, manipulativeness, lack of empathy, and so forth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The lack of congruence between the DSM—III—R criteria for APD and other well-established conceptions of psychopathy does not appear to have been intentional. Rather, this construct drift seems to have been the unforeseen result of reliance on a fixed set of behavioral indicators in the DSM—III and the DSM—III—R. That is, the behavioral indicators do not provide adequate coverage of the construct they were designed to measure. [...]Paradoxically, the criteria for APD appear to define a diagnostic category that is at once too broad, encompassing criminals and antisocial persons who are psychologically heterogeneous, and too narrow, excluding those who have the personality structure of the psychopath but who have not exhibited some of the specific antisocial behaviors listed for APD.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hare et al. then go on to propose the DSM-IV use a set of criteria closely approximating the traits listed on his Psychopathy Checklist-Revised.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Factor 1 [of the PCL-R] clearly reflects a set of interpersonal and affective characteristics, such as egocentricity, lack of remorse, callousness, and so forth, considered fundamental to clinical conceptions of psychopathy. [...] Evidence presented elsewhere indicates that Factor 1 is positively correlated with clinical ratings of psychopathy, with prototypicality ratings of narcissistic and histrionic personality disorder, and with self-report measures of machiavellianism and narcissism. It is also negatively correlated with measures of empathy and anxiety.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Factor 2 reflects those aspects of psychopathy related to an impulsive, antisocial, and unstable lifestyle. It is positively correlated with diagnoses of APD, criminal behaviors, socioeconomic background, and self-report measures of socialization and antisocial behavior.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hare et al. then go on to discuss the usefulness of PCL and PCL-R measures of psychopathy in predicting criminal recidivism and its concordance with certain other measures of psychopathy and related traits (like sensation seeking). They describe how the construct of psychopathy has been used in research on their affective processes (rather than DSM-III or DSM-III-R APD). Hare et al. propose a set of criteria for the DSM-IV version of APD that better conforms to the clinical tradition of psychopathy: "Encouraged by these results, we used the PCL—R and the PCL:SV as the basis for development of the 10-item criteria set for psychopathic personality disorder (PPD)." These criteria are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Glib and superficial</li>
<li>Inflated and arrogant self-appraisal</li>
<li>Lacks remorse</li>
<li>Lacks empathy</li>
<li>Deceitful and manipulatice</li>
<li>Early behavior problems</li>
<li>Adult antisocial behavior</li>
<li>Impulsive</li>
<li>Poor behavioral controls</li>
<li>Irresponsible</li>
</ol>
<p>The PPD, used in DSM-IV field trials along with the ICD-10 dissocial personality disorder and DSM-III-R criteria for APD, is a shortened version of the PCL-R, essentially. Ultimately, the DSM-IV criteria for antisocial personality disorder were a compromise. Psychopathy is <b>not</b> a subtype of antisocial personality disorder. They are simply two separate attempts to measure the same concept.--<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.217.183.224.html" title="User:24.217.183.224">24.217.183.224</a> 01:36, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>[How curious, because Robert Hare seems to be under the impression that he has also criticised the DSM-IV criteria for ASPD as being completely inadequate and distinct from Psychopathy <a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p960239.html" class="external free" title="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p960239.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p960239.html</a> --82.195.137.125 05:37, 27 December 2005 (UTC)]</p>

<p>In <i>The Mask of Sanity</i>, Hervey Cleckley did mention the phenomenon of psychopaths sometimes using an inappropriate word (I believe the example he provided was, "I am deftly afraid of needles"), but he did not rigorously inquire into this observation, which may merely be the result of pre-existing expectations.

<p>I don't recall whether Dr. Hannibal Lecter is called a sociopath in the movie, but I do know his diagnosis is discussed in the books, and he does not meet the criteria for a sociopath. At one point Clarice Starling says, in a discussion with him, "I'm still waiting for the shallowness of affect." He's also very aware of social rules and expectations, and tends to kill "the rude." A sociopath wouldn't even notice those things, right? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseilhan_1a5f.html" title="User:Dseilhan">Dseilhan</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Dseilhan_3629.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Dseilhan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Probably not - an interesting component of those with APD is the flexibility of their "morals". As an example, they might view stealing or infidelity as a particularly eggregious offense - one worth killing over. They key is to remember that those with APD have a fundamental dysfunctionality when perceiving the concept of morality. That is to say, they are not immoral, just a-moral. Make sense? As a pop-culture example, see Patrick Bateman in American Psycho: he killed people who randomly irritated him or were offensive in some fashion.

<dd>As a character Hannibal Lecter is psychopathologically flawed in that the background in "Hannibal" is not a true match for his pathology (others eat the most precious thing in the world to you so you grow up with a compulsion to eat anything that sets your teeth on edge? I don't THINK so!&#160;;o) ) BUT, allowing for that, Hannibal's sociopathic tendencies are environmental in origin which would rule out psychopath and sociopath (incidenatally, in the book, and the movie, he is referred to as a "pure psychopath" NOT a sociopath), so is he truly AsPD?

<p>Please don't merge psychopathy with APD - they are in fact different (though similar and overlapping) disorders- while all psychopaths are APDs, not all APDs are psychopaths.</p>
<p>Psychopaths have some kind of brain damage while non-psychopath APDs are generally merely "badly brought up". This is a very important difference as there is more hope of reform or cure for APDs.

<dd><i>Risk-seeking behavior and substance abuse may be attempts to escape feeling empty or emotionally void.

</dl>
<p>I have read various speculative accounts that psychopaths' and antisocial personality disordered individuals' emotional experience extends beyond boredom, transient rage, and occasionally even anxiety to other unwholesome emotions as well: envy, jealousy, greed, lust, arrogance, wrath, contempt, and self-pity. The thing is their emotional states (especially in primary psychopaths) are superficial—transient and not deeply felt, often even feigned just to manipulate or intimidate. Their capacity for the social emotions (love, empathy, guilt and remorse, and shame) is not altogether nonexistent but so weak as to be meaningless when compared to what most people mean when they say, for instance, love.</p>
<p>Beyond measuring physiological signs of certain emotions, it is difficult to know the thoughts and feelings of what a psychopath is going through, and their accounts are subject to dramatization and bragging.</p>

Hi there - just wanted to point out that the stats seem to have changed. It now reads (Dec 16,2006) 4% of men and 7% of women are thought to have some form of antisocial personality disorder ... and I'm sure the stats will change again sometime.

<p>It is funny that people are labeled such things in complete ignorance of how the mind really works and what really drives people's behavior. This entire concept seems to assume that many behaviors exhibited by those they would label "sociopaths" are not driven by beliefs superior to those the people making such labels hold.</p>
<p>In my opinion, any concept such as this is nothing more than ignorant unless it is made by those people who would hold such a label. As only they can truly gauge how their behavior might be driven by their beliefs and past experiences, which is necessary to understand their behavior in addition to any physical biological evidence. Or perhaps even to explain any observed biological differences as it is possible that they are actually the cause and the physical differences are the effect.</p>
<p>If someone comes from a culture that is extremely militaristic, or has a strong emphasis on lack of fear of death we might attribute their behavior to their culture or the enviornment they live in. But if someone seeks and/or gains such "wisdom" on their own and succeeds resulting in a lack of fear of death and lack of empathy for the suffering of people which they might consider learning experiences etc, they are labeled a sociopath. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.180.7.137 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.180.7.137.html" title="User talk:69.180.7.137">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.180.7.137_ba05.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.180.7.137">contribs</a>).</small></p>

You are oversimplifying the disorder.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you are grandstanding from a Humanist perspective where the individual is measured against the expectations of a society and is thusly assigned into a general category of public acceptance based on social judgment. (It also appears as if you've personally encountered acceptance issues based on your particular belief system. That's all well and good, but you should attempt to avoid injecting personal bias into your argument.) I agree that one is unable to completely understand the nuances of a disorder unless directly affected by it (..and then the difficulty moves into fuzzy, confirmation bias scenarios); yet it is necessary to assess and measure illnesses (using other platforms of diagnosis than what you've mentioned) based on popular experience with the disorder in question. That way, we can begin to understand and help the affected individual.</p>
<p>Criticism is all well and good, but unless you can offer legitimate, empirically-sound alternatives to the existing scientific methods for classifying this biochemically-based disorder outside the generalized parameters of your broad argument, then take a number and wait in line with all of the other empty-handed skeptics.</p>
<p>Not to be a jerk, but its tiring listening to arguments that are ignorant, yet trumpet for sweeping change based on their limited observations.</p>

<p>As for the points above:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mnemonic is accurate; the parts are easy to match to the DSM-IV criteria.</li>
<li>Amateurish? It was published in a peer-reviewed journal that is catalogued by <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_correctness.html" title="Politically correctness">Politically correctness</a> - I think it is hard to make that case. The definition of corrupt<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corrupt" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corrupt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> isn't far from the mark if you look at the criteria of ASPD. <i>Currupt</i> is a label and I think it fits in this case.</li>
<li>Unencyclopaedic? The mnemonic is informative and accurate. Many other Wikipedia articles have <a href="../../../m/n/e/Mnemonics.html" title="Mnemonics">mnemonics</a>.</li>
<li>"[A] mnemonic is a specific tool for those who are learning about ASPD, say, for their job or exams..." - Why not make the article useful for people that are learning about ASPD and use this in their jobs? These people are more likely to know the nuances of ASPD and may be persuaded to fix a little error here or there and may add valuable insights.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think the mnemonic should be removed and I think it is appropriately placed with the criteria. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> <small><a href="../../../n/e/p/User_talk%7ENephron_679d.html" title="User talk:Nephron">&#160;T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nephron_3dab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nephron">C</a></small> 00:05, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do think it is of value and I wasn't advocating for removal off the page. However, whether or not 'Corrupt' is accurate it is still a perjorative term. I work in mental health; while we may use mnemonics in learning we don't generally stick them in notes as part of a diagnosis. The mnemonic is to help people in the area remember the criteria, not to actually use in diagnosis per se. (that is why they are not in DSM IV criteria). People with Personality Disorder often marginalised in psychiatric treatment. There is already enough controversy about the diagnoses. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 03:04, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<b>Antisocial personality disorder</b> (APD or ASPD) is a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatric.html" title="Psychiatric">psychiatric</a> <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnosis.html" title="Diagnosis">diagnosis</a> that interprets antisocial and impulsive behaviors as <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symptoms.html" title="Symptoms">symptoms</a> of a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality_disorder.html" title="Personality disorder">personality disorder</a>. Psychiatry defines only <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological.html" title="Pathological">pathological</a> antisocial behavior; it does not address potential benefits of positive antisocial behavior or define the meaning of '<a href="../../../s/o/c/Social.html" title="Social">social</a>' in contrast to 'antisocial'."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Do we really need this metaphysical discussion about what the word <i>antisocial</i> really means in the introduction? In my opinion, this prime real estate should be more descriptive than quasi-philosophical because the typical reader unfamiliar with the subject will simply want to know what the term means in the first paragraph. The word <i>interprets</i> also adds a highly deconstructionist tone to the introduction.</p>
<p>By the way, <i>antisocial</i> is typically defined in contrast to <i>prosocial</i> and not just plain <i>social</i>. Antisocial behaviors and attitudes are simply those that reduce interpersonal trust, create conflict, seed ill will between people, result in exploitation, or result in violence. Prosocial behaviors and attitudes engender the opposite: increased compassion and trust, friendship, cooperation, and community. Sociologists frequently use both terms, and some psychologists will use both terms (such as encouraging prosocial behavior in at-risk children).</p>

<p>ASPD has huge social implications because its sufferers inflict so much harm on those around them. It is my understanding that this disorder is "baked-in" by the way a person is treated during adolescence, and that it cannot be treated or cured. This has profound implications for the treatment of adult ASPD sufferers convicted of serious crimes, and thier propensity to re-offend.

<p>I'm editing out some unsourced and inaccurate statements that are potentially dangerous. I've made a similar edit before, but it was reversed. As an example, "Generally two-out-of-three indicates a very strong tendency towards sociopathy". This has not been shown in any research that I am aware of, and certainly none that was cited in the wikipedia article. In fact, there have been no studies that were capable of determining this. In fact, this sort of estimation is strongly cautioned against by researchers (with the exception of Hellman &amp; Blackman (1966)), and it is very problematic to make predictions like this about a child without sufficient empirical evidence to back them up.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is that all the current studies have looked at the histories of offenders. While it is true that it is common for offenders to have had these behaviours in childhood, that does not necessarily imply that one can predict who will have APD or become violent against persons based on them, any more than their childhood histories of breathing air indicate that air causes violence. There are large numbers of children who show all three symptoms (particularly in abused populations) who do not go on to develop APD.</p>

<dd>"Sociopath" was, in fact, a term devised to replace "Psychopath" because "psychopath" and "psychopathy" originally meant "general mental illness" and in some contexts and countries still does, to avoid, potentially disasterous confusion. These days some academic sources have slightly different meanings for the two terms, but they pretty much mean the same. Antisocial Personality Disorder was a failed attempt to replace psychopathy in the DSM IV that wound up generalising so much, begging so many questions and avoiding so many issues a lot of people would argue that it doesn't mean much at all, let alone psychopathy or sociopathy. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 19:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Most descriptions of psychopaths and persons with an antisocial personality disorder describe a <b>prototypical</b> case rather than a real individual, with all the nuance and ambiguity that comes with it. Antisocial personality disorder is a heterogeneous diagnosis: It includes bums and drifters, spouse abusers, violent felons, swindlers, and thrill seekers; it also may exclude certain white-collar criminals.--<a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENeantHumain_9180.html" title="User:NeantHumain">NeantHumain</a> 02:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd go halfway with what you are saying. There are real mental illnesses, but a lot of the time the treatments DO seem, to consist in replacing one illness with another. There are also real personality disorders, but too often they seem to be used as labels to slap over bad behavior. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 14:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, from the treating staff's point of view (and society's), a depressed, remorseful antisocial is better than a callous, brazen antisocial. Depression is unpleasant, and with insight, the antisocial patient can be motivated to make change that would alleviate both the depression and the personality disorder. The kinds of psychopaths who experience no guilt or depression are considered untreatable and are pretty much locked away as long as legally possible; doing otherwise would simply mean putting a lot of people in danger.--<a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENeantHumain_9180.html" title="User:NeantHumain">NeantHumain</a> 04:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
