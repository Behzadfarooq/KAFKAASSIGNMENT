<p>The article as it stands contains the sentence:</p>
<p>Frequently vain, self-dramatizing and histrionic, the audience must sometimes laugh at her, but other times consider her a true tragic heroine.</p>
<p>Can we fix this? As it stands, it says that the <i>audience</i> is vain, self-dramatizing and histrionic, not Cleopatra, as presumably intended. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.179.168.52 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.179.168.52.html" title="User talk:209.179.168.52">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.179.168.52_fc64.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.179.168.52">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>fireteddy: in my edit I removed the link "proving" Antony &amp; Cleopatra has a masonic subtext, as it is conspiracy theorist mumbojumbo useless to an information-based article in an encyclopedia. If whoever first posted it needs it to be there, I'd recommend that it be placed in the External Links and not in the main body of the text. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Fireteddy (<a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireteddy_d170.html" title="User talk:Fireteddy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fireteddy_efc1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fireteddy">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Fireteddy could you please tell me the grounds for your assumed expertise on Elizabethan Freemasonry? As a matter of fact, there is good evidence that literary patrons such as the Lord Admiral, Lord Derby, the Earl of Oxford, King James and William Herbert were all deeply involved in Freemasonry. There is also evidence that Shakespeare's literary peers, such as Thomas Nashe, John Lyly and Gabriel Harvey, were very familiar with the craft <a href="http://www.levity.com/alchemy/h_fre.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.levity.com/alchemy/h_fre.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It is against this background that I interpret some of the esoteric allusions in the play to have a Masonic raison d'etre. I believe the two quotations from the (apocryphal) book of Esdras cited in my article are profoundly important keys to an understanding of the play. This is not useless 'conspiracy theorist mumbojumbo' at all, but based on reasoned argument. Do you have any knowledge of the occult philosophy in the Elizabethan age? Shakespeare is not so precious a literary icon that he cannot be subjected to interdisciplinary research. He was a man of his times. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKit_Marlowe_a242.html" title="User:Kit Marlowe">Kit Marlowe</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKit_Marlowe_89ce.html" title="User talk:Kit Marlowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kit_Marlowe_f9f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kit Marlowe">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>(Here via RfC.) These don't pass my idea of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (well, okay, I suppose I could write off for the <i>Hermetic Review</i> CD) and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. There are some more details about <i>The Hermetic Review</i> at <a href="http://www.levity.com/alchemy/journal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.levity.com/alchemy/journal.html" rel="nofollow">the Alchemy website</a>. Although I don't need the assistance of Google to recognise the name of one of the regular contributors to the magazine as a published author in the field of occultism, I don't think the magazine is peer-reviewed in the way Wikipedia likes. If this is a common theory (and there was something about Shakespeare and freemasonry in <i>The Independent</i> newspaper this weekend, oddly enough; although it was in the context of "batty theories about Shakespeare" in a piece presumably timed for his birthday, and not terribly helpful here), there ought to be something else from the field of English literature or drama which can be cited to support this. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 22:41, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><font color="green">There is not a great deal of need for those ignorant of The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age (a seminal work by Frances Yates) to lose hair over the status of the peer reviewed Hermetic Journal. If any one bothered to read the article cited they would see that it refers to unambiguous primary sources by the likes of Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey, discussing their personal involvement with a "sworn brotherhood" tagged "maisonry" whose aim is to build up a spiritual temple, and whose jargon they clearly understand. These people would also do well to dip a toe in David Stevenson's book (CUP), The Origins of Freemasonry - Scotland's century 1590 - 1710'. They would also do well to ponder the Masonic symbolism carved into the walls of Rosslyn Chapel near Edinburgh. The only inscription in that building contemporaneous with its 15th century construction is the quotation from the book of Esdras cited in the Masoncode.com article as being a noticeable influence on the subtext of Antony and Cleopatra.</font></p>
<p><font color="green">There is a large literature on the esoteric content of Shakespeare's plays, just as there is an even larger literature on the esoteric content of the Renaissance world. The self-appointed defenders of Shakespearean purity would do well to acknowledge this and open their minds to criticisms of Shakespeare that address the spiritual and intellectual aspirations of his time. The fact that esoteric philosophy is denigrated by the rational minds of today is no excuse for ignoring its prevalance or the esteem in which it was held by the intellectual elite of Shakespeare's day.</font>--<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKit_Marlowe_a242.html" title="User:Kit Marlowe">Kit</a> 17:01, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well that's great.

<p>In Act 3 Scene 3 servants reassure Cleopatra that Octavia has "brown" hair, which is not a sign of beauty in Elizabethan terms; today that's not necessaraily unattractive; the nearest I could come in modern English is "bad hair".

<p>Andy - to quote Wiki policy on NPOV: "For instance, that Shakespeare is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest playwrights of the English language is a bit of knowledge that one should learn from an encyclopedia. However, in the interests of neutrality, one should also learn that a number of reputable scholars argue that there is a strong case to make that the author of much of the work still attributed to Shakespeare was his contemporary Christopher Marlowe." Imagine my surprise - even the wiki policy page on NPOV cites the authorship question as a valid debate that "in the interests of neutrality" should be discussed. You need to stop trying to prevent opposing views from appearing on Wikipedia. Threatening to revert all edits that represent an opposing view is simply not justified. It is also clearly not the NPOV policy. Smatprt 06:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
