<p>Hi. I have removed the "Hurdygurdy" reference in the above article. It is irrelevant what the (no-longer present) US soldiers called the town. This info is probably better presented in the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Air_Station_Keflavik_3bb1.html" title="Naval Air Station Keflavik">Naval Air Station Keflavik</a> article, if at all. Please leave a message on my talk page if you want to discuss this further. But if you have any other information to add to the article, feel free!

<p>Hi, fair enough you were tired, so what you put is valid as opposed to the sarcastic comment it looked like, but please don't delete the history of the discussion. I guess you're in the same position as me, the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_cannon.html" title="Water cannon">article</a> is blatently all good, but there's no sources cited for any of the claims. Any idea where to start with sources for it? --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedHillian_dc72.html" title="User:RedHillian">RedHillian</a> 17:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC) (also in the UK).</p>

<p>Hi, is the category for articles related to industrial breathing sets or just for makes (brand names) of industrial breathing sets? Of the 10 other articles in that category 5 of them aren't makes, and I'm unclear why <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mine_rescue.html" title="Mine rescue">mine rescue</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_Control_Equipment_Ltd_1e1f.html" title="Gas Control Equipment Ltd">Gas Control Equipment Ltd</a> should be separated out from being alphabetized if the others are not. If we did separate everything that wasn't a make, that would leave only 5 of the 12 articles alphabetized.

<dd>The article was already becoming a focus of contention for more genralised naming issues, it also seems that we could do better in terms of splitting off a section, though personally I think 94KB is pretty small, anyway I see their is contention so I will reflect a bit before seeing if an afd would be appropraite.

<p>For your information, the WikiProject Cricket is establishing a season review article for every first-class season worldwide. A summary of trophy winners is okay as a quick lookup but there is a need for detailed information per season. At present, we are concentrating on getting the articles in place and the best way to do that in a reasonable time is by creating "lookalike" stubs that can easily be copied and pasted; the next phase (which is already underway re England) is to expand the stubs and provide the details. The English seasons to 1787 are no longer stubs, we intend to enlarge all the others also but it will take several months to do it. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 10:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just noticed that you've created a list of places in Kreis Schleswig-Flensburg copied from a different Wikipedia. Please don't add links to other wikipedias directly in article space. If you wish to make lists of interwiki links, please do it on the talk page of the article in question. In some cases, this will mean that this wikipedia will only link to a non-existing (redlink) article, but this is how the system works. On the other hand, a redlink will make others notice that an article is missing here, and it will hopefully lead to its creation. Most of the readers of this website can't read either German or Danish anyway, so they have no use for any such links. I also noticed that you add links from article space to images on other websites. If you wish to include images here, you need to upload them images to either this Wikipedia or to Commons and add the correct image license. Alternatively, you can make a link to them under the "external links" section or you can link to such material from the article's talk page. However, in actual article space, we're only allowed to use images on Wikipedia's own servers. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

<p>-lev is a very old and common ending in Danish placenames. It is at least 1,000 years old. The first syllable is normally but not always a man's name and -lev is derived from the verb "leve" which means to "live". E.g. Haderslev = "where Hathar lives", Marslev = "where Mar lives" (in both cases, the "S" is a genitive). Hartlev = "where life is tough" (in German, this name would have been "Hartleben"), Haslev = "where hazel grows" (Hassel = hazel). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 17:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It will take a little time but I'll try to look for answers to your questions, but I can start with those that I know of for sure:</p>
<p>- Mysunde. Mysunde is located on the north side of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwansen.html" title="Schwansen">Schwansen</a>, near a very narrow part of the Schlei. Any army wishing to outflank the Dannevirke would have to cross the Schlei here. Outflanking it to the west would not be possible under normal conditions since the area between Husum and the western extremity of the Dannevirke was marsh land which was flooded in times of war. Mysunde is located on the road between Kosel and Brodersby. See <a href="http://www.milhist.dk/1864/mysunde64/mysunde64.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.milhist.dk/1864/mysunde64/mysunde64.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It is located in the north-western part of Kosel municipality, see a location map of the municipality at <a href="../../../../de/k/o/s/Kosel.html" class="extiw" title="de:Kosel">de:Kosel</a>. If you read German, there is a bit more information here: <a href="http://www.amt-schlei.de/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amt-schlei.de/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, click "Die Gemeinden" and click "Kosel". The same location was the scene of battles during several wars.</p>
<p>- Railways. The Danish railway network was still in its infancy in 1864. North of the Konge√•, only a rail link between Copenhagen and Kors√∏r existed as well as a railway from √Örhus leading to the north west. Had the Dannevirke been held, potential reinforcements from Copenhagen would have been transported by rail to Kors√∏r and sailed the rest of the way to Flensburg. Such an operation would take a maximum of 2-3 days. The railway network in the duchies was much better: railways linked Hamburg, Kiel, Altona and the city of Schleswig. Less than 10 years before the war, railways opened from Eiderstedt and Husum to the city of Schleswig and from Schleswig to Flensburg. The duchies had no railways north of this point. More interesting is that the railway was never properly used during the evacuation of the Dannevirke with the result that great amounts of artillery, most importantly heavy artillery, were left behind by the Danish army. One explanation is that this was done so the Prussian army wouldn't notice the retreat. A more popular story claims that a waiting train had been instructed to head north at a specific time, which it did, but that the army had not yet arrived to the station due to heavy snow. The equipment transported to Dybb√∏l was essentially pulled there by soldiers and horses during very poor conditions, as the weather had changed to a snow storm. An iconic image exists of this retreat, and I'll upload a copy one of the days. The city of Schleswig, Flensburg, S√∏nderborg and Dybb√∏l were all connected by a road paved with crushed rock and this was the route the army took. The same road continued from Flensburg to Fredericia and √Örhus and this was the route later taken by the Prussian army when it invaded Jutland. The Dannevirke was abandoned at the orders of the commander, Christian de Meza, who feared that the poorly-repaired fortress couldn't hold out against a bigger foe. Even more so as the Schlei and the wetlands west of the Dannevirke were freezing. His calculations might have been correct, but the decision was not popular, and it is still considered almost a miracle that the army wasn't destroyed when the weather changed for the worse so the army had to march most of the way through a snowstorm. Except for the artillery, it arrived almost in one piece at Dybb√∏l. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 13:36, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Anthony. Unfortunately I can't find any really good sources regarding your questions about Arn√¶s and the thaw of 1864. As I remember the story, thaw came soon after the army's withdrawal to Dybb√∏l, but I haven't a good source at hand. Sorry. Around 600 men were caught or killed in action during the retreat and 10 men died of freezing. A number of Schleswigers left the army during the withdrawal, but according to one soldier, most of these returned in less than a day. <a href="http://milhist.dk/1864/tilbagetog/tilbagetoget.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://milhist.dk/1864/tilbagetog/tilbagetoget.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 20:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As you recently edited the Sprevjane article, I thought I'd give you a heads up. The edit may reflect a German POV on the part of the contributor, who also added unreferenced etymological information (most likely folk etymology) linking Spevjane to Spree-wohner. You may wish to move the article back, or simply cite/clean up the etymological information. ---- <a href="../../../b/e/o/User%7EBeobach972_6c35.html" title="User:Beobach972">Beobach972</a> 01:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I can't understand or believe that you would call my adding fact tags to the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_chamber.html" title="Gas chamber">Gas Chamber</a> article a type of holocaust denial. I find this very offensive. I add fact tags to many articles, and nobody has ever tried to skirt WP:CITE in such an irresponsible and childish way.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but you don't just throw around an accusation like that, especially when someone is going through pages trying to help by adding fact tags where appropriate and the article is in flagrant violation of WP:CITE.</p>
<p>I didn't consider that these fact tags could construed as controversial, and I was not thinking of them in the context of the holocaust denial debate. I was simply adding tags where settled policy says they belong.</p>
<p>I don't know if you are actively involved in the holocaust history issue - it's not a main area of study for me. If you are, I would suggest that you take a more reasonable approach when dealing with people, like myself, who have not looked into the issue. While I know enough about the documentation and study of the holocaust to know that it obviously occurred, I am startled by the level of aggression you have displayed in this instance and I fear it may provide ammunition for the very people whose deceits you seek to mitigate or eliminate from WikiPedia.</p>

<li>I was not calling this {{fact}} comment a type of holocaust denial. My edit comment "<i>(rv ... a totally unnecessary "{{fact}}" tag.)</i>" merely meant that so many people know about the Holocaust that surely a reference is not needed. Simiarly with "<i>(rv deletion of a sentence that I put in to counter Holocaust-denial-type queries)</i>". As it is, I have put in a link to <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yad_Vashem_56e6.html" title="Yad Vashem">Yad Vashem</a>'s web site as a fact link. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 10:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>AA, do you have any references for "<a href="../../../p/a/h/Pah.html" title="Pah">pah</a>" as an alternate spelling for "pƒÅ"? I was cleaning up the mess of two disambiguation pages for "PAH" [with and without the (disambiguation)], when we edit-collided. I put your addition in an invisible comment, for now. The PƒÅ (MƒÅori) article shows "pa" as an alternate spelling, but not "pah". It seems to me that the article itself should list all valid spellings (and even common invalid spellings).

<li>AA, I seem to have reverted your reversion to the disambiguation page. I had forgotten that I had already changed it once. However I think there is a difference between simplification and 'dumbing down', and my initial changes were not made without thought. I would suggest: up to 10 tonnes is not that 'small'; 'one-man' is irrelevant to a disambiguation page entry, which needs to be give as brief a description as will suffice for the purpose of disambiguation; not all dumpers are diesel powered and anyway that is also unnecessary detail; and the final 'around' is also superfluous and not, if I may be so bold, terribly good English. In so far as it may be relevant, I happen to have 40 years experience of construction plant. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Ferguson_4783.html" title="User:Bill Ferguson">Bill F</a> 23:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Anthony, I didn't delete your summary points of the 3rd season thus far....not sure if someone did, based on your comment? In any case, while I agree that other news sites and websites may have reported on some of these things, people may be coming to Wikipedia as a resource, so to be fair, information about unseen episodes should be between spoiler tags - and right now, the article does indeed have spoiler tags. I did delete an earlier mention of Flower's death that was placed in that lead information area, which was NOT within the spoiler tags. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 02:15, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll go over to the article and try to clarify what I wrote. I don't think it's a USA vs UK thing so much as a riding discipline thing: In the US, a "crop" is usually used for what we call <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunt_seat.html" title="Hunt seat">Hunt seat</a> riding and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_jumping.html" title="Show jumping">show jumping</a>. It is short (under 24" in some cases), fairly stiff, and has a little popper on the end. A similar tool is used by jockeys in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_racing.html" title="Horse racing">horse racing</a> where the words "<a href="../../../c/r/o/Crop.html" title="Crop">crop</a>", "<a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip.html" title="Whip">whip</a>" and "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat.html" title="Bat">bat</a>" are used interchangably for the same item, possibly a regional variation there. <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodeo.html" title="Rodeo">Rodeo</a> people call their crops a "bat." A "whip" is longer, what may be seen in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressage.html" title="Dressage">Dressage</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddle_seat.html" title="Saddle seat">Saddle seat</a> riding, up to 43" in dressage, longer in other disciplines. It also probably isn't all that cosmically important!&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 07:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do think "bat" as a word interchangable with "crop" is possibly an American thing; we too normally consider a "bat" the wooden stick used in baseball or cricket! &lt;grin&gt; But then, most people think a "crop" is somethig that you grow in the ground for food, too! But basically, in the world of horse whips, think of a crop as a short whip or about 24 inches, or think of a whip as a slightly longer, more flexible crop, whatever floats your boat...everyone says "dressage whip," for example, referring to the riding whip that is no more than 43 inches long; no one says "dressage crop." Hope that clarifies things, sort of... <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 07:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
