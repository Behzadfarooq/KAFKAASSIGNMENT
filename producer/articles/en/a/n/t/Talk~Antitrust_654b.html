<p>The article requires general expansion and more content from non-U.S. perspectives. Also, is there criticism which culminates in more than the concern that competition law discourages "businessmen" from being productive for society? <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.198.237.30.html" title="User:203.198.237.30">203.198.237.30</a> 07:38, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I seriously doubt the neutrality of DrThompson's overhaul of the "Criticism of Antitrust" section (renamed "The Deceit of Antitrust", which is an obviously biased title itself). Whether the information is accurate or not (taken from Dr. Thomas E. Woods Jr.'s book, <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History</i>), the criticism of antitrust should be presented in a neutral and objective manner, not sound like an op-ed piece. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix-forgotten_5f18.html" title="User:Phoenix-forgotten">Phoenix-forgotten</a> 19:17, 2005 Mar 17 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the POV tag because the thought my changes eliminated this problem If someone still think it lack NPOV, go ahead and replace the tag and explain your reasoning here. The major problem that I saw was the criticism of antitrust law was dropped in random places and presented as fact. I moved some of it to the criticism section and eliminated other parts that were duplicated in the criticism section.</p>
<p>On that point, I think a defect of the criticism section is that it only presents the more extreme "all antirust law is bad" POV rather than the more common criticism that much enforcement of anitrust law is excessive and the laws should be both scaled back and more clearly written. Finally there is the point of view that modern antitrust law is too weak, a view not expressed anywhere in the critism section. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitteneatkitten_415d.html" title="User:Kitteneatkitten">Kitteneatkitten</a> 20:48, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it the article still has considerable problems with NPOV. (I say that despite the fact I often agree wih the viewpoint!)</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roosevelt for his part distinguished between "good trusts" and bad ones allegedly on the basis of their contribution to the economy. Such <b>arbitrariness</b> gives business leaders reason to believe that they will be prosecuted if they do not cultivate political support for their business.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>One problem under the Sherman Act was that businessmen did not know what was allowed or not.</b> Therefore in 1914 Congress passed the Clayton Act which prohibited specific business actions (such as price discrimination, tie-in sales, exclusive dealership agreements, mergers, acquisitions, and interlocking corporate directorships) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to "consent decrees" which provided an alternative mechanism to police anti-trust. <b>However the law is still very unclear. For instance there is no clear definition of what constitutes a "market". In the words of Isabel Paterson "As freak legislation, the antitrust laws stand alone. Nobody knows what it is they forbid.".</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both are worthy criticisms, and important to understanding the controversy around the Sherman Act, but the first is clearly in opposition to Roosevelt's POV; the second adopts Isabel Paterson's point of view. Both take the view that the burden on business is excessive. A NPOV would acknowledge the issue without taking the side.</p>
<p>Suggested rewrites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roosevelt for his part distinguished between "good trusts" and bad ones allegedly on the basis of their contribution to the economy. As a result, many business leaders have expressed concern that they will be prosecuted if they do not cultivate political support for their business.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Businessmen have frequently complained that the Sherman Act did not make clear what was allowed or not. In response, Congress passed the Clayton Act in 1914 which prohibited specific business actions (such as price discrimination, tie-in sales, exclusive dealership agreements, mergers, acquisitions, and interlocking corporate directorships) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to "consent decrees" which provided an alternative mechanism to police anti-trust. However businessmen continue to complain the law is still very unclear. For instance that there is no clear definition of what constitutes a "market". In the words of Isabel Paterson "As freak legislation, the antitrust laws stand alone. Nobody knows what it is they forbid.".</p>

<p>However, I'm still concerned about <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Probably these assertions <i>are</i> verifiable, and it's probably more important to get the NPOV than strict verifiability. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobKerns_3266.html" title="User:BobKerns">Bob Kerns</a> 12:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's also concerning that no mention is made of reduced (I believe almost non-existent) enforcement in recent years. Whether you view this as a good thing or a bad thing -- in the context of an article highly critical of the act, it has the effect of enhancing the critisisms by exaggerating the current impact. A more balanced approach would make mention of this -- it also helps with verifiability of some of the positions, since it would seem some of the current administration hold the positions. And mentioning that the administration has been criticised for lack of enforcement would do much to restore NPOV. There is almost no mention in the article that the opinions stated are not universally held as fact. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobKerns_3266.html" title="User:BobKerns">Bob Kerns</a> 12:34, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my revision of this article I did not do much to this section. The beginning of the article already discusses the rationale of antitrust law. Moreover, the section is not very informative and not clearly written. Therefore I suggest that this section be eliminated and the rationale for antitrust laws be more fulling discussed in the introduction.

<p>This article is more balanced than most on Wikipedia by far, I think it's just a touchy concept and people are unwilling to see the other side.

<p>(As far as the NPOV issues, perhaps your problem is with the whole concept of competition or antitrust law; some conservatives think the whole idea is too paternalistic and aimed solely at punishing "big business".

<li><b>Oppose</b> per MoS; which also says if it's been stable at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">Antitrust</a>, which it has, leave it there.

<p>I have been a practicing antitrust lawyer for more than 15 years. I revised the discussion of anticompetitive conduct because it included a lot of information that was, quite simply, wrong. I deleted tying from the list of prohibited practices. While there is a prohibited practice known as tying, the text described bundling rather than tying. Tying is a subset of bundling where the seller has monopoly power in the "tying" product. While the label "per se" is applied to tying, this is arguably inaccurate because proof of monopoly power in this context is almost indistinguishable from proving a case under the rule of reason. As understood in the literature, there are very few cases in which tying would be found to have occurred. Bundling, by contrast, is selling two products together. This is okay as long as there is no demonstrable anticompetitive effect. I also deleted all but two of the entries from the list of antitrust exemptions because the information was wrong. None of the deleted areas is exempt from antitrust scrutiny, though in some cases there may be partial exemptions under specific circumstances defined by statute. In other cases, antitrust scrutiny may be limited to scrutiny by specific agencies of the U.S. government. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob99_fa34.html" title="User:Bob99">Bob99</a> 22:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also changed removed "vendor lock-in" from the list of practices subject to antitrust scrutiny. It would require narrowly defined circumstances in which economic effects could be demonstrated that such a practice would be found unlawful under U.S. antitrust laws.</dd>

<dd>In addition, I removed predatory pricing from the list of prohibited practices. As the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predatory_pricing.html#Criticism" title="Predatory pricing">Predatory Pricing</a> article suggest, this area of law has become very tightly constrained, and these cases are rare.</dd>
