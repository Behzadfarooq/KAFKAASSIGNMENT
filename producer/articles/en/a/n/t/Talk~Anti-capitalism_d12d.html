<p>'Marxism is the foundation of several different ideologies, including communism and certain types of socialism.' Is this really so? Does it make chronological sense? There was communism before Karl Marx, e.g. the commune of Paris. Well, I'm not totally sure about this, so I won't alter the main page. publunch</p>

<p>Fascism is anti-liberal, anti-democratic and anti-capitalist. It places nation and race before profit, and forces capitalist to respect national interest before their private. That contrasts traditional conception of capitalism: no independent decisions, no free market, etc. And there were fascist who were in many ways similiar to socialists: for example <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Rohm_4877.html" title="Ernst Rohm">Ernst Rohm</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strasser_brothers.html" title="Strasser brothers">Strasser brothers</a>, national bolsheviks... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 83.131.252.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.131.252.127_5d07.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.131.252.127">contribs</a>) 13:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>You seem to be arguing that fascism is not capitalist, a point which is debatable. But you're not very well making the case that it is anti-capitalist. And it doesn't much matter even if a few fascists were anti-capitalist, because you could probably even more easily find some who weren't.

<dd>Nonsense. That would mean any system that is not <i>pure</i> libertarianism (the doctrine of "initiation of force" is fundamentally flawed, but that is anthother topic) is anti-capitalist. If it were true, then Ronald Regan, Yelstin Boris, and others are anti-capitalists. Utter nonsense. Fascists are against Lazziez-faire, but they are not "strict anti-capitalists." 72.139.119.165 01:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ideologies are not people, Ronald Reagan (from an Objectivist standpoint) would be anti-capitalist in trying to stop abortions, however he was pro-capitalist on a lot more other things. Fascism is strictly anti-Capitalist because it beleives in initiation of force, it is an ideology though. And it depends on definitons are too, I am an Objectivist along with LazloWalrus, when Objectivists talk about capitalism we mean it in the Laissez Faire way. So to us Capitalism=Laissez Faire, anti-Capitalism=anti-Laissez Faire, you say Fascists are against Laissez Faire, so from our definition they are against Capitalism and strictly anti-Capitalist.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, at least 99.9% of people are not objectivists. Second, capitalism is not only Laissez Faire, it includes any system were most of the means of production are privatly owned. 72.139.119.165 20:52, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are right 99.9% of people are not objectivists. For the second, Then you could say socialism isn't antifascist.</p>

Is there any denying that it is opposed to laissez faire with its regulation of the economy and government intervention?

<dd>The U.S. is capitalism and it is generally laissez-faire. What interventionist measure do exist in the US such as some minor protectionism such as subsidies to farmers, a welfare system, are to the credit of the fascist model.

<p>I disagree that "it is only a minority" who say fascism is anti-capitalist, but that is besides the point: you concede that there is a point of view that views fascism as anti-capitalist, and that point of view needs inclusion in the article. How is fascism anti-capitalist? Look it up: several sources meeting <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> are cited. State control of the economy and wages, as Mussolini did in Italy, is anti-capitalist. Private property existed only at the will of the state. If you're defining "capitalism" as solely "market economy, supply and demand, with mostly private property," then virtually none of the entries in the article apply: how is "social democracy" "anti-capitalist" by that definition? -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 13:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines capitalism as "Capitalism generally refers to an economic system in which the means of production are mostly privately[1] owned and operated for profit, and in which distribution, production and pricing of goods and services are determined in a largely free market." Note the aspect "free market." That is exactly what fascists were against. They were against <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_liberalism.html" title="Economic liberalism">economic liberalism</a>. If the market is not free but controlled by the state to serve national interests then it's not capitalism. It is what's known as a "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>" or "<a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirigisme.html" title="Dirigisme">dirigisme</a>." <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 14:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Fascism being the extreme expression of middle-classism or populism...also may be described as the extreme expression of socialism...The basic ideology of the middle class is populism...their idea was an independent small property owning class consisting of merchants, mechanics, and farmers.

<p>I think we should keep the section von Mises's criticism; while it's not the best quotation from Mises attacking anti-capitalism, Mises is one of the most famous and influential twentieth centruy economists and defenders of capitalism. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 03:43, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is a question of nautrality. Are we to maintain the rules of nautrality given by the Wikipedia guidelines, or are we to turn this page into a haven of opinion? I say we play by the rules, we owe the readers this much.</p>
<p>The criticism section was ambiguious, poorly worded, and is based largely on individual speculation. The phrase "Anti-capitalism is a result of frustrated ambition..." is a phrase that sounds more like a defense mechanism than a critical analysis that carries logical merit. A phrase along the lines of "It is believed that Anti-capitalism fails to address the issue of [.....], and fails to take into account that [.....]," would be more appropriate, and therefore, it would eliminate the need for a reference to Von Mises, who explained little more than that people who oppose capitalism are "just jealous...". This is an encyclopedia, not a political opinion forum.</p>
<p>Until the criticism section is corrected to conform to neutrality and logic, I will continue to keep it off this article, I will also dispute the neutrality of the revisions if necessary. Again, we owe this to our readers.</p>

<dd>I agree. This article needs a criticism section, but should probably contain actual arguments instead of simple mudslinging. I don't think what Mises had to say even qualifies as criticism, because criticism requires a degree of argumentation. This is simply an opinion or a commentary. If the section were called commentary, at least it would be in the right place. But I don't think simple commentary is particularly relevant here. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that that particular quote doesn't provide any information about anti-capitalism itself; it is just Mises' speculations about the motiviations of the people who embrace it.

<dd>Ecofeminism is not a minor movement, even if it is in contrast to some others listed here. But that only means that more political perspective needed to be added. It certainly belongs here more than fascism, which does not even cite a source claiming it is anti-capitalist, and is generally interpreted to be exactly the opposite. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:41, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article says <i>most notable</i>; ecofeminism is not one of the most notable criticisms of capitalism by anyone's account.

<p>Is it just me, or is the Judaism item a bit weird?</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> has always had a tense relation to capitalism, notable in the number of secular Jews attracted to the socialist and communist movements."</p>
<p>This is much too short in itself, secularist Jews are hardly speaking on Judaism's take, not to speak of traditonal Jewish involvement in banking etc. Hence the tag, which should be understood more as a clean-up tag. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 07:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Although there has been a large Jewish presence in anti-capitalist movements, this involvement has traditionally been a secular, ethnic group orientation rather than a religious one. The statement appears to confuse Jews as an ethnic group with Judaism as a religion. It's awkward at present how it lists a secular Jewish position under a list of religious attitudes towards capitalism. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 07:48, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't get me wrong. Even secular Jews might be influenced by tenets of Judaism. There is a anti-usury strain in Judaism (the same as in Christianity and Islam). So what the passage says is correct, but is a highly selective choice of reality. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:05, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right, but it needs to explain just what in Jewish teachings influences that perspective. Otherwise it's not clear how much of it is the result of ethnic values and how much is a result of religious teachings. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 18:48, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've removed the Judaism section for two reasons: 1) it is uncited; 2) it conflates Jews qua ethnic group with Jews qua religious group; the fact that many secular people of Jewish background have been drawn to anti-capitalistic movements says nothing (except perhaps in a very tenuous way) about the influences of the religion of Judaism on anticapitalism. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 19:06, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is only a reference to Guerin himself, not to some text that points out that other Marxist theorists share the view of Guerin. Therefore the text is weasily right now.

<dd>All other sentences in that paragraph are supported by one specific author; if we were to apply your principles neutrally and universally, the paragraph would look like this:
<dl>
<dd>According to Calvin B. Hoover, Fascism rejects laissez-faire capitalism and calls for some regulation of corporations and industry in order to serve the national or racial interest. Frank Bealey claims that fascists were particularly vocal in their opposition to finance capitalism, interest charging, and profiteering. Fascists, such as Adolph Hitler, claimed to uphold private property - including private property over productive capital and the means of production - but, according to Richard Allen Epstein, said that property was to be regulated to ensure that "benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual." Peter Davies and Dereck Lynch argue that fascist movements have regarded themselves as representing a "third way" between Marxian socialism and capitalism. Marxist historian Daniel Guerin rejects this self-characterization, arguing that fascism is a form of government control instituted to protect capitalism during a period of crisis or revolution.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If that is what you wish, I will be happy to oblige, but I think the current version is better. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, I still do not see the relevance of Pollock's view on Stalin to Guerin's view of fascism. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 23:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't have so much trouble with the Guerin piece if the reference came from a peer reviewed journal, because then you could generalize somewhat. Guerin is claiming that the policy of fascist Italy was not anti-capitalist. Pollock is claiming that the policy of Stalinist Soviet Union was not anti-capitalist. See a connection? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntangible2.0_b6a2.html" title="User:Intangible2.0">Intangible2.0</a> 00:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I do, but it is a POV connection. Unless I am very much mistaken, you are trying to imply that Marxists are not a reliable source of information on what is or is not anti-capitalism because some Marxists have made claims which you believe to be outlandish - such as that the USSR was not anti-capitalist. Such a view would be biased twice; first, because it is trying to imply that Marxists are not to be trusted. Second, because it is based on the premise that the USSR was, in fact, anti-capitalist (which is a POV like any other, no matter how obvious it may seem to you). But perhaps I am completely off base and your connection is something else entirely.</dd>
<dd>Now, as to the peer-review objection, none of the other references come from journals as far as I can see. But I could always look up the "fascism" entry in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia if you wish. That <i>is</i> a peer-reviewed source (though you may not agree with the reviewers). -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 01:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I oppose this. It is not really relevant to a single paragraph on Marxism as anti-capitalism. Lots of Marxists have lots of diferent views on this. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 14:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing to point out that there is disagreement about whether various regimes identified with Marxism actually abolished capitalism; but I don't think there's widespread disagreement that <i>Marxism</i> (or communism, for that matter) is anti-capitalist (people who believe the USSR was state-capitalist also deny that it was properly Marxist, AFAIK). <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 06:59, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
