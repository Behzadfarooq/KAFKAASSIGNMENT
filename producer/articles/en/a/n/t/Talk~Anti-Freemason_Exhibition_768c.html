<p>These postal stamps are readly availabe through public auctions and ebay and they are not that rare. Also these stamps have appeared in a number of books on antisemitsm, encyclopedias, and are quite common out there. There is no claimant on the copyright of these stamps, and as fair use under the US copyright legisation the scans of these stamps can be used in the wikipedia.This holds for the poster image as well FrontLine 12:48, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nazi Germany occupied most of Yugoslavia by April 1941. After a Serbian uprising of July 1941, Gen. Hermann Bohme, was given emergency powers to govern the country. SS - Gruppenfuhrer Harold Turner and SS Untersturmfuhrer Fritz Stracke handled the administration of Serbia. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Nedic_8ccd.html" title="Milan Nedic">Milan Nedic</a> was the "nominal" local ruler, comparable to the collaborationist regime of <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quisling.html" title="Quisling">Quisling</a> in Norway.</p>
<p>While Nedic cooperated with the German plans for extermination of the Jews, Serbian partisan groups often tried to save Jews from victimization. The history of this period is complex, filled with mutual accusations regarding the role of perpetrators and rescuers.</p>
<p>The central theme was an alleged Jewish-Communist-Masonic plot for world domination, similar to propaganda once put out by the Tsarist secret police before the Russian revolution in the well-known forgeries <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>. Besides the exhibits at the exhibition, an enormous amount of propaganda material was prepared: over 200 thousand various brochures, 60 thousand posters, 100 thousand flyers, 108 thousand of samples of 9 different types of envelopes, 176 propaganda movie clips, four different postage stamps etc. Organizers advertised that "This concept of exhibition will be unique not only in Serbia and the Balkans, not only in southeastern Europe and Europe, but in the world."</p>
<p>The images on the posters shown in the exhibition were hardly new, and had been seen before in Germany during "The Eternal Jew" exhibitions in Munich and Vienna during 1937-1939. Serbian newspapers such as Obnova (Renewal) and Nasa Borba (Our Struggle) praised this exhibit, proclaiming that Jews were the ancient enemies of the Serbian people and that Serbs should not wait for the Germans to begin the extermination of the Jews. A few months later, Serbian authorities issued postage stamps commemorating the opening of this popular exhibit. These stamps, which juxtaposed Jewish and Serbian symbols (but did not contain Nazi symbols), portrayed Judaism as the source of world evil and advocated the humiliation and violent subjugation of Jews. The 20 posters shown here give a sense of the vile flavor of the exhibition and the theme of Jewish domination. Of special interest is the material showing alleged Jewish domination of the American Press and "Finance," particularly control of The New York Times.</p>
<p>While the Nedic regime was collaborationist, the Serbian people as well as the resistance fighters suffered severe reprisals. Dr. Michael Phayer, in his recent book, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Involvement_of_Croatian_Catholic_clergy_with_the_Usta%C5%A1a_regime_03df.html" title="Involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustaša regime"><b>The Catholic church and the Holocaust</b></a>, 1933-1965 (Indiana University Press), asserts there were three genocides during WW II:</p>

<li>Croatia under the Ustashe against Serbs.</li>
<li>Germany against Poles.</li>
<li>The Holocaust against all Jews instigated by Germany and carried out by Germans, their allies and collaborationist regimes.</li>

<p>This article would lead one to believe that Germans were entirely responsible for the exhibition; in fact, however, the exhibition was first suggested by a Serb, Ðorðe Perić, and financed by the city of Belgrade. Responsible for the overall organization of the exhibit were government propagandists Stevan Klujić and Lazar Prokić. The section of the exhibition dealing with jews was prepared by Momčilo Balić, himself a propagandist and contributor to Naša Borba. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihovil_1a43.html" title="User:Mihovil">Mike</a> 02:48, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
