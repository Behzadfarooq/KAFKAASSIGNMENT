As stated in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> Guide to Passion Plays, "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept... that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus.

<p>Among socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to the Jews, pushing them into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Moneylending.html" title="Moneylending">moneylending</a>, tolerated then as a "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_ends_justify_the_means.html#necessary_evil" title="The ends justify the means">necessary evil</a>". Catholic doctrine of the time held that lending money for interest was a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>, and forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, Jews dominated this business. The <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> and later sections of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> criticise <a href="../../../u/s/u/Usury.html#Biblical" title="Usury">Usury</a> but interpretations of the Biblical prohibition vary. Since few other occupations were open to them, Jews were motivated to take up money lending. This was said to show Jews were insolent, greedy, <a href="../../../u/s/u/Usury.html" title="Usury">usurers</a>, and subsequently lead to many negative stereotypes and propaganda. Natural tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could personify them as the people taking their earnings while remaining loyal to the lords on whose behalf the Jews worked.</p>

<p>On many occasions, Jews were accused of a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>, the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>.

The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk.

<p>The story of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Norwich_7191.html" title="William of Norwich">William of Norwich</a> (d. 1144) is the first known case of ritual murder being alleged by a Christian <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a>, while the story of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Saint_Hugh_of_Lincoln_3e9a.html" title="Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln">Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln</a> (d. 1255) said that after the boy was dead, his body was removed from the cross and laid on a table.

The story of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_of_Trent_c456.html" title="Simon of Trent">Simon of Trent</a> (d. 1475) emphasized how the boy was held over a large bowl so all his blood could be collected.

The cult of Simon was disbanded in 1965 by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_VI_4529.html" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a>, and the shrine erected to him was dismantled. He was removed from the calendar, and his future veneration was forbidden, though a handful of extremists still promote the narrative as a fact.

<p>Jews were subject to a wide range of legal restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghettos.html" title="Ghettos">ghettos</a>, and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own, were forced to swear special <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath_More_Judaico_2dcf.html" title="Oath More Judaico">Jewish Oaths</a>, and suffered a variety of other measures, including restrictions on dress.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Lateran_Council_07dd.html" title="Fourth Lateran Council">Fourth Lateran Council</a> in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews. It could be a coloured piece of cloth in the shape of a star or circle or square, a hat (<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judenhut.html" title="Judenhut">Judenhut</a>), or a robe. In many localities, members of the medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild.html" title="Guild">guild</a> members) were prestigious, while others ostracised outcasts such as <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprosy.html" title="Leprosy">lepers</a>, reformed <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heretics</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitutes</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusades</a> were a series of several military campaigns sanctioned by the Papacy that took place during the 11th through 13th centuries. They began as Catholic endeavors to recapture <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> from the Muslims but developed into territorial wars.</p>
<p>The mobs accompanying the first three Crusades, and particularly the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Crusade_7946.html" title="People's Crusade">People's Crusade</a> accompanying the first Crusade, attacked the Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and put many Jews to death. Entire communities, like those of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treves.html" title="Treves">Treves</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speyer.html" title="Speyer">Speyer</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worms%2C_Germany_b18a.html" title="Worms, Germany">Worms</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayence.html" title="Mayence">Mayence</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, were slain during the first Crusade by a mob army. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July, 1096. Before the Crusades the Jews had practically a monopoly of trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of merchant traders among the Christians, and from this time onward restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent. The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against the Jews as against the Muslims, though attempts were made by bishops during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_crusade.html" title="First crusade">First crusade</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papacy.html" title="Papacy">papacy</a> during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Crusade_dfbe.html" title="Second Crusade">Second Crusade</a> to stop Jews from being attacked.

<p>The practice of expelling the Jews accompanied by confiscation of their property, followed by temporary readmissions for <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ransom.html" title="Ransom">ransom</a>, was utilized to enrich the French crown during 12th-14th centuries. The most notable such expulsions were: from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Augustus_of_France_bfad.html" title="Philip Augustus of France">Philip Augustus</a> in 1182, from the entirety of France by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_IX_of_France_d189.html" title="Louis IX of France">Louis IX</a> in 1254, by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_IV_of_France_3de4.html" title="Charles IV of France">Charles IV</a> in 1306, by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V_of_France_649f.html" title="Charles V of France">Charles V</a> in 1322, by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_VI_of_France_9bd5.html" title="Charles VI of France">Charles VI</a> in 1394.</p>
<p>To finance his war to conquer <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I of England</a> taxed the Jewish moneylenders. When the Jews could no longer pay, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, the Jews saw Edward abolish their "privilege" to lend money, choke their movements and activities and were forced to wear a <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_badge.html" title="Yellow badge">yellow patch</a>. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested, over 300 of them taken to the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a> and executed, while others killed in their homes. <i>See also:-<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_England_9b54.html#Massacres_at_London_and_York_.281189_.E2.80.93_1190.29" title="History of the Jews in England">Massacres at London and York (1189 – 1190)</a>.</i> The complete banishment of all Jews from the country in 1290 led to thousands killed and drowned while fleeing and the absence of Jews from England for three and a half centuries, until 1655, when <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> reversed the policy.</p>
<p>In 1492, <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon_07a3.html" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_of_Castile_aac9.html" title="Isabella of Castile">Isabella of Castile</a> issued <i>General Edict on the Expulsion of the Jews</i> from <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> (<i>see also <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a></i>) and many <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi.html" title="Sephardi">Sephardi</a> Jews fled to the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, some to the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Kingdom of Portugal</a> followed suite and in December 1496, it was decreed that any Jew who did not convert to Christianity would be expelled from the country. However, those expelled could only leave the country in ships specified by the King. When those who chose expulsion arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion, and promises in order to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This period of time technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as "New Christians" or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marranos.html" title="Marranos">Marranos</a>, and they were given a grace period of thirty years in which no inquiries into their faith would be allowed; this was later to extended to end in 1534. A popular riot in 1504 would end in the death of two thousand Jews; the leaders of this riot were executed by Manuel.</p>
<p>In 1744, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_II_of_Prussia_4cf3.html" title="Frederick II of Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a> limited <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breslau.html" title="Breslau">Breslau</a> to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged similar practice in other <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussian</a> cities. In 1750 he issued <i>Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft</i>: the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin" (quoting <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Dubnow_31a4.html" title="Simon Dubnow">Simon Dubnow</a>).

This <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extortion.html" title="Extortion">extortion</a> was known as <i>malke-geld</i> (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son.
