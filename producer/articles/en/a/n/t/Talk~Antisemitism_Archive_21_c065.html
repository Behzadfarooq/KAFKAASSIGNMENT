<p>I've archived the rest of the discussion. Not only is it wholly unproductive, it's utterly inappropriate, since NONE of what's been discussed in the past 5 days has <i>anything</i> to do with the article, rather it's almost <i>all</i> been about 1 particular user's antisemitism. This page is for discussing the <b><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a></b> ARTICLE, <i>not</i> about discussing the rationales or excuses or whatever that <i>drive</i> anti-semitism. Please note: the article does not discuss hairbrained ideas for what "causes" antisemitism, it merely describes the phenomenon. For the pathology, please argue at <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_disorder.html" title="Psychological disorder">psychological disorder</a> or whereëver such discussion is appropriate. It <i>categorically</i> is not appropriate here. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 04:31, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tomer,</p>
<p>ROTFLMAO! One user's 'anti-semitism'? What a cop out. So pray tell me, what exactly made those comments anti-semitic? Was it because something was said that a Jew didn't like? My comments by the way are wholly appropriate and were a directed critique OF THE ARTICLE.</p>
<p>I've continually made the case that the article is completely faulty in not explaining that as 'anti-semitism' stands now, there is (a) no objective criteria, (b) there is no objective adjudicative framework or process nor is there an discussion on (c) who the final arbiters of what is and isn't anti-semitism is.</p>
<p>Moreover, the article should mention that if something said about a Jew is TRUE, it can NEVER be anti-semitic.</p>
<p>Without these acknowledgements, the article is immensely flawed and anyone who thinks otherwise is mentally feeble or intellectually dishonest.</p>
<p>I know, I know, we all really know what anti-semitism is, just don't let the Gentiles know. Anti-semitism is anything that a Jews deems it to be . And normally that occurs if a Jew thinks the comments/actions/thoughts speak unfavorably of a Jew no matter how true they are. The perfect example I presented was Jews cursing Mel Gibson's wonderful film "The Passion of Christ" as 'anti-semitic'. Another examples is Israel and World Jewry cursing the Pope as 'anti-semitic' for speaking ill of Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>The funniest thing about 'anti-semitism' is that without or even the baseless charges of it, the entire World Jewish community would be weaker. Now it is an emotional kneejerk rallying cry, just like the Jewish College Professor from San Dimas, California that is now in prison for faking a hate crime where she said, "Neo-Nazi's vandalized her car".</p>
<p>The problem she faced was that her students saw her smashing her own car and spray painting "Kike!" on it.</p>
<p>Back to the main point. Are we going to fix the defects of this article or just continue ignoring the elephant in the room?</p>

I want a discussion on the following to be added to the article. This is common sense.</p>
<p>For something to be characterized as 'anti-semitism' or 'anti-anything' it must first be UNTRUE. If it is TRUE than it can't be 'anti-anything' let alone 'anti-semitic'.</p>
<p>Further, to characterize something as anti-semitism/anti-semitic, we must establish (a) an objective criteria, (b) an objective adjudicative framework or process and determine (c) who the final arbiters of what is and isn't anti-semitism is.</p>
<p>I've been told I need to reference a book to make this case but how can you reference what is obvious logic -- perhaps an undergraduate Business Law 101 book.</p>
<p>Without those three components AND a defense of "truth" the article is flawed and that should be mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>Without these acknowledgements, the article is immensely flawed and anyone who thinks otherwise is mentally feeble or intellectually dishonest.</p>
<p>Thoughtful, logical comments? Or just more obfuscation?</p>

<dd>I wasn't going to reply, but then Tomer had to jump in, so I couldn't resist. You have brought up three issues of fact that you had with the article, all of which are not in the article:&#160;: (1) The <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passion_of_the_Christ_08c5.html" title="Passion of the Christ">Passion of the Christ</a>, which the article does not call antisemitic (2) Complaints about Palestinians and the Pope, which is not in the article, and (3) Some false allegation of antisemitism by someone who isn't Jewish, which you blamed on the Jews, and which is not in the article. You have no factual arguments with the events described in the article and you seem to not show the slightest embarassment at being repeatedly incorrect. Usually people get bored by now... so, to all the other editors, can we please stop responding and get back to more interesting hobbies? --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Goodoldpolonius2,</p>
<p>I clearly stated my thesis - see the 4 points above (objective criteria, adjudicative framework/process, determination of final arbiters, truth as the ultimate defense to charges of 'anti-semtism').</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this was lost on you or you couldn't keep up. As far as the discussion on the Passion goes, that was simply to illustrate the above 4 points to demonstrate with empirical evidence why the 4 points are so crucial to determine what is anti-semitic and when it occurs.</p>
<p>Further, the Passion is just one example among many that prove my statement that often times (perhaps more often than not), 'anti-semitism' is simply anything that a Jew finds offensive or paints Jews in a bad light even if it is true. Again, I'm sorry this was lost on you or you couldn't keep up with the argument. Four points and empirics. Shouldn't be that hard.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">ECRI definition</span></h3>
<p>the definition used by the European Commission on Racism and Intolerance, which is part of the European Union, available here: <a href="http://usahm.de/Dokumente/ANTISEMITISM17050.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://usahm.de/Dokumente/ANTISEMITISM17050.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>:</p>
<p>ECRI, January 28, 2005 The purpose of this document is to provide a practical guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.</p>
<p>Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and / or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.</p>
<p>In addition, such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong”. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.</p>
<p>Contemporary examples of anti-Semitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.</li>
<li>Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as a collective – such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.</li>
<li>Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagines wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, of even for acts committed by non-Jews.</li>
<li>Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).</li>
<li>Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.</li>
<li>Accusing Jewish Citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the ways in which anti-Semitism manifests itself with regard to the State of Israel taking into account the overall context could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Denying the Jewish people right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor.</li>
<li>Applying double standards b requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.</li>
<li>Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.</li>
<li>Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.</li>
<li>Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow. This definition of antisemitism is rather intense! I will note however that no where in this definition is there anything in specific about taking political action to ban Jewish practices (like circumcision) for ethical reasons. Nevertheless, such people have been accused of antisemitism and there is certain anxiety within such groups of being labeled this way. It is interesting that <i>reasonable</i> criticism of Israel is the only given example of a limitation in the definition. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 00:53, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Helen Fein definition</span></h3>
<p>The EUMC and a large number of other sources site Helen Fein's (CUNY) definition: "A persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions – social or legal discrimination, political mobilisation against the Jews, and collective or state violence – which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Dietz Bering definition</span></h3>
<p>Another common definition is Dietz Bering (Univ. of Cologne), who works from Prof. Fein's definition: "A summary of anti-Semitic belief is:) Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective.</li>
<li>Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies.</li>
<li>Jews bring disaster on their “host societies” or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Causes of Antisemitism</span></h2>
<p>If I'm reading one of Tomer's posts correctly, he's trying to tell us that an article on antisemitism is <i>not</i> an appropriate place to discuss the causes of antisemitism. Is this logical? When I look something up in an encyclopia do I not expect an explaination on thinking around the causes if applicable and even a history of such theories? Wikipedia is not a dictionary. It is supposed to be more indepth than a simple definition of a phenoma. If there is a page I don't know about for the causes of antisemitism please tell me. Otherwise explain why theories about the causes don't belong here? Is it because the best theories on the subject are distasteful to Tomer? Isn't that against the policy of using wikipedia as a soap box? <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 02:37, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sirkumsize, I think this article does discuss the causes of anti-semitism. It is clear, however, that you are referring to your thesis that the root cause of anti-semitism is repulsion towards the practice of circumcision. You have not adequately proved that point, and every article I have read about any such link between circumcision and anti-Semitism mentions circumcision as just one aspect of what made the Jew different,and therefore an "Other" in many societies - nowhere is it listed as a primary cause.</dd>
<dd>For example, in Gilman's <i>The Jew's Body</i>, the author has chapters on racial anti-Semitism and its emphasis on many other aspects of Jewish physical difference, real or imagined; including feet, noses, voice, and propensity for disease. Francis Galton, the founder of eugenics, thought that the eyes of Jews were "the sign of their difference, their potential pathology," for example. Freud certainly thought that circumsicion created castration anxieties, but he considered the primary cause of anti-Semitism deicide, and secondary causes the continued persistance of Jews, Jewish seperation from gentile societies, finally writing, in <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>, "The hatred of Jews is at the bottom the hatred of Christians."</dd>
<dd>I am not supporting any of these interpretations of anti-Semitism, as my personal preference is not semiotics or psychoanalysis, but I am pointing out that the circumcision thesis is not a primary one in the literature that deals with such matters. I understand that it is your theory, but it seems marginal in the literature, or even original research. It also lacks a consensus on this page, even more importantly. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 03:31, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nah. What Sirkumsize is talking about <i>now</i> is my assertion that Kevin MacDonald's crackpot theories don't warrant inclusion here because the article isn't a discussion about the causes of antisemitism. The article is <i>not</i> a discussion about the causes of antisemitism, it's a description of antisemitism and tangible evidence of the pathology throughout recorded history, the impact it's had on various Jewish communities, the manifestations of antisemitism, and so on, but the main focus of the article is <i>not</i> on "causes" of antisemitism, especially not on crackpot theories about evolution (which is actually in itself a condescension to the rest of humanity, and simultaneously an excuse for rampant stupidity) per MacDonald, nor on Sirkumsize' pathological obsession with his penis and his projection therefrom as a "primary cause" of antisemitism. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 04:58, August 3, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, okay. I would like to add that MacDonald does not in any way warrant a mention in this article, not just because of the focus of this article, but also because many, many scholars who we do not mention have dealt with the roots of anti-semitism, have theories are actually accepted by the academic community, and are not nearly as idiotic and neo-racist as those of MacDonald. If someone does start an article on the subject, I hope that the authors will do some reading on the generally accepted arguments, rather than just picking the most controversal and sketchy of all possible writers on the subject and blowing his contribution well out of proportion. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:11, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Goodoldpolonius2, I believe your assertion that my thesis about circumcision not being supported just isn't so. I've been doing some serious reading up on the subject and it is mentioned by many many authors since Freud. I am really really concerned by this communities apathy towards including it in the article. I think it is a reflection of our societies bias against taking the issue of male circumcision and its effects seriously. It also shows that this community is afraid of real academic discussion on the matter. I will also point out that I have had good references -- not just text -- that I added to this article deleted without provocation simply because they didn't sit well with Tomer's personal taste. Also I have been accused of personal attacks for the most minor infraction while you can see from above that its okay for Mr. Tomer to talk about my supposed obsession with my penis. What is with this double standard of conduct. A unattainably stricts standard for me and a second, rediculous loose one for Tomer. That's fair. I'll also note that the two words I added to the section on relgious antisemitism "or coincidental" were removed. I cannot even add two words to the article? Was there no consensus that political activities to ban circumcision -- a Jewish practice -- are coincidental and not related to antisemitism? Is it not clear yet that there is a problem here? <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 07:27, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we keep "passion plays have traditionally been used to incite hatred towards Jews" implies that a religious tradition of Christians (that is still popular to this day) was used mainly for hatred. Thus implying that Christians are indeed evil people. I can't deny that in the past some people may have used them to incite hatred. I mean, nowadays a lot of people use religion as an excuse to incite hatred towards blacks, jews, gays, muslims etc. However, the purpose of passion plays is to remind people about Jesus suffering (according to Christians beliefs) and not to avenge him or to blame anybody. Saying that because some have used it such different purposes contrary to the Christian belief of forgiveness not only does not make sense but is also a horrible generalization. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 20:07, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The anti-Semitic material is the charge of deicide against the Jews as a people, and their collective guilt for the death of Jesus. This has historical been a pretense for violence against Jews and anti-Semitism.

<dd>Vizcarra, your reversion criteria is totally ridiculous, this was not out of context at all, Christianity Today is obviously not calling for anti-Semitism, it is clearly saying that passion plays have been used to incite anti-Semitism historically, but that it shouldn't be used for that anymore. The second sentence you quote does not challenge Eliezer's position, it is the same position of the article itself, in fact, the next sentence begins "Now is the time for Christians to disavow the history of Passion-linked hatred" To quote the ENTIRE full last section of the article from <i>Christianity Today</i>:</dd>

<dd>The Pope may have had the Slovakian papal nuncio in mind when making his remarks about the "lulled consciences" during World War II. When asked in 1942 to intervene on behalf of Jewish children slated by the Nazis to be deported to concentration camps, the nuncio refused. "There is no innocent blood of Jewish children in the world. All Jewish blood is guilty. You have to die. This is the punishment that has been awaiting you because of that sin [of deicide]," he replied. Deicide, which means "to kill God," is the foremost "erroneous and unjust" interpretation of Scripture that has incited so much hostility. In Passion plays, a difficult forum for conveying the theological nuance of humanity's collective culpability, the Jews have often become an inviting target.</dd>

Inflamed by outlandish accusations, such as the claim that Jews killed Christian children and used their blood to make matzo bread for Passover, unruly gangs searched out Jews to kill and maim.</dd>

<dd>This style of pogrom dates back to the First Crusade. Until this point European Jews largely eluded organized violence, but marauding crusaders on their way to the Middle East in 1096 stopped to slaughter Jews in the Rhineland. One crusader's account recalls, "Behold we journey a long way to seek the idolatrous shrine and to take vengeance upon the Muslims. But here are the Jews dwelling among us, whose ancestors killed him and crucified him groundlessly. Let us take vengeance first upon them. Let us wipe them out as a nation."</dd>

<dd><b>Outbreaks of Christian anti-Semitism related to the Passion narrative have been so numerous and destructive that theologian and Holocaust survivor Eliezer Berkovits concluded, "the New Testament is the most dangerous anti-Semitic tract in human history."</b> But neither the New Testament nor The Passion of the Christ is about Jewish deicide or revenge. Each is about God placing the iniquities of us all on his one and only son, who suffered unspeakable brutality to redeem his estranged children. Now is the time for Christians to disavow the history of Passion-linked hatred and show Jews "how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ" (Eph. 3:18).</dd>

<p>This is silly. First, you are ignoring the article above, which you accused me of quoting out of context, and which was clearly in context. Now you are asking for other proof as well? Well, deicide was a common charge in pasion plays:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Deicide, which means "to kill God," is the foremost "erroneous and unjust" interpretation of Scripture that has incited so much hostility. In Passion plays, a difficult forum for conveying the theological nuance of humanity's collective culpability, the Jews have often become an inviting target." --Christianity Today</li>
<li>"The Jew, historically the object of derision and animosity, became the living incarnation of Satan. Holy Week, the week beginning with Palm Sunday and culminating with Easter, became a particularly dangerous time for Jews, as Christians perpetrated violence against Jews living in their communities. Given these developments, which, along with New Testament interpretations, were incorporated into the production of Passion plays, it is understandable that these plays evoked intense feelings of hatred by Christians toward Jews. Belief that the Jews killed Christ became translated into action against his killers. As Passion plays kindled latent rage about the supposed deicide by the Jews, they had an important role in perpetuating anti-Semitism. Since Passion plays historically have resulted in violence and negative attitudes towards Jews, we must be particularly careful in this time of increasing anti- Semitism to make sure that we do not continue or reinforce the mistake of blaming Jewish people for the death of Jesus." Boston College's A VIEWER’S GUIDE TO CONTEMPORARY PASSION PLAYS</li>
<li>The most pernicious aspect of Passion plays is the repetition of the charge of deicide, that is, that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. The charge of deicide lies at the core of Western antisemitism. The history of physical attacks on Jewish communities stemming directly from Passion plays is well documented. In the years since Rabbi Krauskopf wrote his book there have been significant advances in relations between Jews and Christians and some Christian communities have become aware that the Passion narrative has historically generated anti-Jewish sentiment and violence and are careful about how those narratives are presented in plays and in liturgy. <i>Judaism</i> Spring 2002</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the New Testament issue, I was simply quoting the article, and am happy to use the quote without the New Testament section, though this is a common view<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0710/p11s01-lire.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0710/p11s01-lire.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 22:55, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"deicide was a common charge in pasion plays" so is the charge that Jews are as a group guilty of deicide. But neither accusation is sustainable, no matter how old the accusations are.

<li>I don't know what you mean, but if you mean that deicide is false, well, I agree with you. But false doesn't mean people didn't believe it.

<li>I fail to understand how you are calling a straightforward answer a weasel word, the sentence couldn't be more clear, but you want other sources, howabout: "As the dramatic story of the trial, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus, the passion play has for centuries been powerful and popular entertainment - on stage and screen - in the Christian world. <b>But historically, productions have reflected negative images of Jews and the long-time church teaching that the Jewish people were collectively responsible for Jesus' death.

You never proved that historically passion plays blamed the Jews for deicide, only people's opinions, which can be biased. You can find quotes of people claiming men never landed on the moon, but that's rather a reason to say that historically it is believed that men never landed on the moon. You have to show more than people's opinion to prove something, otherwise you can only claim that some/many/several people think that.

Actually my understanding of the passion narratives in the new testaments and this is coming from a New Testament scholar is part historical and part theological glossing. We can certainly deduce that Jesus was tried and executed as a threat to Roman power in Jerusalem, (though what exactly is true or fabrication during the trial and execution is open to interpretation). We also have to mind the era when the gospels were written. They were written down about 30-40 years after Jesus, well the synoptics were and John 60-70. They were written in a time period when the cult of Christianity was growing and being persacuted themselves by not only Roman auhtorities (udring Nero-s reign) but also Jewish synagouge rabbis. John whose gospel is deemed the most anti-semitic of all was composed after the council of Jamnia which deemed christianity as a heresy and excommunicable, therefore leaving Christians out of the mix of being protected under the roman religious tolerance edicts of etablished religions. I believed the writer of John's gospel is reacting to the Jewish anti-Christian actions with his own anti-Jewish rhetoric. It was sort of a PR battle between the two faiths. The christians of this era were seeing jews as their main competitors and actual enemy. We all know that once the Christians became the majority and the tide of their power stem over. We must acknowledge that part of the anti-semiticism in the passion is reflected by Christian reaction to anti-christianity espoused by the  temple leadership and mostly by later Pharises rabbi leadshio after the fall of Jerusalem.

Saying "The French POPULACE openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps" is insulting and a caricature. You can say that the French State openly collaborate with the nazi: that's a fact accept by historians (Robert Paxton), and french autorities (Jacques Chirac made a speech where he recognize the responsability of France). You can describe the role of the administration, who made the files, of the police in the arrestation, of the SNCF, who made the transportations, and was paid for it, the denounciations&#160;: these persons represente certainly a lot of people, but you can't say it's the entire, or even the majority of the "populace".--Geremy78 14:44, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, you are absolutely correct. That the Vichy govt was complicit in helping the Nazis bring the Holocaust to fruition in Vichy France is a rather well-established historical fact. The first poll you referenced is quite encouraging, although I don't see what I'd call a very thorough discussion of the demographics of those polled, nor do I know anything about the polling company. The second link actually deals with the subject at hand, namely the increase in anti-semitic <i>acts</i>. I would propose the following rewording:

<dd>This removes the bit about French collaborating with the Nazis to "get rid of the Jews", not because it didn't happen, or because it wasn't prevalent, but because it's not particularly relevant. Until someone comes up with a scale to measure the extent to which the populace of each occupied country or region betrayed their Jewish neighbors to their deaths, it's best to not include it. Certainly the rate of betrayals in France was higher than in Holland, but the distribution was not "higher in France, lower in Holland", it just happened to be higher in some places in France. It also might be prudent to discuss somewhere that survey about the increase in antisemitic acts in France in the past few years, which the French government (or was it the EU?) suppressed, because it indicated that the vast majority of the perpetrators were Muslims. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:51, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Race Reality, I know your intentions are good, and you may very well be right. I have to point out, though, that it is a core wikipedia policy that it does not matter whether editors' beliefs are right or wrong. You may be right that this article is <i>lacking</i> certain content (since all wikipedia articles are works in progress, all are incomplete, though we do keep trying). But whatever toes in cannot be based on the knowledge or views of the editor to do so would violate our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. I urge you to read that policy and the NPOV policy carefully before continuing this discussion. The issue here is NOT whether a certain claim (about Blacxks, about Jews) is right or wrong. The question is, how to contribute to this article <i>without</i> violating our NPOV and NOR policies. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 20:10, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Race Reality, you can ask Jpgordon for evidence. Jpgordon can ask you for evidence. But neither of you can ask the NOI for evidence — that would constitute original research and thus violate our NOR policy. Again, the accuracy of your edit (the one Jayjg just reverted) is not the issue here. But your edit was editorializing and violated our NPOV and NOR policies. Please go over them carefully, then you can edit without getting into these kinds of conflicts with other editors. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 20:18, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ok I give up, this has crossed the line into the ridiculous. Someone else will deal with this, or not. And the correlation of my edits and Jayjg's reversions suggests this is just stalking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>that is clearly not what WP:NOR says. Someone needs to make Wikipedia:No original sentences And after that, we'll obviously need Wikipedia:No original phrases, because someone could get around the sentences policy that way. Or we could stop the transparent making of rules for individual cases.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And no, asking NOI for evidence would not be "original research". How else would someone support a statement about what the NOI's position is? I haven't done that, but now that you mention it, Someone should do that. Race Reality 21:19, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the 19th century papacy is certainly clearly anti-Semitic in the most direct way&#160;: Pope Pius VII (1800-1823) had the walls of the Jewish Ghetto rebuilt after the Jews were released by Napoleon, and it was maintained up to Pope Pius IX (1846-1878) who called the Jews "dogs," increased restrictions on them, and blamed them for the revolutions of 1848. I don't know as much about the 20th century, although the passivity of Pius XII in the face of the Nazis may deserve a mention. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 03:32, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, my response to Goodoldpolonius2: While there were certainly some actions that popes have taken that were anti-Semitic is a matter of fact. But, to say that "the 19th century papacy is certainly clearly anti-Semitic in the most direct way" is false. Here is an article, written by RABBI and HISTORIAN David G. Dalin, who wrote a book (The Myth of Hitler's Pope) critiquing the numerous errors of Kertzer's book, which I believe is where you get your sources. My second response is to Humus sapiens: I certainly agree that we should not delete facts of events that occurred, but we should not fail to mention the whole side of the story either. We must present what actually happened. While it may be difficult to do so in the article, it certainly is worth inserting cross references to the other article <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_opposition_to_anti-Semitism_05c5.html" title="Christian opposition to anti-Semitism">Christian opposition to anti-Semitism</a>, which will soon include references on the countless papal actions taken against anti-Semitism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On Deicide</span></h2>
<p>It may not have been a Papal announcement, but Church officials often taught that the Jews were collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. This was stated as early as Biship Melito of Sardis (d. 180) and repeated as late as 2000, when Vatican official Father Peter Gumpel, realator of the canonization of Pius XII said in two different interviews that "It is a fact that the Jews have killed Jesus. This is an undeniable historical fact." (Globe and Mail, March 18, 2000). We can make the language reflect this difference between official and actual policy, but even Caroll in <i>Constantine's Sword</i> (winner of the National Book Award) calls the charge of deicide "the ground of all Jew hatred" within the Church. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 03:47, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that the Jews did kill Jesus, but they alone did not kill him. All Christians, Catholics, and everybody is responsible for his death. Your quote by Fr. Gumpel does not prove that the Church "taught" that the Jews were "colllectively" or "permanently" responsible for the death of Jesus. Also, is one bishop representative of the whole Church? By no means! There have been lots of bad bishops, priests, and even a few popes. One statement from Bishop Melito doesn't prove anything. Also, you have not provided the quote from Bishop Melito, what exactly did he say? Constantine's Sword has many problems with it, the author has his own personal agenda of hatred against the Church. He chose only to research the point of view that supports his viewpoints, while ignoring all the other historical data that the Church was not anti-semitic. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 18:27, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I am interested in fairer phrasing, my main problem is that you CANNOT correctly say that the Church taught that the Jews were "collectively" or "permanently" responsible for the death of Christ. While, it is true that the Jews did kill Jesus, the Church holds that all Christians are responsible, not just the Jews. Let me clarify, I am not denying nor was not denying that the Jews did kill Jesus, BUT I am denying that they were "solely responsible" or "collectively" or "permanently" responsible, Christians are also responsible, so was Pontius Pilate. Sebastiankessel, I hold my view with Goodolpolonius2 on this matter about the Inquisition. Furthermore, no the charge that the Jews are solely responsible/collectively/permanently responsible CANNOT be found in any Catechism, nor in any Catholic doctrine. I suggest that you read what the Catechism says is a Church doctrine: "revealed teachings of Christ which are proclaimed by the fullest extent of the exercise of the authority of the Church's Magisterium. The faithful are obliged to believe the truths or dogmas contained in divine Revelation and defined by the Magisterium." Church doctrines are also infallible and usually established by either a Council or the Pope speaking ex cathedra. NOWHERE can it be found in Catholic doctrine that the Jews were "solely" or "collectively" or "permanently" responsible for the death of Christ. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 20:54, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Newcrusade writes, "BUT I am denying that they were "solely responsible" or "collectively" or "permanently" responsible, Christians are also responsible, so was Pontius Pilate." Well, okay. But so what? The views of editors are absolutely irrelevant to the article. The only thing that matters is that some people have either used the accusation of deicide to support anti-Semitism, or have claimed that other people were motivated by their belief that Jews killed Christ. And by "some people" we all know that this categorically <i>excludes</i> contributors to Wikipedia. None of our personal opinions are relevant to this discussion, SR</p>
<p>True, but WHERE is the evidence that members of the Church taught that the Jews were "collectively" or "permanently" or "solely" responsible? IT DOESN'T EXIST! It is not I who have to establish that the members of the Church never taught this, because how can I prove something that the Church never said? I don't have to, that's my point. Somebody has to prove that it DID teach that if you want to keep those words in the article. While, it may indeed be true that members did teach, this you need to provide concrete examples. However, I am satisfied that the article does mention that this idea of Jewish deicide was never a part of Church doctrine/dogma. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 03:15, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In order to keep the statement that Christians have held the Jews "collectively" responsible for the death of Jesus, you must have at least one statement that uses the word "collectively" from a Christian in the middle ages. But you have NONE! You cannot use statements that are not backed up with historical evidence. Unless you can provide evidence, the whole sentence about deicide must be deleted, because there is nothing anti-Semitc about the fact that the Jews killed Jesus. But, it would be anti-Semitic if you could find a statement from a Christian in the middle ages who said the Jews were either "collectively" or "permanently" or "solely" responsible for the death of Jesus.

<dd>It's a "historical fact" that the Jews killed Jesus? If the New Testament accounts are to be believed, it was the Romans who did it. As for collective responsibility, what was the 1965 Nostra Aetate decree if not a repudiation of that formerly commonly held belief? Even then it equivocated, stating that "neither all Jews indiscriminately at that time, <b>nor all Jews</b> today, can be charged with the crimes committed during his passion", implying that at least <b>some</b> Jews today can be charged with those "crimes". The church belief in collective and eternal Jewish guilt is ancient: for example, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a> (185 - 254 CE) stated: "The blood of Jesus falls not only on the Jews of that time, but on all generations of Jews up to the end of the world." <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:42, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jayjg, yes true the Romans did, but it was the Jews who chanted "crucify, him, crucify him." I don't think that Nostra Aetate was a repudiation of "that formerly commonly held belief." It is very questionable as to whether or not that belief was "commonly" held; I'm not aware of any statiscal studies that even existed from those periods. You have made an interesting point about the Vatican II document. It certainly does appear that it did equivocate on the use of the term "all." Perhaps, I need to clarify myself. When I say that it is a historical fact that the Jews killed Jesus, I agree with the document that the Jews of "today" are not responsible, but that some of the Jews back then were responsible to some degree. As for the quote from Origen: that certainly does support your point for several reaons. first, because the article about deicide was under the section about the middle ages. Origen was from hundreds of years before the middle ages. Origen is not a saint, and he alone definitely does not show that the "Christians" as a whole held that the Jews were "collectively" responsible. While, there certainly were some Christians who held this belief, the Origen quote neither proves that all Christians or most Christians have held this belief nor does it prove that this was the official teaching of the Church. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 15:36, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A few things of importance here - nobody is claiming that the Church is currently anti-Semitic, but, similarly, it is accepted by almost every source that the Church was historically widely anti-Semitic. We can look at <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">User:Newcrusade</a>'s own source, from Commonweal magazine above, which does indeed attack Carroll, but states "Constantine’s Sword is behind the curve of history. Had this book been written fifty years ago it would have been noteworthy. But its message has been heard, digested, and acted upon. And the new openness of the church to the Jews has led to a dramatic transformation of relations between Jews and Christians." This certainly does not absolve the Church of historical anti-Semitism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, from one of two most respected sociological journals in the world, the American Sociological Review (the other might be AJS) "Do Christian Beliefs Cause Anti-Semitism? Russell Middleton, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 33-52: <i>"Historians have made a convincing case that the Christian church was largely responsible for the development of anti-Semitism in ancient and medieval times (Parkes, 1934, 1962, 1963; Isaac, 1956, 1964; Simon, 1948; Trachtenberg, 1943). The evidence suggests that economic and other social factors were of relatively minor significance, at least initially. It was the theological picture of the Jew created in the New Testament, in the patristic literature, and in subsequent teachings of the church that apparently unleashed the virulent hatred and persecution of Jews in the western world."</i> Note that the current WP article on anti-Semitism does not go as far as repeating these ("largely responsible") results, or placing sole blame on the Church, but this does seem to represent scholarly consensus that is sourced and clear on the topic.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am all for adding balance to the article, and praised <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">User:Newcrusade</a> when he or she added in sourced opinions that contracdicted individual writers like Kurtzer, but the repeated deletion of well-documented history is more troubling. The Church had enlightened members, but it was also, historically, a font of anti-Semitism, though it is not today. This really seems supported across any range of sources. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 18:12, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To Humus sapiens: I'm not whitewashing history, i'm only acknowledging what really happened, namely that the Church WAS NOT anti-Semitic in its past. But, I don't like it when people try to paint the entire history of the Church as anti-Semitic. I realize that "Christian" does include other denominations, but I'm primarily concerned here with the Catholic Church, not other churches. To Goodoldpolonius, the Church WAS NOT a font of anti-Semitism, did you even read the article <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_opposition_to_anti-Semitism_05c5.html" title="Christian opposition to anti-Semitism">Christian opposition to anti-Semitism</a>? Also, just because it appears that "almost every source" says the Church was anti-Semitc doesn't make it true. What is popular is not always right. I doubt the findings of your ASR article, other historians would disagree. You cannot blame the Church for anti-Semtism, or say that it directly advocated it. OVERALL, though I am (at least for the time being) willing to compromise. I will allow Kertzer in the article so long as I can add sources that critique his position. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 02:00, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">User:Newcrusade</a>, thank you for your willingness to compromise. As an additional note, I did read <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_opposition_to_anti-Semitism_05c5.html" title="Christian opposition to anti-Semitism">Christian opposition to anti-Semitism</a>, and, while some Christians certainly spoke out and protected the Jews, there is also <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_anti-Semitism_d85d.html" title="Christianity and anti-Semitism">Christianity and anti-Semitism</a> and this article, which discuss the other side of the coin. All of my arguments are directly from authoritative sources, not some popular vote, and I think that I have always made it clear that I am more than willing to read any sources you might provide as counters. Anecdotes of Christians who spoke out against anti-Semitism, however, do not contradict the strong evidence that, as a whole, the church served as a source of anti-Semitism, but I would, again, be happy to read evidence to the contrary. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 02:14, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jayjg, while I do have other books that I highly suggest reading, I unfortunately do not have them on me right now (sorry). But, besides that I would like to note that the article about Christian opposition ot anti-Semitism is not merely anecdotal evidence. It is a preponderance of evidence, versus the little that is offered in the article of Christianity and anti-Semitism. All of those in the article about Christian opposition are from very authoriative sources, ones that are not nearly as controversial as the ones that you quote. In fact, I have not even heard of controversy regarding the works that are mentioned on that page. Mere statements of opinion by however many authors you want to quote do NOT surpass evidence that is quoted from PRIMARY documents (which is where a lot of those quotes came from...they came from an authoritative report, which quotes PRIMARY documents). While I certainly did not quote the actual words (because I can't translate Latin yet), they quote the summary of what the documents said. Just because the entries in the article are short for each document, doesn't mean you can dismiss it as anecdotal evidence. There are so many of these documents also! Do you know how many there are on that page? While you do provide some and while there certainly were some anti-Semite actions taken many of your sources are very questionable in authority, you quote/summarize opinions from the author, or it appears that some of the actions are taken out of the context of the historical period and thus possibly not anti-Semite. I merely want the truth, however I am willing to let you allow Kertzer to be mentioned in the article of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitismso</a> long as I can mention authors who critique him. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 00:59, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Etymology redux</span></h2>
<p>For the last couple days, a couple of anons and then <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> have been adding a new second sentence to the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It should be noted, however, that the term "<a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a>", refers to the people who have traditionally spoken <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_language.html" title="Semitic language">Semitic languages</a> or to things pertaining to them which would include Arabs, since <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> is the most widely spoken Semitic language.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pointing these editors to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html#Etymology_and_usage" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism#Etymology and usage</a> hasn't helped. I suggested discussing these changes on the talk page; I guess I'll start the discussion myself, since <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>, noting a revert war going on, properly has protected the article.</p>
<p>My question to Vizcarra et al is: why should this be the second sentence of the article? What information does it convey about Anti-Semitism? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:50, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Response to Etymology redux</span></h3>
<p>My answer to Jpgordon is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first sentence says <b>bold</b>ly that the term "is hostility towards or prejudice against Jews". Given the controversy about the correct use of term, then it should be noted.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>why should this be the second sentence of the article</i>", it doesn't have to be, it shouldn't be the first, but it should be in the introductory paragraphs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of them main functions of an introduction section is to engage the reader so they will be encouraged to read the entire writing. So, "having a section about etymology" doesn't prevent a writer to add the subject in the introduction. Especially, in this case, as it has been explained, rather extensively (and perhaps excessively so) about racial and religions anti-semitism, when "you" have a section about each topic.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Pointing these editors to Anti-Semitism#Etymology and usage hasn't helped.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It didn't help because the first time I noticed the remark was removed was because it was "wrong", I corrected it and the second time it wasn't wrong, but was removed because "we" have a section about it.</dd>
<dd>If you have several objections about content then it's better to note them individually, because the removal of my re-introduction of the "controversial" paragraph seemed to have had a different justification each time and different content each time. This would help prevent edit wars and silly locking (as opposed to "protecting") of pages. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 05:33, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It doesn't belong at all. It represents a recent attempt to change the meaning of the word -- a combination, perhaps, of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> and false revisionism, in proportions which depend upon the writer in question; that is, it's an error, whether deliberate or misguided. Some people who have attempted to add this claim before have been shown to have had ill intention towards this article; others seem simply to be misinformed.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the expression <i>antisemitism</i> was promulgated by Jew-haters to refer to their hatred and to cloak it in "scientific" (anthropological) terms; and that it has since then been used by both Jew-haters and their opponents (both Jewish and otherwise) to refer to this specific hatred and its history.</p>
<p>It is true that linguists call Arabic and Hebrew both "Semitic" languages, and that once upon a time anthropologists referred to "Semitic peoples", although this latter terminology is obsolete, along with the rest of racialist classification. Nonetheless, the linguist's use of the word "Semitic" does not change the fact that <i>antisemitism</i> has always referred specifically to antipathy towards, and discrimination and violence against, Jews.</p>
<p>Pick up a dictionary, dudes. Just because the English language would make more sense if <i>antisemitism</i> meant <i>antipathy towards "Semitic language" speakers</i> or some such, doesn't mean that it does. English is a nasty mess and has lots of confusions like this. There's no cock on a <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocklebur.html" title="Cocklebur">cocklebur</a>, and <i>antisemitism</i> means what it means, not that other thing. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 05:39, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Making the separation between <i>antisemitism</i> and the historical anthropological meaning of <i>Semitic</i> is part of the reason that many scholars choose to spell it "antisemitism" rather than "anti-Semitism", by the way. Besides the fact that "antisemitism" is closer to the orifinal German, it also emphasizes that antisemitism isn't <i>"opposition to 'Semitism'"</i> -- there isn't anything called <i>"Semitism"</i>. Rather, it's the belief system of (self-described) "antisemites"; that is, Jew-haters.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Cooling down?</span></h3>
<p>Ahem, sorry to barge in. It seems that we're letting religious and personal passions get involved here. I think we need to look at the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the word <i>Semitic</i> includes the arab people should be beyond discussion, the language classification alone makes it clear.</li>
<li>That the word <i>Anti-Semitic</i> therefore is meant to include the arabs too.</li>
<li>That the word <i>Anti-Semitic</i> is generally used against jewish people, regardles of their ethnicity (i.e.: Me being a jew of german descent, I really don't think I have a lot of semitic genes).</li>
<li>That this dychotomy may be confusing to some people.</li>
<li>That this is an encyclopedia after all, and we should be avoiding confusion not adding to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I propose leaving the paragraph on top of the article, since it adds clarification to the term and it really doesn't push any particular POV. Furthermore, we should also add a sentence explaining that even the term is meant to include Arabs (and other peoples too) it is mostly used in the sense we know.... although the rest of the article (and the first sentence) makes it plenty clear. Just my two cents... --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 15:54, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, S, you are just wrong. There are not¨"semetic genes" and the word "anti-Semitism" referst to hatred of Jews, period. I don´t like people who hate Arabs or Italians either, but that´s nopt anti-Semitism. SR
<dl>
<dd>SR, sorry I didn't express myself correctly... People of middle-eastern ethnicity (and ethnicity is indeed determined by genes) sometimes are called 'Semites' or 'Semite Peoples', that's what I meant.</dd>
<dd>I agree with you on the widely accepted use of the word, but I feel that we should clarify a little more, for the sake of avoiding confusion. That clarification just doesn't take anything away from the explanation or meaning.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, please don't write things like "you're just wrong", it feels rude (at least to me). I understand we might see differently in this point and we can disagree ad-infinitum, but that's no reason to put somebody down like that.

<p>The issue of "antisemitism" and the word "Semite" is dealt with more than adequately in the <i>Etymology and usage</i> section of the article. It has also been dealt with time and time again in this talk page -- see several of the archives, which deal with it specifically. In short, it is not even a dead horse any more, but a vaguely horse-shaped smear on the ground.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate fact that many of the people <i>(not necessarily the Wikipedia contributors!)</i> who push the "anti-Arabism is antisemitism" meme are doing so in (what I would regard as) a dishonest manner. They go on to try to claim that "Israel is antisemitic" for having fought wars against Arab nations, for instance ... or that "Palestinians can't be antisemitic, because they're Semites" -- in direct contradiction (or ignorance) of some of the Palestinian Authority propaganda that makes use of some of the vilest antisemitic images seen since the defeat of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: I'm neither a Jew nor a supporter of Zionism, but I thoroughly detest antisemitism.)</p>
<p>If anything needs to be done in this regard, it is to post a notice on this talk page, similar to the one on the page for <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_7e23.html" title="Talk:Gdansk">Talk:Gdansk</a>, making it clear that misusing the terminology is not OK. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 17:01, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree with all of your points above, the only one I am trying to make is that a simple aclaratory sentence doesn't prejudice the reader for or against any explanation, just makes the text richer and accurate.</dd>
<dd>I felt a little defensive after your reply (it's probably me, since it's the 2nd time I feel this way today) so I feel compelled to say that I am indeed Jewish and abhor antisemites, regardless of what 'semite' might mean. Two of my grandparents spent years in Auschwitz, and from them I learned that hate is inhuman regardless of who is directed at. Ok, this has gone on waaaay too far.</dd>

<p>S, I apologize if I was rude. For what it is worth, ethnicity is not necessarily about genetics and often is not about genetics. I agree the article should be clear that anti-Semitism = hatred of Jews and not hatred of all or any other peoples who speak semetic languages, but I think the article conveys this and is better explained ijn the body.

<dl>
<dd>SR, no offense taken, it's the lack of ability to convey emotions that makes writing so ambiguous sometimes...

<p>Okay, so if I understand where we stand, there are at least a few people who feel that the term is confusing, and a clarifying sentence or phrase in the intro is in order. What sentence is being suggested currently? A disambig across the top stating "Anti-Semitism is the modern sense is not related to the outdated anthropological concept of Semitic races?" Or changing the first sentence to read "Anti-Semitism (alternatively spelled antisemitism) is hostility towards or prejudice against Jews (see entymology below for usage), which can range from individual hatred to institutionalized violent persecution, of which the highly explicit ideology of Adolf Hitler's National Socialism was the most extreme form." Or something else? I certainly don't think the most important thing about anti-Semitism is that it doesn't apply to Arabs, so, if we want to disambig, lets try to do it lightly. What are the proposals? I would like to see something concrete before discussing further. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 19:25, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, don't mind at all to have them!&#160;:). Jay, since "Anti-Semitic" has an obvious relationship to "Semitic", at least ethimologically speaking, I don't see the explanation to be redundant.

<dd>The point is that it is a sentence about a different topic. Though the words are etymologically related, the terms themselves are not. Antisemitism, for better or worse, is "Jew-hatred". For historical reasons this silly term is used, rather that the more accurate "Jew-hatred", but regardless it is still a word in its own right having nothing to do with "Semitic"; you might as well have an explanation of the meaning of the word "Anti" in there as well. The <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> page doesn't have an introductory sentence explaining the meaning of the term <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franks.html" title="Franks">Franks</a>, even though the source of the last name is etymologically related. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:17, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arabs are semites, and this needs detailed discussion (more than a sentance) because so many Jews hate arabs, and so many arabs hate jews, yet jews who hate arabs are essentially never labelled "anti-semites", but arabs who hate jews almost always are.

<dd>I am curious. It simply hadn't occurred to me that people might be familiar with the term "semite" before they are exposed to the term "antisemitism". Sam, was that your own experience? But more importantly: Gooldoldpolonius2 was (as he usually seems to be) very much on the right track with the minor edit he suggested above. I'd do it a little differently: <i>Anti-Semitism (alternatively spelled antisemitism; see <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html#Etylmology_and_usage" title="Anti-Semitism">below</a> for etymological issues)..."</i> Makes double use of the existing parentheses (they are, after all, a somewhat endangered species), and bundles the spelling issue with the etymological issue. Of course, this won't take care of the people who won't get as far as the first paragraph past the intro, and is perhaps redundant. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 01:41, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure, but I doubt it. My guess is I heard of anti-semitism long before I knew what a semite was (it gets far more airtime). To ad a fun twist, I know a Jewish lady who insists it is racist not to include anti-arabism under "antisemitism". She's also an anti-zionist, so go figure. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 13:14, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This last discussion left me a little shaken and full of self doubt. I pointed a co-worker of mine to the article. This guy is known among to be particularly naive and he's has expressed a lack of knowledge and experience of all things Jewish... To be put bluntly, to my standards, the guy has no clue. After reading the article I asked him a couple of questions, to gauge his impressions and reactions. It was clear to him what the article meant... entirely. If he has no problem getting it, I can't see who will...I stand back and corrected. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 23:04, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>S, thanks for putting it through this useful test. I don´t think anyone has questioned your intentions. But, picking up on earlier discussion, maybe you could work on the Semitic article. One of the whole pooints of an online encyclopedia is to take full advantage of links and hypertext, which allows people to leave the article to go in depth on a particular point. Let´s make sure linked articles are consistent with this one, and, where appropriate, offer information not directly relevant or relatively minor to this article. SR

<dd>How many, who are not familiar with Anti-Semitic do you really think will read the entire article? Most people don't read entire articles (including many editors), that is one of the reason wikipedia has a "Contents" section. Many people just read introductions and/or conclusions, hoping to find all relevant information there and if they are curious about a topic in particular they will be able to find more information about it. Although I once knew <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> meant to include Arabs as well, I forgot and since then I have always related Semitic to Jewish, especially because of the popularity of the term <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> which as "hate towards Jews" may cause many to think that Semitics are just Jews. I don't think that there should be much controvery about adding a note about the term semitic. Or we can just hope everybody will read the entire article and just forget about the introductory section. I would hope not. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 23:24, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

We cannot predict how each one will read it, nor can we cater to the learning-styles of each reader nor should we shoot for the lowest common denomenator. If someone doesn´t understand something, they can tell us why in the talk page or even suggest improvements — remember that this is a <i>wiki</i>pedia meaning <i>any</i>one can contribute, which means <i>none</i> of us has to anticipate how all others will read it.

<dd>Actually, we can predict how readers will read articles and how people will read website. These are topics that are part of the studies in Marketing, web-design, etc. There are even guidelines about color schemes, and content distribution. We don't have to cater the learning-styles of each reader but to the learning-styles of most readers. You cannot assume that people will read entire articles, and all published writers and editors know this, that is why "introductions", and abstracts were created. The problem with this article is that an important piece of information such as "anti-semitic is 'hate towards Jews' although 'semitics' are Jews, Arabs, etc." is lacking in the introduction. While it details some other topics. So one cannot be mentioned while others are detailed. Introductions should include all important points of the article, even though we have a section on ethymology, that section is not reflected in the introduction. We cannot assume that everybody who does not read the entire article and would instead read "anti-semitic is hate towards Jews" will take the time to edit the talk page. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 18:00, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that we need to be broad and not narrow in our style. Having said that, the meaning of the word is "hate agains Jews", period. I don't quite agree that the alternate meaning is of that much importance since I have never ever heard about anybody using anti-semitism to refer to Arabs. I think that your point is valid but in the end, I think its very clear that only Jews are included in the definition, since nobody else is mentioned. I just read the intro before answering and I think that the omission explains almost as much as if the mention was explicit. As I said before, if somebody is interested in the word <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semite.html" title="Semite">Semite</a>, they should go to its article. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 18:23, 12</dd>

<dd><i>The extreme section of the anti-Semites, who had given the movement its quasi-scientific name, declared that it was a racial struggle--an incident of a supposed eternal conflict between Europe and Asia--and that the anti-Semites were engaged in an effort to prevent the so-called "Aryan race" from being subjugated by a "Semitic" immigration, and to save Aryan ideals from being modified by an "alien and demoralizing oriental Anschauung". The Jews contended that this anti-Semitism was a mere atavistic revival of the Jew-hatred of the middle ages.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>There was and is no essential foundation for either of these contentions. Religious prejudices reaching back to the dawn of history were reawakened by the modern anti-Semitic agitation, but they did not originate it, and they have not entirely controlled it. The alleged racial divergence was, too, only a linguistic hypothesis on the physical evidence of which even contemporary anthropologists were not agreed (Topinard, Anthropologie, p. 444; Taylor, Origins of Aryans, cap. i.), and, even if it were proved, it had existed in Europe for so many centuries, and so many ethnic modifications had occurred on both sides, that it could not be accepted as a practical issue. It is true that the ethnographical histories of the Jews and the nations of Europe had proceeded on widely diverging lines, but these lines did more than once cross each other and become interlaced. Thus "Aryan" elements are at the beginning of both; European morals have been ineradicably semitized by Christianity, and the Jews have been Europeans for over a thousand years, during which their character has been modified and in some respects transformed by the ecclesiastical and civil polities of the nations among whom they have made their permanent home.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>[...]</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anti-Semitism was exclusively a question of European politics, and its origin is to be found, not in the long struggle between Europe and Asia, or between the Church and the Synagogue, which filled so much of ancient and medieval history, but in the social conditions resulting from the emancipation of the Jews in the middle of the 19th century.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If the emancipated Jews were Europeans in virtue of the antiquity of their western settlements, and of the character impressed upon them by the circumstances of their European history, they none the less presented the appearance of a strange people to their Gentile fellow-countrymen. They had been secluded in their ghettoes for centuries, and had consequently acquired a physical and moral physiognomy differentiating them in a measure from their former oppressors. This peculiar physiognomy was, on its moral side, not essentially Jewish or even Semitic. It was an advanced development of the main attributes of civilized life, to which Christendom in its transition from feudalism had as yet only imperfectly adapted itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The ghetto, which had been designed as a sort of quarantine to safeguard Christendom against the Jewish heresy, had in fact proved a storage chamber for a portion of the political and social forces which were destined to sweep away the last traces of feudalism from central Europe. In the ghetto, the pastoral Semite, who had been made a wanderer by the destruction of his nationality, was steadily trained, through centuries, to become an urban European, with all the entrepreneurial activities of urban economics, and all the democratic tendencies of occidental industrialism.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Excluded from the army, the land, the trade corporations and the artisan gilds, this quondam oriental peasant was gradually transformed into a commercial middleman and a practised dealer in money. Oppressed by the Church, and persecuted by the State, his theocratic and monarchical traditions lost their hold on his daily life, and he became saturated with a passionate devotion to the ideals of democratic politics. Finally, this former bucolic victim of Phoenician exploitation had his wits preternaturally sharpened, partly by the stress of his struggle for life, and partly by his being compelled in his urban seclusion to seek for recreation in literary exercises, chiefly the subtle dialectics of the Talmudists (Loeb, Juif de l'histoire; Jellinek, Der Jüdische Stamm).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Thus, the Jew who emerged from the ghetto was no longer a Palestinian Semite, but an essentially modern European, who differed from his Christian fellow-countrymen only in the circumstances that his religion was of the Semitic form, and that his physical type had become sharply defined through a slightly more rigid exclusiveness in the matter of marriages than that practised by Protestants and Roman Catholics (Andree, Volkskunde der Juden, p. 58).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Unfortunately, these distinctive elements, though not very serious in themselves, became strongly accentuated by concentration. Had it been possible to distribute the emancipated Jews uniformly throughout Christian society, as was the case with other emancipated religious denominations, there would have been no revival of the "Jewish question". The Jews, however, through no fault of their own, belonged to only one class in European society--the industrial bourgeoisie. Into that class all their strength was thrown, and owing to their ghetto preparation, they rapidly took a leading place in it, politically and socially. When the mid-century revolutions made the bourgeoisie the ruling power in Europe, the semblance of a Hebrew domination presented itself. It was the exaggeration of this apparent domination, not by the bourgeoisie itself, but by its enemies among the vanquished aristocratic reactionaries on the one hand, and by the extreme Radicals on the other, which created modern anti-Semitism as a political force.</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inserting POV commentary into direct quotes</span></h2>
<p>Why are people inserting commentary into direct quotes from the New Testament (i.e. the quote from John)? It's hard to understand how modifying direct quotes complies with policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:16, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I guess I'm confused here. The direct quote starts with "You are of your father the devil" (John 8:44); the "inserted commentary" preceding it is replacing "Jesus said to them", but that's back in John 8:42, so if the quote's supposed to be accurate it should read, "...Jesus said into them...'You are of your father'". Vizcarra is right in that it does appear to be the Pharisees who don't agree with him that are being addressed here. His phrasing is not quite right, though. And the point is that the way this verse is used, not what is actually meant -- so it doesn't really matter what may or may not have been said to whom. Perhaps the best solution is to simply remove the preface and start right off with the direct quote. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 18:25, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I understand your wanting to put the quotes in context, as an answer to those who find these passages antisemitic. But the better way to do that, since the paragraph is about identifying passages some construe as antisemitic, is to simply list them without commentary. Then in a followup paragraph, provide common arguments given (context, etc) that counter the idea that these passages were intended in an antisemitic way. That way we're not qualifying the POV of one side during the presentation of that POV, but presenting it honestly from that perspective. Then the followup should present the POV of the other side.

<li>We agree on balance. The better way, imo however, is to list the quotes directly without context, because the point is not to convince <i>the reader</i> to consider whether these passages actually <i>are</i> or <i>aren't</i> antisemitic; the point is to present which passages are seen to be anti-semitic from the POV of those who think they are. And it's often the case that people who interpret passages a certain way don't consider the context, indeed it may even be that many come to hasty conclusions about it precisely *because* they don't consider the context. This is why I think that presenting the context as part of the presentation of the POV describing which verses are seen as antisemitic is actually an obstacle, too much qualifying. We're not trying to present the "real meaning" of the verses, but rather the perception of people who interpret them negatively, which as I pointed out, doesn't necessarily take context into account. Where context should come in (I believe) is in the followup presentation of the POV that counters that these passages are not antisemitic (context in this case is part of the counter-POV argument). In summary, it should be presented this way: POV1 finds the passages x, y, z to be antisemitic; POV2 counters that these passages are not antisemitic because ...(1) context, (2) other reasons, etc. An analogous situation would be with Talmud quotes. Many nonJews take offense by certain verses in the Talmud (and similarly, many nonMuslims take offense by certain passages in the Koran). If I were to neutrally present this, I would use the same formula I gave above. Any contextualizing would happen in the counter POV, because people offended may not be (and in fact are likely not) considering the context, just basing perceptions on the direct text. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 23:14, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Presenting context does not have the purpose of convincing the reader of what one opinion or its opposite. It is intended to remove bias, since the passages are already in a list of "anti-Semitic verses" (of some sort), so there is already a POV present and that is what the context is supposed to remove. Even with context many will think that they verses are in fact anti-Semitic, again... providing context does not have the purpose of convincing anybody of anything. I don't think an explanation as to why the passages may be anti-Semitic or why they aren't is necessary and it will lead into endless argument. I just don't see how providing sources <b>out-of-context</b> is of any benefit, especially when a casual reader may not know who <i>they</i> or <i>who</i> are. I can include them in a list of "anti-[insert anything here]" and provide the sources to "defend" my case, since there is no explanation on who "they" or "who" it may just work.--<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 23:29, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Where's the evidence that the ancient Greeks were anti-semitic. How can you tar a whole race of people like that??? The Jews themselves ass-kissed Alexander and in return he left them alone. They went on to write him into their religion as a mono-theist to make his dominance more palatable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would like to see evidence of this ancient Greek 'anti-semitism' please. Or do the Jews really believed that every hegemon since the dawn of time has singled THEM out in particular for prejudice. Yawn.

<dd>Uh, one could argue that there were no Greeks back then. There certainly was no state called "Greece." Be that as it may, who is saying that "ancient Greeks were anti-Semities?" This statement is wrong, not because ancient Greeks were <i>not</i> anti-Semites" for the same reason that it is wrong to say "Germans are not anti-Semites" — it is just meaningless to make such a huge generalization. The issue is not that Germans are or are not anti-Semites, but that there <i>were</i> and <i>are</i> German anti-Semites. Similarly, there were Greek anti-Semites. Or, let's be more precise: the Nazis were anti-Semites. The Hellenic regime of Antiochus Epiphenes was, if not "anti-Semitic" (depends on how you define the word) definitely "anti-Judaic" and persecuted the Jews. And there were during Roman times periodic conflicts between Greeks and Jews. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 19:41, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There are and were plenty of anti-semetic Germans who weren't Nazis, and a few Nazis who weren't anti-semetic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jewish race</span></h2>
<p>Most social scientists argue that "race" is socially constructed, which means that whether the Jews consititute one race, many races, or no races depends entirely on historical and social circumstances. What is important in this article is not <i>what "Jews" are</i> (something no wikipedia article should arbitrate; we are not here to proclaim the truth, only to provide neutral accounts of verifiable views). What is important in this article is <i>what "anti-Semitism" is</i>. Anti-Semitic literature is full of talk of the Jewish race; the notion of race is essential to anti-Semetic discourse, and anti-Semitism is therefore a form of racism. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:14, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
