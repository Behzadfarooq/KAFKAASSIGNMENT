<p>His name was Antony. This is how he always signed himself. The name "Anton" was invented by some US sources and it has been often used in America, it was not a name ever used in his lifetime. All the variants belong to other writers. The name should be corrected to Antony. User:buddyjones</p>

<dd>The point is not to Anglicize everything -- that would often be just plain stupid. The point is to use the form most familiar to English speakers -- which is something different and changes with time. For example, 100 years ago, most scholars writing in English referred to the guy crowned emperor in 800 Charles the Great. Today, common English usage is Charlemagne. I hope this makes sense to you. It isn't necessarily logical, but it is appropriate. <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></dd>

<dd>Hello!</dd>
<dd>I'm just an anonymous user browsing through Wikipedia and I came across this page and I was wondering..</dd>
<dd>Why is this page under the 'wrong' name? Anton??</dd>
<dd>Is there any way to change the name of the article to his proper name? (I already noticed the redirect but this is just... wrong. Why isn't Anton van Leeuwenhoek a redirect to Antoni van Leeuwenhoek?)</dd>
<dd>Should ask first before changing it?</dd>
<dd>-Kraftwerk-
<dl>
<dd>I agree, for me it is also Antoni. I don't know what the official naming policy is, but I guess it would be best to spell the name in its native language. I happen to be dutch, and to me Antoni seems the most natural. Some of the confusion might be caused by the spelling changes in the last few centuries, so Antony or Antonie might also be possible. If you google for "van leeuwenhoek site:.nl" (i.e. only dutch sites) the spelling most encountered is Antoni, see e.g. www.nki.nl (AvL hospital). Another less scientific sample: google for Antoni vL has 34000 hits versus 20000 for Anton vL. Cheers, Bas
<dl>
<dd>The part about Anton redirecting to Antoni seems perfectly sensible. You're supposed to learn something from this encyclopedia, so why not teach people that type 'anton' that it's supposed to be 'antoni?' I know Anton is the angelicised verion, so more people in the world would be 'familiar' with it - but if it redirects to the correct name, why not use that correct name for the main article? <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStijndon_a053.html" title="User:Stijndon">Stijndon</a>
<dl>
<dd>What I understand from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAntoni_van_Leeuwenhoek_c656.html" title="Talk:Antoni van Leeuwenhoek">Talk:Antoni van Leeuwenhoek</a> is that the consensus was to move this article from Van Leeuwenhoek's official Dutch name (Antoni) to the name that is closest and most recognizable in modern English. I personally would have favoured Anthony over Anton though. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 00:26, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, Leeuwenhoek <i>believed</i> that he was first to discover them. That is because he had a lack of education in science. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElitejeff123_023d.html" title="User:Elitejeff123">Elitejeff123</a> 00:50, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In one of the paragraphs, some text appears to be 'missing'. The sentence makes little sense this way: <i>After this important invention and <b>his through</b> use of it, ...</i> Could the editor that added this (or someone else?) please correct this?

<p>The article states that Leeuwenhoek was 92 years when he died. However during my recent visit to Delft to see his grave , it is inscribed his age as 90 years, 10 months and 2 days on his dying day ( stone was ordered by his daughter)<br />

<p>The Oldenburgh letter is apocryphal: I contacted the Royal Society, and they had no record of the correspondence.

<dl>
<dd>Dear Ardm2,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You have clearly found someone at the Royal Society of London who feels that the Oldenburg letter was a spoof, and who minimally perused the Royal Society’s official records to see if a copy of this letter might be found there, and who also supplied you with the URL of a certain website that this person felt might disprove the authenticity of the Oldenburg letter in question. You have also apparently visited this certain website, and as a result of your visit there, you have decided that the conclusions of this contact person from the Royal Society were probably correct in his or her assessment of the situation. I can see how you might arrive at this conclusion, however there are three things that it appears to me that you may have slightly overlooked;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>In so far as I can tell from what you have written here, this anonymous commentator from the Royal Society was not claiming that the Royal Society keeps in its possession a record of all correspondences between Oldenburg and Leeuwenhoek. Unless you might be able to provide a specific and verifiable name of someone from the Royal Society who is claiming both that the Royal Society does have such a complete record of all such correspondence, and that this letter is definitely not in this record, then it seems to me that this point is inconclusive at best.</li>
<li>After visiting the spoof website that you referred to, I also found there what appeared to me to be numerous genuine historical documents alongside several documents that were clearly spoof documents. It seemed to me that these genuine documents may have been posted there only because they seemed to amount to historically legitimate spoofs. Thus, unless you might be able to provide a definitive letter from the owner of that site that he himself constructed this letter as a spoof, it would also seem to me that the fact that the Oldenburg letter can be found on that site does not conclusively prove that it is not a historically legitimate letter.</li>
<li>Finally, you have not yet provided any documentation that might disprove the credibility of the source site for the letter itself (as linked to at the bottom of the article). The source site for the letter was the <a href="http://www.euronet.nl/users/warnar/leeuwenhoek.html" class="external text" title="http://www.euronet.nl/users/warnar/leeuwenhoek.html" rel="nofollow">Warner Moll/ van Leeuwenhoek Website</a>, authored by credentialed molecular biologist Warner Moll.</li>

<dd>I do appreciate your effort to increase the accuracy of this article, however, unless you might be able to address the questions that I have raised above about your assertions, I must let you know that I do believe that the Oldenburg letter should be restored to the article. Thank you for working together to improve Wiki's accuracy.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Dear ScottP,</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your reply. I welcome very much any criticism of my claims, as my only aim is for us to construct an accurate document together. However I believe you are misguided in your response to my letter.</dd>
<dd>As a general note, it is impossible for anyone to disprove the existence of a document. One can always claim someone wrote something but it was never recorded in the proper archives or is still hidden away somewhere. Surely the onus is on a submitter to provide proof that the reference exists.</dd>
<dd>If someone, including yourself, can point me to a book, or can show me a picture of a letter properly authneticated by suitable experts, I will gladly submit. However you have done no such thing.</dd>
<dd>As to your specific points:</dd>
<dd>1) My correspondence wasn't with any old chap at the Royal Society. The Royal Society is an open, public institution, with published correspondences and dedicated archiving staff. The archivers searched the records, and they could "find no trace of a letter sent from Oldenburg to van Leeuwenhoek for the date 20 October 1676". Actually, you could have used the few minutes you spent replying to me checking the royal society archive for yourself (<a href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/library" class="external free" title="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/library" rel="nofollow">http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/library</a> ). As I have said, it is impossible for me to prove the document doesn't exist, because it's possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that the document fell between the cracks. It is now your duty to PROVE me wrong, rather than claim that I might be.</dd>
<dd>2) This point actually scares me because it goes right to the heart of whether an experiment such as wikipedia can be successful. ALL the letters on that page are spoofs; that should be clear to anyone who visits. Before contributors just go copying and pasting everything they find on the web, a minimum of critical judgement should be applied. I have, frankly, no inclination to make a fool of myself by asking Mr Chet Raymo (the author of the spoof letters) whether those letters are genuine or not. Again, you are welcome to contact him to prove me wrong.</dd>
<dd>3) This is again misguided. I'm sure Warner Moll's a good old bean; but the letter he cites is not to be found in the official archives. As such, it is for him to provide a source for the letter, otherwise any responsible encyclopedia cannot accept this material. Your implication that as a molecular biologist he knows what he talks of is an argument from authority; the weakest of all arguments.</dd>
<dd>I suppose there are many differing editing philosophies on wikipedia. I personally find it incredibly damaging to find spurious and outright false information on a page. I believe one page of accurate, fact-checked and referenced information is better than 1000 pages of dubious veracity. In other words, leaving possibly true but unchecked information out of wikipedia is a lesser sin than putting verifiably false claims in. With regards to the particular document I am contesting, the sheer outrageousness of the letter should have prompted even more rigorous fact-checking than for a run of the mill document. I thank you for your thoughtful reply but stand firm until you can prove me wrong.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ardm2 that the letter is a fake. But actually it is not really an issue for the Wikipedia article: it should not be included anyway, real or fake. It suffices to state that at first the discoveries of Leeuwenhoek were met with scepticism; there are enough sources to back up this statement. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChina_Crisis_8a30.html" title="User:China Crisis">China Crisis</a> 07:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will postpone reinserting the letter until more suitable verification and supporting documentation of its authenticity can be found and posted here. I agree that most of the other letters found on that page do appear to be spoofs. This letter in and of itself does not appear to be quite so clearly so. You are correct in that good and proper documentation is always the best support of such a thing.</dd>

<p>I will come closer to this matter.</p>
<p>(For instance with reference to the vision of Clifford Dobbell and others). - To begin with, I am not the source of the socalled letter, I just cited it, after reading on the web. The letter was placed on the web by the Boston Globe, Monday, Sept.21 1992 p.30. (Science column by Chet Raymo).</p>
<p>I guess this "socalled letter" of mister H. Oldenburg ("doubting the discoveries of Van Leeuwenhoek, and giggling") is a "joke" and I was misguided, indeed. - However I do think that there could be a reason or motive for this "apocryphal letter" or whatever it should be, if one does taken into account the reaction of the scientific world of that time and the attitude of the Dutch scientist Christaan Huygens and his letter to Oldenburg (see my comment in the above link). -</p>

<p>Dear Warnar, Ardm2 and China Crisis,</p>
<p>I have just emailed and called Dr. Chet Raymo, the author of the original article that seems to have started all of this. Dr. Raymo is out of the country til Mar. 15th, but perhaps if we are lucky, we will have some hard info on whether or not this letter is a spoof. If it is a spoof, it certainly is a good one, I'll grant that to whomever might have composed it! At any rate, I have invited Dr. Raymo to comment here on this question. I will be interested to find out how badly I may or may not have been spoofed!</p>

<p><b>The truth is</b> that Oldenburg, after he had received the Van Leeuwenhoek letter of 9th october, added himself the following words:</p>
<p>"This phenomenon, and some following ones seeming to me very extraordinary, the Author hath been desired to acqaint us with his method of observing, that others may confirm such Observations as these"</p>

<dd>I ran the Dutch quote you posted above through the translator at <a href="http://www.worldlingo.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldlingo.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and this is what I got:</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is that an accurate translation? So then is it correct that they actually first thought that Leeuwenhoek was 'hitting the sauce a bit too much', or as they say, 'drinking enough spirits to begin seeing the spirits'? If this is what they were saying, then maybe a quote from that fully documented lettter would fit into this article. No? Please elaborate if you might.</dd>

<hr />
<p>- Anyhow, the factory (DSM, Gist-Brocades) was orignally Dutch, but today it is an UK company (because they like the Dutch beer so much, I presume!).</p>
<p>They are the biggest yeast manufacturers in the world.</p>
<p>In fact the Yeast factory (Gist-Brocades) was a daughter of DSM. DSM's history began in 1902, when the Dutch government started coal-mining operations (Dutch State Mines) in the province of Limburg. The original Gist-brocades was the result of a merger in 1967 of two long-established Dutch companies - "The Royal Dutch Yeast and Spirit Factory" founded in 1870 in Delft, and "The Royal Pharmaceutical Factory Brocades-Stheeman and Pharmacia" established around 1800. After the merger, the name was modernised by taking two key elements from the old name styles - Gist (the Dutch for yeast) and Brocades. British Fermentation Products was founded in 1932 in an old mill in Ipswich making some 20 tonnes of yeast per week. The company prospered and, after 25 years, was supplying 200 tonnes of yeast per week together with a large range of bakers' sundries to the bakers throughout the UK. In 1943, BFP obtained the patent for the yeast drying process. Since 1870, Gist-brocades had been exporting yeast into the UK and, at the end of 1958, decided that they would make yeast themselves in the UK and took over British Fermentation Products Limited. BFP now had the backing of one of the biggest yeast manufacturers in the world, whose knowledge and expertise stretched back to the last century. In 1998, Gist-brocades was merged with DSM and on 1st February 2000 BFP changed its name to DSM Bakery Ingredients UK Ltd. The two sites of Felixstowe and Aintree together form DSM Bakery Ingredients UK Ltd (DBI UK) which supply the baking industry.</p>

<dd>So, while van Leeuwenhoek may not have been drinking spirits himself while he made his famous discoveries, he certainly was of great assistance to those who may in any way be "associated" with such "spirits" such as breweries, "brew" imbibers and even yeast manufacturers!&#160;: )</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Warnar, I'm curious, might you have access to any letters from anyone that might have shown any skepticism towards van Leeuwenhoek at first at all? I can only imagine that there must have been some rather funny correspondence when van Leeuwenhoek first announced the existence of his "animalcules". If I were around at that time and first heard of this, I would have probably fallen off my chair! Just curious.</dd>

<p>Dear Scott P,</p>
<p>There is at least ONE letter from Christiaan Huygens to Oldenburg in which Huygens was very very sceptical about de discoveries of Van Leeuwenhoek. I will cite a passage of Clifford Dobbel´s excellent book:</p>
<hr />
<p>According to Dobbel (In “Antoni van Leeuwenhoek and his little animals, page 172”) one can read the following concerning Christiaan Huygens. Christiaan Huygens, writing to Oldenburg in 1675, saying:</p>
<p><i>I should greatly like to know-how much credence our Mr. Leeuwenhoek's observations obtain among you. He resolves everything into little globules; but for my own part, after vainly trying to see some or the things he sees, I much misdoubt me whether they be not illusions or his sight; <b>especially when he professes to discover the particles whereof water, wine, and other liquors, are composed</b>.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>I did not read this letter myself. Though, this letter is supposed to be kept in the library of the University of Leiden, Holland.</p>
<p>Brieven van Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) Aan Henry Oldenburg (ca 1615-1677) Jaar: 1668-1675 Leiden, Universiteitsbibliotheek Leiden . [Letters of Christiaan Huygens ( ) to Henry Oldenburg.....]</p>
<hr />
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Perhaps it is possible to ask someone of this University i.e.: Dr. C.A.M. Jansen (Kees Jansen) He is an expert about the friend of Van leeuwenhoek: Reinier de Graaff. Or Dr. L.Palm (Lodewijk Palm) University Utrecht. If you like, I can send them an emailmessage and ask them how to get a copy of this letter. - PS: Never try to use an online translator! The are so bad and ugly&#160;!! It is impossible to translate texts from Old Books by that software&#160;!</p>

<dd>I both hate and love online translators! Without them, in many cases I wouldn't even have the first clue as to what I am reading. With them I often gain just enough knowledge to be dangerous! At any rate, the letter you cite above sounds to me to be most excellent. If there were any way you might be able to cite source and page number, using emails or such, I would certainly be grateful. Also the relationship between Huygens and Oldenburg would be most helpful.</dd>

<p>After noting the frequent vandalism of this page and its article page, I am considering requesting for <a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotected_2018.html" title="Template:Sprotected">{{sprotected}} (semi protected)</a> status for both this page and for the van Leeuwenhoek article page.

<dd>China Crisis, I just placed a request for this at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Anton_van_Leeuwenhoek_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Clinks.7Chistory.7Cwatch.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Anton_van_Leeuwenhoek_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Clinks.7Chistory.7Cwatch.29" rel="nofollow">Current Requests for Protection, Anton van Leeuwenhoek</a>. If you might be able to <i>second</i> my request there, I feel that such might add considerably to the likelihood of the article being semi-protected. Apparently some rather juvenile users must have found some sort of an odd fascination with microbes or some such strange thing, who knows?

<dd>Quuxplusone, I fixed the reference to Anton. I also standardized the footnoting on the page. reinserted a section that had been vandalized some time ago, and a few other things. BTW, as a registered user you should be able to edit as well, even though semi-protected.</dd>

<p>This article failed good article nomination. This is how the article, as of November 18, 2006, compares against the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">six good article criteria</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> The article is very well written, the prose flows well, and it is easily understood.</dd>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> The article does not present its sources, and, as pointed out on this talk page on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, the citation method needs to be standardized, preferrably using the cite book, cite journal, etc. templates. The problem with references is the primary reason for failing GA.</dd>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> Very thorough, for the most part I was not left with unanswered questions at the end. I would, however like to see a better description of van Leeuwenhoek's method of making lenses. I couldn't quite picture the process.</dd>
<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> No NPOV problems at all.</dd>
<dd><b>5. Article stability?</b> No stability problems at all.</dd>
<dd><b>6. Images?:</b> I'd like to see more images, but their absence would not prevent the article from qualifying for GA.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When these issues are addressed, the article can be <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_candidates_d0d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article candidates">resubmitted</a> for consideration.

<p>ANTON VAN LEEUWENHOEK WAS A FINE MAN THAT WAS ALSO A GREAT SCIENTIST AND THE BEST ONE THAT I KNEW ABOUT WHO STUDIED CELLS.

<p>I removed this section from the intro that compares AvL to Galileo on the grounds that it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a>.

<dd><i>Van Leeuwenhoek's early discoveries in the field of microbiology can be likened to <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo_Galilei_17f8.html" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo's</a> early discoveries in the field of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>. Both men used the newly improved optical technologies of their day to make major discoveries that entirely overturned traditional beliefs and theories in their respective fields, and both men were initially met with strong skepticism and resistance to the inevitable conclusions that their discoveries led to. Ultimately van Leeuwenhoek was more fortunate than Galileo in that his discoveries were eventually widely accepted and applauded in his lifetime, whereas Galileo's were not.</i></dd>
