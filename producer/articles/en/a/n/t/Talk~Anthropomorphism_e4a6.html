<p>The Religion and Myths section (or whatever it's called) is so POV that it's almost unreadable, regardless of the fact that I happen largely to agree with the POV. It could only be worse if some rabid atheist re-edits it as an anti-religion screed. Someone who can take a neutral POV without giving into either God-hating cynicism or overt proselytizing ought to rewrite it.</p>

<dd>I see what you mean, perhaps a good suggestion would be to truncate it by mentioning that there is an extensive list of examples in religion, and linking to a new page, "Anthropomorphism in religion" or something like that.71.32.193.22204:17, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree. Actually the discussion of Religions and Myths doesn't even belong here. It is intrinsically atheist because of the idea of "attribution" of human qualities to the gods, as opposed to "recognition" or "perception" of the same. It presupposes a world-view.</dd>

<p>I would suggest that we not do this. Firstly, I don't see what value it has. I could name probably about 20 examples of anthropomorphism on my own as could many others, I am sure. Secondly, if this is going to go forward, it should probably be put it its own article as it could quite quickly become quite long. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheshibboleth_b26a.html" title="User:Theshibboleth">Theshibboleth</a> 09:34, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also have issues with this, even if we made it it's own page it would quickly grow and become hard to mantain.

<p>The image with caption "Dog dressed in human accessories for humorous effect", whilst indeed humourous is not an example of anthropomophism, and would be expected to be used more on <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> than on Wikipedia.

<dl>
<dd>I believe it is indeed an example of anthropomorphism, because the non-human being (dog) has been given human characteristics (clothing). that's how anthropomorphism is defined in the first sentence of the article, and I think the picture fits the definition perfectly.--<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 10:22, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Plus, the dog is cutesy and kind of silly looking. I'm going to change the caption to reflect a closer match to what the image is of as opposed to "dog dressed in human accessories for humorous effect." Also, I'm gonna go ahead and fix the POV issues re: the cleanup tag. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECernen_7781.html" title="User:Cernen">Cernen</a> <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECernen_a016.html" title="User talk:Cernen">Xanthine</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cernen_40f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cernen">Katrena</a> 09:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>On the other hand, while the dressed dog does fit the given definition, this kind of practice is not usually labeled as antropomorphism. Not only that, but clothes and acessories aren't really human characteristics (as in human nature), but human preferences, or even human commonsense. People don't <i>feel</i> a dressed dog is closer to human beings: that's actually the very nature of the humor! People <i>feel</i> that a fictional character who is an animal who walks over two legs and talks in perfect English is more human than a fictional character who doesn't. One of the <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narnia.html" title="Narnia">Narnia</a> books (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silver_Chair_82b3.html" title="The Silver Chair">The Silver Chair</a>) has a terrific example on this: some animals talk, other don't... It's usual and pretty much okay to eat one who doesn't talk, it's nauseating and ultimately unacceptable to eat one who does (myself, I thought that was an horrible example of racism).</p>
<p>So, to summarize, while I agree the dog does fit the definition, I don't see it as anthromorphism anyway, because the definition may be (and, in my opinion, it is) incomplete and/or unclear.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm saying that as someone interested in the area, so this may be just a reflection on my favorite sub-areas. ≈ <a href="../../../e/k/e/User%7EEkevu_9c82.html" title="User:Ekevu">Eke<b>vu</b></a> <sup style="margin-right:-15pt"><a href="../../../e/k/e/User_talk%7EEkevu_1bfd.html" title="User talk:Ekevu">talk</a>&#160;</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ekevu_a9c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ekevu">contrib</a></sub> 14:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that anthropomorphism requires people to <i>feel</i> the subject is closer to humans, the only requirement in my mind is that it is given some aspects or characteristics of human-ness. Clothes aren't human nature but they are only worn by humans (I think), so I consider them to be human characteristics. Yes it is common sense because we have no fur, but elephants and naked mole-rats don't have fur either, so it would make sense for them to wear clothes also, but they don't because of climate or resourcefulness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I kind of agree, a dog dressed in clothes isn't usually what we think of as anthropomorphism. Perhaps a picture of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asimo.html" title="Asimo">Asimo</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Death</a> would be good to replace it with.

<dd>If it's still relevant, the dog was <b>not</b> a proper example of anthropomorphism. The dog has been simply dressed in human apparel, not ascribed human character traits, which is conceptually weak. The article includes a sufficient number of images: an illustration that immediately depicts the concept at the beginning of the article, an example from the ancient world, a lovely Beatrix Potter illustration between the literature and popular culture sections, and a nice robot in the artificial intelligence section.Comme le Lapin 09:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>It should be noted that from the perspective of believers of a religion where the diety or dieties have human characteristics, it may be more accurate to describe the phenomenon as theomorphism, or the giving of divine qualities to humans, instead of anthropomorphism, the giving of human qualities to the divine. The reason for this being that according to their beliefs, the diety or dieties usually existed before humans, and therefore humans were created in the form of the divine, not vice versa. However, for those who do not subscribe to the beliefs of the religion, the phenomenon can be considered anthropomorphism.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't get it. Shouldn't it be the inverse?</p>
<ul>
<li>For a believer, the god(s) precede(s) the humans. hence, the divine nature comes before the human nature. Then, god(s) create(s) men, and men try to understand god(s) making them look like humans, giving god(s) human attributes, hence, anthropomorphism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For a non-believe, god(s) do(es)n't exist. Hence, god(s) is/are invented as a copy from men that actually are gods... Hence, men who are given god attributes, hence, teomorphism.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I'm sorry for not explaining it very well.
<ul>
<li>For a believer, the god(s) precede(s) the humans. Then, the humans were created (to quote from the Bible) "in the image of God". For those who believe their religion's teachings, the god(s) aren't "invented", if anything the humans are "invented". And since the humans are given the attributes of the god(s), it is <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theomorphism.html" title="Theomorphism">theomorphism</a>.</li>
<li>For a non-believer, the god(s) still exist as an idea (although not as a real thing). A similar situation might be a toy. Humans create toys. Sometimes, humans create toys that look like people. They don't have to look like people, but sometimes they're made that way anyways. Therefore, humans are giving toys human qualities. The same is true for gods, according to a non-believer. To a non-believer, humans create gods, and sometimes they make them look like humans (although not always). That would be giving the gods human qualities, or anthropomorphism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I didn't quite inderstand what you meant by "men that are actually gods", but I hope I've cleared up my side for you... theology confuses the crap out of me so I know how it is.

<p>Modern Occurrences is very long. It reads more like a list than a explanation, especially on the subject of animals as examples of anthropomorphism. While I was adding <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Endless_e8a2.html" title="The Endless">The Endless</a> to it, in an attempt to balance the list, I realized it was already mentioned in the section "In literature". Then I realized that some of the "Modern occurences" examples were, in fact, literature. In which place do they belong? Why is there a "Modern occurences" section at all? Wouldn't it be simpler to divide "Modern Occurences" into the existing "In literature", and a new "In entertainment" or "In films" and "In television" section?</p>
<p>If for some reason we should keep the "Modern occurences" section, perhaps the modern examples in the "In literature" section could be moved to "Modern occurences".</p>
<p>Either way (or perhaps a third way I haven't thought of), something should be done to correct this overlap. My first instinct is to trim Modern occurences to a few short sentences with - at the most - 3 or 4 examples total, but I thought it should be discussed first. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 02:57, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The question that comes to mind is: What's the point of talking about "Modern occurences"? The answer that comes with it: To show how it's, in a way, current. But, apparently, while many good examples are aged, a good amount of them are relatively new as well, making that point somewhat redundant. Not only that, the term "modern" is ambiguous. Do we mean "modern" as in the last 50 years? Or 100? Or since the French Revolution? Or since the Middle Age ended? ≈ <a href="../../../e/k/e/User%7EEkevu_9c82.html" title="User:Ekevu">Eke<b>vu</b></a>&#160;<sup style="margin-right:-15pt"><a href="../../../e/k/e/User_talk%7EEkevu_1bfd.html" title="User talk:Ekevu">talk</a>&#160;</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ekevu_a9c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ekevu">contrib</a></sub> 17:22, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe "Modern occurences" could be changed to "Recent developments" or something similar. That would discourage it developing into a list, but rather discussion of trends and aspects of anthropomorphism in modern times, like the furry fandom or the anthropomorphisation of robots. Then another section could be created called "In other media" (just after "In literature") where a selection of the examples given in "Modern occurences" would be moved.

<p>From your definition an anthromorph is "applying human or animal qualities to inanimate objects" so a giant humanoid robots that can turn into cars can be considered anthromorphic? How about cars which have human personality? or dare i say " The Brave Little Toaster". Then mabe it could be added to this list or broken up into to camps, the animal and the mechanical?</p>

<p>I was talking about the article. It just slants too much with furry, It may confuse some readers, thinking anthropomorphics is strictly for furry(animals), which i think is not.</p>
<p>Maybe if we add more mechanical/(giving generaly non-living things human characteristic) examples, then the definition would make more sense.</p>
<p>Dont you think so?</p>
<p>I've seen examples of anthro with animal, plant, vehicle, planet, etc... Anthromorphism, defined is simply placing human traits to something. Being too specific would detract from the article's definition. Yes Transformers belongs, yes Brave Little Toaster belongs, I'd go as far as to say that R2D2 and C3PO belong on certain levels. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIce_a282.html" title="User:Ice">Ice</a> 12:02, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think he would be, because thinking a rock was his brother doesn't necessarily mean he was anthropomorphizing it. He might have realized the rock wasn't a human, but still considered it his brother for some reason. Or, he may have been making a metaphorical statement that "everything, even rocks are our brothers", taking it to an extreme. Or he might've just been faking, for all we know. I don't know what was going on in his mind but it doesn't necessarily have to be anthropomorphism. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 09:14, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To the paragraph that states:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>This form of anthropomorphism is common in other technical fields as well. For example, a chemist might casually explain an ionic bond between sodium and chlorine by asserting that the sodium atom "wants" to merge with the chlorine atom. Desire is, of course, a human emotion that atoms are incapable of. (...)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I added a qualifying paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>However, such uses might better be described as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animism.html" title="Animism">animism</a>, since the features falsly attributed to inanimate objects are those of sentient beings (animals) rather than just those of humans.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I also changed "Desire is (...) a human emotion..." to "Desire is (...) an emotion...".</p>
<p>That addition was reverted by Coyoty, with the explanation "rv non-neutral edits by Olivierd to last version by Nydas".</p>
<p>I have reverted it back.</p>
<p>If you want to assert that desire (and the other feelings those paragraphs mention) are uniquely human, and not felt by other animals, the burden of proof (or at least documentation and explanation) is on you. Descartes notwithstanding, it is certainly a minority opinion among humans today.</p>
<p>It would be much more logical to put many of the cases of "anthropomorphism" on a page about animism. Much would need to be rewritten in that sense on this page. For the moment, the simple qualifying paragraph I have added is the least that should be done. The wording may be a bit awkward and could be made better. But don't just delete it and make believe that the rampant Cartesianism that inspires those attributions of anthropomorphism are the mainstream opinion.</p>

<dd>You might say that the issue is not what <i>we</i> believe. But on that matter, almost <i>everyone</i> believes that at least some non-human animals have desires. So saying that attribution of desire to atoms is "anthropomorphism" rather than calling it "animism" amounts to asserting as a fact what is actually the opinion of a small number of people, those who believe that only humans have desires and so on. It is not my edit that is POV, it is the text as it was.</dd>

<dd>"Animism" might not be a perfect term, but it does describe the phenomenon correctly. "Anthropomorphism" doesn't. It smuggles in the assumption that the only sentient beings are human beings. To say that ascribing desire to atoms is anthropomorphism is to assume that only humans have desires. It is not part of common knowledge today that only humans have desires. To say the least. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierd_19c8.html" title="User:Olivierd">David Olivier</a> 09:46, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since I was the one who originally wrote the atom/desire example, the burden of proof is actually on me. When I wrote it I commented that a better example was needed. I understood then that it isn't an entirely accurate example of anthropomorphism. However, it's not an accurate example of animism either. Animism is a serious religious/spiritual philosophy, and giving atoms emotions as a time-saving device (in the way I was describing, anyways) is not serious or spiritual in any way.</dd>
<dd>If you believe (as I do) that other animals also possess the emotion of desire, then you find yourself on a slippery slope, trying to draw an impossible line where other animals and humans are different. Even animals walking on two legs and speaking could be considered giving animals parrot (not human) traits, because they walk on two legs and speak as well. Anthropomorphism is used to describe giving non-humans traits we <i>usually</i> ascribe to humans. Even desire might fall into that category.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, I still agree that the atom/desire example isn't a great one. If someone thinks it's unhelpful or misleading they're welcome to remove it, although it would be good to replace it with a better example. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 22:21, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason the image is there is because the previous picture was copyrighted. I think it's a good illustration of anthropomorphism. A picture's purpose is to illustrate the article, not to be notable.</dd>
<dd>In response to your accusation that the artist was simply using Wikipedia as a picture hosting site, I believe that is incorrect. It seems to me that the artist generously provided the picture because there was a need for a GFDL image for this article. This is apparent when one finds that she added the picture to this article the same day she uploaded it to Wikipedia. That isn't the behavior of someone just looking for a free image host.</dd>
<dd>As for the white space, I agree that it should be cropped. I suggested this to the artist before, but she seems to have not been active on Wikipedia since then. So, I just did it myself. I hope it looks better now, although unfortunately I only was able to work from a JPG so there is a slight loss in quality. It's barely noticeable though. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 00:07, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Better" is subjective, and for the purpose of illustration, one picture isn't any better than another if it adequately does the job. This one just happens to be the one used, mainly because it's available. Illustrations and photos are the one type of original content Wikipedia allows, and encourages, because it provides GFDL content where the availability of non-original works are limited by copyright. Wikipedia could be said to be commissioning artwork and photos for illustrative purposes, but it would not be "hosting" images because no other uses or promotions are allowed. <a href="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" class="image" title="Image:Tycon.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/c/c1/Tycon.jpg" alt="Image:Tycon.jpg" width="25" height="21" longdesc="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyoty_72ae.html" title="User:Coyoty">Coyoty</a></b> 16:55, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Why would someone use Wikipedia when these are available?</dd>
<dd>As for the quality of the image, I agree it isn't a perfect example of flawless art, but it very accurately illustrates anthropomorphism. It's a cat, standing upright, wearing a military uniform, and acting in a human way. Wouldn't that be anthropomorphism? I agree, though, that the article is too animal-centric. We discussed this <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnthropomorphism_e4a6.html#.22Dog_dressed_in_human_accessories_for_humorous_effect.22" title="Talk:Anthropomorphism">earlier</a> pertaining to the dog wearing clothes image. You're welcome to find an image that is better than the dog photograph, but we should keep the cat drawing, since it is GFDL and a good illustration of the subject. If you can find a picture that undisputedly better portrays the subject of anthropomorphism than the drawing though, you're welcome to move the drawing down to make room for your picture at the top. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 23:12, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do prefer it when articles that have a significant historical importance have interesting historical pictures. I suppose you could argue that the statues aren't really anthropomorphs, but I think they are. Hunks of rock that have been transformed to look more human - surely an example of anthropomorphism? For the record, I like the haunting gaze of the Moai best. It's a wonderful picture.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 11:56, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the Easter Island statues look cool, but I don't think most people would think of statues as "anthropomorphized rock" (even though they are, technically). The Anubis picture, however, might be good somewhere, because it's a deity in the form of an anthropomorphic animal. However, there probably are too many images of anthropomorphic animals. Perhaps one of the images on <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Death (personification)</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/i/ASIMO_9d30.html" title="ASIMO">ASIMO</a> as I suggested earlier, or Greek personifications like <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helios.html" title="Helios">Helios</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eros.html" title="Eros">Eros</a>, or even <a href="../../../f/a/c/Face_on_Mars_d209.html" title="Face on Mars">Face on Mars</a> might be a good example of anthropomorphism. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 09:40, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good work with ASIMO, although I think Apollo might be not the best example of anthropomorphism in religion because he is a god of so many things, of which the sun god is just one of his aspects. That's why I suggested Helios (who was incorporated into Apollo in later ancient Greek religion) because he's a personification of the sun and nothing else. Perhaps <a href="../../../h/e/l/Image%7EHelios.jpg_4432.html" title="Image:Helios.jpg">Image:Helios.jpg</a> would be a better example. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 11:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The image at the top of the article is not at all "like having a picture of someone's vegetable patch at the top of the agriculture article."

<p>Wow, Nydas, you really have a problem with my image. I can understand someone having an aesthetic dislike for any artistic creation, but I'm not sure that is appropriate commentary for an encyclopedia entry. The issue isn't about whether you personally like or dislike an image, but whether the image illustrates the subject discussed in an article. I found your personal attacks on my character (ie - that I posted this image for purposes of vanity, that I am using a Wikipedia article simply to host my drawing, etc., that I "toyed with" the idea of putting my email address in the caption when I first posted it, etc.) to be immature and overly self-important. I suggest that if you do not know another person's motivations, intentions or character that you simply be quiet on the matter rather than to make up your own reality, and then present that reality in what is supposed to be an academic discourse. You do a disservice to people who are here to examine the issues of the article seriously and to users who wish to participate in the creation of Wikipedia equitably.</p>
<p>As for the image itself, it is true that it is a user's illustration rather than a copyrighted one. However, in terms of anthropomorphism, it is no different than your suggested use of the image of Anubis. Anubis is almost identical in the type of anthropomorphism presented, since he is depicted with a human body and an animal head. The only difference in anthropomorphic qualities is that my illustration also has a tail. In introducing the concept of Anthropomorphism, it is not necessary that the example image also have an historical background. It is enough that it illustrates the point clearly. However, the uses of anthropomorphism throughout history to express certain concepts, particularly in world religions, should definately be discussed within the article. This would be a good location to include examples of specific gods and religious iconography. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cberman (<a href="../../../c/b/e/User_talk%7ECberman_bdba.html" title="User talk:Cberman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cberman_1b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cberman">contribs</a>) 01:14, 8 January 2007.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference is that Anubis is an iconic character that has been around for thousands of years, appears in endless media representations and is known to millions of people. It may not be 'necessary' in your view to have some history to the leading image, but it certainly is <i>better</i>. Anubis represents an anthropomorphic depiction, the history of anthropomorphic depictions and the use of anthropomorphic depiction in religion. Anubis is popular among furries as well, so it even covers that aspect. In terms of explanatory power and encyclopedic value, there is no contest between a well-known ancient god and an anonymous character.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 08:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't mind the image staying in the article, but I think it might be better if the first image in the article wasn't an animal - a lot of people on the internet seem to mistakenly believe that the term "anthropomorphic" refers solely or primarily to anthropomorphic animals, and it would be nice if there was some immediate visual demonstration of just how broad the term really is. I kind of miss the robot that used to be there. <a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotengu_637b.html" title="User:Kotengu">Kotengu 小天狗</a> 01:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image of the robot is still included in the article; it has simply been moved to the Artificial Intelligence section, which seems more appropriate. Comme le Lapin 04:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this article is pretty balanced now, image-wise. For time periods, three (or two) images are illustrative of history and two (or three) of modern society. Two are anthropomorphic animals, two are anthropomorphic objects, and one is an anthropomorphic concept (if a god is a concept). I don't object to the Anubis statue, though it definitely isn't as clearly a representation of anthropomorphism as the cat drawing. As for the issue of anthropomorphism being related disproportionately to animals in this article, I think that's more an issue with the text of the article now than the images. Though overall, I'm happy to see that this article is much more balanced and 'encyclopedic' than it was a year ago. <a href="../../../k/u/d/Kudos_%28granola_bar%29.html" title="Kudos (granola bar)">Kudos</a> to everyone that helped! -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 08:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, because the qualities you're referring to, individual rights (unless you mean the capability for suffering, which is commonly believed to exist in animals), are not exclusively human, or even apply to all humans. At least, judging by history. Cats in ancient Egypt, cows in modern India, and pets throughout the world from ancient times to present have all been afforded some degree of individual rights. Conversely, slaves, rape and murder victims, and unnecessary casualties of war have all been denied some or all of their individual rights. So, it's not a human quality, it's just one that has been applied more often to humans. Besides, this article probably already pays a disproportionate amount of attention to animals, when pretty much everything can be (and is) anthropomorphised. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 00:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The introduction to this article is ridiculous.

Anthropomorphism is the <i>application</i> of <i>human qualities</i> to something, whereas personification is the metaphorical derivation of <i>an actual human being</i> that <i>represents</i> something.

<p>Is Spongebob based off of the synthetic sponges most people see most often? I thought he was supposed to be an actual natural sponge-- which wouldn't make him based off an inanimate object. Sponges are animals, after all, if exceedingly primitive ones. But then, I generally make it a point to not watch that show. *laugh* Correct me if I'm wrong, in any case. Anyway, I think something more blatantly inanimate-- a character from <i>The Brave Little Toaster</i>, perhaps-- should be used as an example. But I thought I'd ask first.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanahikarichan_602c.html" title="User:Alanahikarichan">Alanahikarichan</a> 17:05, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Spongebob is a synthetic sponge (it's sort of a pun, based on the fact that he lives under the sea, like sponges the animals). A character from The Brave Little Toaster would be more blatantly inanimate but I think Spongebob is used instead because he's more well-known and current. Besides, inanimity doesn't matter much for anthropomorphism, just non-humanness (if that's a word). -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 08:22, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why do humans anthropomorphize? Because humans are self-absorbed. Honestly, this answer is sufficient for me, though I'm sure some psychologists have gone into much greater detail.
