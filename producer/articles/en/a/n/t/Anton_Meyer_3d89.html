<p>Meyer was a Consultant and Clinical Director of the cardiothoracic department. Meyer also worked part-time at the private clinic the Hadlington. The impression given is that Meyer was one of the most respected surgeons in his field in the whole country. Meyer was a detached, aloof man of formidable intelligence and consummate surgical skill. In one episode, when Charge Nurse Steve Waring asked how he managed to stay so detached, Meyer replied, "Iron will, rigid constitution, superior intellect." Meyer also regularly used the term "walk with me" whenever he was on his way somewhere in the hospital and wanted to give advice or reprimand a member of his team. He rarely showed sign of emotion; he believed that any such sentiment would cloud clinical judgement. His personal life was hardly ever portrayed, although from a few references it is known that he has a wife and daughter. Of his family, only his sister ever appears, when Meyer eventually operates on her and clashes with his brother-in-law. Fellow surgeon Ric Griffin once hinted at a scandalous liaison that Meyer may have had when younger, although Meyer quickly and calmly pointed out that any further references to his private life would have serious repercussions for Griffin's career. However, despite a spat between the two following Griffin's arrest for possession of cannabis, Meyer and Griffin seem to have got on well, within the confines of Meyer's ultra-professionalism; indeed, Meyer even recommended Griffin for promotion to the Hadlington. Certainly it is better than the relationship between Meyer and Nick Jordan (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_French_%28actor%29_2b1e.html" title="Michael French (actor)">Michael French</a>) in the earlier series, and that between Meyer and fellow heart surgeon Alistair Taylor. Meyer also gets on well with his protege, Alex Adams, although is quick to point out his disapproval on many occasions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Meyer_3d89.html" title="Edit section: Major storylines">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Major storylines</span></h2>
<p>Meyer appeared as a steadfast and constant presence in Holby, although was involved in a number of major storylines. These include working with his colleague Professor Alan Fletcher (played by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Soul_96bd.html" title="David Soul">David Soul</a>), whom he realises is surgically incompetent. Meyer was also involved in the story of the murder of his former <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senior_house_officer.html" title="Senior house officer">Senior House Officer</a> (SHO), <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Merrick_c82e.html" title="Victoria Merrick">Victoria Merrick</a>, the daughter of Meyer's long-term friend, neurologist Professor Charles Merrick (to whom Meyer pays a visit when he fears he may have <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_Neurone_Disease_393f.html" title="Motor Neurone Disease">Motor Neurone Disease</a> (MND)). Meyer eventually becomes trapped in a lift with Victoria's killer, James Campbell, although the latter had already overdosed on pills and dies in the lift before Meyer can revive him to face justice.</p>
<p>At the start of series 4, Meyer was shot in a road-rage incident on his way to work. The culprit was later addmitted to the hospital as a patient, when he crashed his car after trying to flee after the shooting. He tried to escape from the hospital in fear that the police would discover he was responsible for Meyer's shooting, and after 3 attempts at leaving the hospital, he finally achieved his goal but collapsed in the hospital car park and died.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Meyer_3d89.html" title="Edit section: Exit from Holby">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exit from Holby</span></h2>
<p>Meyer exited the show in 2002. After the parents of Rufus Wooding had suddenly withdrawn their consent for a complicated operation, Total Cable Pulmonary Connection (TCPC), Meyer eventually comes to understand that his SHO, Dr. Samantha Kennedy, had intervened and so persuaded the parents not to go ahead with the operation. Believing that his authority had been undermined, Meyer promptly sacked her. Kennedy threatened to go to the press if Meyer was not investigated, so the Hospital Board started an enquiry, during which Meyer was suspended (although nevertheless intervened on one occasion to save the life of a dying child). The investigation was headed by Meyer's old friend and rival, Tom Campbell-Gore (played by <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Lawson_5968.html" title="Denis Lawson">Denis Lawson</a>) It concluded that Meyer's clinical skills were exemplary and unquestionable, although the Board, aware that Meyer's penchant for taking extremely difficulty cases had made hospital death rates appear bad, removed Meyer's discretion to decide when to operate in such cases. The Board also relieved Meyer of Alex Adams as his Registrar. Meyer resigned to work in Michigan to develop an artificial heart, while Campbell-Gore took his post at Holby. Although Adams has since returned briefly, Meyer never has and remains a much-missed character from the show.</p>
