<h2><span class="mw-headline">A question about Antarctic land</span></h2>
<p>===&gt;<b>Always wondered this...</b> How much of Antarctica's surface actually contains land underneath? That is to say, what percentage of it is not simply an ice shelf? <a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a> 00:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The vast majority of Antarctica contains land beneath the ice, and there are even some areas <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2414" class="external text" title="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2414" rel="nofollow">McMurdo Dry Valleys</a> with exposed land.

<li>I made "Environmental" lowercase to match "protection act", but I'm not sure whether they should be capitalized.</li>

<dd>I think it's an interesting fact as it's the only continent in which we know who was the first person born there. It's not controversial or untasteful as you say. However, I do see it being a little long now, so maybe a good compromise is to still mention it but shorten it, so there isn't two whole paragraphs on 2 births. What do you think? <a href="../../../g/f/l/User%7EGflores_bda8.html" title="User:Gflores">Gflores</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/f/l/User_talk%7EGflores_1e9f.html" title="User talk:Gflores">Talk</a></sup> 18:43, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its all wrapped up in politics. The baby was imported to be born there for (completely pointless) policitcal ends; hence the "distasteful" bit (and the recent additions don't help...). I would rather it were out. But, AFAIK its a true factoid. Are we also going to include the first person to die there?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dd>The paragraph on the (historical) population of South Georgia is hardly politics in the sense you mean; the sealers and whalers were sent by no government but rather pursued their normal industry. Some of them used to live there for several decades (albeit none for more than one generation), some enjoyed normal family life with marriages, divorces, and children born and raised. Incidentally, I have met one such born and bred native South Georgian: Mrs. Jan Cheek of Stanley, until recently a Falkland Islands Councillor. As for the first persons to die in Antarctica, the earliest recorded grave is that of the sealer Frank Gabriel who died on 14 October 1820 on South Georgia, while the first people known to have died in Antarctica were most probably the 644 Spanish seamen and soldiers onboard the San Telmo believed wrecked off Livingston Island in September 1819. (The latter were sent by their government indeed, even if to fight colonial rebels in the Viceroyalty of Peru rather than conquer Antarctica.) <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 22:36, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Russian priest, Father Gerogy, has a permanent home near his church, lives on the continent year-round, and has been stationed to the continent on an indefinite, and decidedly long-term basis. If that doesn't make him a permanent resident of the continent, how does one define permanent population in a meaningful way. The population should be listed as one permanent. User:suncrush</p>

According to the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a> article, the non-existence of Antarctica and/or the antipodes may have been a belief of some in the middle ages, although that claim is disputed. But in modern times there is no evidence anyone holds the belief that Antarctica doesn't exist. According to that article, there probably aren't even any Flat Earthers any more, since their association's founder died in 2001 they have not been around. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a> 03:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The whole section titled "Geology of present-day Antarctica" is fantastically bad. You couldn't possibly remove the icesheet fast enough to not add at least 100m of elevation from isostatic rebound, and once it comes to equilibrium you'd get over a km of uplift in some places. All of the attractive "fjords" and "basins" in East Antarctica would be above sea level even after accounting for ~70m of sea level rise. Nor would West Antarctica be nearly as fragmented as it rendered there. I realize the images <i>says</i> it ignores uplift, but it is still misleading because people are not given the right impression that after uplift East Antarctica would better resemble Australia than some criss-crossed mess of seas. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:47, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Without the ice-shield, the continent's shape would look fully different from how it is presented on common maps. West Antarctica would resolve into three major parts: the Antarctic peninsula, Marie Byrd Land, and Vinson massif. East Antarctica would consist in a landmass with huge bays (e.g. Aurora Subglacial Basin and Wilkes Subglacial Basin) and fjords (e.g. at the location of Amery Glacier and around the South pole). The East Antarctic landmass would be littered with lakes and endorheic seas, parts of their grounds being far lower than sea level. East Antarctica would look somewhat like Canada or Finland nowadays.</i></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Neither the graph, nor the text suggest that removing the icesheet takes place, should be done, or could be done in a short period of time. Both graph and text simply show the bedrock as it is in fact now, according to the most recent meta-studies. It's a fact, and, to my mind, it's pretty interesting.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-glacial_rebound.html" title="Post-glacial rebound">post-glacial rebound</a> should not been overestimated; it is a slow process. In Northern Europe and Canada it was at most 0.075 m/yr, but most of the time it was only 0.025 m/yr. Of course, the ice-shield did not melt away instantly, so the rate would have been higher under such hypothetical conditions, but we are not talking about 100 m/yr.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The two phenomena <i>sea level rise</i> and <i>uplift</i> compete each other. Sea level rise (estimates are between 59 and 80 m) would happen instantly, so that the bassins, for a few months or years, would probably be even larger than displayed on the graph.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The lakes and endorheic seas would probably not be effected for a few thousand years until rivers would create valleys to drain them. So the Canada-like look would last for a pretty long time, independently of sea level rise and uplift.</dd>

<dd>Panda, you are mistaken on several issues. First, the uplift during unloading is a factor of several higher than <i>post</i>-glacial rebound. Secondly, the Laurentide ice sheet (North America) can conservatively be said to be unloading for at least 3 kyr (probably closer to 10 kyr). For reasonable rheologies, 3 kyr is long enough that ~50% of the ultimate total rebound occurs <b>during the unloading process</b>. For a site under several kilometers of ice, that's several hundred meters before the ice is totally removed. Unless you can imagine some way to magic away to ice a lot faster, there is no way that most of those "bays" would ever be below sea level by the time the ice has melted regardless of sea level rise. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:41, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;;-) And I'm not mistaken on those issues not mentionned in the above reply...? Whatever - as to myself, I'll stop the thread here. If the majority of readers of this section consider the above <i>worst paragraph</i> useful, put it back into the article, maybe with some modifications. Otherwise, somebody should remove the map as well, to be consistent. For those still interested in Antarctic rock surface: see the map at <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/aedc/bedmap/examples/bed10.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/aedc/bedmap/examples/bed10.gif" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or the entire site at <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/aedc/bedmap/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/aedc/bedmap/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> by the British Antarctic Survey. The maps are based on the same data as the map presented here, with a precise description of the data collection/consolidation process. However, the maps don't use 0 elevation as a reference, and they don't fill hollows with lakes - which may make interpretation more difficult to non-academic readers, but the information is the same. A less sophisticated rock surface map is also published on the <i>Antarctica Travel Map</i> by International Travel Maps, Vancouver.--Panda17 03:39, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Probably it would be a part of the continent as the continent would rise, if that was to happen. One estimate is, that f.e. during the last ice age Nordic countries would have been ~50 m deeper compared to the sea level.</dd>

<dd>Presently it is solid all the way from ice surface to bedrock, which is plenty to say it is on land, and if you removed the ice there would be enough uplift that it would still be above sea level (see the topic 2 above this). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 03:26, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
