<h1><span class="mw-headline">The Definition, or "What this Page is About"</span></h1>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> This is at the top because it logically fits here (the page is now 91kbytes long and is going to need some tidying, which is not a wiki-skill I have yet, help appreciated.</p>
<p>The page is currently about groups and individual people, historical and contemporary, who share a definite common factor that they are anti-vaccination. It is also about the nature of the arguments deployed (not, strictly, about whether they are wholly or partially or totally valid, becuase that belongs on the vaccine_controversy page, but about their nature).</p>
<p>Necessarily, it is about the roots of those beliefs (something that evolved in the wiki discussion process on this page, after the story started).</p>
<p>A definition of an anti-vaccinationist is a reasonable thing to try for - I'd suggest a Delphic one. John is an anti-vaccinationist. Anon thing is an a-v Ombudsman is an a-v. I'm not an anti-vaccinationist.</p>
<p>John decided to help with the <b>definition by type</b> by providing a list of assertions (you could say characteristics or propositions) that an anti-vaccinationist will make (or show), whish are listed in tables in teh article.</p>
<p>Anyone who has real trouble working out what defines an anti-vaccinationist (and why the Chief Medical Office of the UK is not an anti-vacciantionist because he thinks that we should vaccinate against Rubella, but not, routinely against Chickenpox, in 2005) then I suggest two things:-</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Look at the tables and try to match beliefs to people;</li>
<li>2. describe a person here on the Talk: page, and we'll come to a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delphic.html" title="Delphic">delphic</a> concensus on whether they are, or are not.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Percolation of rumour, Persistence of demonstrable error</span></h3>
<p>The alleged Smallpox outbreak (Google: swabi smallpox 2002) is a good example, Chickenpox was reported as Smallpox which is regarded as extinct - except in the anti-vaccinationist writings on the Web. The report was widely copied without any critical assessment, over a host of websites. WHO reported fairly promptly (probably after abut as long as it takes to drive over and radio back, actually) that this was not Smallpox, but no correction occurs in any of the first few pages of Googled results... To what extent the misinformation continued to be spread after it was clear that it was Chickenpox might be interesting to map given the appropriate software. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 10:12, 24 January 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 14:05, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bibliography from VACCINATION AND THE ANTI-VACCINATIONISTS</p>
<p>"Anti-vaccination movements are not a new phenomenon. The "Society of Anti-Vaccinationists" was established in 1798, 2 years after Edward Jenner had demonstrated that cowpox material was effective in preventing smallpox. In 1853 the Anti-Vaccination League was founded in London to provide a nucleus for anti-vaccination groups to oppose the compulsory vaccinations acts of Great Britain...

<h3><span class="mw-headline">A quote on the difference of vaccination from medical treatment</span></h3>
<p>Vaccination is unique among de facto mandatory requirements in the modern era, requiring individuals to accept the injection of a medicine or medicinal agent into their bodies, and it has provoked a spirited opposition. This opposition began with the first vaccinations, has not ceased, and probably never will. From this realisation arises a difficult issue: how should the mainstream medical authorities approach the anti-vaccination movement? A passive reaction could be construed as endangering the health of society, whereas a heavy handed approach can threaten the values of individual liberty and freedom of expression that we cherish.</p>

<p>The article on vaccination citics was deleted after a discussion, Ombudsman's edits are tending to recreate it, starting witht hetitle.

<p>THere was already a redirect from vaccine critics to this article, which remained.</p>

<p>It has also broken a bunch of links, reucing the coherence of WP.</p>
<p>Antis ... implicitly will be opposing something, won't they - so the bit about fighting the policies although left in is pretty redundant. If they weer _critics_ they might be criticising the policy, in which case it might be mere coincidence that all of them were resolutely opposed to every aspect of every immunisation, and one would have to add extra verbiage to indicate the direction of their criticism. But as anti-s it is made clear in a single composite word. Isn't the language wonderful.</p>
<p>It does not seem to me that the edit from "preservation of health" to "as a public health measure" reflects the public stance even of the person who made it. The implication would be that anti-vaccinationists are in favour or neutral toward individual vaccination to produce individual immunity while objecting to this being a public policy. I can see elements f this in various writings, but it doesn't work - opposition to public health measures and compulsion would be on principled grounds, whereas much material is presented - partly including an unsourced quote selected to add tot eh article - which asserts that vacciantion and immunisation does not produce immunity and, elsewhere, induces disease in the individual. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 10:59, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anti-vaccinationists are a small headcount. Is there an indication of how many people are involved? Even in the 19th century they were a small minority, although like creationists in Kansas, Trotskyites in Liverpool in the 70s, and various other small motivated groups they were likely to get into boards where policy was applied. "Many" is a POV addition commonly made, and never referenced by a reasonable effort to actually count.

<p>Looking at a website referred to in the text, which is actually a reduplicated copy of Whale.to, and is in the .uk domain, I note that the first item in teh page to which one is directed first asserts that only a doctor may offer medical advice, before going on to offer medical advice labelled a opinion.</p>
<p>The UK law is actually quite different, IANAL but I am a UK doctor.</p>
<p>Anyone may offer medical advice and indeed offer to treat humans. (Other animal species are assumed to need more protection than their own common sense, and only a qualified Vet may treat or offer to treat anyone else's animal)</p>
<p>What is restricted is asserting that one is a <a href="http://ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Registered_medical_practitioners" class="external text" title="http://ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Registered_medical_practitioners" rel="nofollow">Registered Medical Practitioner</a>, which only those who are, may.</p>
<p>Richard <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman.html" title="Feynman">Feynman</a>'s biography gives the account of his receiving many huge documents asserting they were proofs of perpetual motion or difficult theorems in mathematics.

<p>If this approach is taken to anti-vaccinationists' material, the amount of reading necessary is much reduced!</p>
<p>In this spirit, the first mistake in www.vaccination.org.uk occurs in page 2, paragraph 1.</p>
<p>The name chosen of course associates the author (I do not believe there to be more than one) with the worst elements of Web society, the domain squatters, as a proper name for the domain would be anti-vaccination.org.uk .

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Character of Anti-vaccinationist writing</span></h2>
<p>Reasonably enough there is a question over citing references for this, which turns out to be less obvious than it first seemed.</p>
<p>Is there a character to the material, and its promulgation? There certainly is, and some elements listed seem to me not to need a reference since they can be seen by anyone with Google and 1 minute. One effect of the link-farming and reduplication that has gone on on the Web is that meta-information tends to be buried to any casual search (teh proliferation of articles apparently abut someone, which turn out to contain only that they opposed vaccination - as though one wrote a "biography of Mr <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindbergh.html" title="Lindbergh">Lindbergh</a> which consisted of only "He consistently and successfully opposed gravity" - is an example of a similar tendency or tactic).</p>
<p>(If someone want sto make a case that the material is no different from anything else, that would also be reasonable, I think we are allowd to look at things and feel their nature)</p>
<p>Sometimes a test of the reasonableness of a statement is to test its opposite - if soneone says "antivaccinationist writings on th web and elsewhere are no different in any respect (save their conclusion) from writing about topics in general" would that pass unchallenged? I think not.</p>
<p>More research is needed. Should we assume that those anti-vaccinationists who read and edit this article are operating in a spirit compatible with WP, and if they had ever seen an analysis of teh character of the writings they accumulate and pass on would prsent it here. TO do otherwise would be to conceal information in order to present a POV, which I thnk is actually part of a character of teh writings, whch distinguishes it from scientific work in general as well in its degree if not absolutely as from documents prepared by eg civil serants to support decisions on policy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Specific People</span></h2>
<p>This is from the Rabid Response ssytem of the BMJ - which is not, although it is sometimes represented as being, peer-revewed publication in the BMJ:- (Google: BMJ DOnegan Midgley)</p>
<p>As to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationists.html" title="Anti-vaccinationists">Jayne Donegan</a>, the judgement[1] is damning, but polite, and that isn't censorship either. "44. It has not been a well-balanced exercise. At the end of her first statement Dr Donegan made this declaration -</p>
<p>"…..this is an independent medico-legal report based on my opinion, knowledge and research on the diseases, their vaccines and taking into account the particular cases of the children involved. I understand that the court will use it in coming to a decision as to what is in the best interests of the children involved. I have indicated my sources extensively. The facts and opinions expressed in this report are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I confirm that any fees are independent of the outcome of the case."</p>
<p>45. I regret that Dr Donegan has not fulfilled that declaration. Mr Cohen submits that she has not understood nor complied with her duty to the court. I am satisfied that his submission is well founded. Had I heard her evidence alone, I might have been mislead and could well have reached a decision not supported by the research upon which she largely relied.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>53. Dr Conway considered Dr Donegan's first paper in a response of over 60 pages with which Professor Kroll entirely agreed. I am satisfied he was not over critical. But at various places he points to <b>Dr Donegan being confused in her thinking, lacking logic, minimising the duration of a disease, making statements lacking valid facts, ignoring the facts, ignoring the conclusion of papers, making implications without any scientific validation, giving a superficial impression of a paper, not presenting the counter argument, quoting selectively from papers, and of providing in one instance no data and no facts to support her claim.</b></p>
<p>"</p>
<p>In the appeal case[2], the point of appeal was not the science, but reasonably enough the Court considered it and recorded:- "36 The judge concluded that the medical evidence relied on by the two mothers to show that vaccination is dangerous and unnecessary was untenable. <b>Dr Donegan's report was based on no independent research, and most of the published papers cited by her in support of her views turned out either to support the contrary position or at least to give no support to her own. Not to mince words, the court below was presented with junk science.</b></p>
<p>37 In opposition to this material the judge had the evidence of two knowledgeable clinical scientists, both respectful of parental anxieties. They concurred in the conclusion that, while you can never prove a negative, there was strong scientific evidence that the risks of not immunising children were real and in many instances serious – tetanus, meningitis C, mumps, measles and rubella presenting what Professor Kroll characterised as 'a plausible risk of severe illness and death'; that the effectiveness of the vaccines was high; and that their known side-effects were rare and not life-threatening.</p>
<p>38 It is especially worth highlighting why autism was not an issue in this case: not even Dr Donegan suggested that there was a scientific case for linking it to the MMR vaccine.

<dd>I appreciate that the distinction is subtile, it may even be subtile enough to make no differnece.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Restoring tag</span></h2>
<p>This article currently targets modern vaccine critics primarily. Historically, the term anti-vaccinationst primarily applied to vaccine critics who opposed any and all vaccinations, during a long ago time when cowpox inoculations were the primary or only vaccinations commonly administered. The landscape has changed significantly since then, perhaps since about the 1950s, primarily it seems as a result of the success of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio_vaccine.html" title="Polio vaccine">polio vaccine</a> which, despite its initial major drawbacks (i.e., <a href="../../../s/v/4/SV40_aa55.html" title="SV40">SV40</a>), provided a strong case for the benefits of at least certain vaccines. Most vaccine critics nowadays recognize that some vaccines are invaluable and that there is a rational basis for the use of some vaccines as part of a prudent medical approach to protecting <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_health.html" title="Public health">public health</a>. The concerns of modern vaccine critics largely stem from the <b>vast overuse of vaccines seen today</b>, as is plainly evident from some of the many absurd additions to <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_schedule.html" title="Vaccine schedule">vaccine schedules</a> in recent years. Because the term 'anti-vaccinationist' is somewhat of an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a>, the current article should be split into two distinct articles, one covering the history of the anti-vaccinationist movement (comprising a small minority of critics today), with another more appropriately titled article on the broader topic of modern vaccine critics. Lumping both subjects into a single article is misleading at best, since critics today --rather than opposing all vaccines-- mostly want to see <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">thimerosal</a> and certain other additives removed from all vaccines, longer intervals between vaccines (rather than the MMR and the new 5-in-one shot, and administration at later ages when immune systems are more fully developed), more <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injury</a> research, and some (or a great deal more) moderation in the number (and types) of vaccines added to the vaccine schedule. For these and other reasons --including the concern expressed by some that the article may be a bald attempt to discredit the majority of vaccine critics who are not opposed to all vaccines-- the tag on article is now going to be restored. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 09:00, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the comments. There is some undoubtedly good material there - which if it can be referenced and/or substantiated seems to me to have a proper home in the article, rather than the discussion.</dd>
<dd>I do not think that all of the statements about current anti-vaccinationist thought and intent above are true, or perhaps apply to substantial portions of the identifiable group. As a trivial example, for instance, the Ctee on Safety of Medicines would I am sure like to see an absence of Thiomersal in vaccines, and the same goes for other regulatory bodies, doctors and the companies producing them. But that does not make them in any useful sense anti-vaccinationists, nor does it have any specificity for vaccines as distinct from every other class of real or potential medicine, or real or potential additive or preservative. I don't think one needs an encyclopedia to tell one that making medicines with nothing in them that is not needed is best, or that as manufacturing technologies improve, the risk of bacterial (for those who think Pasteur had a clue) introduction and multiplication recede and thus additives previous needed become not needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the argument about Mercury etc is not on that basis, nor proportional, and is not always (ever?) used to argue for an improvement in a vaccine, but rather as an argument that a vaccine should not be used - with the expectation that when the Thiomersal is removed, another argument will be dusted off and used to the same purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Historicity</b>. The thesis I started the page with, taking it from the BMJ paper referenced within, is that there is an identifiable movement, set of tropes, continuum of argument which is not broken at a particualr date.</dd>
<dd>An argument that there was a historic movement which passed away and that there is now a <b>different</b> modern movement doing different things in different ways for different reasons which should be treated differently when describing or discussing it and the people in it does not seem to me to be made out by the comment above, nor by anything else.</dd>
<dd>A tactic in argument which is seen here and there is to insist that every case is different, and thus no overview or categorisation or aggregation of like things into classes for teh purpose of considering them and producing or testing general rules is legitimate. Man is an animal whcih classifies, and this works well for us - I see splitting of the material around this topic as a way of preventing consideration of it rather than facilitating it.</dd>

<dd><b>Specific</b> rejoinders:-</dd>
<dd><i>Moderns'</i>. The article in its current state (which is unfinished, and I think a draft tag would be more appropriate than an unbalanced one if onewants to reflect that) does not seem to me to bear on moderns more than historicals. If it does, providing some infomation on the historicals might be the most effective way to balance it. If there is no information on them, then the balance would be as good as it could be anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>What the historicals originally wanted</b>. This is a disagreement! The names of the organisations may give a clue - the national anti-compulsory vaccination league for instance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>anachronism</b>. The term is wonderfully accurate and provides a good class for consideration of a collection of people with continuing unifying common characteristics of behaviour. Are there are sub-groups, or do people with one concern become subsumed into a whole, with an overlap into other areas such as in the UK Munchausens by proxy? I think they do actually, although I am quite prepared to see someone produce an example of a group who are against a specific vaccine while queuing up to have all the others.

<p>There is a nice page (it has colour in the tables, even) at <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_schedule.html" title="Vaccine schedule">Vaccine_schedule</a> which seems very appropriate for material on <b>how</b> to actually _decide_ what <b>schedule</b> to give <b>vaccines</b> on and when to give them. I think that the range of opinions on when to give what and the way in which schedules are arrived at would be appropriately dealt with there, and is not really the material of this page. Pages need to stick to their own topic, not that of another page - we could simply refer to that, if a substantial proportion of people commonly identified as A-Vs are actually merely differing in opinion from the consensus on _when_ to give immunisations. It seems clear to me that such technical discussions will already be well written up and references easy to find, since they will have given input to official national policy-forming bodies, and there will be reasoned arguments behind each of the existing schedules - even if the reasonaing is of the order of "we want to get people as immune as we can to as many of the listed diseases as we can as early as we can without over-working everyone concerned and then keep them immune as long as it matters. And eradicate Polio. Actually the <b>eradication of infectious diseases</b> would be a reasonable page topic - immunisation is a part of it, politics another, sanitation and housing and feeding people yet another, most of whcih would not need writing <b>in</b> it since they have great pages already to point to. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 10:54, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The Vaccination Belief System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Infectious disease is caused by transmissible agents such as pathogenic <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus.html" title="Virus">viruses</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>.
<ul>
<li>They satisfy Koch's postulate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the (human) <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a> responds to invading organisms and to toxins from them (eg<a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetanus.html" title="Tetanus">Tetanus</a>) when they are presented to it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>fragments of organisms (eg <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">Influenza</a> vaccine, or a weakened variant of the organism (eg <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubella.html" title="Rubella">Rubella</a> vaccine) or small amounts of a toxin chemically or physically treated to break the damaging part of the molecule (eg <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetanus.html" title="Tetanus">Tetanus</a> toxoid) or an organism similar to the feared one but much less dangerous (eg <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinia.html" title="Vaccinia">Vaccinia</a> for <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">Smallpox</a> or <a href="../../../b/c/g/BCG_50e4.html" title="BCG">BCG</a> for [Tuberculosis]] produce a response from the immune system which is similar to the response produced in survivors of infection with the natural or wild or feared organism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The attenuated or substituted organisms are less dangerous than the wild organisms (eg <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinia.html" title="Vaccinia">vaccinia</a> is less dangerous than <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">variola minor</a> which itself is less dangerous than <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">variola major</a> the two being strains of the same virus AFAIK and variolation an effort to pick the minor one in order to have a greater chance of surviving both it, and subsequent exposure to the major one))</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>as the risk of exposure to the wild disease, during the whole of life, becomes smaller, the acceptable risk of vaccines also becomes smaller, thus vaccines which were a great advantage when introduced are now regarded as some sort of bug soup that we prefer to avoid, and as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio.html" title="Polio">Polio</a> incidence falls toward zero, the less effective and nastier to take killed injectable vaccine becomes a relatively more favourable proposition than the oral Polio vaccine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>under suitable conditions some of these responses include <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune memory</a>, the capacity to much more rapidly produce a much greater response to a subsequent challenge (or infection or exposure) with the wild/feared organism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>under other conditions, the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">humoural immunity</a> produced does not persist long, and therefore while the immunisation is useful for visits to infected areas, it is not suitable for lifelong protection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>vaccines are not perfectly effective, universally correctly stored or given, and do not in all cases encounter a perfectly effective immune system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>after most people are vacinated, in the persisting presence of circulating transmissible agents of disease, even though those who are not vaccinated are many times more likely to contract the disease when presented to it for the first time, there are very few of them compared to the large number of people individually unlikely to catch the disease because they have been vaccinated, and therefore it is not unlikely that the majority of people ho catch the disease will have been vaccinated - far from unlikely it is inevitable from the mathematics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>people with partial immunity from a response to vaccination or to a previous infection with the wild agent are less likely to die of the wild disease if they are exposed to it even if they catch it than people who have not been previously primed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>some people are naturally immune to some infecting organisms, indeed given our understanding of the interestingly random development of parts of the immune system, it may be that all people are immune to some infecting organism, whetehr or not it actually exists in the locality. (this is a small digression)</li>

<dd>It is a toxemic host (with smallpox that was living in and drinking filth) made more vulnerable by nutrient deficincies. <i>The several forms of these intestinal crises, or drunks, follow holidays or feast-days. The lightest drunks are named colds, "flu," tonsilitis; the heaviest, diphtheria. In those who eliminate through the skin (the eruptive fevers), the lightest form is called measles; the heavier, scarlet fever; the heaviest, black smallpox.</i> Children: Their Health and Happiness by J. H. Tilden (1928). <i>Smallpox and diphtheria, now both very rare, have long since been cleaned up by the sanitary engineers.</i> Chickenpox &amp; Measles by Dr Bieler. I think you should be able to get where anti-vaccine disease theory is coming from. Disease comes from WITHIN essentially, and it can be tranmitted if the other person/host is in a similar toxemic state, and this has been wildly exagerated by vaccinators over the years, smallpox being a notable example <a href="http://www.vaccination.org.uk/v/smallpox2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vaccination.org.uk/v/smallpox2.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> When you consider the fact they feared measles more in Leicester around 1880, you can get some idea about the extent of the fearmongering. <i>So far as we are concerned in Leicester, a town containing 120,000 inhabitants, with many thousands of unvaccinated children, smallpox seems to be about the least dangerous of all diseases, and is not to be named by the side of scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, diarrhoea, or even consumption. If a case of small-pox is discovered, instant isolation is adopted, and during the last five years we have hardly had five deaths. That being the state of the case, one need not wonder that the fear of the disease should disappear, or that resistance to vaccination should increase."</i>--William Tebb 1881.{fact} One dude though it so uninfectious he thought onlt bedbugs could transmit it. <i>"This child, although living in the same room with the patients at the Pest House, had not acquired the smallpox, after being exposed to it all of the time for a period of six weeks; yet upon the fifth day after returning home, this child acquired the initial fever. I then examined their house and found it to be literally alive with bedbugs."</i>---CHARLES A. R. CAMPBELL, M. D. And you have to marvel at people falling for the germ theory when most people don't catch the diseases. <i>"As a matter of fact, perhaps it is safe to say that not more than 10 per cent of the people ever would take smallpox if sleeping in the same bed with an infected smallpox victim."</i>--Dr Hay. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 21:06, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have any plague pages on my website, you are nitpicking. I have never even looked into plague, I presumed it had died out in this country. I don't think it is a good subject for you to bring up, considering the amount of lies that the medical industry churns out every day. Starting with the great smallpox lie, then the <i>vaccines are safe</i> lie. And so on. Also <i>demonstrated to be clearly false</i> is according to you, in many cases. Just because you say something is true or false doesn't necessarily make it so. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 07:29, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and to ignore the more important causes--toxemia, nutrition, poisons and sanitation (both contributing to toxemia), is something else, as Bayly points out:</dd>
<dd><i>Perhaps the greatest evil of immunization lies in its diversion of public attention from true methods of disease prevention. It encourages public authorities to permit all kinds of sanitary defects and social problems to remain undressed, particularly in schools. It ignores the part played by food and sunlight and many other factors in the maintenance of health. It exaggerates the risk of diphtheria and works upon the fear of parents. The more it is supported by public authorities, the more will its dangers and disadvantages be concealed or denied."</i> M. <a href="../../../b/e/d/Beddow_Bayly_25f8.html" title="Beddow Bayly">Beddow Bayly</a>, M.R.C.S., 1944.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vaccine safety - a question</span></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding there being a perfectly adequate page on this, lets briefly amplify a statement in teh article given as a core assertion of antivaccinationists (may need demonstrating that is so but for now ...)</p>
<p>Quote:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccines aren't safe.
<ul>
<li>Vaccinators have stretched the definition of safe
<ul>
<li>to include death and serious brain damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions:- 1. What is the altenrative view of "safe", IE what would an anti-vaccinator find general agreement on if he called something "safe" among his peer group?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Safe</i> is breastfeeding. End of story. Not something that kills 100 kids (as compensated by the NVICP, so I believe) a year in the USA, the bare minimum. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 07:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
2. Isn't there a bit of a paradox in the text as given - which was not all mine - in that if we define safe as including death and serious brain damage, what on earth is it that happens that allows anyone to say htat vaccines are not? Are we talking global thermonuclear warfare here, or peril to immortal soul? Or has someone got carried away? Or is it more simply a matter of whatever is defined as safe being largely defined in terms of "safer than vaccines", such that rather than the steady ratchetting up of requirments for safety that has occurred as disease becoems less manifest, it is actually a circular definition intended as polemic? <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 21:47, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why the greed for organisations? The last time I posted some on other pages they got deleted! A lot of organisations don't want to be labelled <i>antivaccine</i>, so I was hesitant to list any more until I had asked them. They prefer to be <i>pro-choice</i>. the reason as I deduce it is because of medical industry propaganda, where <i>anti-vaccine</i> has been given the tag of mentally ill, for want of a better word. Terms used to infer mental illness are <i>Conspiracy theorist</i>, <i>paranoid</i> etc, an ad hominem tag, essentially. The medical industry has tried to banish the word <i>anti-vaccine</i> by this method, and succeeded for some time. Also you will never get any media attention if you come out anti-vaccine, so you will reach less people, they theorised. I will put a <i>vaccine critic</i> list up to cover the rest, but there are 20 or so. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 07:41, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't claim to get it right all the time. What you lot will never understand is the fact we don't need to lie. We didn't get into this for profit. My main interest is the truth, before vaccination. I spent 10 years on spiritual truths, which are a lot harder than medical ones, which I find easy. I thougt you were the one keeping log of our mistakes. When I look at the ones your lot come up with it is just nitpicking. I think there was one when Mendelsohn said so many docs didn't take rubella vaccine, which he was meant to have got wrong when you read the paper, but I'd have to read it myself before I'd trust what your side would say.

<dd>Imagination is one thing... substantially every UK doctor has been immunised against hepatitis B with 3 or more doses of the Hepatitis B vaccine. Likewise all healthcare workers including receptionists who are not known to have had Chickenpox have recently caught up with Varicella vaccine. Rubella, I'd have to look up, but I suspect we would have complete coverage. A significant point here is that this is all easily available, to anyone who looks for truth rather than imagining <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 08:48, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is an improvement on 1990. In 1990, a UK survey involving 598 doctors revealed that over 50% of them refused to have the Hepatitis B vaccine despite belonging to the high risk group urged to be vaccinated. (British Med Jnl, 27/1/1990) If you can supply a survey that proves all have been vaccinated with Hep B, or the document that states they have to have the vaccine? Saying they all have been vaccinated is very different to them all having been.

<dd>I am not using it to suggest doctors don't support vaccination, more they don't have much confidence in it. As to my use of the term vaccinators, I do that to point out the bias in medical doctors, as they usually, eg JDWolf, try to pretend they have thought about the subject and made the decision for, when in reality they are vaccinators the moment they sign up for a medical degree course. Just like a politician will support his party when the whips crack the whip, not needed in most cases.

Especially when there are disease cures out there, and the pharma med doesn't work, generally speaking. And causes huge deaths and disease. 150--780,000 itarogenic, plus the 700,000 who could be saved by Vitamin C from heart disease deaths. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 20:25, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Vitamin C for heart disease is in that camp. By medical monopoly, I suspect we mean the system where medicine is done largely by people who get a medical degree, and then follow postgraduate courses of study and training. The assertion that Pharma doesn't work (but Vitamin C which presumably is therefore not pharmacutical???) is incredible. Pharma started working around Willow bark and Foxgloves, and there is no obvious point at which to say all after this is rubbish.

John, you can go back through the history and find where you put it in, and then forward again, and you would find a link you can copy here as a <b>diff</b> that will show the difference made by any individual edit. I suspect you put the comment text in the wrong place in what is admittedly a complex table - notice I have tried to make it less unwieldy. You'd be wanting to reference it - as a comment, WP editors are highly likely to think that a reference to within WP is useful for that, most people woudl accept a UNICEF one as being free of teh specific interests here. If you can point to a diff, please do so, otherwise it would actually be polite to retract that. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:13, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is the idea of contingent arguments a useful one - that if you have an argument which to your mind means 100% of African children should not be vaccinated, there is not a lot of point in presenting an argument that 60% of them should not be vaccinated.<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And indeed, if you have an argument that 100% of children should not be vaccinated, tehre is little point in saying that some subset of them should not be vacinated because they are African children.<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>At the end of a process of following each class up of the class which it is a member of, we might hope to arrive at one of several possibilities:-
<ul>
<li>That some children should be vaccinated, and who they are.</li>
<li>that <b>no</b> children should be vaccianted, and there is <b>one</b> reason which applies to all children and is sufficient argument. (regardless of any <i>other</i> reasons applying to any sub or supergroup) (god said don't do it is a pretty good example of one of the specific types of argument that would <i>fit</i> there - I wouldn't know, never having been told about it by god, but someone else might - I once met a newspaper editor who told me god had told him how to run his business. He is no longer in that job, but perhaps he mis-heard.

<li>That no children should be vaccianted, some of them (say group A) because of one reason applying only to them (say reason 1)and another group (B) because of another separate and different reason (2) applying only to them. Logic warning: this is a weak argument since if a child can be found who is not A and not B then neither 1 nor 2 applies and you cold find yourself not arguing that they should not be vaccinated. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Polio in Africa</span></h2>
<p>A Transcript of a talk given by Kihura Nkuba (Nov 2002) <i>In Africa polio does not kill anybody and they say it's very rare to catch. It's really very rare to get paralytic polio. They say it's in very rare circumstances, so what is it that is killing people in Africa ? Malaria. Every five seconds a child is dying of malaria in Africa. Now to get the dose of life-saving anti-malaria is about $5 but there is no government to give anti-malaria. When somebody gets malaria, if they have no money they even die. So the question I was asking and many people were asking was 'If you really want to help children, why begin with a disease that they don't have ? (applause) Why not look for something that is killing them and save them from what is killing them ?' And then (inaudible) ............. 'you know what, I like you very much. I save your children from this killer disease. Now there are no other diseases apart from this rare polio, so let's go and fight that as well.' But you don't begin with the rarest disease and spend all the government's meagre resources fighting polio, which is not a threat to most people, and then ignore something that is killing them in large numbers like malaria, like AIDS, like cholera, issues to do with sanitation, stunted growth - all the main things that matter to people the government was not fighting.</i><a href="http://www.whale.to/a/nkuba_h.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whale.to/a/nkuba_h.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 20:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

"Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, where an ongoing civil war has kept vaccine supplies from being delivered to patients.  The country experienced the largest modern outbreak of polio in 1995, when over 1,000 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were recorded in the city of Kisangani, and war has complicated recent efforts to chase the disease from the central African country."
</pre>
<pre>
"Bordering Congo to the Southwest, Angola is experiencing even more serious problems with a polio epidemic which is being exacerbated by civil war and the movement of millions of refugees within and out of the country.  The epidemic, which was first reported on 23 March 1999, has now caused over 700 casualties, including more than 40 deaths, making it one of the largest polio epidemics in Africa since vaccination began there in the 1950s.  On 8 April, the National Institute of Virology in South Africa confirmed that the epidemic is being caused by type 3 poliovirus."

<p>Very selective, see all of the responses: <i>History demonstrates that, in fact, the propaganda stems from your side of the debate rather than from that of the antivaccinationists. Has Robert never investigated the history of vaccines? All of the major "epidemic" diseases were just about on their way out long before any serious vaccinations took place and even then the percentages of those vaccinated were miniscule. ...... For the reader's information, all of the old "epidemics" were caused by malthusian-predicted societal outgrowths of food supplies with its subsequent malnutrition. The rats and fleas and bugs are still with us but the "epidemics" are all gone. Robert has been hoodwinked by the germ theory of disease [upon which a criminal industry depends] he joins the ranks of other historical victims of authoritarian propaganda based upon belief systems such as Ptolemy's flat-earth-centered universe. The germ theory of disease is such an incredibly stupid notion! It's like saying that flies cause manure piles and firemen cause fires. Doesn't anyone ever wonder why the doctors never "catch" all this stuff? In over thirty years of clinical practice I have never seen an infectious hepatitis "caught" by another member of a household and believe me when I say I really looked high and low for one of those. If I found one I would look for a source of the poisoning, not for a germ or a virus. The authors are victims of the germ theory propaganda that has about 85% of the world's "educated" population under its control.</i> Dr Daniel H Duffy Sr <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/325/7361/430#24962" class="external free" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/325/7361/430#24962" rel="nofollow">http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/325/7361/430#24962</a> <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 20:16, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What a curious description of <b>moving</b> the section.. And curious of course means POV.</dd>
<dd>The Thiomersal article was left quite a nice article about a chemical, with a link to the material here - which has a body of agrement on teh talk page there - where I suggested the move. Nothing is lost, and this arrangement is at least as good as at least two others. I think the material beliongs together, and I think teh good faith of this anonymous editor User:86.10.231.219 is not something one should assume, in this topic. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 02:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section about the thimerosal debate has nothing to do with anti-vaccinationists. The thimerosal issue is about banning the use of a neurotoxin (mercury in the form of thimerosal) in vaccines. It is not about banning the use of the vaccines nor is it a crusade of principle but about preventing harm to infants by eliminating the neurotoxin and not about eliminating the vaccines.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a substnatial overlap in people and in arguments. That is a large connection. Lets see what other people think. Persuading Leiffen (who has a reputation for acting abruptly when some people might look to see what had been discussed and assess whether other people's opinions might have validity to revert it was not actually an action I would suggest indicates you respect him.

This applies even to criticisms or critics irrelevant to the editor's postulated "anti-vaccinationist" movement.</p>

<dd>You idiot. There are four anti-vaccinationist orgnaisations of historic record provided by John Scudamore, together with a zillion links to his pages and elsewhere, and a screed yeah long above here by people who may like to argue they are vaccine critics or whatever, but fit it well enough.

<dd>The 'Evidence of an agenda' is I think to ensure a well <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECite_a996.html" title="WP:Cite">WP:Cited</a> &amp; <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> article, with hard scientific evidence and a careful demolishing of the pseudoscience of anti-vaccination campaigners. Sure there are problems with vaccines: poor batch control on occasions, less than 100% protection given, loss of immunity over time, minor local reactions, reduction in individual benefit when the overall population vaccination level gets high and so provides herd-immunity effects (a somewhat selfish viewpoint which ignores any responsibility to others - whether to those unable to have a vaccine through immunosuppression or who through bad luck do not mount an protective immune response after their own vaccination). All the points just mentioned (and there are many more) are reasonable to consider, however 'Anti-vaccinationists' latch onto any &amp; all specific concerns, amplify them, add in additonal pseudoscience concerns (e.g. that germs don't cause disease), and then wrap the whole lot up in medical/government/money-grabbing-pharmaceuticals conspiracy theories. 'Anti-vaccinationists' try to present themselves as merely expressing reasonable concerns, but in reality have a belief system that means they selectively quote from the literature, ignore the overwhelming evidence that fails to support their worldview and consider anecdotal stories as more worthy than statistical data based on hundreds of thousands. As such they unfortunately stifle any reasonable debate on specific issues. The thimerosal issue was seized upon and became a large part of the anti-vaccination/anti-MMR campaign and so is quite legitimately included here (I accept that mercury's image is no longer as benign as it once was, what with schoolchildren no longer allowed to handle the liquid metal, mercury <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphygmomanometer.html" title="Sphygmomanometer">sphygmomanometers</a> being replaced by alternatives, but that does not automatically mean tiny amounts of a compound of an element are the cause of autism, Crohn's disease etc etc).<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:44, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another Midgeley deletion by merger. The Invisible Anon is correct, thimerosol hasn't any relevence on an anti-vaccine page. Also the attempt to put it here is to make out thimerosol critics are in the same camp as the anti-vaccinists. And since the POV of Midgley and co is to push the idea that anti-vax are mad, then you can see the game. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 09:30, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John, apart from the "deletion by merger" having made 3 pages out of two, IE an increase of one well-formed page, whcih is not what most of us call deletion, if you feel thimerosal critics are mad you now have a wonderful opportunity to troll(*) over to the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal_controversy.html" title="Thimerosal controversy">thimerosal controversy</a> page and say so. Not here, since Thiomersal now has after some cooperative editing a single paragraph. Which seems about right to me, given the other page.</dd>
<dd>It is very kind of you to credit me with that page, and I suppose my being bold may have encouraged it, but it was set up by Leifern who has a considerable pre-existing interest in the topic.

<dd>Pseudoscience? That would be an apt description for most of the epidemiological number games being played by government agencies and drug company sponsored studies. The comments above seem directed at vaccine critics, not at the 'anti-vaccinationist' straw man concocted here apparently for the sole purpose of its demolition in effigy. The part about stifling debate would almost be humorous, if only the entirely avoidable <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> wasn't so tragic. These who are stifling debate here are the same ones who also seem to condone the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_assassination.html" title="Character assassination">character assassination</a> of serious scientists like <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijendra_K._Singh_a9bb.html" title="Vijendra K.

This article has diversion and character assassination written all over it, starting right from the title. This article has little to do with building an encyclopedia, and everything to do with injecting the rigid hierarchical cultural bias of medical orthodoxy into the relatively pristine and egalitarian culture of the Wiki. Almost all of the arguments set forth in the article, apparently to simply deprecate vaccine critics, can actually be applied more readily to the medical establisment itself, because there are plenty of flawed studies that can be pointed out as clear evidence of the rampant <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> problems plaguing the research published in what were once prestigious medical journals. In contrast, the solid scientific evidence from small clinical studies, as well as the other compelling evidence including reports that autism is virtually non-existent in unvaccinated populations, provide hard examples of research areas of interest to vaccine critics that could be discussed rationally, if only all the red herrings --starting with the basic premise of this article-- were removed from the debate. It would be nice if subjects like the role of the immune system in neurodevelopment could be discussed with the learned representatives of the medical profession here who, instead, seem to spend most of their time deleting anything that even hints at questioning their authority. If any one of the medical professionals around the Wiki has expertise about the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enteric_nervous_system.html" title="Enteric nervous system">enteric nervous system</a>, for example, it would be nice to discuss with them how vaccines affect the 'gut brain'. It would be nice to be able to walk into places like the <a href="../../../m/2E/i/M.I.N.D._Institute_3242.html" title="M.I.N.D. Institute">M.I.N.D. Institute</a> and find literature about dietary advice for children on the autistic spectrum, rather than being told that science on the matter was, a couple years ago, too uncertain and too controversial to warrant distribution of such publications. Simply put, in terms of psychology, what the defenders of medical orthodoxy are doing, with this article in particular and throughout the Wiki's medical articles in general, equates more readily with <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_projection.html" title="Psychological projection">projection</a> of their very own scientific shortcomings, rather than rational debate. Efforts to penetrate straw man arguments with serious discussion usually seem to backfire, eliciting little more than mockery, taunting and baiting. Rather than simply deleting the outright attacks on vaccine critics featured in this article (the same way wholesale deletions have been made by defenders of medical orthodoxy), plenty of opportunity was allowed for toning down the pov, before this article eventually was put up for AfD. In contrast, the vaccine critics article, a title that would obviously be much more appropriate for the topic at hand, was shot down by AfD almost immediately, much like the knee jerk deletions that have increasingly plagued many vaccine articles in recent months. <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_King_f40c.html" title="Rodney King">Rodney King</a> once said something that seems like it needs to be said again here... <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 11:13, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great summary of this page Ombudsman. Even the title anti-vaccinationists grates and looks to have been a recent invention of vaccinators. Anti-vaccinists is better, and was used in the past. The whole aim is to make another page along the lines of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracism.html" title="Conspiracism">Conspiracism</a>, ie wackos, anyone anti-vaccine is by definition anti-science etc, so paranoid, mad etc. John Stauber spotlights the game: <i>"The first step in his strategy is to isolate and marginalize the radicals. They're the ones who see the inherent structural problems that need remedying if indeed a particular change is to occur. To isolate them, PR firms will try to create a perception in the public mind that people advocating fundamental solutions are terrorists, extremists, fearmongers, outsiders, communists, or whatever."</i> They didn't want the better term <i>vaccine critics</i> as they couldn't have played this game, and it <b>keeps out 90% of the vaccine critics,</b> as no vaccine critic wants to be labelled anti-vaccine (and you can see why when you come to Midgley's page). The section on Donegan is pure POV, and sums up the page.

Potato plant</div>

<pre>
Initially the food was treated by distrust, and was believed to be unhealthy and even <i>un-Christian</i>. 
This prevented widespread acceptance for a period,
</pre>
<p>But now of course we know that bits of potato are a vital component of a Spanish omelette and various tapas, and very nice they are to.</p>
<p>So:-</p>
<ul>
<li>are the intial responses quoted different for vaccination than for anything else?</li>
<li>are they imbalanced, in that on the stage at a meeting woudl be two men in dog collars, one for and one against, and certain literature only records that one was present.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the absence of contemporary sermons or Papal Bulls it would seem the situation at least needs to read "the Catholic church regards vaccination as a proper medical procedure, although at its introduction at least one priest had doubts." (Which leads on to who he was, what his doubts were, when they changed, and why".</p>
<p>There are far too many flavours of Protestants to handle, but it is quite clear <a href="http://ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Religious_and_cultural_aspects_of_medical_care" class="external autonumber" title="http://ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Religious_and_cultural_aspects_of_medical_care" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> that the Muslim and Jewish religious view is in favour of immunisation as of other medical activity - although there may be areligious element to the fuss in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kano.html" title="Kano">Kano</a> with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio.html" title="Polio">Polio</a>.

<p>It is high time to ascertain whether or not there is a consensus to either <b>rename</b> or <b>split</b> this article, or to <b>keep</b> this article (which may infer an assumption that it is brought up to npov standards and pared down for manageability). Presently, the content of the article is quite ambiguous, encompassing the entire gamut between anti-vax and vax critics subject areas. There are several comments over on the article's AfD supporting the renaming proposal. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:15, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are several not supporting renaming, and there are several opposing it. The Earth is round and the sky is blue. We may manage to agree on the latter proposition, provided it has no relevance to vaccination but in discussing the former the immediate response to Ombudsman's selective presentation of easily discernible fact is a weary one. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 12:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>An article called vaccine critics previously existed. It was written from a POV, found unsalvageable, and deleted. The POV was not the one that informs the initial writing of this article, which is not quite the same subject at present. Who wrote and contributed to the deleted article?</dd>
<dd>As I understand WP policy, as discussed on this page above, plurals are deprecated. Mutating Vaccine_critic<b>s</b> to Vaccine_critic produces a name that is unsatisfactory since there are at least three of them ... here. Vaccine_criticism would be possible, but <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism.html" title="Criticism">criticism</a> is in my book, producing a balanced view of the whole of an effort as was the brief inter alia of the ROyal COmmission in mid-nineteenth century, and probably by the Royal COllege of Physicians around that time in material as yet not bound into this nascent article, and alas, the anti-vaccinationists to hand and referred to herein.</dd>
<dd>GIven this is urging to do something already known (and I misdoubt remembered by Ombudsman) as well as deprecated, I find it hard to see it as argument for coperation and easier to see it as argument from a conclusion rather than toward one and intended to impede other people working together on this large and diffuse article. In due coruse elements of it should split off - I have started a sub-page on Swabi for instance...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at the AFD, the consensus at the moment is to keep the article with no renaming/splitting or other forms of unnecessary action you seem to be suggesting.

<dd>Excuse me splitting this comment. John, this is all very obvious to <b>you</b>, but I don't know how to emphasise more strongly than has already been done that it is not obvious to everyone. In particular, you may find it helpful to assume that the doctors here are all very stupid, completely ignorant of everything including history and biology, biased of course having been taught by a hundred generations of biased doctors all conspiring to put a warped world-view forward to their own benefit and the harm of the world, and actually <i>explain</i> some of it.</dd>
<dd>"Res ipsa loquitor" you may say, waving a hand at one of your collected articles, and yet, the thing does not speak to me in the same tongue in whcih it speaketh unto thou. More important (in our context here in teh encyclopedia - WP) is that the hypothetical future reader drawn not to the row going on at present, but to teh area of calm surrounding a well-crafted concensus NPOV article, will need to be spoken to in a tongue they understnad, and being posessed of only moderate curiosity and time, they will not want to scurry hither and thither excpet to check and dig deeper into the agreed story that in that possible future exists here. Res ipsa loquitor is reptty much outlawed in English court now, not because they are conducted in English rather than Latin and thus a barrister would have to say "the thing speaks for itself" but becuase it was recognised that in fact often a plaintiff having a plaster on his leg did not demonstrate that it was the defendant's fault he fell down those stairs.</dd>
<dd>I have in fact expended an effort which is beginning to appall me on providing an admittedly as yet imperfect facility in which the material offered, the views presented, the history of a past effort by an assortment of people can be aggregated and after testing for credibility and spelling presented coherently to the world, partly becuase it has not been done yet, and partly becuase I have a fleeting interest in it and partly becuase thre is a possibility that this stuff, the process, the material, the history , the underlying world-view may actually '<i>matter</i>.</dd>
<dd>Add what you say is relevant where I created space, please.</dd>
<dd>What instead I am getting is only adequately described by phrases I shall not commit to this record. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:06, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This could be an entertaining ding-dong, and a nice illustration of mutation of anti-vax to anti-vaccine and nit-picking on anti-vaccinationist and anti-vaccinist, but John recalled for us all that "in Smallpox days they used to call them anti-vaccinists" in the rfd argument, (note that there was then only one vaccine). I suspect his eclectic collection includes a copy of Webster, which in 1913 ... see the links demanded by another critic and which are now in the top paragraph of the article, on the use of the word (a <i>desperate</i> argument I'd say). TO distill a fact here, I have not been around since 1913, I am in fact young and dynamic, although not so young as to be immature, and the papers refernced discuss the topic - hence its appearance in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 14:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ombudsman's Unfounded Assertions, and contributions</span></h2>
<p>Ombudsman asserts that efforts have been made to tone down POV. I looked to see if Ombudsman had made any, and indeed to see if Ombudsman had actually contributed anything at all to this article.</p>
<p>On 28 Jan His Ommer made an alteration <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37065798" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37065798" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37065798</a> to the lead paragraph. He changed groups to "many groups" and narrowed the focus from vaccination to vaccination for herd immunity for public health. None of this was referenced. He also changed the name of the article to one that had previously been deleted and I think may have been one he wrote.</p>
<p>Apart from that, sicne then, the only contribution Ombod has made is to repeatedly insert the same tag, and refuse to offer any focus or improvement on any part of the article. THis is quite clearly his usual behaviour, and is disruptive and dishonest. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:56, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was that page. It was called vaccine_critics. It was, you tell us, as does ombudsman, about a different subject or group. It was deleted after due process. It seems to me a wholly unreasonable claim that this page is your work. If you think a page called vaccine critics about a different subject is useful then you are at liberty to actually write it. Then anyone may see what group it is about, and how they differ from other groups. Go forth and as a multiple write it.
