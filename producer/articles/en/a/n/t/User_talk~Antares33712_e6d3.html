<p>Ok, terrible joke. But I do seem to talk with you a lot.</p>
<p>I ran across the article on <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocal_weight.html" title="Vocal weight">vocal weight</a> which I think you created and which you've edited. I was a bit confused by a few of the classifications in that article, several of which I've never heard of and can't find used anywhere else. I'm asking various folks who've been involved in that article to drop by <a href="../../../v/o/c/Talk%7EVocal_weight_1fec.html" title="Talk:Vocal weight">Talk:Vocal weight</a> and see if they can't give me a hand. Many thanks. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifamilymang_ce87.html" title="User:Antifamilymang">George</a> 03:00, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I've reverted your change to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnie_Ripperton_21e1.html" title="Minnie Ripperton">Minnie Ripperton</a> page. For as long as I've watched the page, people have attributed various pitch ranges to her without citing any sources. While I appreciate your attempt to be more resonable by citing liner notes from one of her albums, liner notes are unfortunatley not trustworthy on this topic. As you're doubtless aware, liner notes are promotional material written by a combination of the musicians, producers, promotional departments, and so on. They are in no way an objective assessment of anything, except in some cases the lyrics as they were originally written.</p>
<p>While I have no objection to listing a number for Ripperton's pitch range, it <i>must</i> be from an objective source. Inflation in this area is utterly rampant in pop music circles, particularly among female soul/R&amp;B singers and even more particularly among those who use the whistle register. Given that, promotional material created by people who have an interest in making the singer look as good as possible are simply not adequate. I do thank you for your interest in this area, though, and look forward to hearing more from you. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifamilymang_ce87.html" title="User:Antifamilymang">George</a> 23:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anteres, what is the purpose of Template:Singers who can access the whistle register?

<dd>Anteres, I'm not an admin, so I can't delete it myself. If you put the {{speedy}} tag on it though with a comment that it was a mistake it will be quickly cleared away. <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a> 16:23, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No problem. Examples are great, but become lists too quickly in this medium and unbalance the article. Something similar has to be done with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_actor.html#Notable_character_actors" title="Character actor">character actor#Notable character actors</a>, which is completely out of hand.</p>

<p>Just so you know, in retrospect even though I disagreed with the merits of keeping the article I agreed that greater thought should be put in before deletion and I was about to change it to vfd, however the article had already been deleted.

<li>Unfortunately, someone speedy-ed it and I'm <b>NOT</b> happy. What is the purpose of fighting and agreeing to rewrite something if it only gets speedy-ed by someone pointing to a Vfd (that I wasn't a part of). IF I repost (adding what we discussed), and it gets speedy-ed again, then I'll be labeled a vandal.

<li>Angel Daniel Figueroa is the one I was talking about. You had it on VfD and then switched it back to speedy. No administrator <i>should</i> delete it under the rules (although administrators are human, too, so you may get your wish).

<p>Is there any way we can create a page to have a consensus on what we are reporting as far as vocal statistics. The reason I ask is, I thought about it over the weekend, and I believe we may be approaching this from a multitude of different angles. My reason for debate for example, on the Minnie profile, it says highest and lowest note. Those are the highest and lowest <b>recorded</b> notes, so far anyway. We don't know what she hit in the shower<b>!</b> Is that her TOTAL range? No, her published range is five (5.5 per her Petals legacy album). I think if we stuck to the highest recorded note, lowest recorded note, and a vocal range per record label website (if possible), a lot of the bickering would stop. Maybe not with Britney, but most.... <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 15:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good day Antares, and thank you for raising some very good questions! If there is an officially published range for any artist, we should definitely include that within the article and then <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> it as the source. Furthermore, if you can provide a scan of the album cover, this could be uploaded to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a> to put quash any further reverts on this particular article. As for the others, I'm afraid we still need to provide some form of reference for our information to avoid falling under the umbrella of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 16:00, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you do a search on Minnie or Mariah, it will say five octave range. Using <a href="http://www.music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16117745" class="external free" title="http://www.music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16117745" rel="nofollow">http://www.music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16117745</a>, and <a href="http://www.music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16074698" class="external free" title="http://www.music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16074698" rel="nofollow">http://www.music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16074698</a> as examples, we can easily derive the range. But if you see, D3 - F#7 does not equal five octaves. That is because the low and high notes listed are only for <b>recorded</b> notes. So when someone says her range is 4.3 octaves (D3-F#7), I go and try to correct that, since I know (have known for a long time), since she is well-known for having a five-octave range. The range is only recorded, so I would rather we have protected the section and discuss range changes first. The most edits come from the least knowledgable. It part isn't fair. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 16:26, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 11% for major edits and 17% for minor edits. (Based on the last 142 major and 150 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<p>Let me first say that I agree with you wholeheartedly! I personally think the statement is not POV, but even under the guidelines of POV it can be introduced as such. I will take the time to read all the concerned pages regarding the editing of articles before I prepare a formal response. I am certainly not pleased with the handling of this article for some time by some specific people and we have been trying to compromise without success, there are many ways by which bias can be inflicted on an article and as expected the more power you have the more ways. I sent you an email a few days ago but I do not know if you got it, please drop me a word at rebel.crusader@gmail.com or at my talk page.Rebel.crusader 01:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not an administrator, but that's irrelevant. The first and third webpages you linked to are copies of previous versions of the Wikipedia article; the second makes no mention of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine. Additionally, you'll also need a source for the statement "this may be in fact be a misstatement of the fact she sings in the seventh octave", otherwise it qualifies as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. It is written in the book <i>She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul</i> (2002) that Carey has an eight-octave vocal range; even if this weren't true, the book appears to be reliable so it's worth mentioning the fact that different sources report different things. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 22:19, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why do we need a CITE to hear a pitch? I guess this is were I have a problem because like it or not, the entertainment companies are not packing them in to test their abilities scientifically.

<dd>Crap, I just realized what actually happened. There used to be a Piccolo (coloratura) page, and then it got {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">prod</a>}}ed. (I would have no way of knowing about this if it weren't for the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> cache—would be nice if they left a note on the talk page or something when they deleted something through PROD.) The reason given was apparently that <i>piccolo</i> isn't a recognized term for a coloratura. I guess if that's the case, it's best to remove that usage from the disambiguation page entirely, so I'll go ahead and do that. Let me know if you disagree. —<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a><a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaesura_b24c.html" title="User talk:Caesura"><sup>(t)</sup></a> 14:49, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sure, that's reasonable. If it's going to be on the disambiguation page, though, it really needs to link to a relevant article. Disambiguation pages aren't supposed to contain "dictionary definitions". So I guess, in my view, our options are to either</p>

<li>go through <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> to try to get the deletion of Piccolo (coloratura) overturned or</li>

This is a topic I know absolutely nothing about (the only reason I've been keeping an eye on <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccolo_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Piccolo (disambiguation)">Piccolo (disambiguation)</a> is that I play the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccolo.html" title="Piccolo">piccolo</a>), which is why I'm bugging you about it.</li>

<p>I have restore the section on voice that you ha removed. Whilst it needed references, I feel that it would have been better to {fact} or {cite} rather than remove an entire section. This is especially true since some of the information in that section has remained in place since April. Checking on the talk page, it turns out that IMDB at least can be used to somewhat substanciate the claims. Added the IMB reference, going back now to {cite} the section. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 12:45, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't have a problem with the note requiring a cite, but requiring a cite to show she is soprano (when she said on some program about Toni raxton that she was always the highest and demonstrating coloratura technique, you're reversions are silly. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see she is a soprano, unless you are now trying to assert she is a contralto (which would be very absurd) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 16:01, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I killed the remaining pages in Whistle register and Seventh octave, so we can just let the categories go. Right about now, I am sick of Wikipedia! 216.141.226.190 02:46, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added you to my friends list on AIM just so ya know. And yes If you need any help with a site, I'd be happy to help. I'm getting tired of this whole wikipedia thing too. It was good while people cooperated at making the whistle register category a good one. <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMyke209_395a.html" title="User:Myke209">Myke</a> 11:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm at work right now, so I shouldn't write an authoritive response. However I saw your message to me, and thought I would acknowledge it. You'll see from article histories that I originally opposed the changes by Miessier Food bringer, until his reasoning was explained to me. The problem with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> is that if an artist or other living person threw a hissy fit over a claim, apparently kind or otherwise, wikipedia gets in trouble. I generally err on the side of inclusion with {fact} tagging, however I ended up in a rather crazy debate instead which has taken far too long to realise the problem is with defficiencies with current policies. However therein lies a dilemma - to {fact} one unproven claim on a living person would be to allow all unproven claims as long as they are {fact} tagged.</p>
<p>You made some good points about the whistle register and aquiring proof - I would suggest you post them on the talk page, or perhaps one of the many places for policy discussion. Although I've sided with the safer interpretation of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, I have to say this whole thing has been quite stupid, and I'm keen on getting some more sensible resolution. I'm also one of the parties involved less likely to say a wildly provocative comment (and mix up supersets and subsets&#160;:P). If you tell me were any discussion about this issue lies (if other than on the catagory talk page), I'll come in and prod people to see if we can get a sane resolution.</p>
<p>You may also wish to suggest using the wayback machine internet archives to reach the site you talked about, and use wayback references. This entire mess would have been much less hassle if that site had been mentioned earlier. With respect to self-publishing proof, if any of those involved happened to be a recognised musical academic or analyst and could place the information in a respected source, then I think at least this one would try and sneak it in&#160;;) (a respected source by a qualified person is a respected source by a qualified person, tbh)</p>
<p>The adding of {fact} to a claim made in the talk page was not my doing. I suspect it was down to some guideline changes currently being discussed on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia_talk%7ETalk_page_guidelines_7ccc.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia_talk:Talk_page_guidelines</a>. Personally, I'm currently nuetral in the matter. Whilst {fact} tags may help to visually remind people involved in long and bitter arguments that some substance is needed, I also worry about how it may enrage people to have there comments edited. Infact, I would very much appreciate it if you would go there and state your annoyance at it, and how you would have prefered a response asking for references instead (obviously, you probably would have prefered nothing, but assume that they would have done something). The person backing this change is being very optomistic about how people would react to such changes.</p>
<p>Before I finish, can I ask you to join me in encouraging all involved in this, well, farce, to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> and avoid <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">personal attacks</a>? Whilst on a quick glance over the exchanges you appear to have been fairly cool, some others on all sides have not. I find this terribly tragic, since being polite tends to help you get listened to and generally promotes healthy discussion far better than slurs.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to encourage you again to look to discussing the problems with the guidelines and policies. As I have stated, the problem lies with these (both the interpretation, and the absense of how to deal with issues such as obviousness to the experienced). I likely will support sensible changes in this regard which perserve the spirit originally intended (although I stop short of saying that I definately will), and back you up on the reasons for changes being needed.</p>
