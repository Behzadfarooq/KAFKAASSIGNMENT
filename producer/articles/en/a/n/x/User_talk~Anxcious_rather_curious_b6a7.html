	    <p>here is a few simple answers on how to kiss by a variety of different people</p>
<p>You close your eyes, tilt your head one way, he should tilt his head the other way and then your heads should get closer and closer then your lips should meet. Your lips should be closed and you should pucker then just a little and that's how you do a simple kiss.</p>
<p>Pucker your lips a little bit, then press them gently against the other person's neck, smooch. Then do the shoulder. Then back to neck, then lick their ear some, then kiss their lips.</p>
<p>just put ur lips on his and give him soft kisses in the beginnin, then slowly increase it but openin ur lips apart and lockin with his.. then once u get in the proces slip in ur tongue if u wish and scroll it is and around his mouth</p>
<p>well you can lure him into kissing you if You look into his eyes deeply. Remember..When he stares too much into your eyes, u blink then lower ur face and start gazing again.. this is a hint to the person U like him.. After a while,u purposely stare at his lips when he is looking into ur eyes. U have to sweet talk in a beautiful manner and a soft tone. If he feels shy..its about time you move ur face forward a little looking into his eyes… But dont go bang his lips.. this is going to surely tempt him and he is now in deep thinking whether to kiss you or NOT..the next time you look at his lips while he'z staring at u…he goes pale…DANG! baby..u're about to conquer his heart Rest is suspence..coz if you have the proper hormones u'll know what to do in a situation like this..It is always best if the male makes his first move…</p>
<p>Look for positive body language. Eye contact, uncrossed arms and a head tilted towards you are all good signs. Maintain eye contact as you close in. Try not to close your eyes until after you’ve established that all-important lip contact. Tilt your head. Avoid the nose bump! At first, just press your lips gently against your date’s. Avoid sucking his or her breath. Or drooling on them. Now is not a good time to faint. Release and look into your date’s eyes. If he or she looks away, you should probably stop right there. If they look back and smile? Well, then, vive l’amour!</p>
<p>Think short and sweet with a hint of passion. Also, make sure that there is some other body contact. Putting your arms around each other is nice, but if it seems to be too much, holding hands works too. Whatever you do, do not venture in to the realm of french kissing, but opening your mouth ever so slightly adds an element of intimacy. This kiss should last more than a second but less than 15 seconds. Too long and you run the risk of sending an undeniable "I am in to you!" message. Too short and you may give the person an unintended brush off</p>
<p>Start with a gentle closed mouth peck and move on to something a little more inviting - open mouth but no tongue. Try to keep your lips soft, not too puckered, and make sure that your arms are around your partner. A couple of kisses in a row is a nice idea. Try not to let this kiss linger too long or you may find yourself making out. Making out with a crush too quickly has spelled doom to many could-have-been romances. Make sure the kiss has a definite end and that you both stay on the same planet as the rest of the party-goers.</p>
<p>It is often thought that if a man communicates his feelings he is soft and has let his guard down. There is a perception that the manly thing to do is to not show or verbalize emotion. This is a completely inappropriate attitude to have. Men have feelings too, and to verbalize this is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength and a sign that men have managed to evolve. But still some men can’t see past this. Therefore it is important that you don’t take his lack of communication as a sign he doesn’t like you. This concept goes both ways too, because women are so used to opening up it might be a little overbearing if you let all your built up emotions out all at once. It would be better to take it slowly.</p>
<p>Kissing is kind of an art that comes with practice but there are some techniques you can do.</p>
<p>1)Try to take smaller kisses. This is a good rule of thumb as no one likes having another person's tongue shoved down their throat.It doesn't mean you have to take short pecks but you don't have to have to keep kissing till you almost pass out either.Just moderate the time for each kiss. Somewhere around 30 sec per kiss is a good place to start. As more practice comes you can find the times that work for you.</p>
<p>2)Aim for the bottem lip. If the guy is taller then you aiming for the bottem lip is good place to start a kiss. Licking the bottem lip is way to get him to open his own mouth. Also sucking on his bottem lip as you release a kiss can drive a guy wild. It's just a quick suck to tease him a bit for the next kiss.</p>
<p>3)Don't try to overcome his mouth with yours.It his job to do that. All you really have to do is give him an opening to your own mouth. You can do this just by following the tip above.</p>
<p>Quick Fix: If its getting a bit slobbery around the edges make a joke a about it. Like "Whoa there, we've got plenty of time" and then take it a little bit slower. You don't have to go fast if its your first time. You can always practice these tips and others on your hand by making a fist and tucking your thumb under your fingers.</p>
