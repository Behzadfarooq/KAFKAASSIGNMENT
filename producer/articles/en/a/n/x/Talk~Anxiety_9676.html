The Anxiety page should <b>not</b> just be merged into this one, (1)It doesn't have any meaningful content on its own, and (2)this article is more accurately named the Anxiety Disorder page.</p>

<dd>Anxiety is a symptom, anxiety disorder is a disorder. You can have anxiety without having an anxiety disorder, though I guess you can't have an anxiety disorder without anxiety.

<p>Anxiety itself is a complicated concept in psychology and psychiatry. Anxiety in itself is <b>not</b> a psychiatric disorder. Anxiety is one of the basic emotions, and it plays a major role in classical fear conditioning. Debilitating anxiety can be present as a symptom of a mental health disorder (not the least of which are the anxiety disorders), but anxiety is not merely an emotion of abnormal mental processes. When a psychiatrist says someone's problem is anxiety, that is only shorthand for an anxiety <b>disorder</b> (i.e., an overreaction of anxiety; the emotion of anxiety is in disorder for the patient). By and large, this article currently covers anxiety disorders and not the pure emotion; the current contents should be moved to <a href="../../../a/n/x/Anxiety_disorder.html" title="Anxiety disorder">Anxiety disorder</a> and an article dealing with anxiety <i>per se</i> should replace it.--<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.217.183.224.html" title="User:24.217.183.224">24.217.183.224</a> 08:33, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is palliative care really an alternative medicine? Considering one of the oldest, most mainstream centre's in the world, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, has had a <i>Integrative Medicine Service</i> for close to 5 years now. Where do we draw the line between alternative and <i>mainstream</i> medicine? AstroBlue 14:55, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, palliative care is about complementary medicine rather than alternative medicine. Second, it is 'where do you' draw the line rather than where <i>mainstream</i> medicine draws a line. Clearly many physicians are in favor of it. And, clearly some are not.</dd>

<dd>I'm not discounting the validity of the survey (my point was not in regard to the survey at all). I was questioning the semantics of "<i>The strongest connection can be found in complementary medicine which is well known for using palliative care to treat cancer patients. Some research has strongly suggested that treating anxiety in cancer patients improves their quality of life.</i>" and putting it under the title of <b>Anxiety and alternative medicine</b>. When palliative care encompasses far more than just previously alternative medicines. A low dose of radiation to the spine of a patient with a cord-compression is seen as palliative care, a visit to a counsellor or psychologist regarding anxiety is considered palliative care. Would you consider them alternative or complementary? And considering mainstream Oncology's mantra has been "holistic care" for a good 10 years now, and "complementary medicine" has been practiced in one of the most conservative and "old school" centres in the world. Can you really put that under the title of alternative medicine? It's complementary medicine at the least, and integrative medicine at the most. AstroBlue 08:16, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the survey itself, "The denominators used in the calculation of percents [in table 3] are the estimated number of adults who used CAM (excluding megavitamin therapy and prayer) within the past 12 months, excluding persons with unknown information about whether CAM was used to treat the specific condition" (footnote, p 9). I believe this means that <i>4.5 percent of CAM-using adults</i> used CAM to treat anxiety (not "4.9 percent of the population" as currently stated in this article).

<dd>Yes, it is an anxiety disorder. When sufferers do not do the compulsion, they report a feeling of anxiety. Or they use the compulsions to manange anxiety. It's a bit like phobias in a way - sufferers of phobias feel they must get away. --Nervous neuron 05:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From a psychonutritional point of view OCD is part of the complex of anxiety disorders because when you test them with the Medical Test for Hypoglycemia they usually test positive to hypoglycemia. Thus OCD patients tend to be hypoglycemic and therefore tend to overproduce adrenaline. Adrenaline can be considered a <b>focusing</b> hormone, compelling people to focus on something.This is part of being <b>compulsive</b> <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJurplesman_dba2.html" title="User:Jurplesman">Jurplesman</a> 05:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is an ongoing controverse in the scientific community about wheter OCD is to be classified as an anxiety.</p>
<p>DSM sais it to be, ICD (by the united nations) sais it does not.</p>
<p>From practice, we have a lot of parallels not only in the feelings of people suffering from OCD and anxiety but in the (possible) medication as well. So we may conclude that there are similar neurochemical processes in those deseases.</p>
<p>There may be a sub-group of anxieties that are quite close to OCD. At least that's what I see in my practice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wouldn't include OCD in the anxieties. Rather create sort of an related-topics-link.</p>

<p>In the treatment section there is one line that mentions CBT. The rest of the section is mostly about drugs. I understand it's perhaps more convenient to pop a pill every day for the rest of your life than to go see a shrink. But is there evidence that drugs are considerably more effective than good CBT? Besides there are other benefits to CBT other than recovery, such as learning life skills. There are also very good cognitive-behavioral programs some people swear by, such as the one from the Midwest Center. The great thing about these programs is that if you need a "tune-up" it's very easy to get one. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 22:48, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there a scientific way to determine if you have an "actual" disorder or (I suppose) just a made-up one? NVM, I'll take a shot at fixing the section myself. I should do some research on comparative effectiveness. I don't see any clear indications either way. BTW, CBT and talk therapy are not the same. And there are many different kinds of CBT. For example, there's one type of CBT that seems to be particularly effective in treating depression. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 16:43, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the article says "Mainstream treatment for anxiety consists of the prescription of anxiolytic agents and/or referral to a cognitive-behavioral therapist." but as far as I know in most cases SSRIs are used as main stream especially in OCD and GAD. anxiolytic agents are used as the first choice when a patient comes to emergency with an attack.

<dd>This needs clarification, OCD is classified as GAD and its treatment is in most cases SSRI used in combination or alone to CBT, on the other hand, when anxiety doesn't appear to have sign of obsessive or compulsive behavior anxiolytic agents are tried, but due to the dependence and the need to increase the dosage, CBT is favoured. But those are not the only treatment, in some cases, when in cases of severe social-phobia, uncontrolable depersonalization/derealization and the patient doesn't respond, atypical anti-psychotics at lower dosage might be tried. Anxiety treatment depending on the severity or the type is a case by case matter, but when taken 'anxiety alone' it is generally known that meanstream treatment includes anxiolytic agents and/or CBT. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is intensity of a feeling a negative motivation. Emotional state caused by a situation that is seen as threatening (wood 1998) involves worry that failure might accrue. Negative thoughts we may experience.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
What are the signs of anxious performer? Body Mind Shaky, cold, sweaty, heart beats faster, feel sick, feel dizzy, breathing heavy, pacing up and down, butterfly’s, sweaty palms Saying things in your mind like I can’t do it, negative thoughts, frighten, mood swings.</p>

<p>Wikipedians, I am being treated for psychotic anxiety, but can find no information on this anywhere on the internet. It is referred to in academic journals, but I have no access to the content. Searches are also complicated by the frequent use of the term "non-psychotic anxiety", which shows up as a hit for "psychotic anxiety". I would really appreciate someone adding information about psychotic anxiety to this article, and also adding information about the use of antipsychotics for treating anxiety (this treatment is becoming more common, even for non-psychotic anxiety, or so I hear). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.195.115.100_a1ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.195.115.100">62.195.115.100</a> (talk) 12:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
