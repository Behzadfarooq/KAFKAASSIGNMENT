<p>Well, Hooker, Henry &amp; Cranmer are hugely important figures that helped to make Anglicanism what it is. I think these are the types of folks to list. Maybe Elizabeth I? <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 12:19, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder how appropriate it is to link to the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_York_2903.html" title="Archbishop of York">Archbishop of York</a>. The <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> is the "symbolic head of the worldwide <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>", but the Archbishop of York doesn't really have any relevance outside England, does he?</p>
<p>Also, maybe there could be an "Issues" heading, with entries for things like <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_views_of_homosexuality.html" title="Anglican views of homosexuality">Anglican views of homosexuality</a>? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 06:24, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Issues are transitory; here today, gone tomorrow. I'm not sure that's a grand idea. Canterbury &amp; York are the two archbishoprics, York being the #2 guy in the communion behind Canterbury (I think...I'm not Anglican). We can certianly take York off the template if necessary. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 12:15, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My 2 cents. About the first issue, I agree with Angr, the Archbishop of York is significant only to the CoE. If York is on the list the ECUSA Presiding Bishop should be also...etc. Also, I think that issues could be interesting if it was related to Anglican distinctivness. The ordination of women could be worked in here somehow...let me think about it. --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 15:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Canterbury is nice, but very CoE. This is <i>Anglicanism,</i> so I think we would all prefer something more universal. BCP is a good idea... --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 02:55, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just received an email from Jim Rosenthal, director of communications for the Anglican Communion. He told me that thej compass rose symbol is licensed "to all who write about, illustrate, or promote churches and institutions of the official Anglican Communion. Misuse would be challenged." It is stil unclear to me whether this allows use in a "neutral point of view" encyclopedic setting, especially one of the bredth of Wikipedia. It might be best to leave things as they are for the moment. --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 19:57, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tested the template with both images, and while I would prefer to use a BCP image, the first is not centered, and the 2nd is too dark. In my opinion anyway.

<p>Please see the discussion at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2007_February_9_2852.html#Template:Anglicanism2" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 February 9">Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 February 9#Template:Anglicanism2</a>. I think it raises an interesting point, namely, whether the photo of Canterbury Cathedral on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Template%7EAnglicanism_64c0.html" title="Template:Anglicanism">Template:Anglicanism</a> needs to be changed, or whether the template needs to be removed from articles on churches outside the Communion, as defined by its principal instrument of unity, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Part of me wants to say that you cannot claim to be Anglican while being outside the ambit of Canterbury - which I think has a lot of theological justification. On the other hand, I am congnizant of the right of subjects to self-identify. I cannot claim to be able to put the Anglicanism tag on articles relating to Catholicism over the objections of Roman Catholics if I cannot also allow self-professed Anglicans to use the same tag on articles relating to their churches. But a straw vote on what the community feels would, perhaps, be instructive.</p>

<li><b>Support</b>: Even the schismatic churches once recognized the authority of Canterbury, so it's appropriate to them as well even once they no longer do. I notice the same image is being used on {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_British_Christianity_741b.html" title="Template:History of British Christianity">History of British Christianity</a>}} and therefore appears without apparent controversy on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Template%7EHistory_of_British_Christianity_ac21.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:History of British Christianity">several non-Anglican-related pages</a>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 09:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Photo to be changed, apply to all relevant articles</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>: We cannot pick and choose who gets to call themselves Anglican, but it is inappropriate to imply that Canterbury has anything to do with groups that have broken away from the Communion. Articles on breakaway churches need to note that they are outside the Communion, and templates such as <a href="../../../a/n/g/Template%7EAnglican_Churches_2912.html" title="Template:Anglican Churches">Template:Anglican Churches</a> should not be appended to these articles. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 22:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>: I'm not completely comfortable with this choice. I'd rather be more partisan. But ... there is also the question of historical articles related to Anglicanism which depart from contemporary Anglican doctrine. For example, articles on the Book of Common Prayer before 1662 could be excluded from the Anglicanism project because they do not represent prayer books officially used by any church in the Anglican Communion. My argument may sound silly but I'd rather see a more inclusive Anglicanism project. Changing the picture to something generically Anglican that does not give comfort to the schismatics but brands Anglicanism would be best. How about a cartoon or simple logo depicting the Book of Common Prayer, itself? Cheers! Wassupwestcoast 02:20, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>: If the project and infobox were about the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a> - there would not be a problem with having Canterbury as an image - however, this a template on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicanism.html" title="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>, therefore the schismatic Churches possibly (probably?) have a right to refer to themselves as <i>Anglican</i>. I understand the problem with the schismatic Churches, as in what defines <i>Anglicanism</i> but arguing about revoking the right of the Churches to call themselves <i>Anglican</i> opens a similar problem to the great <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> naming debate - in the sense of what defines the term Anglican... Although I feel Canterbury is a fairly harmless image, it would probably be (ugh...) <i><a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">politically correct</a></i> to change it...

<li><b>Comment</b>. If I read the TfD debate correctly, the photo is the only thing people want changed. Just make the image used an optional argument.

<li>Isn't it possible that at present the template is massively overused? What if we only put it on the pages to which it links? (Making it a navigation box for within the set of key Anglicanism articles, just like the churches of the communion template is a navigation box for within the set of those churches.) This isn't my formal opinion, just a rumination. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 05:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This, on the other hand, is my formal opinion: the BCP as an image is a non-starter. It simply isn't visually catchy— and, moreover, nothing marks any old book as the BCP besides the words on the cover; relying on words is not what an illustration is about. What *image* says 'Anglican'&#160;? <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 05:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

As far as cassock and surplice, I thought it was a nice example of something which is middle-ground: simultaneously liturgical and ceremonious without being high church (like albs and chasubles and suchlike are — after all, the low churchers were wearing cassock and surplice as they fought to prevent these innovations). <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 18:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps the Hooker statue (shown below) is best— 1) influential figure; 2) wearing distinctly Anglican garb; 3) cathedral in background <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 21:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agree, the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hooker_28e0.html" title="Richard Hooker">Hooker</a> statue is probably the most appropriate image - although I personally would prefer it if the photo were cropped a little, it looks a little odd to me at an angle (<a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitpicking.html" title="Nitpicking">nitpicking</a> there...) — <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 16:31, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The content may be anglican; but the visual screams eastern orthodox.

<dd>Hooker is photographed in front of a <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeter_Cathedral_6181.html" title="Exeter Cathedral">cathedral of the Anglican Communion</a>!

<p>Of the choices above I like Cranmer the best. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 06:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, Cranmer is probably the safe choice, although I'm now thinking it doesn't really matter and Canterbury is perfectly acceptable... Hmmmm — <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 16:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't like the Cranmer image. I just went to the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hooker_28e0.html" title="Richard Hooker">Richard Hooker</a> article and thought "why am I looking at an image of Cranmer?". So may I suggest the Bishop's mitre I've included in the gallery? --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 03:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've replaced Cranmer with the Mitre. I'm happy to let others remove it if you don't like it. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 03:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
