<p>Hi Angie: Thank you for your interest in the <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zord.html" title="Zord">Zord</a> page. Sadly, I have deleted your new section entitled Fictional Zords because it only contained a reference to your "spoof of MMPR, caled <i>Strong Transformin Irken Rangers</i>". Your post at <a href="http://www.badbadrubberpiggy.com/vBulliten/archive/index.php/t-3352.html" class="external text" title="http://www.badbadrubberpiggy.com/vBulliten/archive/index.php/t-3352.html" rel="nofollow">The Babble</a> shows that this is still a work in progress . Unpublished fan fiction is not encyclopedic and there is a Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_page" class="extiw" title="w:Vanity_page">convention that counsels editors against submitting nmaterial about themselves or their projects</a>. I see that you have enhanced Wikipedia with other contributions about MMPR so I trust that your enthusiasm for this encyclopedia will be undimmed by this deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 12:17, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! Just noticed you were creating some pages about Invader Zim characters. However, please note that most of that information is already in the main <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invader_Zim_0ae3.html" title="Invader Zim">Invader Zim</a> article, and that the current policy on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">Fictional characters</a> is that, in cases like this, that's where they should be. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 17:10, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I thought I'd explain my rationale for removing the links to the minor Mary Poppins characters. As mentioned in the above message re:Invader Zim, there is a guideline (I wouldn't call it a policy as done above) that minor characters be covered within a main article, rather than having individual articles written about them. Although a case can be made for an article on Mary Poppins, the character, by rights it would probably be seen as a duplicate of the main article. Bert could perhaps get an article -- if he was a major, ongoing character in the Poppins books, but I understand the movie character was an amalgam of several characters. The fact there are already articles on Mr. and Mrs. Banks is a bit of an anomaly, but they were major, ongoing characters in the book series so they might survive. An article on Ellen the maid or Mrs. Brill the cook would probably spark a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">votes for deletion</a> process under the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines. If you still want to create articles of the minor characters, please by all means go ahead, but please make sure they have substantial content ... and perhaps be prepared to have to merge them into the main Mary Poppins article if enough people object. PS. Mary Poppins and Invader Zim aren't unique cases -- <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> characters are also undergoing similar scrutiny.

<p>A few says ago you added a mention of the use of "bitch" in the "slang" section. I added a qualification, because in my part of the world (the East Midlands) and elsewhere the word "bitch" is often used by women to each other in the way that men will sometimes use "bastard" — that is, in an affactionate and joshing way, or sometimes as a rebuke that is neverthless much milder than when the term is used in other parts of the country. For example, a mother might call her daughter a silly bitch, or a daft bitch. (This has sometimes taken visitors aback, as you can imagine.)</p>

<p>Hi! Just noticed your recent edits to the List of All That Characters and there was some great stuff there, but I had to take out anything that was just speculation. Just so you know, it's probably better to edit multiple items at once than to do a whole lot of consecutive small edits. By the way, Kevin Kopelow was a writer &amp; producer on the show, not actually the stage manager. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptHayfever_007c.html" title="User:CaptHayfever">CaptHayfever</a></p>

<p>Hi, Angie. I ran across the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Category%7EInvader_Zim_characters_4bbe.html" title="Category:Invader Zim characters">Category:Invader Zim characters</a> in <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html#Lists_of_fictional_characters_in_specific_works_or_series" title="Fictional character">Fictional character#Lists of fictional characters in specific works or series</a>, had the impression you intended the Cat to show up as a list under Simpsons, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fictional_character&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=14090885" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fictional_character&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=14090885" rel="nofollow">fixed it</a> (by adding a colon inside the brackets, as i also did just above; this creates a link ("lk") to that page, instead of putting the article into that category.) (Ignore the "summary" for that edit, which was the result of hitting Save by accident just after accidentally pasting in the wrong text.)<br />
You may want to look at how it came out, and move it around to achieve what you actually had in mind.<br />
I also noticed that the Cat's articles mostly have titles that end in "(Invader Zim character)"; there are two things worth saying about that:</p>
<ol>
<li>When parentheses are needed, what goes inside them only has to distinguish what kind of thing it is (in this case a character from "Invader Zim"), or what context it occurs in (in this case the "Invader Zim" stories). In this case, just specifying the context with, e.g., <a href="../../../t/a/k/Tak_%28Invader_Zim%29_d8e9.html" title="Tak (Invader Zim)">Tak (Invader Zim)</a> would suffice, and the style of title that identifies what kind of thing the unparthenthesized portion is longer without any purpose. So <a href="../../../t/a/k/Tak_%28Invader_Zim%29_d8e9.html" title="Tak (Invader Zim)">Tak (Invader Zim)</a> would be the better choice of title; the same shortening would apply to the other articles in the category.</li>
<li>Parentheses are appropriate in a title (with exceptions so rare that it's hard to come up with a convincing example) only when they are needed. Dib needs them: <a href="../../../d/i/b/Dib.html" title="Dib">Dib</a> is a disambiguation page to route users who type "Dib", "dib", etc. in the box next to the "Go" button to either <a href="../../../d/e/v/Device-independent_bitmap.html" title="Device-independent bitmap">device-independent bitmap</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/b/Dib_%28Invader_Zim%29_f7f5.html" title="Dib (Invader Zim)">Dib (Invader Zim)</a>, so <a href="../../../d/i/b/Dib_%28Invader_Zim%29_f7f5.html" title="Dib (Invader Zim)">Dib (Invader Zim)</a> is the correct title. <a href="../../../t/a/k/Tak_%28Invader_Zim%29_d8e9.html" title="Tak (Invader Zim)">Tak (Invader Zim)</a> is also correct, because <a href="../../../t/a/k/Tak.html" title="Tak">Tak</a> is presently about a town; <a href="../../../t/a/k/Tak.html" title="Tak">Tak</a> needs to either be renamed to Tak, Thailand with the name <a href="../../../t/a/k/Tak.html" title="Tak">Tak</a> becoming a disambiguation, or to have a "top-of-page disambiguation" added at the top of the article on the town. <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zim.html" title="Zim">Zim</a>, on the other hand, should become the title of the article presently named <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zim_%28Invader_Zim_character%29_8d75.html" title="Zim (Invader Zim character)">Zim (Invader Zim character)</a>, since there is presently no competition for either the <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zim.html" title="Zim">Zim</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invader_Zim_0ae3.html" title="Invader Zim">Invader Zim</a> title.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have done a merge of <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zim.html" title="Zim">Zim</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invader_Zim_0ae3.html" title="Invader Zim">Invader Zim</a> articles' histories, in order to avoid the history of <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zim.html" title="Zim">Zim</a> being hidden under the redirect that was there. (A badly named article should be moved or merged, and merging and moves should not be done by cutting and pasting, or by writing a redirect over the existing article. Merging of histories and some moves require an admin (to delete some historyless redirects, and to temporarily delete an article in the process of merging histories). I would be glad, at least while you are learning the ropes, to do the appropriate deletions that you'll need, and in any case, you can request help at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>.

<p>Hi, Angie,</p>
<p>It's very important that when you upload images, you provide source and copyright information, in addition to a description. Images which have no source may be deleted. If an image is copyrighted, the person who owns the copyright needs to license it under a free license (especially <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>) for us to use it. We also might be able to use some items as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Fair use</a>. You can take a look at <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html" title="WP:ICT">WP:ICT</a> for some templates you can use to tag images. Please go back over your uploaded pictures and tag them with their source and copyright information. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to help. Thanks. <a href="../../../k/m/c/User%7EKmccoy_af23.html" title="User:Kmccoy">kmccoy</a> <a href="../../../k/m/c/User_talk%7EKmccoy_b427.html" title="User talk:Kmccoy">(talk)</a> 7 July 2005 01:58 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can you do that for me? It's way late where I am.</p>
<p>No, because I don't know where you got the photos or what their license status is. When you upload an image to Wikipedia, it's your responsibility to ensure that it is an image we can legally use. You need to label the images with their source and copyright information in order to meet that responsibility. If you don't, the images may be deleted. I'm happy to help you with it, but I will not and cannot do it for you. Thanks. <a href="../../../k/m/c/User%7EKmccoy_af23.html" title="User:Kmccoy">kmccoy</a> <a href="../../../k/m/c/User_talk%7EKmccoy_b427.html" title="User talk:Kmccoy">(talk)</a> 7 July 2005 04:50 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the last time I'm going to bring this up to you. Do NOT add information that exists solely in fanfiction to wikipedia, and do NOT add fan theories/speculation, either. It does not belong here, and I am getting very tired of wasting all of my time and effort removing it (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_Hart&amp;diff=18351114&amp;oldid=18275110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_Hart&amp;diff=18351114&amp;oldid=18275110" rel="nofollow">here</a>). If you continue to disregard consensus decisions and wikipedia policies, I will be forced to initiate action against you, which could result in you being partially or fully blocked from editing wikipedia. If you really feel the need to put this stuff somewhere, find somewhere on <a href="http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikicities" class="external text" title="http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikicities" rel="nofollow">Wikicities</a> (where they are more permissive of this kind of material), but STOP adding it here.

<p>I second the above remarks. Information is far more useful if it's organized, and Wikipedia has the custom of organizing minor characters from fiction into such lists as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons_08fd.html" title="List of recurring characters from The Simpsons">List of recurring characters from The Simpsons</a>.

<p>Angie: Several things: 1. Please stop creating articles about minor characters. They have adequate sections in the main article. This is a policy that has been explained to you repeatedly. If you want to create detailed fan articles about shows then please do so at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicities.html" title="Wikicities">Wikicities</a> or create your own wiki. 2. Please stop disambiguating articles with phrases like "(Invader Zim character)". "Professor Membrane" is a unique name.

<p>Following <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">Inshanee</a>'s request at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html#.28many.2C_many_pages_.28mostly_involving_the_Teen_Titans_.28animated_series.29_or_Invader_Zim.29" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">the page</a> I am contacting you to see if there is a possibility for solving this in a sensible manner. Please take a moment to review the request at the aforementioned page.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is to set up a medium for all editors involved to explain how they feel about what contributions should be included in Wikipedia and what should go. Obviously it is here your opinion differs with other editors so let's see if it is possible to come to a compromise. Nobody is accused here, I am merely here to mediate between you and the other editors, but I <i>am</i> an administrator. This means that I will not tolerate it if things get out of hand.</p>
<p>I am not sure if you are familiar with <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">mediation</a>. I suggest you take a look and find out what instance mediation is in the Wikipedia Dispute Process. The most important thing to remember when a mediator (such as myself) gets involved is that the mediator will almost always ask for compromises from every editor included in a dispute. This means you need to have an open mind and be ready to restrict any demands you might have. I am here to make sure that a working solution exists between two (or more) editors and that we reach a conclusion everyone can live with.</p>
<p>Please don't be alarmed, but mediation is always a good step to try before any administrative policies come into effect and/or the case escalates to the Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p>Feel free to review InShaneee's explanation on my <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInter_a37b.html" title="User talk:Inter">talk page</a> and feel free to respond there. I would suggest we keep the conversation to my talk page since so many articles are involved here.</p>

<dd>I'm taking my time to see if you are coming around, but I want to let you be aware that if you do not want to mediate, there are other options other editors can pursue if their beef with you is big enough.

<p>Hi Angie: I have just renamed <u>Violet Beauregarde (character)</u> to the simpler <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violet_Beauregarde_c69e.html" title="Violet Beauregarde">Violet Beauregarde</a> and fixed all the links to that page. You could help by doing this on the other pages with this kind of over-complex name. You simply MOVE the page to the new name, use "What links here" to find the pages linked to the old name, and change all those links to the new name. When all the links have been changed just leave me a note and I will delete the redundant redirect that will be left. I suggest that you start with a page that has only a few links. Squeak if you need help. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 23:05, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angie: I deleted your essay on gender politics in <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dexter%27s_Laboratory_c5db.html" title="Dexter's Laboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a> because that sort of thing is not encyclopedic. I am going to analyse the section here (with my opinions/comments in &lt;&gt;) so that you may understand my reasoning:</p>
<p>There's quite a few instances of male chauvinism, sexism and male dominance on the series. &lt;but no more than is normal for a US animated series about a nuclear family&gt; For example, Dexter consistently refers to her as just "woman" instead of saying her name and considers her and her friends to be "bothersome" and "irritating".&lt;a single statement in the section about Dexter to say that he is sexist would cover this&gt; The structure of their family is also very &lt;is it particularly extreme?&gt; chauvinistic; the father claims superiority as head of the household, above his wife, who is depicted as the stereotypical 1950s female homemaker. To some fans of the series, Dee Dee is treated poorly by her brother as well; he considers her to be very inferior and stupid.&lt;this is already covered in the section on Dexter&gt; He often says "<a href="../../../s/i/l/Silence.html" title="Silence">Silence</a>!" at her &lt;citing his precise phrasing is an undue level of detail&gt; whenever she is speaking to him, and even created a potion to mute her forever, but instead gave her a "monster potion".</p>
<p>By creating a separate section about an aspect of the show that is inherent to the social structure of its subject, you unbalance the article. This is a series about the extraordinary son of an ordinary American nuclear family. To emphasize its sexism is to suggest that it is more sexist than equivalent shows. Dexter's competition with Dee Dee is one-sided sibling rivalry. The creator's awareness of gender differences and stereotyping is a source of the humor but to emphasize gender conflict rather than other stereotyping could mislead the reader. If I have not been clear in any of this, just ask any questions here. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 09:35, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>At least put it in the discussion thread in the article. It's just my opinion, okay? I only wanted to help.</p>
<p>Hi Angie: I have absolutely no doubt that your aim is to help. That is why I am spending time explaining things carefully. I think that you have great things to offer to Wikipedia. It took me time to learn how things work around here and I was helped by patient people. I know how tough it is to have people seeming to pick on everything you do, but the explanations of the changes should build up a picture of the policies that we use. I think that part of the difficulty that you are experiencing arises from your additions of your opinions to an encyclopedia that only accepts opinions from externally verified sources. I have to go out into the real world now but I will be back later. Perhaps you could move my previous post to <a href="../../../d/e/x/Talk%7EDexter%27s_Laboratory_ec7f.html" title="Talk:Dexter's Laboratory">Talk: Dexter's Laboratory</a> for me while I am out.

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Another thought: Perhaps if I simply edit the articles after you without detailed explanations of each change and you can then ask me to explain those changes that I make that do not make sense to you. I will flag things if I think that there is a particular mistake that you keep making. I think that because you are so active (which I admire), you are inclined to make the same mistake frequently before someone calls you on it. I am happy to keep helping you. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 14:51, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I am the New Era Outlaw, one of the people watching over the Kimi Finster entry in the Wikipedia. I thank you very much for your contribution in the page, however, I had to delete all of the changes because they were not correct pieces of information:</p>
<p>1) Kimi Finster is not the first Japanese character in any T.V. show. There are many animated T.V. shows that had premiered before Rugrats/All Grown Up that featured Japanese characters, such as SuperFriends (Samurai), X-Men (Silver Samurai) and many others.</p>
<p>2) The point about Kimi being more fashionable than any "other cartoon character in general" as they wear the same thing in every episode is a gross exaggeration. Most of the other characters in All Grown Up do change their wardrobe from time to time, and there are cartoons where characters change their wardrobe in each episode (such as Winx Club).</p>
<p>3) The entry added in "Kimi Trivia" was deleted because it was not a factual statement that Kimi resembles an anime character, nor was she intended to be. Her facial features are somewhat similar to the other Rugrats in appearance.</p>
<p>4) It is not confirmed (nor implied) that one of the activities undertaken by the kids in the Japanese club in Kimi's school is 'drawing anime'.</p>
<p>Also, your entries have caused several of the paragraphs in the page to be too close together, resulting in a couple of the pictures creeping over to the other section of the Wiki.</p>
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience. Rest assured that this was done to maintain the integrity of the Kimi Finster entry in the Wikipedia. As always, you are welcome to contribute, but ensure that your facts and entries are correct before entering them.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
