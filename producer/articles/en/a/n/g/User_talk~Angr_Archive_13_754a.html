<p>Please stop restoring the link to a Southern Poverty Law Center article. The link was replaced by one from an academic who is a recognized expert in the field, which contains exactly the same info as the SPLC link. The SPLC is not a reputable resource and is no more appropriate a reference for Wikipedia than, say, Free Republic, or Lyndon LaRouche movement websites. All links to articles on such websites are original research. The ArbCom rulied that LaRouche material cannot be used as references on Wikipedia except on articles that are specifically about LaRouche, and based on that precedent, material from the Southern Poverty Law Center should also not be used except on articles about the SPLC. Links to SPLC articles need to be replaced with links to recognized experts who, even though they may be critics themselves or have their own strong POV, are nonetheless able to write about the topic in a detached, NPOV way. The SPLC is highly partisan and alarmist and unable to do this.70.108.135.136 12:42, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The link to the SPLC gives the entire text of the memo and <i>no commentary</i> on it, while the link to Crawford's book excerpt (which incidentally I never removed) provides only a short quote from it and plenty of partisan commentary from the author. It is entirely appropriate to provide readers the chance to read the entire memo. Lyndon LaRouche has absolutely nothing to do with this issue, and I can't imagine why you even brought him up. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 13:04, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because the SPLC's credibility is comparable to that of Lyndon LaRouche and because the ArbCom ruling regarding LaRouche material as sources therefore makes a good precedent for not using SPLC material as sources either. 70.108.135.136 15:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The SPLC is also a money-grubbing fundraising machine which exists solely to fatten Morris Dees' bank account. Providing links to his website could also be considered commercial spam for this reason. 70.108.135.136 15:14, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Leave your personal politics out of this. The ArbCom ruling on LaRouche has zero relevance here. As I said on the talk page, if you can find another page that has the <i>complete</i> text of the memo, you can link to that instead. Name-calling isn't going to win you any arguments. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 15:44, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>FYI, the SPLC is considered a reliable source around here. It is not considered similar to LaRouche webistes or Free Republic. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 22:59, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That says a lot about the <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> rampant on Wikipedia doesn't it? Wikipedia editors are self-selected from the academic intellectual class, which is also the class where SPLC and related groups get most of their support from. I'll tell you why they're in the same league as LaRouche and Free Republic: All three are True Believers. The academic intellectual class will never recognize this fact because they are one of the groups most prone to being True Believers themselves (see <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Hoffer_68ad.html" title="Eric Hoffer">Eric Hoffer</a> to understand why). 70.108.121.71 10:45, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angr,</p>
<p>I was curious as to why an article that I authored, one on the PTC Gz, was deleted by you late last month. I was curious as to what I can do to provide citations or material to prove that the group did exist, as I was once a member, or to prove its cultural impact on its home community and many others. Please inform me as to what I can do to get the PTC Gz article reinstated. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

<dd>I deleted because it was an <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a> that had not been contested within five days of proposal. Since you're clearly contesting the deletion now, I've restored it at PTC Gz. However, it can still be nominated for deletion.

<p>Angr,</p>
<p>I'd like to know why you deleted the article I just added for Porcelain, an Australian band recently signed to a major US record label. I simply added their biography and links to their websites, and thought it was a simple, accurate addition with no reason to be considered for deletion. Please undelete or explain your reason for deletion. I appreciate it. Thanks.</p>

<dd>I deleted it because <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadren_9a46.html" title="User:Gadren">User:Gadren</a> tagged it for speedy deletion under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy criterion A7</a> (article on a group of people that does not assert their notability). Please see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for guidelines on how notable a band must be to warrant an article on Wikipedia. In general, bands have to be established <i>before</i> there's an article on them. If they've only just recently been signed to a major record label, they're probably not considered notable enough yet. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 21:35, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why would an indie band with a barely similar name to Porcelain ("Fine China") be allowed an entry on a major page, but a band signed to a major record label, Universal no less, not be allowed? I mean no disrespect, I'm just new to being a contributor (long time user), and want to understand why articles are moderated so strictly when what I have done is simply add uncontested useful information.</p>
<p>Industriality</p>
<p>I should also mention that the criteria under which you listed as the reason for this deletion, Speedy Criterion 17, does not apply: <i>"The "Speedy deletion" policy governs limited cases where Wikipedia administrators may delete Wikipedia pages or media "on sight" without further debate, as in the cases of patent nonsense or pure vandalism."</i> My article was neither nonsense nor vandalism, and the popularity of a band does not seem to warrant speedy deletion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have nothing to do with the article on the band Fine China. If they don't meet the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> either, you're free to put the {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-group_fcf7.html" title="Template:Db-group">db-group</a>}} tag on their article as well. The speedy criteria <i>include</i> cases of patent nonsense and pure vandalism, but aren't limited to those cases. Criterion A7 is for people or groups of people with no assertion of notability. It's applied especially strictly to bands around here because of the huge amount of band vanity we get. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 21:51, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the PROD instead of the speedy deletion. I will make sure that this article gets contributed to the point of much greater "notability" than many permanent articles here.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jalopnik_b045.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jalopnik">AfD for Jalopnik</a> you state that it is not subject to {{db-repost}} as it was recreated after being deleted via proposed deletion.

<dd>Hmm... I thought it said this explicitly somewhere, but I'm not finding it at the moment. Still, it's implicit in the following statement from <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>: "Any deletion via this process which is taken to deletion review is implicitly a contested deletion, and the article may therefore be immediately restored by any admin without discussion." Since an article deleted by PROD can be "speedy restored" simply by someone objecting to its having been deleted, it stands to reason that the re-creation of a PRODded article should not be speedy deleted. I think I'll suggest adding this language explicitly to both <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 09:31, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also Hmm... Clarification really needs to be made. On <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> under Proposed deletions: "Articles deleted under the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> procedure (using the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPROD_4af6.html" title="Template:PROD">PROD</a>}} tag) may be undeleted, without a vote, on reasonable request. Any admin can be asked to do this, alternatively a request may be made here. However, such undeleted articles are open to be speedy deleted or nominated for <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> under the usual rules.", it seems clear that CSD G4 should not be applied due to the "undeleted per the undeletion policy" part of CSD G4. But is a user recreating a article deleted via PROD any different from the same article being restored by a admin after being taken to taken to deletion review. I could see some users tempted to apply CSD G4 as <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> in the case of a user recreated article (after PROD).--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue520_f758.html" title="User:Blue520"><span style="color:#000080"><b>blue</b></span></a><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlue520_06b1.html" title="User talk:Blue520"><span style="background:#D3D3D3;color:#000080"><b>520</b></span></a> 10:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The whole point of PROD is that it's used for uncontroversial deletions. If someone goes to the trouble of re-creating an article that was <i>not</i> a speedy candidate the first time around, then obviously its deletion <i>was</i> controversial, and it should be taken to AFD where its merits can be discussed, rather than speedied under G4. G4 is (or ought to be) only for things that (1) were deleted after discussion at AFD or (2) were speediable the first time around and aren't any better the second time. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 11:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for taking the time respond.

<p>Hi Angr! Just wrote an article on American English on the Dutch Wikipedia - it was about time, all of the other major Wikipedias have had it for ages...! For the phonology section I used the maps you display on you user page. I was as naive as to assume you'd placed them on Wikimedia Commons and faced the unlucky surprise that they weren't. I've uploaded all of them on commons now, under exactly the same file names. But perhaps you could put your pictures on commons immediately, unless you have a good reason not to do so? Obviously they're also interesting for non-native English speakers and thus for other wikis than en:&#160;;-).

<dd>I just looked at the Dutch version, and it looks like you're saying the cot/caught merger takes place in Anchorage but not elsewhere in Alaska. Actually, Anchorage is the only city in Alaska that there's data for. In all probability, it takes place throughout Alaska, but no one (to my knowledge) has done research anywhere else but Alaska. What <i>is</i> peculiar (and what you might want to mention explicitly) is that the cot/caught merger does <i>not</i> take place (at least not consistently) in San Francisco, but it does everywhere else in California and indeed the whole West. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 05:32, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Angr, I said this just in case you ever create some new maps. I'll edit the article immediately. Actually, when writing the phonology section, I relied too much on your maps and read too little about it in the corresponding articles. How remarkable that the San Francisco dialect resists the cot-caught merger! Is that because of the large scale immigration in this city or should it be explained by the sociological fact that San Francisco is such an atypical place for California (often dubbed the 'most progressive' or 'most European' place in California or indeed in the US) that makes it residents want to distinguish their accent from those heard around it? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinbach_5cf8.html" title="User:Steinbach">Steinbach <small>(fka Caesarion)</small></a> 09:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The immediate reason I deleted it is that it was an uncontested <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PROD</a>. But apart from that there are good reasons to keep it deleted. For one thing, it's not an encyclopedia article about anything; it's more of a how-to guide, which is one thing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. For another thing, it was a direct copy of something already existing at another website. You say you had permission to use it, but it makes more sense to just link to the external website.

If there's to be an article 40 Principles it should be an article discussing the history and significance of the principles, not just a list of what they are. At this point, I just don't see any reason why a link to <a href="http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/1997/07/b/" class="external free" title="http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/1997/07/b/" rel="nofollow">http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/1997/07/b/</a> from <a href="../../../t/r/i/TRIZ_79ae.html" title="TRIZ">TRIZ</a> shouldn't be sufficient. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 06:10, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Angr, I just wanted to register my thanks to you for banging on in removing all the "Blurb" from <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. I may be wrong, but I perceive an "East Berlin point of view" bias in the articles. e.g. I think there should be an image of Ged√§chtniskirche, which is after all, an important touri-site and stark reminder of WW2. I¬¥m not criticising the remodelling per se, I¬¥m also very open to new ideas, unfortunately I think the article has become "faceless", lost its originality and "Urigkeit". I¬¥d like your opinion on this too!!?? <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 08:43, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't realize I was removing "blurb" (whatever that means), I just want to polish it up to Good Article status. I've added a pic of the Ged√§chtniskirche as well as a line mentioning it under "Famous sights".

<dd>"Blurb" to me means.. lots of words, meaning nothing.. There is a continual process going on right now of cutting this, cutting that, and we¬¥ll end up with just the communist party manifesto!! lol. I¬¥ve just noticed that all film references have been cut. A section that over time has drawn "strangers" i.e. not regulars, to make entries. I¬¥m not sure if you¬¥ve also noticed, but mostly all of the regular contributors have been "turned off". I think I must make an entry on Talk: Berlin to get some sort of concensus of where "Berlin" is going. It irritates me, because I feel I¬¥m being negative... It¬¥s a shame we don¬¥t have a counter to see how many hits Berlin now has against Summer 2005. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 21:19, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've only had <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> on my watchlist for a month or two now, so I haven't seen the changes happen over time. But when I compare today's article with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&amp;oldid=19993960" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin&amp;oldid=19993960" rel="nofollow">the version of 31 July 2005</a> I really do think there's been a vast improvement since then. The July 2005 article was made up largely of lists; probably less than half the article was complete sentences. And as for the cutting, well, of course it's unfortunate, but the article was until recently over 70 kB long and is still 67 kB long, which is simply too big. It's fine to mention something on the talk page if you're feeling frustrated, but I wish you would be more specific about what you think needs improvement.

<p>by the way, with your high-up WIKI connections, what do you think of the idea of having a tab withe the relevant UK/USA flag to denote which form of English should be used on each article on the English WIKI.

<dl>
<dd>Me? I don't have high-up Wiki connections. I think the idea of having some sort of tag identifying which spelling is to be used has been considered before, and rejected as too complicated to implement for too little benefit. Personally, I usually just do a quick read of the article with an eye to country-specific spellings and then use that. My problem more is that I have started a lot of articles about Irish, which by Wiki conventions should use the spellings used in Ireland, but since I'm the one starting the article, I use American spellings because I can't remember not to. Actually, I wish we could establish the Wikipedia-wide convention of using Canadian spelling, which is a nice compromise between the two, but given the comparatively small percentage of people to whom Canadian spelling comes naturally, it seems very unlikely to happen. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 07:18, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At the Limburgic Wikipedia we have a template which marks the dialect in which an article, or a section of it, is written. When someone adds a few words or sentences to a certain alinea these words have to be put in the proper dialect, e.g. by the first author; see <a href="../../../../li/d/i/a/Sjabloon%7EDialek_6906.html" class="extiw" title="li:Sjabloon:Dialek">li:Sjabloon:Dialek</a>. That's very necessary indeed since the dfferences between the Limburgic dialects are in fact quite broad. On the English Wikipedia however such a thing seems unfeasable and undesirable: the differences are much, much smaller and the number of contributors is much, much higher - a single article is often edited by so many different people that noone could ever control if the edits done obey the dialect/spelling template. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinbach_5cf8.html" title="User:Steinbach">Steinbach <small>(fka Caesarion)</small></a> 07:56, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia naming conventions are to use the most commonly used name of something in English, which is not necessarily its official name. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 08:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not suggesting that the English be removed, simply that the English place name be redirected to the official Irish place name as was done with the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carraroe.html" title="Carraroe">Carraroe</a> article by <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesnp_6053.html" title="User:Jamesnp">User:Jamesnp</a>. I have since read the help file on moving articles and was wondering if you would sanction these moves if I went ahead with them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If people still usually use the English names when speaking English, then the articles should use the English names, regardless of the official status. Are people in Connemara, when speaking English to each other, more likely to say "I'm going to Carraroe this afternoon" or "I'm going to An Cheathr√∫ Rua this afternoon"? Are English speakers in the Rosses more likely to say "I went to Gweedore yesterday" or "I went to Gaoth Dobhair yesterday"? The answers to these questions tell you what the names of the Wikipedia articles should be. But there should definitely be redirects from all other names to the article itself. At any rate, if you do move from the English names to the Irish names, I won't revert you or anything like that. Whatever you do, be sure to use the "move" button, don't use cut and paste. If the move fails because of an existing article or redirect, let me know and I'll clear it up. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 09:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I searched for Chitika and found that the article doesn't exist. However when I saw the deletion log, I saw that you deleted it after it was <i>PROD</i>ed. I am sure that Chitika is very notable and popular and should have a Wikipedia page for itself. If you are not convinced, try google searching for it and you will be convinced. The only reason I feel that it was deleted because of lack of content not actual lack of notability. If you are satisfied, can you please move it (the deleted article) to my <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_Sandbox_f909.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena/Sandbox">Sandbox</a> so that I can start working on it.

<dd>On second thoughts, since it didn't had enough content in the first place, I would rather create the article from scratch.

<p>Hello, Just saw your comment about "never will be consensus to delete userboxes reflecting religious beliefs in an unoffensive manner". Alas, I don't think that is borne out in practice. If you look at the log at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_U_c4a1.html" title="WP:DRV/U">WP:DRV/U</a> right now, there were two deletes as "CSD T1" for userboxes that said "This user is an Atheist." and "This user is a Christian." Both of which are written unoffensively, but were classed as "belief about a controversial topic" and speedied. My personal opinion is that CSD T1 is being interpreted too broadly to delete any template, and the resulting disagreement results in more division than the original template ever could.

<dd>The discussions going on there prove my point exactly: there was no consensus to delete them, and there's no consensus to undelete them.

<p>Today you "rm image: not fair use in this article."</p>
<p>Ok. Explain. It's 2001. The image is 2001. How, exactly, is this <i>not</i> fair use.? A pic on <i>my</i> talk page, I can understand. But a pic pertaining directly (or indirectly, as in this case) to the subject matter of the article would appear to be <i>fair use.</i> So, what's the deal? I'm not about to rush in and just do a revert . <i>Oh, the temptation!</i> So, how about something in the way of an explanation? -- Jason Palpatine 19:41, 13 May 2006 (UTC) speak your mind</p>

<dd>2001 is 2001. The differences you are citing are like 2 sides of the same coin. There are many editions of the book that contain images from the film. They are related, they are conected. They are pertenent. I belive the use of the image is -- in general -- a fair use. Even here. You're being <b>too</b> literal. Jason Palpatine 03:27, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I've never actually seen a policy or guideline that speaks to what the maximum amount of copyrighted pictures can be in an article and still qualify for fair use. I was wondering if you could share with me some of the documents you use to help you decide this. This is something that I'm really interested in, just because I plan on contributing to additional feature articles in the future. So far, this is the only guideline I've used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fair_use" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fair_use" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Because of all the various policies, rules and wikiprojects, I find the whole FAC process quite interesting and painful at the same time.&#160;:) Cheers. --<a href="../../../p/-/c/User%7EP-Chan_7e32.html" title="User:P-Chan">P-Chan</a> 03:29, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most fair-use tags simply say "a limited number" without being specific as to what that means. The policy at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> says "The amount of copyrighted work used should be as little as possible." In the case of <a href="../../../v/_/f/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29_84d8.html" title="V for Vendetta (film)">V for Vendetta (film)</a>, my own opinion is that using the poster and the one image of the two main characters sitting together (plus the free image of Natalie Portman at the press conference, of course), should be sufficient. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 08:52, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that is the key policy that we have to work with, then there seems to be room for interpretation. Looking over the other FA articles, from <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_%28film%29.html" title="November (film)">November (film)</a> to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ran_%28film%29.html" title="Ran (film)">Ran (film)</a>, the number of copyrighted images seems to vary a lot. The Fair-use descriptions, however, are very different. I have no idea if the Fair-use descriptions are used in judging the number of FA allowed or not, but I think they would be a very important factor. Otherwise this would be a totally subjective process and would involve a lot of guessing. I'd love to speak with you about this further and hope we can keep an open dialogue on this. It's important to have a picture depicting the graphic novel in the article. It is a major line of discussion about this film and can be justified based on past FA articles. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Troopers_c029.html" title="Starship Troopers">Starship Troopers</a> for example, is a recent FA that shows a poter of the film, etc. Thanks. --<a href="../../../p/-/c/User%7EP-Chan_7e32.html" title="User:P-Chan">P-Chan</a> 15:44, 14 May 2006 (UTC) (BTW, I know we can create a great fair-use justificiation, that I believe should be able to satisfy your standards).
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, we can't allow precedent to take precedence here, if you'll pardon the pun. The earlier FA's should not have used so many copyrighted images either, but no one thought of it at the time. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 05:14, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>May I move this conversation onto the FA nomination page?

<p>Can you say a little more than just "restoring image" about this? How many images that are basically just "person with red hair" do we need on that page? Every image, multiplied by thousands of page loads, costs a nonzero amount of money--I know that's not a huge deal, but it says to me that there should be some content contributed beyond just "this is what red haired people look like." And given that this particular image is just a vanity snapshot of some wikipedian who wants his picture in the encyclopedia, why? I'm not going to revert, but it seems like it would be collegial to at least give a reason. <b><span style="color: #f33">¬∑<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>¬∑</span></b> 20:01, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would have been collegial to give a reason for removing it in the first place. The edit summary "removing readheadedguy.jpg" isn't exactly informative either.

<dd>Good point--I think I actually wrote more in the edit summary but took it out because it was getting too long, but my brain retained the impression it was still in there, I guess. I don't agree with your claim of pro-woman bias, but I don't exactly disagree either--it doesn't seem like an issue to me, and it does to you, so OK. It was the quality of the picture that struck me as lame, and lately I've been seeing many articles with just too, too, too many pointless images--see <a href="../../../b/u/u/Buu.html" title="Buu">Buu</a>, for instance, or <a href="../../../e/n/y/Enya.html" title="Enya">Enya</a>, which seems to be treated as fan page (actually, <a href="../../../e/n/y/Enya.html" title="Enya">Enya</a> may be down to just four or five right now. <b><span style="color: #f33">¬∑<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>¬∑</span></b> 20:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The big problem with <a href="../../../b/u/u/Buu.html" title="Buu">Buu</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/y/Enya.html" title="Enya">Enya</a> in my opinion is not the number of images per se, it's the fact that all of those images were uploaded under a claim of "fair use". Wikipedia's fair-use policy says to use as few fair-use images as possible -- they should be used only for identification, or if a specific image is discussed in the article. They should not be used solely for decoration. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 21:31, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that's a problem.

<p>Greetings Angr,</p>
<p>I am the creator of the page "Gwyllion (band)". Today I noticed that it had been deleted on May 9th. I had the page on my watchlist though, but I do not check that every day - I expected to receive an email when something dramatic such as deletion would occur. Anyway, so I noticed the deletion today, and I spent a few hours reading Wikipedia policies and workings. I decided perhaps it was deleted because there were no references, or possibly because it was indeed only very small. I spent some more time trying to figure out whether there was a way to undelete it, but I could not find any discussion about it in the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Wikipedia%7EArchived_delete_debates_a169.html" title="Wikipedia:Archived delete debates">Archived delete debates</a>. Perhaps it was quickly deleted because it was so small. So then I remembered some text saying I should just '<a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a>' and recreate the page and try to adhere to the policies better. So I spent some more time doing just that, making it look more structured, and adding some references.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, less than an hour later, the article was removed again... so I went to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Deletion review</a>, which is supposed to be where I can undo the deletion, but I have no idea how I am to start a discussion there. I could just go and edit section "23 May 2006" but perhaps that is not the way to do it... indeed, I am rather new to the moderation process at Wikipedia. I would muchly appreciate if you could help me out here&#160;:)</p>
<p>Thank you very much, - <a href="../../../s/y/g/User%7ESygmoral_9cbe.html" title="User:Sygmoral">Sygmoral</a> 21:22, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, yes, the way to request deletion review is just as you said: edit section "23 May 2006" and give your reasons why you think the speedy deletion was unjustified. I deleted the article the first time under speedy criterion A7 ("no assertion of notability") as it did not seem to me the article made any claim that Gwyllion is a notable band, using the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to determine what is considered notable. I deleted the article the second time under speedy criterion G4 ("re-creation of previously deleted content"). To be successful at deletion review you will need to convince at least half the people discussing the case that the original article did in fact assert notability per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 21:41, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, yes, it was deleted for lack of a copyright tag.

<dd>I don't have the image and I don't know where to get it. Isn't there a way of undeleting, especially if it has only just been deleted? Otherwise could you tell me who the original uploader was? I would like to put a message on their user page requesting the image. Isn't there a protocol in place that better notifies users of the image? Surely there should be a message put on the article rather than just the image itself which no-one will see. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 11:44, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Once an image is deleted, it's gone for good. I could only undelete the text on the image description page, which wouldn't do you any good. The original uploader was <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahksheep_c661.html" title="User:Blahksheep">User:Blahksheep</a>, who said in his edit summary he got it from <a href="http://www.celebchaos.com" class="external free" title="http://www.celebchaos.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.celebchaos.com</a>.

<dd>Well im flattered you think that much of my skills in MSPaint, but shouldve maybe pointed out that I dont actually have access to the book. Only PIRA volunteers get the book. However, author TP Coogan was allowed to see a copy- thats where I saw the strategy- appearing in his book "The IRA" on page 696, a copy of which appears on the CAIN site <a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/coogan/coogan93a.jpg" class="external text" title="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/coogan/coogan93a.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</dd>

<dd>It's probably best to just summarize the contents of that page in your own words rather than using the image. If you feel that the image is <i>absolutely</i> necessary, upload not the version that was here before, but the version you linked to above, providing that source. The tag to use is {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}} (using the page name as a parameter thus: <tt>{{fairusein|The Green Book (IRA training manual)}}</tt>. On the image description page you must also provide a detailed rationale explaining <i>why</i> this image is indispensable for the article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 13:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what was wrong with the copy of the image that was there. Did you delete it by mistake or because it was infringing copyright or something?

<dd>No, because you do not own the copyright to that image. Copying it over yourself does not remove the original author's copyright, nor does it grant you the power to license it as you will. Even if you upload "your" version, it would have to be used under a fair-use claim with a rationale. So you might as well upload the original since you know where to find it. Or better yet, leave it out altogether and just summarize in your own words what it says. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 13:39, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Moreover, the 69 in the name apparently refers to CUP's 69th annual conference.

<p>You should look up such words before you insult people abusing both them and the term. Advertising is a purposeful activity by an interested party, normally commercial, spam is putting links to he szme thing all over the place, regardless whether it links in any logucal way. When I put ONE single link to a non-commercial, free site with which I never had any contact, that qualifies in no way for either category. I never heard how you think it could be anything but relevant to link Buttocks, which is illustrated exclusively with pictures of posteriors (in close up or not), to a site (RearEndz; technically it seems to link collections on different sites) which shows nothing but exactly such pictures, be it of celebrities. Nor how it could be advertising since the site sells or propagates aboslutely nothing. <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 17:11, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your work on Neues Museum. Is the translation of 'Kabinettsordre' as 'royal command' correct? (from second sentence in the <b>Construction</b> section, originally <i>Zuvor hatte der K√∂nig St√ºler bereits mit Kabinettsordre vom 8.

<p>Since you participated in the <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETfD_0497.html" title="WP:TfD">Templates for deletion</a> discussion apropos of Template:Legal disclaimer, I think I ought to let you know that in my hasty cutting-and-pasting, I inadvertently removed part of my nomination, such that it didn‚Äôt fully enumerate the reasons for deletion and was syntactically troublesome in any event. The nomination, which read <i>the template is used only twice (once in mainspace), its existence but absence from nearly every page to which it could be appended surely invites one salient objection from NDT, viz., that "The lack of the disclaimer on a page might open Wikipedia to lawsuits"</i>, ought to have begun with <i>This template is self-referential and in any event in contravention of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_disclaimer_templates_9a1b.html" title="Wikipedia:No disclaimer templates">Wikipedia:No disclaimer templates</a>; inasmuch as</i>; I've now appended the omitted portion.

<p>Hello, I'm just curious - why was the pic of Busty Heart crushing the can deleted? Because it was moving? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonmega60645_a2ea.html" title="User:Donmega60645">Donmega60645</a> 20:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, because it didn't list a source. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 21:36, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>for a couple of weeks now, whenever I edit anything it is vandalised. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 08:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, POV pushing isn't the same thing as vandalism. And I don't think the paragraph on the Airlift should be completely deleted, though maybe it could still use some NPOV-tweaking. Whoever it is seems to think saying the Nazis used the '36 Olympics for propaganda purposes is non-NPOV, and maybe it could use a little cleanup, but his suggestion of "Berlin arranged the 1936 Olympics" without further discussion is very weird. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 08:54, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the image looked good as it was, why delete it? It shows the person in question, which I think is perfectly reasonable. And to tell you the truth, I'm a bit pissed off at you aswell for doing it. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Hummingbird_14c1.html" title="User:Dark Hummingbird">Dark Hummingbird</a> 19:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you upload an image, you get a message that says in large, colorful text "Your file <b>will be deleted</b> in one week unless you provide detailed information on both: 1. The source of the file ... 2. The copyright holder and the license of the file". Neither of the images had information on the copyright holder and the license of the file, so they got deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 19:50, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't upload the file personally, only used it in that page. And its in the entire Static-X section so why only delete it there. And I'm sorry for getting angry at you, you were only doing your job. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Hummingbird_14c1.html" title="User:Dark Hummingbird">Dark Hummingbird</a> 20:01, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
