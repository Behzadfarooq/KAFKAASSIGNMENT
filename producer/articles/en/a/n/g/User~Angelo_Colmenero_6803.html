<p>Angelo Colmenero, a hispanic male born in Corpus Christi Texas; Angelo has a wide range of talents, ranging from the odd to the useful. Son of parents Valentin and Angie Colmenero, and only-brother and middle child of two sisters Carmen (the youngest) and Rosie (the oldest), Angelo would be raised with a 5 member household. As a young boy, Angelo faced a ravenous curiosity and an untamed imagination, which can still be seen today as he expresses himself through technology and literature. In his early years of life, he enjoyed wearing muscle shirts with the Nija Turtles on such, as would any 3 year old boy. At this time he began to endulge in watching shows such as Batman the animated seriesand Power Rangers. When Angelo went to daycare, he met his first friends, an aspiring group of kids. In the first grade he experienced his first broken bone, an incident where he broke his leg playing tag on the jungle gym. In third grade he developed a form of epileptic seizures from a drug overdose diagnosed by his doctor, though over a year the siezures in his leg vanished. It was during his elementary years he developed a taste for science, it was this that would feed his hungry curiosity and that would attribute to his preference of documentaries over rerun cartoons. His life after elementary remained relatively docile (with the exception of puberty). While the docile years of his life were uneventful, they paved the foundation for his personality that would be fine tuned into his teenage years. In his teenage years, Angelo changed a few likes: blue was no longer his favourite colour, but instead it became titanium; his favourite cookie changed from sugar cookie to peanut butter; he changed from prefering guys as friends to girl friends. One figure that can be given credit to his personality is his cousin Johhny and Jason Colmenero, the cousins that he would spend over half a decade in summers with (from his 3rd grade years to his 9th). Johhny influenced his sense of style and persona onto Angelo, while his cousin Jason set him on the path of imaginative activities, such as Pokemon card collecting, console gaming (a milestone in his life touched at the age of seven), and other hobbies. Gaming became a huge part of his life (almost as huge as science and things of that nature), and would consume large amounts of his time. In the 6th grade, Angelo had a first taste of the TAGS (talented and gifted students) program, which he tested for and passed in the sixth grade, from then on he would enroll himself in all Advance Placement classes throughout his K-12 years. High school was a new world for him, as he encounter a larger number of people than ever faced before in a school, though he quickly became adjusted to his new surroundings and became a Coyote Scholar (one of the top 20 students in his class)his freshman year. Angelo can thank his parents for placing a large emphasis on education and resisting peer pressure. In Angelo's sophmore year he became a Coyote Scholar for his second time and also became enrolled into the National Honors Society program. As the end of his sophmore year is only a few days away, he looks at summer with intentions of taking local college classes (Speech and Psychology) for dual credit and seeks to get a job to pay for the upcoming PS3. Though he knows that even without a PS3, his best friends will keep him company (a few of which are:Ross, Joey, Yvette, Ishan, Tina, Effron, Leah, Liz, Liz, Macy, Aaron, and Treavor).</p>
