<dd>For Dál Riatan kings I think I'd prefer "name patronym" or "name byname". It avoids the problem of "was X" king of Dál Riata or just of the Cenél Y, it's how they're presented in most books, and it's how other Gaelic kings are done. If that's the route, I'd like an expert opinion on the orthography, and on diacritics.

<p>Angus, the best place to start with is not with Frank's book but with "A New History of Ireland", which was a multi-disiplinery ten volume series who's final edition only came out last year. In the Irish king lists which I have compiled I have done so according to their usage, and have listed volume nine as my source (see <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Connacht_4f3b.html" title="Kings of Connacht">Kings of Connacht</a>, and other lists on my userpage.

<p>Nice to see your additions to the High King of Ireland page Angus. Another improvement would be to emphasise the difference/overlap between kings of Tara (real early sacral continued as antiquarian/titular), high kings (pseudohistorical concept projected back onto previous figures) and kings of Ireland (real centralisation and internal conquest). The title of the page is really a misnomer for the development of kingship in Ireland through these stages. Also, perhaps a few parallels with developments in near neighbours such as the Capetian internal conquest in 12th century France to counter the long ingrained tendency to imagine a void of central kingship in Ireland as against the supposed existence of such a thing in France since the Merovingians, in England since Alfred, etc which as benchmarks are really not sustainable <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.92.168.168.html" title="User:195.92.168.168">195.92.168.168</a> 22:30, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. For the early stuff I need to read the bits of Byrne (the first six chapters) that I have only ever skipped over). Certainly the Capetians are a case in point as their writ did not run south of Loire for many years, and later Merovingian and later Carolingian authority did not extend far either. England post-1066 is atypical, so why it should be a yardstick for anywhere else - other than the large number of English historians ... - I don't know. Ireland in the 1170s is not, by European standards, especially disunited; rather England is exceptionally centralised due to a series of historical accidents. That's my reading of things anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:46, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see from your user page that you are probably as close to an authority on early Scottish history that we have on Wikipedia. Regarding your edit of the Irish-Scots article, removing "unhistorical historical note", I agree that the "summary" given was questionable, and represented some of the theories of early Irish migration to Scotland as fact, rather than just one of many theories. However, the idea behind the note was just to summarise that the presence of the Irish, and the effect of Ireland on the history and culture of Scotland long pre-dates the influx of Irish into Scotland in the 18-20th centuries (the main feature of the article), and that there is evidence that the "Scotti" came from Ireland, which I think is generally accepted (and certainly seems to be backed up by other articles on Wikipedia). Would it be possible to provide a <i>better</i> summary of these points, rather than just removing reference to them? Without wanting to impinge upon your time (I see you have quite an extensive "to do" list as it is!), could you provide some input in this direction?</p>
<p>If you have the time, I would also appreciate your input on the rather nasty edit war that is going on on the article just now, with (what I believe) to be rather contentious edits being added by one "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brandubh_Blathmac_053e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brandubh Blathmac">Brandubh Blathmac</a>", who is easily proved to be a sock-puppet of a very difficult editor, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Rms125a%40hotmail.com_5f49.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Rms125a@hotmail.com">Rms125a@hotmail.com</a>. I'm afraid I may have allowed myself to become too annoyed with this editor, but this is because of the quite disgusting personal abuse I, and many others, have had to suffer from him, as well as the rather outrageous POV he adds to many articles. Again, I do not wish to make claims on your time, but it may or may not be of interest to you.</p>

<dd>Apologies, I'll try and add something back. There's absolutely no doubt that to benighted foreigners, Gaelic-speaking Scotsmen and Irishmen were one and the same thing, and that the word for both was "Scots" until quite late in the day. So far as I can see, our man Rms125 wouldn't be missed if he took himself off and didn't come back ever again.

<p>Thanks so much for your contribution, Angus. I must say I quite like the comment from <i>1066 and All That</i> - it can be refreshing to see a bit of humour, particularly clever humour which actually has something to teach us, into an article such as this which can be the target for such contentiousness (is that a word??). Your edit clearly shows that the line between the Scots and Irish is a very vague one - it seems to me to be a common feature of the history of migration, that the idea of "fixed" "indigenous peoples" is just a sham - people were shifting about for millenia, with groups gaining and losing ascendancy, and all the time inter-mingling. (That was all I wanted to reflect in the "Historical note" section). Which is why I get so annoyed by people with fairy-tale mythological pseudo-historical ideas of (for example), the noble "Caledonians" versus the rabid slave-mongering "Hibernians" (I think you know who in particular I'm referring to). Scotland and Ireland are of course, not unique in this - England is very much a "mongrel nation" - but, unlike the MP I heard complaining about this a few years ago, some people see this as being something to celebrate.

<p>I realise that you are by no means supporting my arguments here, but I would just like to say that I appreciate your input all the same, because to date coverage of the counties of Scotland has been dominated by one supreme fact: utter ignorance! We have had zero scholarly, sourced input, and I just hope that you and your learned colleagues can add <s>a bit</s> a heck of a lot of <i>weight</i> to Wikipedia's presentation of this area.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>at what date did the word "<a href="../../../c/o/u/County.html" title="County">county</a>" first start getting used by Scottish people to apply to their own subdivisions? (I understand that it was the early 19th century)</li>
<li>at what date did the word "<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire.html" title="Shire">shire</a>" first start getting used by Scottish people to apply to their own subdivisions? (I understand that it may have been the 17th century, although earlier usage in Lowland Scotland seems likely)</li>
<li>where can we obtain a reliable list of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriffdoms.html" title="Sheriffdoms">sheriffdoms</a>? (that article and topic needs a lot of work)</li>
<li>where can we get a list of shires which were entitled to send Commissioners to the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Scotland_b6d1.html" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a>? (because the names used at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Constituencies_in_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_at_the_time_of_the_Union_25b1.html" title="List of Constituencies in the Parliament of Scotland at the time of the Union">List of Constituencies in the Parliament of Scotland at the time of the Union</a> are those used in <i>1878</i>! and just strike me as being highly unlikely to be accurate.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I probably have more questions, but you are a busy man.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_subdivisions_of_Scotland_e534.html" title="History of the subdivisions of Scotland">History of the subdivisions of Scotland</a> is utterly pathetic at present, and extremely heavily concentrated on the 20th century.

<p>I noticed that yoour "ruthless trimming" of the Further reading section was less a trimming and more a wholesale replacement. What were your criteria for selecting which items were on the further reading list? The list previously in the article was based on the bibliography in the Grove <i>Dictionary of Art</i> and the bibliograohy of the Calkins work used as a reference for the article. The works you dropped include the first facsimlile of the Book of Kells and a rather complete discusion of it (Alton and Meyer), the most commonly cited article on the most famous illumination in the book, the Chi Rho page (Lewis), one of the most widely available books on Insular manuscripts (Nordenfalk, <i>Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Painting</i>), and an article on the vellum and structure of the book by the man who did the latest rebinding of it (Powell). <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 14:37, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no attachment to the books listed. Please do replace them if you feel that something else would be better. But the previous list was largely useless as "further reading", in which I'd expect to find "books that will tell you more than this article without going into enormous detail". I don't think you can assume everyone has access to a large anglophone library, so 1932 books are not likely to be helpful. Why not just cite the Grove Dictionary of Art&#160;? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:53, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess we have a different concept of the use of further reading. I look at the Further reading list to be "a list of sources that will tell you more about this article, going into much greater detail, but were not used as sources for this article." I can see the value of having more recent works, but definitive works from the past should be included, as some people do have access to large Anglophone libraries (almost everyone in the United States can get almost any book via through interlibrary loan from their local library. I know, I live in a town of about 30,000 people in Oklahoma.) I don't cite the Grove article because the article is much shorter than ours, but with a good bibliography. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 15:10, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe it's just me, but I would expect the "Further reading" to be much shorter than the "References" section (or at least my articles end up like that), or with a couple of "Further reading" entries if there are no refs. But, having said that, I have reverted the article (no,I haven't; you did it first).

<p>Not much help i can give you regarding <i>"Cath etir Albancho ar aen-rían cur' marbad and Crínan ab Duín Calland &amp; sochaidhe maille fris .i. nae .xx. laech. "</i> im afraid. What little of it i could understand seemed to match up with your own translation of it - i asked my father for his opinion ( hes a celtic studies grad ) and he came up with the same translation pretty much. He did suggest that that &lt;something&gt; might have been "at sea" or something similiar. Thurneysen's Old Irish book gives <i>rian</i> = sea apparently and with that in mind 'ar aen-rían' looks fairly similar to modern Gaelic 'air an cuan' - assuming that the ar aen=air an.

<p>Well, I don't know anything about Scottish dynasties, so I don't know how accurate those names are, but I will say one thing...just because something is a modern invention doesn't mean we shouldn't use it. If other historians divide up the dynasties like that, then that is what we should do as well. This is not the place to overturn mistaken historiographical assumptions. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 11:57, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think many historians actually do that; they seem as much an invention of wiki users as amateur (but published) "historians".

<p>I looked for the 25,000 claim in the online PDF of the US Census, but couldn't find it; I am curious as to how it was conducted. BTW, the Irish nationalist <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_More_POV_Please_ee02.html" title="User:No More POV Please">User:No More POV Please</a> has stuck a fact tag on my claim that Gaelic was known as "Scottish" until the 16th century.

I know you have that; can you check out the article on the "Scots language" and add a reference? Much appreciated. Good work on Macbeth BTW.

<p>Had a quick question about this referencing style, since you seem to have a good understanding of it. I think you may have answered it on your user page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are using Cite.php, you can combine repeated refs by adding a "name" - so the first is <sup id="_ref-xxx_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-xxx" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the subsequent ones are <sup id="_ref-xxx_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-xxx" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...but I can't exactly figure out what that means. What I want to do is make it so I can reference things "out of order"; that is, if after note 3 I want to reference note 1 again, then I can just use that same note without having to add another note to the list (otherwise the referencing becomes a list of the same sources being repeated over and over, which is not only unnecessary and repetitive but bloats the article text size). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:55, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Creating the map is not a problem, and I have topo data for all of the UK, so the southern and western boundaries are no bother.

I just chose those colours for the test to give an idea how it would roughly look, and resolution can go to the super numbers that I have previously uploaded (file size isn't so much of an issue when it is only 4 colour, as the test image is 1400x1000 but it is only 80kb!). If there are other things you would like on it let me know and I will see if it is possible or not (I am currently doing a good bit of behind the scenes testing of using PD maps to derive map data (settlements, roads, rivers etc) <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 13:56, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

If so then I will go ahead and create a full one with polish (hollowing out Lough Neagh for example) Do you want a land height key on the map? <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 14:17, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have uploaded the final image to the commons at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Image%7EScotland_Land_Use_by_height.png_0b0c.html" title="Image:Scotland Land Use by height.png">Image:Scotland Land Use by height.png</a> and have swapped it in place of the test here, everything seems to be fine with it, I hope it is useful to you in article work! If you need anything altered on it let me know. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 15:55, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Angus, Feel free to nominate this as a good article, hopefully it'll pass. I am planning to make a few changes suggested by the Peer review but I don't have any time right now &amp; don't expect to do it any time soon, I don't think they'd compromise the article in any event. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanHainey_d289.html" title="User:AllanHainey">AllanHainey</a> 11:39, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey. I was keeping that on the quiet until I'd done all of them. I've got a revamped list which I'll paste on the relevant page once I'm done. Your tweaking would be appreciated, not only for content, but I am a notorious typo-dumper. The later Archie Duncan book is inaccessible to me; I've never got around to buying it because of its price, but it does seem to have made a large impact on Scottish historiography, so it'd probably be worth it. The MacQuarrie article is very useful; he does much of the scholarly leg-work, but I've never been that impressed with MacQuarrie as a scholar. He builds his king-list from the Harleian genealogies (and there he is not alone), but never mentions that most of them are not attested as kings. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 18:10, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
