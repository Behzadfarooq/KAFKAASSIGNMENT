<dd>I didn't imply anything about whether or not angels are religious symbols. I merely noted that the article is too long, unwieldy and generally illegible because of poor structuring and bad style.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">New Age</span></h3>
<p>Angels are also a part of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New_Age</a> beliefs, where angels (known as <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini.html" title="Dakini">Dakini</a> in some New Age systems) are timeless, inorganic, immortal, inhuman beings who have existed with the Spiritual Energy's appearance as part of the <b>One</b>, not servants of God. Because the Energy is transdimensional, the behavior of angels has always been revelatory and mysterious. However, they respond to the state of spiritual energy within individuals, with the empathy that comes with their higher state of existence. Manifestations of angels in human form are explainable because can manifest in any form they choose.</p>
<p>Haha. Seeing this summary reminds me of The Matrix. "The One" sounds like Neo and the angels seem like Mr. Smith(s)</p>
<hr />
<p>Found the source of this discussion from the Bad Jokes page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(The theory was part of the Angel article. But since aliens and UFOs are generally dismissed as nonsense, so is this theory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some atheists believe that angels were crews of an alien starship that visited earth a long time ago. These crews wore space suits with a glass bubble helmet which was mistaken as halo. Their space suits had wings that allowed them to fly like Buzz Lightyear in the cartoon Toy Story.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The captain of the starship went by the name Jahveh. A mutiny took place on board. A high ranking officer by the name of Lucifer and his followers were exciled to earth after the failed mutiny. The unexplainable alien technologies were viewed as miracles by the primitive human civilization at the time. The starship stayed with humanity for a long time until the captain's son was crucified by the people on earth. The aliens gave up on humanity and departed, they promised to return.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those atheists believe the books of Bible can be consistently explained in terms of alien visitation. The sharp difference between the angry God who flooded and burned humanity in the Old Testament and the lack of similar punishments in the New Testament and in today's world was explained by the departure of the starship.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What is the advertisement for an movie doing in here&#160;? Please explain how this links at all to anything.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The familiar image of Buzz Lightyear helps the readers visualize how advanced technologies could be linked to attributes of angels by primitive people. e.g. Helmet as Halo, Flight suit as wings of angels, laser pistol as fire balls. Feel free to replace it with another familar icon that can provide the same visualization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Phenomona beyond human knowledge were often interpreted as divine intervention. For example, in mythology, Thor was responsible for thunders and lightnings in the sky. Nowadays, we no longer take those supernatural beings seriously. Some day when we know enough, we may realize that some religions we believed in were just wrong interpretions due to our ignorance.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>can those people be called atheists, since they believe in a being with all kinda' powers? --MichaelTinkler</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think they should be called atheist because they try to deny the existence of God by substituting him with a biological being - the alien.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>This makes no sense -- should go to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">Patent nonsense</a>?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Alien or New Age should deserve at least a subpage. They are belief of some people. In my opinion, the Christian belief of angels should be moved to a subpage too, or else this article become biased towards only one religion. Where is the NPOV here? Why is the New Age paragraph repeatedly removed? Is there freedom of religion in wikipedia? How can people be so closed mind that anything non-christian makes no sense. To the atheists, the Bible belongs to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">Patent nonsense</a> too, but atheists respect your belief and won't call it nonsense in front of your face. Why can't Christians be more tolerant of different idea and people around them?</dd>

<hr />
<p>"Many Old Testament chapters mention an "angry God" who sends his(her) angel to smite the enemies of the wandering tribes of Judah." I don't recall this. Refs?</p>
<hr />
<p>I think the stuff about aliens belongs on an entirely different page altogether, as it is not a belief about angels specifically (<i>Jahveh</i> would not be an angel) but about extraterrestrials perhaps being responsible for all the stuff normally held to be divine. Chariots of the Gods comes to mind, but I'm sure a handful more people have bothered to develop all this stuff, so someone else should come up with a place to move it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this argument makes no sense. Christians believe in more than just angels. By the same argument, the Christian belief should be removed from this article too because christian belief is not about angels specifically either. Why the belief that 'angels are aliens' has to be moved from an article about angels? I know, it is the same reason why the New Age belief must be moved too, it is simply because non-christian belief must be removed from wikipedia. I guess you know I am just trying to be sarcastic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the alien belief, Jahveh is not an angel, he is just another alien in power.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Christian beliefs on the divine in general should indeed go on other pages, and the article should link to them for more information. For instance, it would be inappropriate to have a long explanation of the great chain of being, but nothing would be wrong with mentioning that under that scheme angels occupy the position intermediate between man and God, and linking for more info. Same thing here - a quick note that angels have considered to be aliens with a link to more info would be best. If it's worth a subpage then it's worth a page. After all, you want to say the same thing on Jahveh, right?</p>
<hr />
<p>My Grandfather claimed he saw Angels in the sky over the battlefield after one of the battles on the western front in World War 1. Apparently there was one particular battle where thousands of soldiers, from both sides, claimed to see this. Many who saw it were not particularly religious people. A few of the German soldiers apparently described them as Valkeries, though most said Angels. Does anyone have more definitive information? Do we think this is important enough to include on the page?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I think if the sightings were recorded, they should be mentioned here because they were believed to be angels. Perhaps they coincides with UFO sightings and future scholars may confirm angels are just aliens. Let not hide the information from the researcher.</dd>

<p>How many contributors to this article have ever <i>experienced</i> angel(s)?

<p>Is <i>Uriel</i> an archangel. What are actually archangels? -- Jan</p>
<dl>
<dd>All seven archangels listed occur in some Jewish writings. All Christian groups accept Michael and Gabriel who occur in the book of Daniel, the Catholic and Orthodox Churches accept Raphael, and only a few churches like the Ethiopian Orthodox accept the the last four. 209.244.91.81 06:10 Aug 13, 2002 (PDT)</dd>
<dd>From the Catholic encyclopedia: The "angels" are assigned to the salvation of one man. Thus the guardianship of the human race belongs to the order of "Principalities," or perhaps to the "Archangels," whom we call the angel princes. Hence, Michael, whom we call an archangel, is also styled "one of the princes" (Dan. 10:13). Moreover all corporeal creatures are guarded by the "Virtues"; and likewise the demons by the "Powers," and the good spirits by the "Principalities," according to Gregory's opinion (Hom. xxxiv in Ev.).</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Angels as dead people</span></h2>
<p>Where does the idea that angels are dead people back in a mission come from? It's quite popular in popular media: <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_to_Heaven_70ba.html" title="Highway to Heaven">Highway to Heaven</a>, but I can't link it to a major confession. Is it from the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedenborgian.html" title="Swedenborgian">Swedenborgians</a>?</p>
<hr />
<p>The idea that all angels are 'dead people' is one of the central tenets of Swedenborgianism, through there is little believe in dead people coming back on a mission from God (see <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues_Brothers_292a.html" title="Blues Brothers">Blues Brothers</a>. But since Swedenborg lived in the 18th century, and the idea of angels being dead people can be traced earlier than that, I don't think we can say that it is strictly a Swedenborgian teaching. It is true that while it's hard to find official doctrine in the world today that include this idea, it actually is all around us. I've been to funerals where the priest started by saying that it's very sad that Uncle Joe is dead in the ground and we'll miss him until the resurrection when he will be dug up (the official doctrine of their church), but finish by saying that we can take comfort knowing that Uncle Joe is happily living in heaven where he isn't bothered by his cancer anymore and he can see Aunt Jane who died two years ago. No one seems to really belive the official doctrine but have an inate understanding that when people die they continue to live.</p>
<p>It's my understanding that the early christian church in the first and second centuries understood this to be true. Looking for a reference...<a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmosglenn_c997.html" title="User:Amosglenn">-AmosGlenn</a> 03:20, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Wings" id="Wings"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wings</span></h2>
<p>I thought that the idea of angles with wings came via the Hebrew from <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_art.html" title="Assyrian art">Assyrian art</a>, with their winged bull-men (<a href="../../../k/u/d/Kudurru.html" title="Kudurru">kudurru</a>?). But if the data in the article is so late it can't be so.</p>
<p><a name="Physicality" id="Physicality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Physicality</span></h2>
<p>The article contained the following: "many theologians have argued that they have no physical existence. (Hence the frequently recounted tale of Scholastics arguing about how many angels could fit on a pinhead; if angels possess physical bodies, the answer is "a finite number", if they do not, the answer is "an infinite number".)" I think it is a misrepresentation of the debate to think that the answer `an infinite number' is forced on us if we think angels are non-physical. One might think the answer is none (since non-physical beings cannot occupy space), one (since non-physical beings would be unextended - like the pinhead), infinitely many, or that the question doesn't make sense (because it has a false presupposition - that angels are the types of things that can fit on pinheads). What is ruled out is a finite number greater than 1 if angels are non-physical. I've altered the article accordingly. - RossCameron</p>

<p><a name=".23_of_angels_on_a_pinhead"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline"># of angels on a pinhead</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the number of angels that fit on a pinhead, this article stated that the answer must be either: (1) at most a finite number (2) not any finite number greater than 1 Clearly, however, the answers must be: (1) at most a finite number (angels have physical bodies; hence at most a finite number of angels can fit on a pinhead at once) (2) not any finite number greater than 0 (angels have no physical bodies, so the answer is either "an infinite number", or "none at all") It should be noted that the previous version of (2), would be compatible with at most one angel on a pinhead (1 is not a finite number greater han one), which is not compatible (as the argument sees it) with a physical body.</p>
<p>Contrary to a previous comment above, a pinhead is not an infintesimal point, nor do I think the scholastics would have believed it to be as such, so the answer cannot properly be one.</p>
<p>On a tangent, it should be noted that this question really applies, not to whether angels have physical bodies, but whether angels have a one or more non-infintisemal, non-overlapping, spatiotemporal locations. Conceivably, a being could lack a physical body yet still have one or more such regions of space it occupies. Equally so, a being could have one or more physical bodies, which could be either infinitesimal or capable of overlapping, in which case an infinite number of such physical bodies could be fit on a pinhead. -- samuel katinsky</p>

<p>From the page</p>
<p>"Scholastic theologians teach that angels are able to reason instantly, and to move instantly. They also teach that angels are intermediaries to some forces that would otherwise be natural forces of the universe, such as the rotation of planets and the motion of stars. Angels possess the beatific vision, or the unencumbered understanding of God (the essence of the pleasure of heaven). Furthermore, there are more angels than there are anything else in the universe (although when first written this would have probably not included atoms since atomic structure was not known)."</p>

This is untrue, since there is no reason to believe Angels are unintelligent and are much like robots. Angels by necessity do have the ability to have wisdom, understanding, and knowledge as agents of God. Occam’s Razor states that the simplest explanation is the best one, since it has the least parts; therefore, Angels that are like robots strictly programmed by God is more complex, or a class of beings that help God, but are intelligent is the best answer. Finally, Angels can be in human form and are not limited to being <i>air</i>; therefore, Angels have physical existence, but can move in mysterious ways. <i>Unsigned comment by 172.195.130.79</i></p>

<p>You know, many would argue that Angels do have free will. After all, how could so many angels have rebelled against God, if they did not have the freedom to do so in the first place? It obviously implies some form of intelligence and self-awareness. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterXiam_6129.html" title="User:MasterXiam">MasterXiam</a> 06:56, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since angels are entirely imaginary, they both have and not have free will at the same time&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 02:16, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Angels and Aliens</span></h2>
<p>Some people believe that angels are ancient references to extraterrestrials due to their lack of genitals and the fact that they come from the sky. I myself don't know that much about the matter, but I think it's worth mentioning. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersonDude_e1fc.html" title="User:PersonDude">PersonDude</a> 17:59, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has been discussed before a few years back. The thread is still present Under the New Age section above on this talk page, in the paragraph about "bad joke". There was a theory on Angels=Aliens; halo=space helmet; Wing=flying devices; the cessation of miracles of the caliber of "Noah's flood", "Plagues of Egypt", "parting of the red sea" etc. = departure of an alien spaceship. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 02:14, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">List</span></h2>
<p>There is a nice section under <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallen_angel.html" title="Fallen angel">Fallen angel</a> that not only lists believed fallen angels, but does so by rank. Can we get some such thing under this topic as well?

<p>Was there greek influence in the figure or form? For example the Greek goddess <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a> or Roman Victory(mythology) is winged.--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJondel_fb32.html" title="User:Jondel">Jondel</a> 04:13, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the greeks invented wings or winged creatures. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaceFalcon2001_2983.html" title="User:SpaceFalcon2001">SF2K1</a> 06:47, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The iconic image that was adopted for Christian angels was Greek rather than Persian-Babylonian. Athena had lost her early winged form by the Classical period. Nike, Eos, etc. are the Greek winged figures adopted by the earliest Christian illuminators, in Constantinople and Syria. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 18:42, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the Angels/Cherubim/Ophanim had wings long before the Jews even met the greeks/persians as can be observed in Tanakh. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaceFalcon2001_2983.html" title="User:SpaceFalcon2001">SF2K1</a></dd>

<dd>Uh you're right(to SF2K1). I remember something like Isaiah describing an angel with 6 wings. I'm just struck that some Greek gods look like angels. Maybe the Greeks were influenced by Persian-Babylonion illuminators? Persians seem to have influenced the Jews too (part of Zoroastrisism).--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJondel_fb32.html" title="User:Jondel">Jondel</a> 00:51, 27 February 2006 (UTC) --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJondel_fb32.html" title="User:Jondel">Jondel</a> 00:51, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
