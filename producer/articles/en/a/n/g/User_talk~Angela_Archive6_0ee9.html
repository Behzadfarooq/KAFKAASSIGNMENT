<p>I subdivided the ultra-long <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Quebec_history_5e3f.html" title="Timeline of Quebec history">Timeline of Quebec history</a> as inspired by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_United_States_history_6783.html" title="Timeline of United States history">Timeline of United States history</a>. As this timeline will obviously only get longer as more events are added, I thought it made sense to do it now. On 3 occasions, User:Angelique has reverted to a previous version of hers to remove it. I am beginning to think that this "new" user is a hard banned one under a new name. She saw me get angry and insult another user on <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebecois.html" title="Quebecois">Quebecois</a> so I think she is trying to push me to do the same to boot me out. User:Adam Bishop thinks the same. If she has objections, she can discuss them like User:Tremblay, User:Adam Bishop and I do. She has been giving hell to all of us for a while now. Is is possible for your to try to reason with her? Whatever happens, thank you. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 14:35, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I posted your comments on my page not "out of context" but verbatim. I did so because <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> deleted them so as to cover up his conduct. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 15:14, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What are you talking about this time? I am really not following. Explain to me (and Angela I guess) in which way I am involved in your copying her comments? -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 16:24, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Two things: 1) If you read my page you would see that User:Mathieugp has continued his personal attacks, and 2) while I respect your objection, anything, anyone writes at Wikipedia is copyable. You do not have the right to restrict my page, particularly where an individuals conduct is a valid part of any ongoing matters. I am using your comments as a Wikipedia Administrator, to defend myself from attacks. That, is perfectly proper. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 15:26, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, you are a popular lady, but can I get a little help from you? I (with a few others) am having a very hard time understanding a point Eloquence <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EEloquence_b8a8.html" title="User talk:Eloquence">User_talk:Eloquence</a> is trying to make regarding the Book of Mormon page. You can skim the Book of Mormon Controversies topic on that page. I think she/he is trying to say that it is anti-NPOV to have a separate page for controversies. Others of us are saying that without a separate page, controversies were burying the topic, and that the controversies page is NPOV because both apologetics and critics are relegated back there, with "just the facts" reserved for the main page. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a></p>

<p>There is lively discussion of policy issues on the mailing list. There is lively discussion of policy issues on talk pages on en, and in places like the pump and vfd. With few exceptions, there has not been in recent times anything approaching lively discussion of policy issues on the meta.

<p>By freezing <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Greek_and_Roman_Egypt_179c.html" title="History of Greek and Roman Egypt">History of Greek and Roman Egypt</a> in the form Jiang is trying to impose on it, you are effectively taking his side in this dispute. This I <i>greatly resent</i>. This is not a dispute about the content of the article (about which Jiang knows nothing), but about his <i>opinion</i> that it looks better a particular way rather than some other way. This is entitely a matter of judgement, and his opinion is no better or worse than mine (although I do have a degree in graphic design). The fact is that some designs look better on some browsers and some look better on others. I doubt the readers care very much. If Jiang ever actually contributed anything to this project I might not get so annoyed at his obsessive interference with articles I have contributed, but so far as I can see he is nothing but a professional pest. I request that you <b>put the article back the way it was the way before Jiang started messing with it</b> and <b>then</b> protect it.

<p>I have contributed something like 200 articles to this project. (How many has Jiang contributed, by the way?) Every day I look at my Watchlist and I see 10, 15, 20 edits other people have made. Maybe 25% of these are minor copyediting changes, most of which are needed, since I am far from a perfect typist. But most of the rest are frivolous, vexatious, pedantic, incorrect, illiterate, ungrammatical, polemical, tendentious and/or malicious, and have to be reverted. If articles are not watched over constantly, they <i>always</i> deteriorate over time through this kind of harmful editing. This is why serious contributors eventually drift away, and why WP will never be a real encyclopaedia until it allows articles to be declared <i>finished</i> and protected from further edits except through some sort of formal process. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:52, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the use of <a href="../../../q/h/o/Image%7EQholyavenger1.jpg_078b.html" title="Image:Qholyavenger1.jpg">Image:Qholyavenger1.jpg</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Avenger_7784.html" title="Holy Avenger">Holy Avenger</a> and similar images are fair use in an article about the publication. We can't replace the publication and our articles are basically reviews of them. That's enough to swing the question in our favor, IMO. There's a potential issue because single cells of comic books have value as individual artwork pieces but for those things, our images are both thumbnails and increase the awareness of the unreduced frame, hence its likely market value. It's helpful to always have a link to the web site of the publication because that will also tend to help sales. As a useful side-effect, publications which check links to their site and want to object will find out about us and are likely to object before there's a print edition, while we're still protected by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communications_Decency_Act_d18c.html" title="Communications Decency Act">CDA</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/i/OCILLA_341a.html" title="OCILLA">OCILLA</a>.

<dd>The reason no edit summary is given is because I used the rollback button, which automatically inserts the words <i>reverted to last edit by ...</i> and marks the revert as minor. The reason the revert was made is because <a href="../../../1/4/2/User%7E142.177.etc.html" title="User:142.177.etc">User:142.177.etc</a> is a hard banned user. If hard banned users attempt to circumvent their ban and continue editing, the general guideline is to auto-revert them. It's just a way of enforcing the ban when IP blocks don't work. Having said that, if you feel the content is useful, there is nothing stopping you reinserting it.

<dd>I severely disagree with that. You did not comment on the <a href="../../../1/4/2/User%7E142.177.92.201.html" title="User:142.177.92.201">User:142.177.92.201</a> comment page. You did not appear to examine the edits to determine their worth to wikipedia. You have no evidence that this is the banned user, other than the fact that they have the same isp as EntmootsOfTrolls. Both the edits to Economics and the edits to Ecosystem have been reverted back to 142.177.92.201's edit. If you have any evidence that this is EntmootsOfTrolls, and not someone else at the same ISP, you did not publicly put that up. If I see that you continue to rollback other's reasonable attempts at contributing with out any comment what so ever to them and no solid connection to a banned user, I will request that you have your Sysop status removed. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrincayc_4757.html" title="User:Jrincayc">Jrincayc</a> 21:27, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize for getting out of hand. I should not have used BS as an edit summary. While you have not directly stated that "all edits from an ISP that has had a banned user are to be considered edits from the banned user", so far as I can tell, the only evidence that you have about 142.177.92.201 being EntmootsOfTrolls, is that they are from the same ISP. Therefore, from my point of view, it seems that you are operating under the assumtion "all edits from an ISP that has had a banned user are to be considered edits from the banned user." If I am mistaken, I would like to hear why I am mistaken on this point. Again, I apologize for getting out of hand and being uncivil. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrincayc_4757.html" title="User:Jrincayc">Jrincayc</a> 23:56, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would rather appreciate that you do not list User:Mediator has being one of the user name held by 142, since that is untrue.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It would be very useful if you (or someone who is responsable for that) move English pages move to UTF-8 encoding. In this moment I have to write non Latin-1 characters into some other editor, and then to submit it to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, my intention with Description of Serbian Language was to invite other people to write this document with me. It is a long term work and I don't think that it would be done in the near future. But, I thought it is possible to develope it on Wikipedia openly.</p>

<p>Angela. To me it wasn't anon users or new users who were the problem. My problem was the failure of most users to write for the enemy and to stand up for the integrity of articles that were not in their own "personal political space". I took pride in the fact that I, a conservative Republican, defended the integrity of the Wesley Clark article and was very vocal in confronting the conservative troll JoeM. Unfortunately, I did not see my philosophy working the same way on the other end. I, as a conservative Republican felt very UN-comfortable defending the George Bush article and Santorum article. I felt that a liberal Democrat should defend the NPOV on those but did not see it occur. Behavior that was seen as "trollish" on Hillary Clinton was seen as "informative" on George Bush. Thats why some started the "list war". Similarly, I felt uncomfortable trying to take anti-Bush material out of J. William Fulbright. I felt that a responsible liberal should have taken the lead on it. I asked for help and only got one person willing to assist me defend that article. So I don't think that Adam's proposal would help that. The only thing that would help that would be a change of heart by the political partisans or a change in NPOV philosophy. But I think very highly of the project and will keep watching in hopes of seeing it mature. -- <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArk30inf_d1d1.html" title="User:Ark30inf">Ark30inf</a></p>

<p>That is a good question. I admit I didn't spend alot of time thinking before I made that vote. My best idea is to merge it into <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">palestine</a>, but... I would prefer if I wasn't the primary decision maker on this&#160;:). It really seems to be a section of an article, rather than an article itself.

<p>I don't think its anarchy in regard to who edits and how soon, but anarchy in regard to NPOV policy.</p>
<p>You are correct about political partisans changing their beliefs, but I think they can change their behavior. IF that is what is expected by the majority and that expectation is insisted on. The problem is that the NPOV policy as stated and accepted in practice is not really NPOV, its dueling POV. You can't blame users for being good at dueling POV when dueling POV is the standard operating procedure and is accepted by the community.</p>
<p>The idea seems to be to "get as much of my point of view in there" and "grudgingly accept the minimum opposing POV after a long fight". In reality, Wikipedia's policy is very similar to Fred Bauder's policy only the sympathetic and critical views have to fight for the same article space here whereas they are physically separated on his site.</p>
<p>Dueling POV works in a way, but you better be ready for a head-butting contest in addition to being ready to write an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>Jimbo said on the mailing list during the RK thing (paraphrased) that it is his view that the best articles come from such partisans engaging in mortal combat with other partisans. I respectfully don't see that and instead see the best articles occurring where partisans from both sides write for the enemy, police their own kind, and treat seriously any and every criticism of their work rather than circling the wagons and defending it in a kneejerk fashion.</p>
<p>I've always tried to avoid being a utopian. But I feel that most of the regulars here regardless of political stripe could deal with that concept if that were the standard accepted here and insisted on. I'm figuring that either Wikipedia will mature and move that direction or someone will fork and try that philosophy. I'll keep watching because the project (ignoring methodology) is intriguing and useful. --Ark30inf</p>

<li>Apologies if I violated protocol in my first 2 days on the wikipedia. At the time, I had no idea what user talk pages were even for. I blanked your message after reading it. I did not understand that it was customary to retain content on one's talk page after reading it; I viewed it as more like email.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, the term "utilities" is nothing like self-explanatory in this context: mnemonic once you know it, but non-obvious if you don't. It is, indeed, linked from the Help page, but there is nothing to make it stand out, and it seems to be the only link-based (as against search-based) route into a vast array of pages. If nothing else, I think it deserves a more verbose entry on the Help page. If you have no objection to that, I'd like to write a sentence or so there. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 11:13, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>

<p>Angela, I think that's really a Jimbo thing. Jimbo believes that partisans fighting over articles produces the best articles. As long as that is true then many people who want to be collegial will be frustrated and leave.

<p>Thanks for welcoming me as a new member.

<p>Thanks for the Intro! Okay, I have a question now: I started <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell%2C_Ontario_07b0.html" title="Russell, Ontario">Russell, Ontario</a> but I did it anonymously. I would do the thing where I go back to the computer with the IP and claim it as mine, but I did it on dial up with Dynamic IPs, meaning I probably won't ever get it again. Is there anything else I can do? Thanks! PS: You can probably tell that it's really short. I'm planning on longening-it up when I get a free minute (although I probably won't use made-up words. . . probably&#160;;). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanrocks_9411.html" title="User:Canrocks">canrocks</a></p>

<dd>Hi, Yeah you said that you thought I did it from a University. . .very clever! The IP probably came from ncf.carleton.ca. My ISP is called NCF, or National Capital Freenet. It's a service (not really free) provided by Carleton University for the community. It is dial-up which uses <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:uSs1C30QixMJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address+Dynamic+ip&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:uSs1C30QixMJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address+Dynamic+ip&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Dynamic IP</a>s, basically assigning an IP at random, first-come first-serve. It would be very tiring to dial up and dial up repeatedly to get the right one. Do I have any other courses of action in claiming my article?

<p>Angela, I seem to be in an edit war with various Wikilunies regarding accents. I put them in (because they are part of a proper name) and people take them out. Is there an existing discussion on the pros and cons of accents? Is there a policy or recommendation regarding their use? Or do I just need to wear someone down in an edit war? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelwest_a5eb.html" title="User:Joelwest">Joelwest</a> 19:23, 1 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. It is about <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_c7dc.html" title="San Jose">San José</a> (and <a href="../../../s/j/s/SJSU_aa36.html" title="SJSU">San José State</a>), both of which under <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> seem to qualify for accents -- since the official name on government stationery, website, etc. has the accents. But this is a general issue that comes up in California and a few other states with Spanish/Mexican influence, and before I write new content (or face other edit wars) I want to know the "right" answer.</p>
<p>As for talking about it, yes that's the right thing to do but that assumes my editing opponent is willing to talk rather than just go ahead and mash my accents. After the first round (with SJSU) I did just that at <a href="../../../s/a/n/Talk%7ESan_Jose_State_University_68c7.html" title="Talk:San Jose State University">Talk:San Jose State University</a>, but only got a discussion from someone who agreed with me not the person who backed out my changes. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelwest_a5eb.html" title="User:Joelwest">Joelwest</a> 08:27, 2 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never seen San Jose spelled with an accent. The San Jose newspaper doesn't use an accent. <a href="http://www.sanjose.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sanjose.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sanjose.com/</a> doesn't use an accent. <a href="http://www.sanjosesharks.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sanjosesharks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sanjosesharks.com/</a> doesn't use it. If they do it on their official websites, that's decidedly odd. Do we start putting accents on Los Angeles? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 16:36, 2 Jan 2004 (UTC)

<dd>To jump in on this, as both a San Jose resident and a SJSU alum, the city and the university are pretty much the only instutitions that use the accent, the rest of us ignore it. I believe the accent was adopted in the late 1980s or early 1990s to show off our "cultural heratige" as the oldest city in California. It is a symptom of SJ's inferiority complex. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGentgeen_2e43.html" title="User:Gentgeen">Gentgeen</a> 22:46, 2 Jan 2004 (UTC)

<p>Hi Angela. Thanks for the welcome. I've just discovered Wikipedia and I feel that I'm going to be spending a lot of time here.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping me be more specific in my link additions. Actually, I think you'll find myMicronesia to be one of the most comprehensive sites on the internet in the area of Micronesia, and is quite relevant to the islands of Kosrae, Chuuk, Yap, Northern Marianas and others.</p>

<dd>As the author of that text naming conventions, I can state confidently that the version that is protected is fine. The example that 80.255 quotes as justification for his assertion, only prohibits not mentioning continued geographical use, and does NOT prohibit use referring to them in the present tense. He has been told this before, and is persisting in wilfully misreading a policy he originally opposed to back up his claims.

<p>Angela, I think your npov-excising-edit, injecting perception, was not a good one. The article is about IRT.

Then another editor, who rightly thot that the disamb belonged on the main article under the name <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto.html" title="Magneto">Magneto</a>, accomplished that by cutting and pasting <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28engine_component%29.html" title="Magneto (engine component)">Magneto_(engine component)</a>'s content over the redir, and putting a redir back to <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto.html" title="Magneto">Magneto</a> over the text of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28engine_component%29.html" title="Magneto (engine component)">Magneto_(engine component)</a>.

<p>Hi this is Zestauferov. John kenney came after the discussions at the end of December had finished and the work had been done and nasically let us know that he does not like it. Which is fine because it is not finished yet and anything he wants to add can be put in. Basically we agree that the Prussia page should cover all aspects and not be just about the Brandenburg Prussia state. Ultimately we want to phase out the disambiguation page. If you have any suggestions please post. The article is still in a bit of a mess. I am having a baby tomorrow and do not have a lot of time to focus on it now but wanted to get the ball rolling before that happens.

<p>I removed some of the discussion concerning the administration page because it looked like a phantom edit - It still does. The dates for the comments I removed were April/May of 2003. The comments "I've unprotected this page" and "I unprotected it again" <b>do not</b> apply to the administrators page, which has stayed locked since I protected it. You can check for yourself in the protection log.</p>
<p>Almost all of the rest of the comments (Dershowitz-Finkelstein Affair, Silesia, extermination camp, et al) I removed were unchanged for almost three weeks. (Except, now that I look carefully, the last comment in Death camp was only 6 days old). When you say I removed text that was only a few hours old, I just don't see what you are talking about.</p>
<p>In the future, I'll archive them - I didn't know they were supposed to be.</p>

<p>Could you possibly look at my comments on the discussion for <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_server.html" title="Key server">Key server</a>? My Hungarian isn't fluent, but I could manage a translation. OTOH is this obscure enough to let die the death it would have had without the crash - and let an anglophone write it from scratch if ever needed? The content is valid enough and it is still probably one of the most effective methods of cryptography - just a rather obscure topic. The few bits of English on the page are mine - <a href="../../../u/n/k/User%7EUnkamunka_4a03.html" title="User:Unkamunka">unkamunka</a><a href="../../../u/n/k/User_talk%7EUnkamunka_7526.html" title="User talk:Unkamunka">.</a> 04:19, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since we're keeping it, can it be retitled either "The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" or simply "Message-Digest Algorithm" - to convey the substance?

I complained that the article makes not the least attempt to say what factor analysis is (and please see the discussion page before disputing this). The page's first author rather belligerently and falsely accused me of wanting to write some sort of ivory-towerish account devoid of any mention of practical applications. What incited that attack I do not know. What happened was a sort of compromise. But my objection stands: the article <i>still</i> simply does not care what factor analysis is; it makes no attempt to even hint at that topic. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 02:05, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
