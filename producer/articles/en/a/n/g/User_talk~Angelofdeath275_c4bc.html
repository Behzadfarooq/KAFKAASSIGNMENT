<p>I think we should add something like that. There isn't much of them, actually, for not all episodes have a victim-of-the-day, and I can't remember all of these characters without watching the whole series, but I'll be able to add them later. Just tell me where to place this stuff.</p>
<p>Also, after watching the final credits for several episodes, I came to the conclusion that using the middle dot for separating the last name and the first name looks odd. They usually do such things only with non-Japanese names that are written in katakana. Japanese names written in kanji/hiragana have just spaces. Anyway, I've never seen the middle dot used in Japanese names. (Again, looked at the "Sailor Moon" articles, there are no middle dots used.)</p>
<p>Tired of fixing Lettuce's 碧 <i>midori</i> kanji in the articles... someone is constantly changing it to 緑. Maybe add some note about this, too? (Geez, two kanji for "blue", two kanji for "green"... and how am I supposed to finish learning Japanese after all this?..)</p>
<p>...And can you explain to me how to read that "Japanese name pronunciation" thing in the aliens' (and some other) articles? I don't know how, and I don't think all TMM fans know it...</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Well, if anything, it is here: A list of Tokyo Mew Mew anime minor characters. I think it is way too long for a section in the main article, needs a separate page.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Another thing that always gets changed... Mickey's name... again, nobody knows how it's written in the manga... I added the katakana for the name, but do people really pay attention to such things?......</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>WOW!!! And if after that somebody else will say something against "reborn"...</p>

<p>The word "check" with a long vowel... yes, but it's only in one of Ichigo's attacks. All other attacks do not contain words that can be written differently in katakana, and they also say "reborn".</p>
<p><i>*Points on this link again* Is it even worth adding to the article?</i></p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>I think I'll be adding the info for some time, as I watch random TMM episodes, but it'll be good if somebody else helps me with this list, as I've only seen the original anime, so I can't add info from MMP and other dubs. I believe MMP has some alterations other than renaming, as 4Kids seems to like changing characters' personality... Also, the list is <i>not</i> complete. I didn't include some other characters. I can take screenshots from the episodes with all these characters, only I'm afraid that my computer will be against uploading files again... I now can try to use another Internet connection, maybe it'll help, but I don't really know how to upload files to Wikipedia, what to write in the descriptions of the files.</p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned something about Hotaru desktop wallpaper? ^_^;; Yes, I know, it's a lame present, but I just don't know how to thank Ian Miller for help... Since he likes Hotaru...</p>

<p>I originally made this for my Sailor Moon fansite.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If only it isn't specifically said anywhere in the notes in the original manga that "reborn" was supposed to be a pun on "ribbon", we can't say for sure, even though the attacks do contain other puns. I mean, Sailor Saturn's "Death Reborn Revolution" does involve ribbons, so in that case the pun is obvious. The Mews do not use ribbons, so even if it is a pun, it is unclear what it refers to; the only possible version is the opening song, but then it can apply only to the anime, while all these attacks actually first appeared in the manga.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Not sure if it does count... In episode 11, there is a TV show named "Ani-Ani-Animal", and it's title is shown written at one point.</p>
<p><a href="http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p3/Yume_no_Kishi/tmm_ani_ani_animal.jpg" class="external text" title="http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p3/Yume_no_Kishi/tmm_ani_ani_animal.jpg" rel="nofollow">Ani Ani Animal</a></p>
<p>The translation of the katakana is from a fansub; I decided to choose a picture where this line is shown, to show how the word is translated.</p>

<p>Well, I'm currently watching random TMM episodes, trying to write out the characters' names in kanji/kana from the ending credits, and I've noticed something interesting. I have yet to watch episodes 45-52 to see what was done there, but it'll be after I finish with the minor characters list.</p>
<p>At first I thought that the Blue Knight's name doesn't appear in the credits at all (which didn't surprise me). Then I found some episodes (one of them is episode 19, for example) where his name <i>is</i> shown there (the same way as Deep Blue's, with a question mark instead of Megumi Ogata's name). The interesting thing is that in this episode, Masaya himself (in his normal form) does <i>not</i> appear. If both Masaya and the Blue Knight appear, only Masaya is mentioned. I think the reason for that is that the Blue Knight is considered just a form of Masaya, not an independent character. (And, if anything, Ryou's name <i>is</i> shown in episode 19, even though we're supposed to think that he's the Blue Knight. It's... just... a <b>hidden spoiler</b>!!!)</p>
<p>Now Deep Blue... I don't know about the last episodes yet (after his awakening), but in the first episodes he is <i>always</i> mentioned in the credits, <i>along with Masaya</i>. He first goes as "Mysterious voice" (謎の声 <i>Nazo no koe</i>), then, after his name is revealed, as "Deep Blue" （ディープブルー <i>Dīpu Burū</i>).</p>
<p>Can't say about the last episodes yet, but I <i>believe</i> that somewhere in the middle of the story (say, episode 27) his name <i>disappears</i> from the credits, though I'm not sure. I just remember that there was something weird, too. Maybe they just forgot to mention him... Though I kinda remember Deep Blue's name in one of the last episodes, where his identity has already been revealed, and Megumi Ogata was listed in the credits as his seyuu... For sure I'll need to examine this thing better... I need to understand whether Deep Blue is <i>really</i> treated as a separate character or not...</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Believe or not, someone got confused by... <b>Ichigo's age mistake</b>! Guess we need a better explanation of this one... <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the person who tried to remove Ichigo's age explanation started doing it at the wrong time, when I couldn't explain anything properly. This is just another proof of how much confusion is there.</p>
<p>Strange, because if you read Ichigo's talk page, seems that the person was confused by the "chuu-ichi" thing from Ichigo's intro, but then somehow ended up saying that the TE section is not an appropriate place for this stuff... <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Then again, if you see the history of the page, this person <b>first</b> deleted this thing <b>and</b> claimed it's OR <b>and</b> called it silly, and <b>then</b> tried to explain <b>why</b>. These things annoy me. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>I got really tired of trying to explain to that person why we keep Ichigo's age mistake in the TMM article. Those who change her age in the TMM article do not even <b>read</b> this section, so do you think they would read something in another article? How to convince the person that it <i>is</i> worth mentioning. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Since the whole TE section is still marked OR, I see no reason for deleting anything from it. I now have some problems with Internet, so I don't know if I'll be able to edit it the next day or two. Please try to find any proof for Ichigo's age. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>

<p>Well... I just hope you won't get a heart attack upon seeing my edits to this stuff. Perfectblue97 just <i>could not explain properly from the very beginning what was wrong</i>, and since I automatically see all people who delete stuff from the TE section without explanation as vandals, I probably wouldn't have read it either, since the explanation came <i>after</i> deleting stuff. And I still insist that this should be merged with "International Adaptations of Tokyo Mew Mew"; it just attracts <b>way</b> too much attention when it's in the main article.</p>

<dd>I'm already tired of this thing... I did mention that it could be a mistake in the original manga, but since Tokyopop didn't pay attention to this anyway, it's still <i>their</i> mistake, too: they could have noticed that Ichigo's age doesn't match her grade. I really wish I had the original manga to see if her age is stated correctly or not (and I'm sure it was said correctly... well, we still need a scan of this, and I can't find it anywhere...)</dd>

<p>Do not revert it, as it will be a beginning of a new edit war... I really do not want you to get banned from Wikipedia. (And if anything, I can restore it at any time.) Technically, it is really more of a personal opinion, though some parts of it could be used... A la Mode has many plot-holes, and it can be mentioned, but in another way...</p>
<p>Thinking more about this...</p>
<p>You know, I never had a chance to read the manga, original or translated, therefore I can only judge by other fans' opinions written on Tokyo Mew Mew forums...</p>
<p>It is a known thing that sequels of popular stories are often very disappointing. An example I can think of is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_NeverEnding_Story_%28film%29_d5cf.html" title="The NeverEnding Story (film)">The NeverEnding Story</a>. The first movie I <b>love</b> (nothing less), the second movie I can watch if I haven't anything better to watch, and the third movie I <b>hate</b> (there wasn't even <i>anything</i> from the novel!). (Again, notice that it's just my personal opinion.) There are some exceptions, but usually the original is better.</p>
<p>The same thing was with A la mode: it was created just because the original story became very popular. Yeah, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a> wasn't originally intended to be longer than the Dark Kingdom series, but in that case all five stories were connected to each other and nothing appeared out of the blue.</p>
<p>While I do believe that many fans dislike Berry, it's still their personal opinion. There <b>are</b> reasons for this, I'm not arguing about it. But I do <b>not</b> think that this info can make articles better.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this thing starts to remind me of how many TMM fans hate Aoyama for being "too perfect". It isn't mentioned in his article! I believe I'm simply too old to get into this "whom Ichigo looks better with" thing, or to be a crazy fan of <a href="../../../r/y/o/Ryou_Shirogane_4c69.html" title="Ryou Shirogane">Ryou Shirogane</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kish_%28Tokyo_Mew_Mew%29_9241.html" title="Kish (Tokyo Mew Mew)">Kish</a>. (Why, I have a boyfriend in real life, and for sure I prefer him over any fictional character. ~_^ That is why I don't like fangirls.) However, it's a fact that poor Masaya is hated by a majority of fans. Only it is not mentioned anywhere in Wikipedia...</p>
<p>Also, the manga itself is <b>not</b> a reliable source of such things. If it was so, we wouldn't have to bother Ian Miller and ask him to write a review about the "reborn", for we have <i>pictures from the original manga</i>, where it is clearly shown that the word is not the same as in the opening song. But that wasn't enough.</p>
<p>That's just my opinion on this thing. I know that you are trying to make the articles better. But such things are not something that is usually included into an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia has just basic info, with no further analysis of the topic (which is what you're trying to do). There <i>can</i> be some additional info, but only if it is: 1) <i>really</i> important, or 2) interesting to know about, and 3) with sources cited. A la Mode/Berry stuff is none of these. So... sorry for not sharing your opinion, but I kinda begin to think that it wasn't <i>that</i> good to keep this in the articles...</p>

<dd>Eh? What does that mean? This mistake could've been noticed by anyone else... and I wasn't even sure that this thing would go into the articles... Yes, I was the first person (apparently...) to point it out, but I'm sure there were some people who noticed the mistake, but thought it wasn't important (they still think it isn't...). Say I was the first to post this info on Wikipedia talk pages, that'll be enough...</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm tired of the things on Ichigo's article talk page. <b>Who cares</b> if a particular person decided to use "ribbon"? Why arguing about it? And one may think that writing the words correctly is actually <i>a good thing!</i> And there may be people who are <i>interested</i> in learning the correct translation! Does that mean that if a person deletes this thing just because he/she doesn't want to know/use the correct translation, then he/she is just... selfish?.. And those lines that are mentioned there (those for the "vowels that are drawn out") look <i>different</i> from a normal <i>chōon</i>, by the way. Look at the BK's manga picture that you uploaded - <i>those</i> are said lines. They're used only at the end of a phrase or a part of a phrase, not somewhere at random. Considering how the attack name are shown (the font that is used), it doesn't look like this... Why other vowels in the other Mews' attacks aren't drawn out? And this completely changes the meaning of the word; Japanese is not the language where you can change the length of the vowel just because you decided to do so. "Ribbon is girly" is stupid as well - POV. If the creators wanted to use "ribbon", they'd have written リボン, not リボーン. If Tokyopop changed the word purposefully, without any note about this it still looks like a mistake. And what is "I prefer to say so"? Well, you know, I kinda got used to calling <a href="../../../u/s/a/Usagi_Tsukino_5b34.html" title="Usagi Tsukino">Usagi Tsukino</a> "Bunny", and I think that "Bunny" sounds cute. However, on my SM webpage I always call her "Usagi", because I decided that the info on my webpage should be based on the original Japanese version. That's a different thing. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Yume no Kishi has nothing else to do... ^_^;;; Just wanted to say that I have a bad habit of leaving comments in the articles; this is usually when I want to add some info, but don't know how to put it in better words. So read carefully when editing the articles. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Still don't like how the info about international versions is placed in the articles at random. The whole VA lists at the end of the characters articles... why not put the info about this in the Adaptations article? Same goes for attacks and transformations... <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>

<p>Just to throw some more confusion into the mix.</p>
<p>Did you notice that Lettuce's Birthday comes after the high school cutoff date (April), but Ichigo's comes before it?</p>
<p>This means that, in oder for them to be on the same grade, there must be an 11 month age gap, not a 1 month age gap. They would only be the same age for a very short period of time.</p>
<p>Ichigo is about as young as it is possible to be in any Japanese school grade, while Lettuce is about as old as it is possible to be in a Japanese school grade.</p>

<dd>As shown by the "ribbon/reborn" thing, pictures themselves can't be count as a reference. Besides, there are still fans like Fushi2 and Kiwi-chan, who won't believe it even with pictures. And fans who just add random stuff to the articles, because they've read some of the translated manga, and so they "know"... ("Kirema Anima", yeah...) You know how many stupid edits I sometimes have to revert? I'm usually online at least 10 hours a day - if I'm at home and not sleeping. I'm monitoring all TMM articles via the watchlist, so I often can revert stupid changes in a few minutes. Sometimes the changes are made only in one of several articles that have the same info, which indicates that people don't even bother to read other articles. As long as this stuff is edited by fangirls, there will be more stupidity added. If we find references for all translation errors, we'll at least be sure that this section won't be eventually deleted by admins, and that admins can help us to protect this section from vandals. <b><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">Yume</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yume_no_Kishi_49fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">no</font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/m/User_talk%7EYume_no_Kishi_6b77.html" title="User talk:Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">Kishi</font></a></b></dd>

<li>The Truth about "reborn" slowly reaches the owners of TMM fansites... ^_^ Of course, it'll take some time, but come on! the mistakes in the "Sailor Moon" manga also lived for years before they were explained! For sure an article at DIES GAUDII is a much more stronger argument than just a note written by two wikiusers! And I <i>still</i> think that if the authors meant "ribbon", they'd have written リボン, and not リボーン: it's so much simplier! I mean, why use one word if you actually mean another? And if it is a pun, it's still more correct to use "reborn", like in Saturn's attack. And still - no signs of any ribbons in their attacks...<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Now we need to do something with other "alterations"... While the "anima" reference we probably can get somewhere (it's still important, as many fans were confused by this thing; and it's even more interesting than Sailor AnimaMates, because here it's quite possible that "anima" is not only a shortened form of "animal", but a reference to the term "anima" itself), I have absolutely <i>no clue</i> what to do with Ichigo's age...</p>

<p><b>More ideas</b> (sorry, I'm just trying to improve the articles, have many ideas, but not sure if they're good, so I'll ask first)</p>
<p>It's just <i>really</i> bad that I don't have the manga, because it makes it very difficult to tell if there are any notable differences in the plot or not. To look at the Mews' articles, the "manga" and "anime" sections in their "history" sometimes have almost the same text, with only a few sentences altered. Reminds me of the description of TMM adaptations back when the stuff was in the main article and the Italian version was just added. Makes the articles redundant.</p>
<p>This is how I organize characters' pages on my SM website: I start with basic info - something that is certainly true for both versions, a sort of an intro (i.e. who the character is, his/her role in the story, etc.), then describe the manga version, with some <i>really important</i> plot details and personality, and then in the anime section I describe <i>just the difference from the manga</i> - not the whole plot difference, as it goes to a separate place if it's really notable, but rather something that can show if there are any changes in characters' powers/personality between the two versions<b>*</b>. (The only exception is when the whole character's story is completely different, as in case of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chibi_Chibi_ddd7.html" title="Chibi Chibi">Chibi Chibi</a>, but there are no such things in TMM.) IMO, this is way better than altering the same text to make it suitable for another version, or writing huge plot summaries instead of just pointing out the differences. Besides, this is how Mew Mew Power version is described, as there is no need to repeat the same with different names. Anyway, the main idea is to avoid repetition.</p>
<p><b>*</b> And I mean - <i>really</i> important plot details. Some articles have some description of the plot, but completely lack the description of the characters - not only powers, but also personality. Sometimes it's other way around. This thing needs a balance. And don't forget that I can watch most of the anime episodes whenever I want, so I can provide the info; it's only difficult for me to compare it to the manga.</p>

<p>The recent rewriting of the NOR policy statements can help us greatly. Basically we are talking just about the different translations (correct or incorrect) of certain words - this thing is much more easy to prove than some speculations about characters' personality and such (like Mint's "crush" on Zakuro). Moreover, said speculations just <i>can't</i> be proven, while the translations <i>can</i> - if there is any person who can analyze the info and made it available for citing. This is our chance to save the Alterations section. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">夢の騎士</font></a><sup><a href="../../../y/u/m/User_talk%7EYume_no_Kishi_6b77.html" title="User talk:Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">Yume no Kishi - Talk</font></a></sup></p>

<dd>I've put a link to Anime News Network in the adaptations article, as a reference for Italian version, as it didn't have any... but there are some contradictions between this page and the article... ANN still calls the "Italian version" of Kish "Quiche", and there was also some character named "Kai", who, I suppose, is actually Keiichiro. (The page may get edited, but when I looked up the info there, it was like this.) Pie was actually called "Pai" there. On an interesting note, the Italian Wikipedia has half of the names messed up, and also characters' ages. I guess we need some more sources for this thing... <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">夢の騎士</font></a><sup><a href="../../../y/u/m/User_talk%7EYume_no_Kishi_6b77.html" title="User talk:Yume no Kishi"><font color="goldenrod">Yume no Kishi - Talk</font></a></sup></dd>

<p>I don't remember anything about Zakuro's family from the anime, but that's not the worst thing. My computer apparently got a virus, so I won't edit Wikipedia from it until it's gone.

<dd>(Need I repeat how much I hate editing from this computer?..) OK, I was going to add episode summaries, right? (Not now, but after I fix stuff on my own computer.) Well, now the question is what they should look like. I mean, I can write them in any way: just add some 4-5-line description right in the table, or make a normal 4-5-paragraph summary, with episode highlights (characters introduced etc.), and put them on separate pages.

<dd>This thing is kinda universal for all articles, so it would be helpful, and it actually can be used for any kind of name changes. Other things are minor. They are considered just inserting unverified info (there is already a template message for this), but the names are a special case. The name changes are considered bad edits because the rule about using names (which I kinda described in my template) works everywhere on Wikipedia. Such changes can not be called mistakes - it is just a matter of translation. Oh, and this template needs to be subst'ed too, like other templates, so it would be {{subst:<a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_uw-names_6c1e.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi/uw-names">User:Yume_no_Kishi/uw-names</a>}}.
