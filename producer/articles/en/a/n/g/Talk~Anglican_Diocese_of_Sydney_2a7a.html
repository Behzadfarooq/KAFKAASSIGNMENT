<p>Yeah, that's the right headline.</p>
<p>Feelings of marginalisation go beyond the clergy or parishes. There are many individuals who feel marginalised.</p>
<p>Now how does one express accurately the disatisfaction of Anglicans in the vast Western and Southern Regions where Sydney Evangelicalism prevails to the extent that it's very hard to find any church which-</p>
<ul>
<li>Follows the church year - ie celebrates not just Christmas and Easter but also Maundy Thursday, Pentecost, Palm Sunday, Trinity Sunday, Lent and Advent and perhaps a patronal festival.</li>
<li>holds Communion regularly</li>
<li>Follows a cycle of readings (either Three Year or BCP) rather than themes determined by the preacher.</li>
<li>Has sermons based upon the readings ie "The Word of God"</li>
<li>Has a prayerbook service, either BCP or AAPB</li>
<li>uses the psalm and collect set for the day.</li>
<li>has a priest/lay reader who robes. Yes, some people really prefer this, not as an "outward display" but as something that gives the person of the priest a more neutral identity. This has significance, not for a priest as preacher but in pronouncing absolution and blessing, and officiating at Communion and Baptism.</li>
<li>uses real hymns.</li>
<li>doesn't have an amplified band.</li>
<li>And a real bonus would be the singing of the Canticles, perhaps even with a choir.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the entire vast Illawarra Region, I do not know of any church that has a choir. The Cathedral choir were dismissed by the previous Dean. There is a church that holds a BCP service once a month, and BCP Communion on Fifth Sundays. This church is certainly not High Church or "Anglo-Catholic". I know of no "High Church" in the region.</p>
<p>In the entire Western Region, there is only one church which describes itself as of moderately Anglo-Catholic practice. It has a choir. That's Granville. Which is an awfully long way from Mt Victoria, if that's where you happen to live.</p>
<p>There are abbout 8-12 churches which follow either more formal Anglican or High Church practice, but apart from Granville and Dee Why, they are all within the small area close to Sydney and most are "inner city". Of these churches, several are too high church in their practice and use far too much incense for many people.</p>
<p>To sum up- Many people simply want Evangelical teaching combined with traditional Anglican liturgy and real hymns, and for many of them, it's simply not made available in a form that is acceptable. A watered-down version by an unrobed priest, that's called a meeting and is over-amplified is not the same thing at all.</p>
<p>I'm not writing here about some priests or parishes within the Diocese who feel marginalised. I'm writing about hundreds of Angelicans, many of them Evangelical, and many of them staunch admirers of our present Archbishop, who nonetheless feel alienated.</p>
<p>I cannot speak for the situation of those who wish to combine formal services with a more charismatic ethos.</p>

<dd>Hi again Amandajm. I thought I'd made a fairly good attempt at neutrality in this sensitive section but I'm generally very happy with your changes and see them as improvements. As to some of the points you raise here:
<ul>
<li>Surely your "many individuals" is well encompased by "parishes" since it is the many individuals who constitute a parish.</li>
<li>"Now how does one express accurately the disatisfaction of Anglicans... to the extent that it's very hard to find any church which ..." - that is a question that's well beyond the scope of this Discussion page although I'll venture to say that it's a question you need to raise with individual parishes who elect their own parish councils and parish nominators. However, while I'll agree that the current leadership could be more willing to cater to those who prefer a more formal style of worship (when parishes don't have the financial independence to appoint their own rectors), I feel strongly that all our churches need to radically reconsider how we continue to meet together as God's people. Our current styles of worship need to be accessible to outsiders while uplifting, nurturing and sustaining those who've already embraced the Gospel of Jesus.</li>
</ul>

Hi Angusj!</p>
<p>The "many individuals" are those who wander from church to church searching. They are the people who don't "belong" to parishes because they are not comfortable with the style of Sydney Anglicanism. These people don't really have the power to change anything. They have no hope of being elected as a nominator for anywhere. Now tell me, who was it who wrote "the diocese in Melbourne" rather than "the Diocese of Melbourne"? That was a <i>very</i> clever one! It almost got by me.</p>
<p>I don't believe that highly-amplified music adds to accessibility. I don't believe that the lack of liturgy adds to accessibility. On the other hand, I think that BCP/AAPB are hard to follow, but there's a perfectly easy solution- heavy-duty printed sheets. All the new-comer needs is for someone to say, We all join in the bits in bold type. I don't believe that singing the same chorus twenty times in a row has the same value as singing Amazing Grace, or All Creatures of our God and King, or There Is a Green Hill, through just one time. (I'm not saying this to the exclusion of good modern hymns)</p>
<p>What I know is this- Teenagers <i>love</i> every sort of simulated pseudo-ancient story, movie and computer game there is. They love the notion of tradition and rite. They can tell you every detail of Middle Earth Law, of Hogwarts Academy, of Narnia and of The Empire. They know how to slay an orc, how to defeat a basilisk and exactly what it was that the White Witch said to Darth Vader. They play Dungeons and Dragons, Age of Mythology, and Runescape with obsession. The da Vinci Code with all its mumbo-jumbo of secret societies and sacred rites is the most popular book on the planet.</p>
<p>So then, in the light of all this, Anglican liturgy makes Christian Faith inaccessible?</p>
<p>Don't you think that perhaps if one said-</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to learn an old Jewish song of praise that was written 700 years before Jesus?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to use some prayers that were written or translated for the 15-yr-old son of Henry VIII?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How about we make a statement of our Faith just the way Christian's have been saying it since since 325 AD years. Day after day, for 1700 years!</li>
</ul>
<p>... then perhaps some of these young people might actually <i>enjoy</i> knowing that they belonged to a church that has a very long history and many complex layers of traditions?</p>
<p>And while we are depriving our kids of their traditions in the Church, our Premier is legislating that every child should know Advnce Ausralia Fair, and within the Roman Catholic Church there is a very strong movement reinforcing the catechism of catholic youth.</p>
<p>I just want our kids to know the Lord's Prayer, the creed and the twenty third psalm (Crimond tune), so that when the Holy Church throughout the World prays, or sings or pronounces their faith, our kids aren't left bumbling around searching for the overhead projection. It's their right! It does more than make faith accessible; it makes it universal and unites people.</p>
<p>Believe me, there is no more profoundly moving experience than standing with ten thousand people from "all corners of the Earth" and praying, each in his own tongue like the day of Pentecost, and knowing that whatever the language, this is our Lord's prayer to Our Father and we, regardless of denomination, are united in praying it. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 05:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Amandajm, Please don't think for one minute I'm trying to defend current worship styles, nor do I think one style fits all. I do believe they all need radical rethinking. (Incidently, I also hate "highly-amplified music" and love many of our traditional hymns, and am a fan of "Songs of Praise" on the ABC!) My vision of radical change certainly doesn't include getting rid of what is very good&#160;:). Anyhow this discussion is really for another forum. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusj_ae2a.html" title="User:Angusj">angusj</a> 06:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I must also say that I think that there is a place for informal worship as well. I suppose that I see what we used to call "Youth Fellowship" passing as "Church". I think that Youth Fellowship, complete with prayers, Bible reading and teaching is a great thing. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 11:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>re BCP and AAPB</b> For the record. Just checked out the Cathedral website to see exactly what was on offer. The number of Choral services during the week has been cut back. BCP is used at the 8.30am and at a couple of weekday services. On the website, demonstrating enormous talent for communicting effectively with ordinary people, Phillip Jensen (at least I presume it was Phillip Jensen) has written an invitation to people to come to "Church" at 10.30. The writer then goes on to explain how it is conducted, with formal prayers, statement of faith, several "items" from the choir such as the Te Deum and so on.. It coincides with Sunday School and preceeded by Bible study in the Chapter house and followed by morning tea. The whole thing is made to sound very welcoming and accessible. Formally structured but made easy byt the information that (for example) if you are late, the volunteers will assist you etc. This is exactly the sort of thing that I have had in mind, and I'm glad to see that the Dean is doing it.</p>
<p>Now, here's an odd thing! I looked up Anglican Church Diocese of Sydney and got a site with a formal Mission Statement, a nice photo of Archbishop Peter Jensen and all the details of the formal structure of the Diocese, with a search. So I searched. Couldn't find the Cathedral website. And there were no links to <i>anything</i> except Anglican Media..... If you want to know anything about anything not related to formal structure and synod, you gotta go to Anglican Media to find it.</p>

<p>Yes, it's biblical.

<p>I'm a bit confused about the discussion of <b>priesthood of all believers</b> on this and other pages. The concept comes out of 1 Peter and means that all believers are God's priests not in the sacramental sense (for that is Christ's work alone) but in the representative sense. For Israel was meant to be a nation of priests, going between the Gentiles and God. Now Christians are to go between unbelievers and God; being his mouthpieces, explaining the gospel.</p>
<p>The concept is not about ordination. It does not refer to the elder/presbyter/overseer of Titus and 1 Timothy (which was left 'priest' at the English Reformation). While all Christians are God's priests, they are not all presbyters. Thus it is invalid to say that Sydney's decision not to ordain women, contradicts their acceptance of the priesthood of all believers. For one is about the status of Christians before God and mankind, and the other is about about a role some Christians fulfil within God's church. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 06:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There were three references attached to this passage. I followed them, looking for the support of this statement which begins "It has been suggested...."</p>
<p>Now, while, on one hand I accept that it may have been suggested..., none of the three references were directly suggesting anything that was <i>specifically</i> critical of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney.

<p>I deleted the reference to the roles of "Men and Women as set down in .....Genesis".</p>
<p>My reason for doing this is that I believe some people mistake the description of Eve as the "help" of Adam as meaning that Eve has a subordinate role.</p>
<p>There are two ways to help. A mother says to a toddler "Come and help me put the washing out! You can pass the pegs." The same mother says "Let me help you do your jigsaw puzzle. Why don't you try turning that piece around?" In these two applications of the same word "helping" takes on two very different meanings.</p>
<p>While men often see a wife as the person who passes them the light globe, the woman sees herself as the person who holds the ladder steady while he climbs it.</p>
<p>When we say "God, help me!" we don't mean "God, stand by and be my assistant." What we mean is "God, save me!", "God, comfort me!" or "God, heal me!"</p>
<p>Like the God who is called on in times of need and darkest distress, in her role as "help" a woman is anything but subordinate. Hence I removed the reference to a supposed ordained order. (On the grounds that it is open to interpretation and ought not be taken as a given)</p>

<p>Amandajm why are you pushing your hobby horse on Genesis here? It may not be the interpretation you agree with but clearly it is the interpretation of the Sydney diocese. Your view on the matter is irrelevant to the clear and public Sydney Anglican view which should be neutrally presented in this article.</p>
<p>Hi, whoever you are! (I wish people would give themselves an identity of some sort). The problem is that I am a Sydney Anglican and I think that rather than making the statement "blah de blah <i>as set down in Genesis</i>" there needs to be some explanation of how the Genesis passage is being interpreted. Because, as I have made clear, it is open to two very different interpretations.

<p>I am still to read any of these but in my correspondance it seems the word "advocate" is too strong, but he apparently thought that segregation would lead to greater societal harmony: five families in five houses would be more peaceful than five families in one house.

<dd>Might I respectfully suggest that before you remove wording such as advocate you read what DBK wrote.

<p>It is interesting and very sad that my points about the history of the Diocese ( i added the sections about Archdeacon Scott and some of the material on Bp Broughton) and on the 'red book' and on the positive (or at least politically correct) parts of the diocesan politics (Again i added the section on Abp Loanes championship of 'boat people') have survived. that part on this topic (substantiated with proper sources widely available in the major work on the Anglican church in Australia Bruce Kaye (Ed) Anglicanism in Australia: A History (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0522850030</a>) (Dr Kaye was the General Secretary of General Synod his book has been respectfully reviewed (e g here <a href="http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/reviews/jrbview.cgi?n=0522850030" class="external free" title="http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/reviews/jrbview.cgi?n=0522850030" rel="nofollow">http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/reviews/jrbview.cgi?n=0522850030</a>) has been deleted.

Dear Backnumber 1662, I deleted the segment on apartheid because I cannot find any primary sources for it. I waited for a month to see if anyone could come up with one. The only source that is available is the opinion of Bill Lawton. None of the other sources appear to exist. As you said, Moore college does not have these volumes, nor any other library in NSW that has an on-line catalogue. If support for apartheid was considerable then there should be some primary evidence for it. I invite you to contribute to the on-line discussion linked above as soon as you have any information. From what I can gather DBKs view was somewhere between the sort of multiculturalism that existed in Australia up until 2005 and the form of self determination that exists for the Inuit in Canada. I can find nothing that would suggest that he supported the sort of discrimination that was the hallmark of apartheid however I am very open to being proved wrong.

</dl>
<ul>
<li>For those who are not Sydney Evangelicals (which is the more accurate name for this page, as that is how we are known), to say "a liberal in the mold of Harry Goodhew" is not to imply an exponent of Liberal Theology. It simply implies that Harry Goodhew was a little more liberal than the present archbishop, showing, for example, some sympathy towards the cause of Women's Ordination.</li>
<li>There appears to be some sort of a slur implied in Jensen2007's question. I can't quite understand why this forum has been used for that purpose, or why Jensen2007 would wish to cast some little stone in the direction of a man whose style of ministry has been marked by love, humble service, self-effacement, outreach, wisdom and implacability in the face of challenge to his own right as archbishop to show faith, kindness and respect towards others.</li>
<li>Harry is no longer Archbishop of Sydney. Since no just cause for crucifixion could be found within his term office, I would like to call upon you to respect his retirement from Sydney politics and give over your efforts to prayerful support of his work with those in the slums and garbage dumps of Africa.</li>

<p>I put up the photos. I think that the text in general needs a few more photos but my inclusions were based of availability. I would be happy to see a few faces on notable people in a gallery at the end. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 03:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again Amanda. If Jensen2007 is who I think he is then I'm very confident that no slur was intended by suggesting I'm a Goodhew supporter. Likewise I'm very confident that Jensen2007 intended no disrespect of former archbishop Goodhew. Anyhow, thanks for making it clear to those outside the diocese that Goodhew was still very much aligned with the the reformed evangelical tradition that's prevalent in the Sydney diocese. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype; font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusj_ae2a.html" title="User:Angusj"><font color="blue">angus</font><font color="navy">j</font></a></span> 11:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your reply, Angus. You're probably right. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 12:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think they disrupt the flow of the text. There is a photo gallery module for WP we could use, or the photos could be shifted to individual Abp pages. --<a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 01:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd leave a couple of them in, perhaps the more important ones. But one for each Bishop or Archbishop is too much. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 04:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
