<p>One day a king named Vali, who was childless, went to the <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_River_7af6.html" title="Ganges River">Ganga</a> river to perform his ablutions. Then a raft to which the old sage Dirgatamas, cast away by his wife and sons, was tied, approached him. The king took the old man. Vali, chose him for raising up offspring. King Vali sent his wife Sudeshna unto him. But the queen knowing that the latter was blind and old went not unto him, she sent unto him her nurse. And upon that Sudra woman the Rishi begat eleven children of whom <b>Kakshivat</b> was the eldest. And beholding those eleven sons with Kakshivat as the eldest, who had studied all the Vedas, king Vali one day asked the Rishi saying, ‘Are these children mine?’ The Rishi replied, ‘No, they are mine. They were begotten by me upon a <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudra.html" title="Sudra">Sudra</a> woman. The king Vali then again sent unto him his queen Sudeshna. The Rishi by merely touching her said, ‘Thou shalt have five children named Anga, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanga_Kingdom_1076.html" title="Vanga Kingdom">Vanga</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalinga_Kingdom_fc73.html" title="Kalinga Kingdom">Kalinga</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pundra_Kingdom_9605.html" title="Pundra Kingdom">Pundra</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suhma_Kingdom_df87.html" title="Suhma Kingdom">Suhma</a>.

Thereupon, Bhimasena deeply pierced with a long arrow that elephant. That arrow, penetrating through its body, sank deep in the earth. And at this the elephants fell down. While the elephant was falling down, the Mleccha king also was falling down it. But Vrikodara, cut off his head with a broad-headed arrow before his antagonist actually fell down. When the heroic ruler of the Angas fell, his divisions fled away. (7,24)</p>

Then the ruler of the Angas hurled at Nakula eight hundred lances bright as the rays of the Sun. Each of these Nakula cut off into three fragments. Nakula then cut off the head of his antagonist with a crescent-shaped arrow. At this that mleccha king, deprived of life, fell down with the animal he rode. Upon the fall of the prince of the Angas who was well-skilled in elephant-lore, the elephant-men of the Angas, filled with rage, proceeded with speed against Nakula. (8,22)</p>

<p>Karna:- Fie on the Arattas and the people of the country of the five rivers! Commencing with the Pancalas, the Kauravas, the Naimishas, the Matsyas,--all these,--know what religion is. The old men among the Northerners, the <b>Angas</b>, the Magadhas, (without themselves knowing what virtue is) follow the practices of the pious.</p>
<p>Shalya:- The abandonment of the afflicted and the sale of wives and children are, O Karna, prevalent amongst the <b>Angas</b> whose king thou art. Recollecting those faults of thine that Bhishma recited on the occasion of the tale of Rathas and Atirathas, drive away thy wrath. Do not be angry. Brahmanas may be found everywhere; Kshatriyas may be found everywhere; so also Vaishyas and Shudras.</p>

He beget a son named <i>Rishyasringa</i> in <i>Urvasi</i> of the Apsara clan. At this very period there was a ruler of the land of Anga known by the name of <b>Lomapada</b> who was a friend of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosala_Kingdom_332e.html" title="Kosala Kingdom">Kosala</a> king Dasaratha. We have heard that he from love of pleasure had been guilty of a falsehood towards a Brahmana. He was shunned by the priestly class. And he was without a ministering priest (to assist him in his religious rites). There were no rains in his territory for many years; so that his people began to suffer a draught. Lomapada, caused the youthful sage Rishyasringa to come to his kingdom, by attracting him using courtesans in his country. After Rishyasriga performed a sacrifice, rain came back to his kingdom.</p>

<p>An invitation came to Ruchi from the country of the Angas. The sister of Ruchi, named Prabhavati, was the spouse of Chitraratha, the ruler of the Angas. Ruchi, of very superior complexion, having attached those flowers to her hair, went to the palace of the king of the Angas in answer to the invitation she had received. Beholding those flowers on her hair the queen of the Angas, possessed of beautiful eyes, urged her sister to obtain some for her.
