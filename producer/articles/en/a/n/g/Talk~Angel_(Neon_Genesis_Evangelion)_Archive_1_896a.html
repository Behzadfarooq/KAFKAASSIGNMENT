<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; Angels</span></h2>
<p>My recollection is rusty, but weren't the angles said to be predicted in the Dead Sea Scrolls? I've done some research and all I've been able to find is that the Dead Sea Scrolls were written in Hebrew and often repeat gospels in the bible. I've never found anything connecting the 18 Angels to the Dead Sea Scrolls. In addition, searching the names of the angels turns out nothing but more Evangelion pages.</p>
<p>What my question is: are the Angels really a part of mythology/legends or were they specificially created for the anime? --Feb 15, 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is an actual area of study called angelology. There are a great many angels with names, and some of those were used or adapted for the series. As for the Dead Sea Scrolls, the implication is that SEELE has some of them kept secret. These fictional scrolls are the ones that contain the scenario for Third Impact and have no connection (other than name) to the real Dead Sea Scrolls. <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEASports_390c.html" title="User:EASports">EASports</a> 07:33, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should it be deemed useful, it would not be hard for me to screencap images of each Angel, for reference in this section. Indeed, there is a website which already has the images that we would require, and I'm confident that the webmistress wouldn't mind us borrowing them. --Soluzar</p>
<p>Yes, that would be very nice... and while you're at it, could you capture a facial image of every character?</p>
<p>If you can get clear permission to license captures from another website under GFDL, that is good too, of course.</p>
<p>There's a better, close-up picture of Arael out there. I used to have a copy on my computer, but I deleted it when I got <i>Die Sterne</i> or I'd upload it (and I haven't been able to find another copy XP). I'll see if I can photograph the picture in the artbook and link it, in case anyone else wants to try locating the picture online and wants to know what to look for. --Anon 11:18, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Names of Evangelions</span></h2>
<p>The Evas are often referred to in some sectors of the fan community by their Japanese designations. Rather than Unit 01, or Eva-01, the Japanese Seiyuu refer to the first Eva as Shogouki, with Sho meaning 'first' and gouki meaning 'unit'. The primary Evangelions of the story then become, in order, Zerogouki; Shogouki; Nigouki. This sounds rather more pleasant to my ears, than the English designation. Any objections to me using them in my edits? --Soluzar</p>
<p>If you do use them, simply say their Japanese name is &lt;XXXX&gt;</p>
<p>Even the opening sequence shows flashframes of the Evangelions as "Unit-01", "Unit-02", etc. All the promotional material and official artwork and fiction reflects that their official designations were intened to be "Unit-XX". -- Matariel 20:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I have only done a couple so far, my revised Angel descriptions are somewhat larger than that which existed previously. Does this pose a problem? Would the desire be to keep them as short as possible, or to expand them even further, or just leave as is? --Soluzar</p>
<p>Feel free to expand further... or even create a whole page for each Angel, if desired. That's what Wikipedia is all about!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do not actually create a page for each Angel as was suggested by the anonymous commenter; it is much more convenient, organized, and less excessive to have them all on the same page. -<a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrop_3814.html" title="User:Pyrop">℘yrop</a> <a href="../../../p/y/r/User_talk%7EPyrop_b0e6.html" title="User talk:Pyrop">(talk)</a> 02:47, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Creating a page for each Angel would be okay, so long as a great deal of extra information comes along with it. (e.g. an image, estimated height and weight, special attacks, meaning of the name, episode appearance, concept designer from Gainax, comments from Anno, etc.) That doesn't mean get rid of the overall Angels page, which would be good for discussing the Angels overall, but if you can dig up enough information for a full article about each Angel, then you should put them in their own Article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Shito" vs. "Tenshi"</span></h2>
<p>While the word <i>tenshi</i> approximates more exactly to the Japanese equivalent of the word "angel", <i>shito</i> approximates, as the article's opening says, to "disciple" or, better, "messenger." <i>Messenger</i> is in fact a close equivalent of the Greek term <i>angelos</i>, and it may be this equivalence that the creators of EVA intended, especially taken in the light of the "English" name of the series actually being a series of Greek words. I think this may be relevant to the article; is there any place we could include it? - Anonymous</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>kinda stupid but had to ask. so, the purpose of angels is trying to reach 'adam' (or lilith) to create 3rd impact and ending the human race? 70.70.209.80 22:10, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My understanding was that each of them wanted the earth for themselves. I took seriously the line that the other Angels were other directions that human life may have taken, and as a result want to be the direction that human life takes. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 04:11, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just like Hackwrench said, Angels were 'other versions' of mankind, and so they wanted to be the dominating species of the planet, just like humans are. When they awoke (with the second impact), they started to struggle to reach Terminal Dogma, leading to a 'destructive Third Impact', exterminating every other Angel species (including humanity). This explains why SEELE and Gendo could only achieve their Third Impact Scenario by killing every other Angels first: to let only mankind alive, thus leading to a 'constructive Third Impact' wich would gather all human life-forms togheter to make them a complete Angel (Human Complementation/Instrumentality Project). ~Nih 18:20, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Images</span></h2>

<p>I think regardless, humans are considered to be the 18th Angel per the information provided by the actually series (in the 2nd movie if I am right). You can't just discount reputible information from the main source even if you may disagree with it.</p>
<p>I'll reinsate it, and we can discuss it here in the future. Don't just make these kinds of huge edits without at least posting something here first.--<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi">Juhachi</a> 03:24, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can kinda counter his point, too... Touching Lilith does not start an impact, touching Adam does. However, as I recall, Misato said "<b>Maybe</b> humanity is the 18th Angel", not "humanity is the 18th Angel". <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a> 03:34, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If that's the truth, then I'd say just edit the article to take out the word 'maybe' and also to drop off a line about what you just mentioned.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rei's AT field</span></h2>
<p>Just watched the episode with the 17th Angel on CN today. Since I haven't read the manga, I was wondering something: When they said that the strongest AT field they had ever encountered (another Angel!) was in Central Dogma, I assumed it to be Rei. The AT field of the 17th Angel was already recognized, and she does have the soul of Lilith. And she just sorta appeared there, around the time that the AT field was identified. Is this totally crazy and/or more clear in the manga? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.29.72.186 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.29.72.186_0634.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.29.72.186">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I think you're right; Rei projected her AT field in the same manner that Tabris did when Units 01 and 02 began fighting. Also, Rei's AT field is mentioned specifically in <i>End of Evangelion</i>. Since the English translation of the 10th volume of the manga hasn't been released in the US yet, I can't say whether or not the manga makes this more clear. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 22:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Contradicting Name Meanings</span></h2>
<p>Is it me, or do the Angel's name meanings in each paragraph seem to contradict one another. I'll give an example: "The thirteenth Angel, Bardiel, named after Barachiel, the angel that governs lightning and hail." This contradicts: "Bardiel literally means "Humiliated Son of God," referring to being forced to possess an Eva instead of appearing in physical form." I think these should be looked into and disscussed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by CyberWrist101 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CyberWrist101_bbbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/CyberWrist101">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Both the identified Angels and their roles within biblical texts and the literal meanings may be significant, as many Angels are named using biblical references, and their nature as "Godlike" is referenced within the show several times. The names of certain Angels in biblical texts may not have the same literal meaning as is the function or purpose of that Angel, as is the case with some of the Angels in Evangelion. Its not a contradiction if the two meanings are clearly differenciated, as is the example you gave. A good example would be Kowaru, as his name literally means "of the seashore", but his Angel name "Tabris" refers to the Angel of free will. His "human" name is fitting because the seashore is the first place Shinji and Kawaru meet, and his "Angel" name is fitting because of him exercising his free will by allowing Shinji to kill him at the end of the episode. -- Matariel 20:12, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Japanese names?</span></h2>
<p>In the first section, the article reads "in the English translation, many of the Angels are named after certain angels in Judeo-Christian lore.", yet there is no mention of what the japanese names are. I had no idea that the Japanese names for the Angels are different (and can't find proof of that through google), and the article dosen't say what they are. So my question is -- is the quoted statement true, and if so, is there anyone who can get the japanese version's names for the angels?</p>

<dd>There's one episode late in the series where the Angels' names are flashed on the screen. ADV replaced them with English text, but I have a copy that wasn't edited in this way.

<dd>I noticed that, and it says basically the same thing. They're just Katakana representations of the known english names.

<dd>The original mask have a long beak like sharp point, the new one seems to be pretty much the same, but not fully grown out of the body and have a shorter beak. I bought two model sets to built both. Also, Sachiel seems to be the only angel that blinked (while intercepting a missile) before being hit by the N2 bomb. ref: <a href="http://www.1999.co.jp/asp/GoodsDetails_e.asp?Bno=&amp;Typ1_c=109&amp;Typ2_c=181&amp;Typ3_c=688&amp;SPage=1&amp;SC=24&amp;SN=Other+Evangelion&amp;It_c=10012982&amp;andor=0&amp;scope=0&amp;scope2=0&amp;thumb=1&amp;sortID=1&amp;urikire=1&amp;sort_sort=0&amp;ItKey=&amp;app_url=shop_right_e.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.1999.co.jp/asp/GoodsDetails_e.asp?Bno=&amp;Typ1_c=109&amp;Typ2_c=181&amp;Typ3_c=688&amp;SPage=1&amp;SC=24&amp;SN=Other+Evangelion&amp;It_c=10012982&amp;andor=0&amp;scope=0&amp;scope2=0&amp;thumb=1&amp;sortID=1&amp;urikire=1&amp;sort_sort=0&amp;ItKey=&amp;app_url=shop_right_e.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>. please click on other pictures to see more details. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a> 13:21, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't really see any difference between Sachiel's new mask and his old one. The only possibly and logical difference would be the fact that Sachiel's old mask was more worn out due to its possible age differerences or traits, and that its new mask is just plain vanilla construction paper color. If you put more thought into it, however, you'll find out that Sachiel's new mask has larger eye holes, meaning it probably replaced its head or something for its new head, possibly. The size of its visual contractors have probably gone an up or two.</dd>
