<p>Hi Angela, I am told you are the person who may know thw answer this: Can you tell me how to send an image from the Italian Wikipedia to the English, or do I just download it to my computer and then reupload it and take all the credit myself, which seems a little unfair. Also, if I wanted to translate a page complete with images from the Italian, am I allowed to do this, and if so, how can I do this without losing all the credits to pevious editors on the Italian site. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 16:02, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer, I will give it a try. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 11:35, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is getting absolutely ridiculous. I've never reported an IP to anyone before so I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it. It looks like a vandalbot. --G3pro 20:28, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>These were deleted by BCorr without any reason given. To them , I'll add that it took me a lot of stress and money to put my original comments on, and that's your reaction below hurt.

<p>Hi Angela! You're a Developer, aren't you? I need some help. I originally approached Andre Engels as a Steward, but he said that my problem needed a Developer rather than a Steward. In a nutshell, I've been having problems with my account on the Walloon Wikipedia <a href="../../../../wa/d/a/v/Uzeu%7EDavidcannon_4bb8.html" class="extiw" title="wa:Uzeu:Davidcannon">wa:Uzeu:Davidcannon</a> - fundamentally, it's forgotten my password. No, I haven't forgotten it - I use the same password on all Wikimedia projects. The "system" has screwed up. I have a strange request: please nuke my account on WA, so that I can create a new account with the same name, but different password. (I can't get it to e-mail a new password to me because my e-mail is not registered on that account).</p>

But unfortunately I don't understand German! Isn't it available an English or Italian or Esperanto or a French or a Spanish more recent version?</p>
<p><i>EDITED:</i> Sorry, Angela, I didn't notice that I can use language.php</p>
<p>I've made some corrections (Ukarasa-&gt;Ukurasa, Hobe-&gt;Nenda, etc.) and some translation, but how is this editing related to the site? I suppose that the only way to see the changes in the web is to work trough the MediaWiki namespace.</p>
<p>I don't understand which type of experience is needed. I'm new to Wikipedia, but not for php and other programming (I can send you my CV, if needed!). As for editing I've already made eight edits (three anonymously: 80.116.199.130), and I'm working on Sheria. I don't have any experience on working with the namespaces, but how can I get this experience if I should have a administrator permision and I can get the permision only after some experience?</p>
<p>I think I've lost something&#160;:( I need more help. Please let me know what can I do.</p>
<p><i>EDITED:</i> In the meantime, I will translate the file language.php</p>

<p>It would seem beneficial for the Czech Wiktionary to switch to wholly case sensitive links. This should be done early, the sooner the better. Now we have fourty articles so the impact and inconvenience caused by the switch would be minimal.</p>
<p>If I uderstand it correctly it is necessary to persuade a developer (and/or a developress) to add the following line into LocalSettings.php on the cs.wiktionary.org site.</p>
<pre>
$wgCapitalLinks = false;

<p>Could you guide me to the best place to start the lobbying effort for such a change?</p>

<p>Hi, Angela. Thank you for you help! I'm trying to be very careful in editing sw.wikipedia.org, in fact I test my edits on the software I've installed in one of my sites <a href="http://www.vessella.com/wiki" class="external text" title="http://www.vessella.com/wiki" rel="nofollow">one of my sites</a>.</p>
<p>As I said I would like to edit the page about Law (<a href="http://sw.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheria" class="external text" title="http://sw.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheria" rel="nofollow">Sheria</a> the Wikimedia Foundation site]) and I need to use some arabic character. Can you help me to understand how to do it?</p>
<p>Thanks again, Neno</p>

<p>I've fixed that thing that was leaving plurals etc out of links. I had noticed the "fault"; but seldom obvious when most of one's material is in a language that generally has the same form in plural as in singular.</p>
<p>Thanks for the sympathy over the "trolling" - but that grumbler was the nearest I've had to a sustained intelligent discussion on mi: for several months; I've fixed several of the things he or she complained about, and I've greatly increased the proportion of Maori language with nearly every edit since. I hope the "troll" has a third bite at the discussion. I would like to find who that person (<a href="http://mi.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=24.251.242.236" class="external free" title="http://mi.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=24.251.242.236" rel="nofollow">http://mi.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=24.251.242.236</a>) is - claims to have started a "couple of Wikipedias"; probably someone you know!</p>

<p>Dear Angela, Thank you fro answering my last question. I would like to heare your opinion about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it recommendet to make InterWiki links <b>between categories</b>?</li>
<li>If so I want to point out the difficulties regarding this: <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eo:Vikipediisto:Gangleri/farenda%C4%B5oj#Kategorio_en_diversaj_lingvoj" class="extiw" title="w:eo:Vikipediisto:Gangleri/farendaĵoj">Categories in different languages</a></b> shows some examples of how different it can bee to:
<ul>
<li>know the link to the special page categories in the different Wikipedias <b>or</b> know the name wich is used when you search the link at special <b>pages</b>;</li>
<li>know the word to insert in the code / to search for it in the code;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have some questions about this:
<ul>
<li>Has a similar work been done already?</li>
<li>Where is the rigth place to address this item and where such a list should be maintained?</li>
<li>Should it be maintained as text or in a database?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pease note that this taughts can be expanded to other <i>words</i> as well. If somebody creates a {{Stub}} in another language having minimal knowledge of it and not being experienced with this (maybe new) Wikipedia he / she would not know what words to choose for <i>Stub</i>, <i>External link</i> and so on.</li>
<li>I reaslised that Wikipedias in some languages are using <i>icons</i> for <b>{{Stub}}</b> or other not for this particular template. This is not the case for <b>{{GNU}}</b>. Why not use same icons for most of / all Wikipedias (WikiProjects)?

<p>Hi Angela - I was wondering if you have read the exchange that <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabbit_e032.html" title="User:Habbit">Habbit</a> referred to in his request (at <a href="../../../r/u/f/Talk%7ERuffini%27s_rule_fd05.html" title="Talk:Ruffini's rule">Talk:Ruffini's rule</a>). I hadn't before he replied, but that exchange, combined with the answers he gave to our questions, and a look at his user page have left me feeling that the MC may not be the best place for him to help out. I don't want to be discouraging, though, and wonder if you think it makes sense to direct him towards the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffice_of_Members%27_Advocates_fa1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Office of Members' Advocates">Wikipedia:Office of Members' Advocates</a> instead....</p>

<p>Yes certainly, policy clearly states that we <i>should treat the counties as one entity which has changed its boundaries with time. We should not take the minority position that they still exist with the former boundaries</i>. It also states <i>We should mention historic counties in articles about places and in references to places in a historic context, but only as an afternote</i>. Which is not what 80.255 has been doing. This is certainly in contravention of the spirit of the policy. What he is trying to do here is to twist and re-interpret the policy to suit himself, and change its meaning to something it was never intended to mean. This is the thin end of the wedge. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 13:21, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Policy clearly shows that refering to traditional counties in the past tense in unacceptable. Look at 'examples of unacceptable things'. Parliament passed a bill in 1992 expressly recognising the the 'ancient and geographical counties' were <i>not</i> abolished in 1888. This is parliament's position, the government of Great Britian's position - hardly minority! The article clearly states the warwickshire is the administrative county and that worcestershire is the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_county.html" title="Traditional county">traditional county</a>. It is completely in line with policy. Claiming it "contravenes the spirit" is a nonsense, and suggests that you can only resort to such vague, unsubstantiated allegations because you are unable to disprove the manifest reality that reference to 'former' traditional county ("<i>Middlesex was a county</i>") is clearly stated in the policy as being unacceptable! <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 13:34, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The policy is perfectly clear: "<i>We should not take the minority position that they still exist</i>". You can report that a minority position is that some people are under the illusion that Shipston is in Worcestershire, but we should not be reporting such opinions as though they were facts. It's misleading and looks to the vast majority of people as a simple inaccuracy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 17:20, Oct 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Angela it's good to see your not be fooled by 80.255's attempts to re-write the policy. I have explained it to him at his <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.255.html" title="User talk:80.255">talk page</a>. Perhaps we should make the policy clearer, so he cant keep trying to exploit the Middlesex loophole, by stating that it is an exception. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 21:11, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, Ugen promoted grunt, his first activity as a bureaucrat in six months. I wrote the following in his User Talk:</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ugen64, I believe it was inappropriate for you to promote Grunt while the RfA dispute was going on. You had expressed an opinion on the issue and did not follow my lead in not acting at this time. I had already asked Angela to look at the issue and she wanted to give it another day. I request that you admit error in this case in promoting with only 75% support and ask Angela to reverse the bureaucratship for now. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 21:23, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC):</dd>

<p>Angela, this is gamesmanship, and I also think it is inappropriate to use IRC as a sounding board because it violates the principle of transparency in Wikipedia dealings. The practice has been that people have continued to vote and have their votes counted before the nomination is acted upon. I will further point out that Grunt did reply to my concern for three days and only replied after the deadline. You yourself wanted this to go for another day when I queried you. The inappropriate of this grows and grows. I intend to ask Ugen again to withdraw his action and will bring my first-ever RfC on Wikipedia if he doesn't. Ugen has been an inactive bureaucrat and he picked a terrible time to get active. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 21:59, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a Grunt supporter, I share Cecropia's concerns, and have said so in more detail at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship</a>. Anthere has kindly reversed the bureaucratship while we discuss the issue, at the request of Theresa Knott (and probably taking into account also the four other editors who have expressed concern). I hope ugen will admit that the decision lacked the care and caution with which I always feel I should act as a bureaucrat -- at this point, I feel the hasty promotion has damaged Grunt's chances for a permanent promotion (which might otherwise have been very good). Anyway, just wanted to keep you posted that the conversation continues at WP_T:RFA and that Grunt is not currently a bureaucrat. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:38, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, I just noticed what you wrote on Admin talk <i>before</i> the snippet you republished. Please understand, I am not accusing you or implying any wrongdoing by your whatsoever. You were not the one who decided to promote Grunt. My complaint is IRC, where I feel it is inappropriate to discuss matters that lead to decisions where other Wikipedians do not know what is happening. Transparency, especially in granting powers, is extremely important, IMO. I have seen chatter on IRC turn into a virtual lynch mob. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 23:17, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree and have clarified my remarks on the talk page, in addition to extending an apology to you if you felt you were criticized by my initial remarks. I think this was handled badly by ugen and Grunt -- ugen for making the decision to promote, and Grunt for jumping into the discussion about whether to promote him (I do understand why Grunt did so, but personally I feel it's inappropriate to start making arguments for your own promotion in a close decision -- if you're going to do so, at least do them on a talk page where your comments are more transparent). It's not the channel's fault, but I did offer some thoughts in general about IRC. Again, I do apologize, and hope I am expressing myself more accurately and clearly now. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:25, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the end of the two-day extension, Grunt's nomination is below 74%. Will you rule on this?

<p>Thanks for the response, Angela. I respect your desire not to act on Grunt, and I believe you are correct that removal is not necessarily an admin or bureaucrat duty. However, I think people are expecting a bureaucrat to act on a contentious nomination, even to remove it. If a non-admin or non-bureaucrat were to remove it, I think it might cause of storm of protest in some cases, because it would be taken as a "decision." But I'm not trying to put it on you to do it, if you're disinclined.

<p>I was thinking of adding an explanitory note to the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html#Counties_of_England" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">counties policy</a>, along the lines of what I've left at <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.255.html" title="User talk:80.255">80.255's talk page</a> to explain why the policy is not contradictory. I was also thinking of making it clearer that ceremonial counties can be used for geography when a place is a unitary authority.</p>
<p>I wasn't thinking of changing the policy so much, just explaining it better, so I dont think that a vote would be neccesary for it. I feel that the way Morwen wrote the policy is somewhat confusing, and 80.255 is exploiting that. I have already talked to <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">User:Warofdreams</a> about it and he seems to agree.

<p>This regards the article: <a href="../../../w/i/t/With_the_Lights_Out_48c3.html" title="With the Lights Out">With the Lights Out</a></p>
<p>I came across that article from a link from a Nirvana message baord. I at the time had never been to Wikipedia and did not know what this site was.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, to start with <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome_to_Wikipedia_34dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome to Wikipedia">Welcome to Wikipedia</a>. :)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My dillema is this: This might sound really strange and believe me I've learned my lesson: The tracklisting for the upcoming Nirvana boxset is under lock and key. It has not been released yet at all. Not even one song is known on the listing. I had edited the page just screwing around with test data, because I had never used this site before. I had made a FAKE list of songs to test editing the page. After I had made my edit and figured out how to do it, I had deleted what I had typed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please use the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a> for testing next time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Everything was safe and sound until I came back much later on. People had looked at the history of that page edit and took the FAKE list I made up and reposted it. Vandals had messed with the page, and for some reason an editor of this site had protected the page, and reverted back to my first version with the fake tracklisting.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't worry. Vandalism often happens, but there are lots of people to revert it. If it happens again, you can report it at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So for awhile the page was protected with the fake tracklisting. I then became frantic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I expect it was difficult to tell which was the real version in amongst all the vandalism. There's no need to worry so much though, since the <a href="../../../v/p/r/Template%7EVprotected_5459.html" title="Template:Vprotected">{{vprotected}}</a> message that was put on the article would explain that the content might be vandalised, so people should not be trusting it without checking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What if someone from the press got ahold of that list and thought it was true while the page was uneditable?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd hope the press would check with more than one source if they were going to publish such a thing. :)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I emailed some of he ediors on the page about it. What I ask and beg is that you and others keep an eye on that article for anyone posting that old tracklisting I made. IT IS NOT REAL. I simply used it as test data to practice editing a page. I don't know why anyone reverted back to it without any research, and after I deleted it. The tracklisting as of yet does not exist and won't for a month. Right now the tracklisting is blank is that page, after I talked to some people about it. And I ask of you that it stays like that until an official word is out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll keep an eye on it. If you <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">create an account</a> (you don't even need to give your email address), you wil get a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Watchlist" class="extiw" title="m:Help:Watchlist">watchlist</a> which lets you watch over any edits to articles you choose to watch. This makes it very easy to spot vandalism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could you even protect the page so that vandals cannot further do it again, at least until nov 23 when the real trackisting will be revealed? Thank you, and again I don't know why this got so out of hand.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it continues to be vandalised, then it could be protected, but it doesn't look at the moment as if it needs to be. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:28, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've heard that you told Kate on IRC not to give access to everyone to use Kate's script to view deleted articles. Kate took that as a Board declaration and says that I would have to petition the Board to get permission to use the script.</p>

<dd>I myself have concerns about the script. I don't believe that the Wikipedia community has disucssed the policy implications of having a means available to view deleted pages, and the "tool" in question is nothing more than a deliberate developer-sponsored means to query a portion of the database that is ordinarily not published. Particularly since <i>your</i> goal is to be able to republish deleted material, I would be particularly concerned in this case. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">uc</a> 20:23, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not really. We have a means available to view deleted pages for contributors who meet certain requirements (admins), so that they are able to review deletions and reverse them when warranted. You don't meet the requirements, and want to do more than just review the deletions to see if they are warranted -- you want to republish them. As for Kate's script, I think it should be unplugged until there is a community consensus otherwise. Software fiat does not make policy. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">uc</a> 21:24, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're confused about what Kate's script does. It certainly doesn't allow me to view deleted articles, and I see no reason that it should be unplugged. As for getting community consensus, I'm perfectly willing to hold a poll. But I'd like to hear from Angela first as to what method she'd like to use to determine whether or not I can get access to the script. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 21:38, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I said on IRC was basically the same as I wrote on the village pump. There has been no board decision, and no order made to developers that they can't do this.

<p>Hi Angela, yesterday I came across a site that uses Wikipedia content in a rather nasty way: it queries each article directly from Wikipedia, strips it down to the content text and places it on its own page (along with a load of ads). Its adress is <a href="http://www.objectssearch.com/pedia/" class="external free" title="http://www.objectssearch.com/pedia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.objectssearch.com/pedia/</a>. I already added it to Mirrors and Forks:Low compliance. However, not many people seem to watch that page. In any case, there is a lot there that's waiting for action.</p>
<p>I think this particular situation needs rapid action. I could send the standard violation letter, but that's not the biggest problem: the problem is they are stealing Wikipedia bandwidth. I'm not fluent enough in English to write a good letter, so I figured you might be able to help out or you might know someone who could do something about this quickly. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">Mark Dingemanse</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse"><small>(talk)</small></a> 09:06, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I don't know if you are the person to address here. Recently I noticed that whenever the mouse pointer hovers the user bar (like Login, my talk, my contribution, etc.) on most pages, the bar slides to the left side, over the Wikipedia logo, making it impossible to click at least on the first item. This happens (it seems) in all Wikipedias.<br />

<p>Angela, As a native speaker and expert writer of this language, I request to be given main administrator rights on Kashmiri Wikipedia. I started, many months ago, by translating the main page and a few others to Kashmiri language, using Devnagari script -- initially my edits were anonymous. Others started adding pages to this wikipedia in the same script. Kashmiri is presently being written in Devnagari and Nastaleeq (Arabic) scripts, but the latter does not have full Unicode support yet. Then a user Bbbbbbbbb apparently opposed to Devnagari, but not knowing the language or any of the scripts, started converting the script to Roman script, saying this would later be "used for multi-script conversion". The Roman script used by Bbbbbbbbb (obtained by automatic script conversion) is unintelligible and means nothing but gibberish to a native speaker. I suggested to use both scripts, and proposed to help with it, but the user continued to vandalize. Now Akka Akka (seems to me another name for Bbbbbbbbb -- though I could be wrong) has got admin rights, in spite of having no knowledge of the language or the script. I have done extensive work on the language -- please see Raman Kaul's work on <a href="http://koshur.org" class="external free" title="http://koshur.org" rel="nofollow">http://koshur.org</a> and on my site <a href="http://kalusa.org/koshur" class="external free" title="http://kalusa.org/koshur" rel="nofollow">http://kalusa.org/koshur</a> . Although I lean towards Devnagari script, I know Arabic script too, and am a very proficient user of the language on the web. I can create and monitor content in each script. Any questions/verifications, please feel free to ask. Please see the discussion on main page for my stand on the subject. rk_kaul</p>

<dd>Hi rk. Thanks for letting me know about the problem. I've asked Akka to discuss it, and removed his adminship temporarily until there is agreement from the community on this. Please discuss these script issues at <a href="../../../../ks/m/a/i/talk%7EMain_Page_dad0.html" class="extiw" title="ks:talk:Main_Page">ks:talk:Main Page</a>. I don't think making anyone a sysop during this conflict will calm the situation.

<p>I am very concerned about the future of the fledgling Wikipedia in Kashmiri. I believe Mr R.K. Kaul set up a very fair system in which users could use any of the three scripts they wanted (devanagari, arabic, or roman). But there are two gentlemen (Bbbbbbb and Akka Akka) who want to destroy all devanagari content, and one of them (Akka Akka) has now become the Administrator.</p>
<p>I am myself a professor in the United States and as someone who cares for fairness and excellence, I think it would be good if R.K. Kaul is made an adminstrator (which was denied by Akka Akka as the sole Admininstrator, which he became yesterday) and you supervise to check that Mr Kaul is actually doing a good job (which he will, given that he is perhaps the only one in the world who knows how to write in Kashmiri on computer).</p>

<dd>Hi. Thanks for your comments. The script system is something the community there is going to need to discuss and come to some sort of compromise about. There are currently no admins on that wiki until the conflict is sorted out or there is some demonstration of community support for anyone to become an admin. I'm slightly concerned about your comment "he is perhaps the only one in the world who knows how to write in Kashmiri on computer" which implies the wiki is not going to be a success if only one person can use it. Is this part of the problem? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:40, Nov 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela. I have been following the works of Raman Koul for some time. I am myself a native of Kashmir, like Raman a native speaker of Kashmiri language koshur. I have developed about 25 websites on the culture, religion, heritage, language, music and politics of Kashmir in general and Kashmiri Hindus in particular, under Kashmir News Network. In fact, sites like ikashmir.org, radiokashmir.org, kplink.com, kpandit.com to name a few, are complete repository on Kashmir.</p>
<p>Raman who is well-versed in such scripts as Devnagri and Nastaleeq is most suited to handle the job of an administrator for this particular page. To his credit, he has developed fonts on PCs for Kashmiri language (Koshur) in Devnagri and Sharda, and has developed an online editor that makes it easier for one to write the language on a PC. I hope and pray that you intervene and take the right decision soon.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

Hello Angela, As a native Kashmiri and a native speaker of Kashmiri language I have been following the works of Raman Koul. Raman seems to be well qualified and I have found him to be well-versed in Koshur scripts such as Devnagri and Nastaleeq. Raman is better suited to handle and be an unbaised administrator for this particular page. He has developed fonts on PCs for Kashmiri language (Koshur) in two different scripts and has also developed an online editor for writing this language on a PC. I will appreciate if you could intervene and allow Raman Koul to be the administrator for this page.</p>
<p>With Regards,</p>

<dd>Thanks for all your comments. It led me to explore the Kashmiri Wikipedia a bit more and I've emailed Raman about one of the problems there. However, for adminship, there needs to be consensus within the community on the Kashmiri Wikipedia before Raman can be an admin. It isn't really my decision to take. I understand he might be well qualified in developing fonts, but this realy doesn't tie in to what the role of an admin is. Anyone can edit a page at Wikipedia, and being an admin gives you no further rights over that than a normal user has. The role of a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">Wikipedia:Administrator</a> is to watch for vandalism, delete nonsense etc. It's just a janitorial role, not something with any attached prestige. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 04:22, Nov 3, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>This morning I've been working on implementing a new and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_of_the_day_405e.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture of the day">Picture of the day</a> system. It is based on the proven concept used by <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article">Today's featured article</a>. This system will allow us to plan the POTD way ahead, plan POTD for special occasions, automatically archive the POTD's and so on, it also makes recycling a POTDs very easy, just point the template to a previous date. Another important advantage is that it makes customizing POTD's much easier, as you don't need to remember which were changed in size for instance or had a small caption added.</p>
<p>Overall it's a robust system I think but please take a look and tell me what you think, see if there is anything I've overlooked. Switching to the new system would be a cake as the only thing that changes, is that the POTD templates now need to point to specific dates instead of days.</p>

<p>Initially, I am thankful for the contribution.<br />
In the projects wikiquote (in all the languages) happens the following one: when passing mouse in top of logo, logo is blinking. This does not happen in the other projects (wikipedia, wikitionary). What to make so that soon of wikiquote it is not blinking when passing mouse?</p>
<p>-- <a href="http://pt.wikiquote.org/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:Chico" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikiquote.org/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:Chico" rel="nofollow">Chico</a> 05-nov-2004</p>
<p>This happens in IE, but not in Firefox. I suspect its because it is a background image on top of another background image. Since it is a link, every time the mouse goes over it, IE has to decide which background image is in the background and which is in the foreground, and reloads. That is what causes the blink. Personally, I would change the logo away from being a background image at all. A perfect example of an overuse of styles. From:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="portlet" id="p-logo"&gt;
          &lt;a title="Main Page" style="background-image: url(/upload/b/bc/Wiki.png);" href="/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I had a look at the page suggested and while I can see it is related I don't feel I want to disrupt the flow. I'm also not too supportive of an off-web version of Wikipedia but lets not get into that. Lets stick with the common ground here. It seems that to produce an off-web version there would be an editorial process (hopefully not too formal) that does some basic checking and either weeds out the irrelevant, updates any obvious issues and approves the article for publication. If there is a process there I suggest that it is linked with my idea of protecting articles that have been through it. Even a warning might be sufficient but I doubt it. Please can you bear this in mind as the process is concluded. --<a href="../../../r/j/s/User%7ERjstott_f82b.html" title="User:Rjstott">Rjstott</a> 09:16, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It will involve some sort of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/article_validation" class="extiw" title="m:article_validation">article validation</a> process. I'm hoping this will enable us to mark the version that went through that as a "stable version" and then we could offer users an option of seeing only stable versions. I strongly feel the default view should remain the latest version, not stable version though, but with a link to "see the validated version" on every article. This means it can still be edited, and still be improved, but for people needing or wanting something more reliable, they don't have the problem of having validated it only to have someone come in and vandalise it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 12:12, Nov 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there an admin or sysop available for the test wiki? If not, can I obtain permissions allowing me to delete offensive images? (image deletion only would be plenty).</p>
<p>Presently I'm downloading them and re-uploading them with a 'Kids use the test wiki too, please be considerate' notice covering the offensive material. I was unable to find an admin page there, (or images to be deleted page) so I don't think I can go through the Requests for Permissions page.</p>
<p>I know it's a test wiki, but, still, some stuff doesn't belong even as a test, esp If I can't delete these images, would you point me to a resource/procedure/admin that can?</p>
<p>Thanks, sorry to keep being a bother, but I almost feel I know you now, and I know you know your way around, when it comes to the dusty corners of the wiki.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 21:11, 2004 Nov 8 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>thanks for the advice on the skin bug on test wiki, thanks for your help with the image deletions. It was one of my homeschool kids (I help homeschool groups with web resources etc.) that spotted the inappropriate image on the test wiki. The kids often use my account for editing and writing, so I can keep an eye on their contributions, but that might be obvious already. thanks again<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a></p>

<p>Hi Angela:</p>
<p>Regarding that ruckus, we are but a small amateur astronomical observatory. Unfortunately a person with "issues" has recently been dogging us at a number of local (NZ) astronomy forums and mailing-lists, accusing us of all sorts of things. The Wiki entry "atmospheric quality"-angle is just one aspect of his campaign. Why he's doing it, we don't know, but we do not have the time or resources for this and are conceding victory to him on this front, and have asked for a speedy VfD of the page. 222.152.120.161 20:29, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi this was discussed in July and then dropped. I saw it from your to do list. A number of people supported and more just did on IRC. As opt-in, I can't see how many could object.

<dd>Yeah, that is the discussion I was referring to. It simply stopped without a consensus no. Since it only affects users that specifically choose to use it, I can't see how others would object. Most of the objection was to the opt out option. An unobtrusive opt in might work, and after the initial set up should be very little work for some revenue. I'll leave a message on that page and see if anyone responds. I'll only bug you again if not. -</dd>

<p>Hello, I am directing this at you as you're the most senior UK wikipedian I know of. I have noticed that the UK wiki's are in need of a photo for the Meera Syal page. There is a very good one of her on her agent's site <a href="http://www.pfd.co.uk/scripts/showimage.py/actors/?SYALM" class="external free" title="http://www.pfd.co.uk/scripts/showimage.py/actors/?SYALM" rel="nofollow">http://www.pfd.co.uk/scripts/showimage.py/actors/?SYALM</a> . I pretty sure that a phonecall will get me permission to use it (I am an agent too and none of my clients would object). If they grant permission I can get them to confirm it in an email reponse to a request. However, what do I do with that? Print it, scan it, upload it as a reference file? or can I forward it to and admin to hold on ther server? I'd like to know before I make the call :D --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_TB_63ca.html" title="User:Martin TB">Martin TB</a> 20:39, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, I already left Netoholic a note, but I thought I'd leave one with you also. Simple's main page was vandalized today, redirected to en's main page -- the talk page was redirected back here also. This is one of the worst kinds of things to have to fix (as I know you know) -- after a couple people noticed and left notes here at <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_page_fb00.html" title="Talk:Main page">Talk:Main page</a>, I realized what was up and fiddled with the URL to get to the redirected pages and revert them. I have no idea, though, why simple's main page isn't protected -- unless there's a good reason not to, I hope someone will. I can't rememebr if you are no longer an active admin there (you're still listed on the project's administrator list) and I know you best of the people on that list, so I thought I'd leave a ntoe for you also (I left on for Net since he was the most recent admin to appear in Newest changes at simple).

<p>Hello, I wonder if I can suggest an small improvement to the sandbox. I don't know if you're the right person to speak to, but here goes. Basically, the {{sandbox}} header at the top of the sandbox contains important information for new users. However, due to the nature of the sandbox it is deleted about once a day (or more often). Also, it appears to be a favourite target of vandals, as witnessed in a recent and prolonged revert war. I wonder if it is possible to somehow 'protect' the {{sandbox}} header on the page, while allowing the rest of the page to be edited? (Also, I would like to suggest that the template itself is expanded to warn users that offensive behaviour and blatant vandalism won't be tolerated in the sandbox -- how would I go about doing that?) -- <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirstPrinciples_f0ae.html" title="User:FirstPrinciples">FirstPrinciples</a> 08:58, Nov 14, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>on 27.

<p>It's me again :)</p>
<p>I would like to know where to post in order to generate a discussion on the placement of the TOC within a page. I think on most wiki articles it actually looks a lot better of floated top right. Readers of English read from left to right, so having to TOC top right won't interfere with the initial reading of the subject matter. At the moment there can be a large white block underneath the intro which is used solely by the TOC on the left. If that list is long(ish) it just looks ugly. I spotted that your user talk page has a lot of info floated right, and copied the html to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monmouth_Rebellion_bee1.html" title="Monmouth Rebellion">Monmouth Rebellion</a> page. This resulted in a much better looking page!</p>
<p>It has been deleted by a user claiming that it's not in the WS:MOS, but I can find no reference to the TOC with the MOS at all. I don't want to start an edit war, but I do think that a discussion on what actually looks good and readable is needed. Take a look at <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> for example.

<p>What's the difference between GNU material and copyrighted material that Wikipedia has been cleared to use? You once opposed a picture that I took and posted on featured pictures canidates because of "inappropriate liscense" when I had given Wikipedia permission to use it (I later GNU'd it). Does EVERYTHING on wikipedia have to be GNU'd? <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJediMaster16_69d4.html" title="User:JediMaster16">JediMaster16</a> 02:32, Nov 17, 2004</p>
