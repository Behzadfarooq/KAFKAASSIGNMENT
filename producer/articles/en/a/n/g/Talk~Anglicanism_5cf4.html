<p>I am involved in a discussion with another editor at the article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_Washington_and_religion_9715.html" title="Talk:George Washington and religion">Talk:George Washington and religion</a> and need someone who is familiar with Anglican theology and dogma (and especially that of the late 1700s) to comment. Here is the discussion in brief... the article talks about the fact (well documented) that George Washington was not a communicant (ie was never seen to take communion) and would often leave devine services before communion. Given the context of the article, it is implied that this indicates he was a Deist. I question this implication ... I <i>think</i> that it might indicate that he was a "Low Church" Anglican. I do understand that I can not add such information to the article - as my personal conclusions would constitute Original Research. But I would like confirmation of whether my thinking is on the right track or not. Unfortunately, I do not know enough about the Church of England at the time, especially the different attitudes of High and Low Church, to know one way or the other. I tried an RFC, but that is being removed as there is not an actual dispute going on (I guess I am trying to find out if there <b>IS</b> something to dispute). I hope someone here can help set me straight. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that the information I wrote relating to pacifism was deleted again, so it has been restored once more. With respect to Revd McKenzie, for something that is "hardly a major issue", the fact that many of the most prominent Anglican intellectuals of the 1930s and onwards have been involved in the movement, not to mention the likes of Revd Dick Sheppard, the most famous churchman of his day, launching the secular Peace Pledge Union, shows that it is an issue of concern to may Anglicans. Anyway, as the "Social Issues" subsection now contain discussions of other issues of importance, so it is a legitimate inclusion to balance this article. David Le Sage, 6 February, 2007 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.138.16.150_135c.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.138.16.150">202.138.16.150</a> (talk) 06:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what other editors think, but to me three paragraphs on one aspect of Anglican social theology seems overboard - especially since there are only three other paragraphs which together cover all the rest of Anglican social concerns. "Balance" is precisely the reason why the bulk of the material that was there was excised. I would like to hear the contributions of other editors, however, before going in with pruning shears once again. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 06:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I would prefer authors expand the other sections relating to social theology so that a broad coverage of all of these is supplied. Thanks, D. Le Sage.</p>

<p>This section is going to be never-ending, most of the most notable British figures in the last 300 years could be described as prominent Anglicans. If their Anglicanism had some direct relevance to their prominence I could understand listing them but some are red-linked which imply no prominence of any sort and others are not really notable for their Anglicanism, e.g. Kate Winslet. If we have to have a list like this, can't it be a separate List of prominent Anglicans? <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 14:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These things tend to grow like topsy, unfortunately. I'm for excising it entirely - there's already a Category:Anglicans, after all. Instead of "Notable Anglicans," "Notable Anglican Theologians" might be more appropriate. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 17:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm the person who expanded this list. Initially, there were only four people on there, so I thought it worthy of expansion. I was working from some other information I had. I tend to agree with the cuts made, as, for instance, there is nothing explicitly Anglican about the film work of Winslet or Myles. I have added Yonge, Rossetti and a couple of others once more, however. Yonge and Rosetti were both explicitly Anglican in their works of literature, so I think they are worthy of inclusion. The change to "Important Anglican Thinkers" was probably a suitable alteration of heading. Thanks to whoever did that. D. Le Sage</p>

<p>Well, yes, that's why I added back Watts: his fame rests on his religious contribution. I certainly think a list is legitimate, although a separate article might make sense. I excised George Carey and Rowan Williams. They're both ABCs who have done nothing remarkable.

<p>Greetings. I am not too familiar with Anglicanism, so I am hoping for some feedback from some editors with a better understanding of how to classify the Anglican Communion. Specifically, there is a section in the article on <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> discussing his interaction with other religions. One section is his relationship with various protestant faiths. There was comment on his meeting with Rowan Williams. However, at least one editor believes that it needs to be under a separate "anglican" section, apart from "protestant". I tried to look into this, and got conflicting information... different sources classify Anglicans as anything from protestants to reformed catholics with protestant influences. Do Anglicans consider themselves protestants? Is there an "official" position on this? Any feedback would be welcomed! --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnietor_4a7c.html" title="User:Anietor">Anietor</a> 17:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They consider themselves a distinct branch of Christianity, a <i>via media</i> between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, a movement that is both Catholic and Reformed (Protestant). So, yes, it should be in a different section, and this article can be cited as a reference, since that is what it says. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 00:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I continue to be confused why, although editors allow the article to say that Anglicanism is seen by some as "Protestant", they qualify this as "without a prominent leader, like ... Calvin ...". Calvin was not a founder (like Luther or Wesley), he was not the singular national spokesman for the Protestant church (like Knox). In this way, Calvin is not more "prominent" than Cranmer, only Cranmer <i>was</i> the archbishop of Canterbury, and the author of the seminal Book of Common Prayer. Even so, the introduction continues enshrine the assertion by omission, that Cranmer did not practically embody the Anglican turmoil that comes of not wanting to put away either, Catholicism or the Protestant Reform. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 19:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unlike Calvin or Luther, both of whom have Protestant denominations or theologies named after them and can be considered to be prominent leaders or originators of a strand of Protestantism, Anglicanism evolved over a period of years under the influence of a number of different leaders and theologians, none of whom were considered to be as important as Calvin or Luther were. Although it started nominally under Cranmer, the eventual codification of the Thirty Nine Articles was only completed years after his burning at the stake. Cranmer although very influential in the development of the Anglican liturgy is not seen as a seminal figure in the way that Calvin and Luther are. So calling Anglicanism "Cranmerism" for exanmple was never an option. At various periods in their history Anglicans have trended towards a more Protestant outlook and at other times Catholic outlooks have come to the fore, but usually both tendencies have been accommodated within the broader church. The current situation is that many Anglican churches are probably closer to Catholic practice and consider themselves as Reformed Catholics, though there are some churches which still tend to consider themselves as Protestants and retain more Protestant practices. Not much help I am afraid! <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 20:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't want to say that Anglicanism is Cranmerism; but for those who would point to its Protestant character and history, the mark of the Oxford martyrs, and Cranmer above all, is indelible.

<dd>It <i>is</i> indelible for <i>all</i> Anglicans, I would hope. I just don't think it's indistinguishable. Anglican theology and, perhaps just as importantly, the Anglican ethos, was several centuries in the making <i>before</i> Cranmer came on the scene. Cranmer is a very big fish, yet still exists in the context of the life-giving water that forms the current which is Anglicanism. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 23:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but <i>when</i> Cranmer came on the scene, something "Reformed" came in with him and remained there when he was gone, and developed from there. Isn't that so?

<dd>I would argue that Anglicanism is nothing more than "English Catholicism." While we protested the abuses of Rome, we really didn't protest the doctrines or the practices with very few exceptions (papacy being the one chiefly on my mind). We kept the others: tri-order clergyhood, Apostolic Succession, Sacraments, True Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, Complete Canon, etc. It should be noted that the 39 Articles of Religion were never meant to be read literally nor were they the first Articles and furthermore, nor were they around for most of Anglican history. Therefore, if by Protestant you mean we protest certain doctrines that the Pope declared ex cathedrally or those that their church declared, yes, we are Protestants. Yet we are most certainly not Protestants in the "classic" sense of Lutherans, Moravians, Calvinists, or Anabaptists. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValer_b0d4.html" title="User:Valer">Valer</a> 01:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I know that this is the Anglo-Catholic party line, but I don't think it's historically defensible. The doctrine of the Real Presence found in the 39 Articles is indistinguishable from that held by Calvin, Bucer, and other folks on the more sacramental end of the Reformed tradition. Lutherans find it to be insufficiently Catholic! I know that it can be interpreted in a more Catholic direction, but that is not generally how it was interpreted at the time. Richard Hooker's "virtualism" expands on the Articles and further demonstrates the basically Reformed nature of Elizabethan Anglicanism. No one in the Elizabethan era doubted that Anglicanism was Protestant. Indeed, it was somewhere in between Lutheranism and Calvinism. The "Canon" was not complete at all--it explicitly and systematically excluded language of sacrifice and placed anything remotely referring to sacrifice in the post-communion thanksgiving. As for the Articles not being "around for much of Anglican history"--this begs the question. The question is whether Anglicanism became Protestant in the 16th century. Obviously the Articles were not around before that, and the Ecclesia Anglicana was not Protestant before that--no church was! But the Articles were adopted as a statement of the faith of the Church of England, they were printed in the BCP, and ordinands were required to subscribe to them (and still are in England, I believe). Your position is held only by Anglo-Catholics--other Anglicans disagree with it and non-Anglicans who study the subject almost never find it persuasive. It should therefore not be made the basis for a wikipedia article. The Church of England described itself as Protestant and was universally regarded as Protestant in the sixteenth century. This was not seriously challenged until the 19th century, although some of the extreme high-church folks in the 17th century spoke of Anglicanism as an expression of the faith of the undivided Church.

<p>I am wondering why this is such a concerted effort to ensure that the ordination of a gay bishop not be mentioned in a headline? This is the crucial issue which has led to the current crisis in the AC. The recent Communique only discussed three points with regard to the crisis:</p>
<p>1. Ordination of gay bishops 2. Same sex unions 3. provincial boundaries</p>
<p>So, one cannot avoid mention of gay bishops in the headline.129.74.165.42</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anglicans like a bit of decorum. Tabloid headlines are best left to a certain class of argument. Lets all take a deep breath and speak nicely to each other. And - quite parenthetically 129.74.165.42 - you spelled embarrassing incorrectly. It is spelled with a double r and a double s: not (sic)"embarassing". Now, how embarrassing is that! Cheers!

<dd>And it's not even an issue of decorum. The sensationalistic headline proposed by you, 129.74.165.42, seems to carry more of an agenda than any you accuse others of having. It's a great head-turner, but belongs in the National Enquirer, not Wikipedia. It's also overly simplisitic and misleading. I would think that if you really are sincere about wanting to include an issue that, while embarrassing, is still relevant and worthy of inclusion, you would want to do it in a professional and accurate manner. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnietor_4a7c.html" title="User:Anietor">Anietor</a> 15:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Your comments are great for leveling charges, but you have not made a case for the exlusion of gay ordinaton from the headlines. Saying that this is an issue of decorum or that it is biased is really not an argument. Please tell me how the present crisis is NOT about the ordination of a gay bishop.129.74.165.42 15:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, here's a response: It has very little if nothing to do with Anglicanism, which is a movement within Christianity. It merits discussion in the article <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, and indeed it is discussed there. Focusing on it as a matter of such great import is an example of recentism: We do not live in exceptional times as Anglicans. There have been schisms and extra-provincial meddlings since the seventeenth century, when the Puritans left the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and Archbishop of Canterbury <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Laud_ce91.html" title="William Laud">William Laud</a> was meddling in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Episcopal_Church_03b9.html" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 17:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely calling methodism an "Anglo-American" movement is inaccurate. It was established in Britain long before it crossed that Atlantic and the article implies that Wesley personally took it there.Further the American revolution may have prompted a break away for American methodists, but hardly for the whole movement.
