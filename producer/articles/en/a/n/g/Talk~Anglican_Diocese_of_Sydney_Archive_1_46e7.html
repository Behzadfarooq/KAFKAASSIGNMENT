<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverting the links</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia articles are not well served by a paucity of links. All of the links provided are referred to in some way in the article. It will not confuse readers to have this many links. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 06:39, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason I removed some of the links was to do with an overall concern about this page. Although personally a supporter of Syndey Anglicanism, I think that they page isn't strictly written from a Neutral POV. When I read it, it read to me like it was written by a supporter, and the Discussion page confirms this! But this becomes most clear when looking at the Links section. Linking to Matthias Media's 'Two ways to live' page is only indirectly relevant to the topic Syndey Anglicans. If you really want the link, it would be better on the 'Philip Jenson' arcticle. The same goes for MTS. And describing 'Anglicans Together' as "more progressive" dosn't bring neutrality but is just the other POV: a more neutral description is needed. I'm not wanting to be critical (I'm trying to be constructive), but I think that at the moment the page is open to criticism of bias, which is a shame. A little more tweaking is needed. pode 15:06, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a little POV, despite good intentions. If you see a way to fix it, go ahead! <i>Two ways to live</i>, however, is most definitely directly relevant to Sydney Anglicans. Have you read the Briefing yet? If you did, you'd understand it is a large part of the orgs evangelism efforts. That and Introducing God(www.introducinggod.org). - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 20:18, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've been re-reading the article to think about the 2WTL link. You say it is "...part of the orgs evangelism..." By 'orgs' I assume you mean Matthias Media, MTS, or Sydney Diocese (as an institution). But the article isn't about those organisations (except indirectly) but about Sydney <i>Anglicans</i> -- i.e. the people. 2WTL may be popular amongst Sydney Anglicans, but it is widely used elsewhere also. So I still think the link would be better moved to the 'Philip Jenson' article (as should the 'Campus Bible Study' link). Anyway, I'm happy to agree to disagree. And, yes, I subscribe to the Briefing. pode 23:34, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>2WTL originated with Phil Jensen during his time wroking with the Department of Evangelism I think. It has been widely used in the Sydney Diocese since the mid 1970s. It has really only been taking off outside of Sydney for the past 15 years or so. I would rather keep it simply because it does, in a compact way, explain the Sydney Anglican gospel message. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 23:39, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps then what is needed is a section 'Christianity according to Sydney Anglicans' in which the 6 points of 2WTL are described. That would add value to the article (which is good - I'm not complaining!) and make the relevance of the 2WTL link clearer. --23:46, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hmmmmmmmmmm not sure about that idea. I think an in-article section about 2wtl would be in order rather than a separate article. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 07:43, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">reverting the links</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure that the bias issue is that bigger worry in the present article for two reasons: 1) To get a true expression of the attitudes and influences present in the diocese the article has to be written by an insider who understands the thinking which drives the organisation's key figures. Those on the 'outside', no matter how 'neutral' they try to be, cannot express accurately such views. The bias which will naturally come with an insider is out weighed by the close representation of the diocese's mood which he or she will bring. Sure get the view of Anglicans Together, but will they be able to really express the inner convictions of those who are currently influencing the life of the diocese? 2) The article as it stands, I think, has actually done a good job in trying to avoid unhelful bias anyway. There is an absence of the blatant back slapping and overly positive and unreflective hype which seems to now accompany any talk of the diocean mission (re the 2004 MTC graduation), and there is a regognition that minority groups within the diocese feel isolated and sidelined. This last concession relfects badly on those who are running the show. - monkeyboy</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. However I think they can still make a positive contribution.

<p>Is Sydney's distinctive evangelicalism really unique in Western Anglicanism? What about the Diocese of Clogher, say? <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Lynch_1279.html" title="User:Gerry Lynch">Gerry Lynch</a> 01:37, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sydney is hardly the sole Evangelical diocese, that much is true. What is different is that the Sydney diocese wields a great deal of financial and ecclesiastical power, not to mention a huge amount of churches and regular worshippers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've checked some basic info about the Diocese of Clogher. It appears to cover both <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Monaghan_0533.html" title="County Monaghan">County Monaghan</a> in the Republic and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Fermanagh_5317.html" title="County Fermanagh">County Fermanagh</a> in Northern Ireland. The total population of these two counties is over 100,000 people. The Sydney diocese is populated by well over 4.3 million, and the amount of regular attenders numbers between 30-40,000 I think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No other diocese in Australia comes close in terms of numbers and money. In fact, I would guestimate that over 50% of Anglicans in Australia - those who regularly worship every sunday - are located within the bounds of the diocese.</dd>

<p>I think the Anglican Diocese of Sydney is probably unique in countries like UK, USA, NZ, Canada, Australia, not in terms of having evangelicals, but probably in terms of the proportion that are evangelical. But I couldn't find a better reference to support this.

<p><br />
The uniqueness of Sydney Anglicanism is not simply that there are a large number of Evangelicals- It is the precise nature of the Evangelical tradtion and teaching within Sydney, coming out of the traditions at Moore Theological College. It would need a more learned Theologian than I am, to comment upon it. But having attended various evangelical churches in England over the past ten yyears, I can asure you that Sydney's thinking is a bit different.</p>

<dd>Yeah, but that would be so Anglican, and the thing about Sydney Anglicans is that we're soooo not Anglican (at least according to the rest of the Australian church).</dd>

<dd>My only suggestion would be that the article be renamed to Sydney Anglicanism. Alternatively, you could have a formal <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Diocese_of_Sydney_702a.html" title="Anglican Diocese of Sydney">Anglican Diocese of Sydney</a> page with infoboxes and everything, and then another page on the broader topic of Sydney evangelicalism which would include our brethern from other denominations. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 00:05, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Believe me, this page is about, and ought to be titled "Sydney Anglicans".</dd>
<dd>When one travels, one is accosted by people from other churches, all the way from Hobart to Aberdeen, who, when they know you are from Sydney, grab you by the shirt front and say "You're not one of those dreaded Sydney Anglicans, are you?" To which one replies "Not of the dyed-in-the-wool variety" at which point they relax their grip.</dd>

<dd><i>What you are writing is a justification for the Sydney way of doing things. What I am trying to write is an explanation, for non-Sydney people, of the way in which Sydney substatially differs from Anglicanism, as practised in England, where Evangelicalism leads to a very different style.</i></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Your paragraph about Broughton Knox and Moore is valuable and should stay in. So is your comment about people identifying with their local "meeting", but the very fact that you call it a "meeting" separates you from Anglicanism in general. Please remember that we are talking about the Anglican Church, for a world-wide audience. There are understandings as to how anglican church performs and is conducted. You are writing as if Sydney presented the 'norm'. The term "Eucharist" is widely used and understood by Anglicans, world wide. It is only considered a sign of Roman Catholicism in Sydney.</i></dd>

<p>Thanks for the comments Amandajm. You're right that the article should present Sydney Anglicanism for the novice reader - I'll avoid that in future. But where I draw the line is that Sydney Anglicanism with its 'meetings', lack of formal liturgy and derobed clergy is most definitely Anglican. It stands in the tradition of English Reformation, the English Puritans and the Evangelical Awakening - all Anglican events. Further, the only place I know of 'Eucharist' being used in protestantism is by anglo-catholic anglicans. IMHO Holy Communion is the normative term for evangelical anglicans, Methodists, presbyterians, congregationalists, etc. Latimer and Ridley went to the stake for a distinction like that.</p>
<p>On a technical note, in my understanding, Reformed = Calvinist, Protestant refers to all churches that came out of the Reformation - Lutheran, Anglican and Reformed.</p>

<dd>Actually, Journeyman, the term Eucharist is <i>extremely</i> common in Anglicanism (I can't speak for Sydney). In Canada and the United States at least it is the normative term for the sacrament. You may be thinking of the term Mass, which is indeed used usually by Anglo-Catholics (though sometimes <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_church.html" title="Broad church">broad churches</a> will use it phrases like "Midnight Mass", "Jazz Mass", etc.) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 20:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Sydney, its Holy Communion, Communion or the Lord's Supper, using 'Eucharist' would get you funny looks. In <i>An Australian Prayer Book</i> the services are called <i>First Order of Holy Communion</i>, etc. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 00:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Women and Lay Presidency</span></h2>
<p>The article implies (but does not state) that the Diocese has no problem with women celebrating the Eucharist. Is that true? As long as they are not ordained? If so, it should be explicit. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 20:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would expect that Women would only be allowed to celebrate Holy Communion when only women and children are present. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 00:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would think that the diocese would have a problem still, because although lay presidency gained a majority support in Synod in the 1990's, Archbishop Goodhew vetoed it. --Petedenham 01:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the position is, that if lay precedency comes in then lay men can do it. This doesn't change the position of women. Men are at the head. Men are to preach, teach and take charge. If lay men are able to preside, then women who want to be ordained as priests can no longer use the excues that there's not enough priests to go round. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 14:46, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liberal Theology</span></h2>
<p>This is a point that I want someone with more subtle skill than I to sort out.</p>
<p>There is a reference to some Churches being "liberal" (uncapitalised). Nonetheless, I'm a bit worried about this reference, because it might be associated with so called "Liberal Theology", such as I believe is espoused by Spong. (I am hesitant on this point.) Anyway, "Liberal Theology" implies that an acceptance of the Resurrection isn't necessary. I don't know of any church in the diocese where "Liberal Theology" is openly accepted, let alone preached.</p>
<p>I think what is meant is that some churches are <i>more</i> liberal in thinking, and in accepting such people as practising homosexuals, and marrying divorced people. It doesn't mean that they are not also Evangelical in style</p>

<dd>Perhaps you're referring to my recent edit of the section "Relationship with the rest of the Australian Anglican Church"? If that's the case then I think the included citation clarifies (with at least one example) what more liberal might mean. (Anyhow, I don't think any Anglican diocese would condone preaching which denies the resurrection.) --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusj_ae2a.html" title="User:Angusj">angusj</a> 11:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Angus, Yeah! There's quite a bit of it in England. Some previous Bishop of York (not the present one, God bless him!) who made a "Liberal" statement that was well reported and caused a bit of a furor. Then, would you believe, York Cathedral caught fire!? There were those who saw it as the retribution of the Lord!

<p>Who wrote about Archbishop Mowll? Its wonderful and I love it, but it's just a little colourful. I would love to wax just as lyrical about Harry Goodhew and his gentle moderate loving determination. Hey, I remember Mowll at a confirmation service getting stuck in a particularly small pulpit.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cranmer and tradition</span></h2>
<p>This was a very well-phrased justification. But as it was speculative and not verifiable and referred to the ambiguous "they", it had to go.</p>
<p>Yes,along with Cranmer, any intelligent person can see that traditions can evolve in a wrong or mis-interpretted direction. But let us write about what actually happens, not what "they may see" that is similar to what Cranmer saw.</p>
<p>Some of the traditions that have been abandoned in freeing ourselves from the constraint of the prayerbook, like saying the Lord's Prayer for example, I consider rather valuable. It is the thing, more than any other, that unites us to other christians around the world. And nowadays, an increasing number of our youth have been denied that tradition, because of the style of services that are offered to them.</p>
<p><br />
Anglican Media is the mouthpiece of the Sydney Diocese. This article is not. This article needs to convey factual information that can be read by people who are not from Sydney and not Anglican. It needs to show how it is that Sydney can be described as unique within the Anglican Communion. If it gets too dumbed-down in the interests of political correctness, or if it merely reflects a precisely Sydneyfied point of view, it achieves nothing. There is a link to Anglican Media at the foot of the page.</p>
