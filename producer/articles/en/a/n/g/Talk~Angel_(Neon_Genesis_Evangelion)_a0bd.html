<p>Watching Evangelion reminded me of the Book of Enoch, as well as the story of Lilith, the first wife of Adam before Eve. Head over to the the Wikipedia section of the Book of Enoch and Lilith to have a read. The first mentions the Watchers, the angels who were supposed to watch over humans. The leaders' names and translated names are listed, such as Shamsiel, "Sun of God." They generally fit the translated names listed in the NGE angels list, but it should be noted where some of these names come from. In the Bible, very rarely are angels given names. And also about the Book of Giants, the Nephilim. I found it interesting that there were giants who preyed upon man and beasts and then fed upon eachother's flesh and blood. It reminded me of when ever Unit 01 would go ape and eat an angel. It might not mean anything, but it's a good read.</p>
<p>And about Lilith. She's appearantly been around for a long time, but it's said in The Alphabet of Ben-Sira, a medieval writing, that she left Adam and the garden because she refused to be below him during sex, and therefore, did not eat from the Tree of Knowledge. She appearantly swore to destroy all of Eve's children and gave birth to demons. Also, she knew the true name of God, and to know the true name of God is to have power over Him, so it says.</p>
<p>NGE feels like it's a mix of everything. Maybe it all lies with the fact that they're not angels but just messengers; 18 messages, with humans being the conclusion. Anyway, it's all speculation.</p>
<p>That's really all I'd like to mention. I didn't mean to rant. I just wanted to point out the Book of Enoch and shed some light on Lilith and possibly start a little conversation about the two. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by ElijahD (<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElijahD_0653.html" title="User talk:ElijahD">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ElijahD_3bb6.html" title="Special:Contributions/ElijahD">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

I´ve heard from a close friend of mine (and, by the way, a big fan of the Evangelion series) that after some research about NGE subjects, he discoverd that the first three Eva´s designs were actually based on "demons": EVA 00, the "one eyed" demon; EVA 01, the "screaming" demon and EVA 02, the "four eyed" demon...anyone has some information about this?

<p><b><a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_Machina_7751.html" title="Deus Ex Machina">Deus Ex Machina</a>.</b> "Angels" are nothing but plot devices high on steroids, really. People have been trying to explain what they mean, what they are and everything else since Evangelion became popular, when it's obvious that they're just a rather simple invention to fill a bad storytelling. According to this article they're <i>beings</i> and no other explanation is given. Dogs or cats or horses are not canine, feline or equine mammals, let's say they're just <i>beings</i>, wow, great information to put on an online encyclopedia.<br />
I can imagine the guys in Gainax back then trying to figure out how to make more money out of their business, it must have been something like:<br />
--Hey, we need some evil alien villain thingies on this cartoon.<br />
--Uh yeah, why don't we plagiarize some Angels' names or whatever? Teens will dig it, they'll believe we're like giving a secret message or something.</p>
<p>In and after the end of Evangelion, the only thing left is a low budget animated series with no meaning at all and no other purpose but exploit of merchandising. That, and thousands of naive fans trying to figure out the gag line of a bad joke.</p>
<p>It's really sad to see it takes a cartoon for someone to become interested in our background and heritage as western judeo-christian societies and read stuff like the Book of Enoch or whatever, when it was already there, long before Evangelion...<br />

<p>I'm confused; who said that the information from the NGE 2 videogame is canonical? What is the source? Wait, so the "Black Egg" is Lilith's egg, which is what Nerv's base was built around (according to Ikari in episode 20 they built the base around it after finding it). So...<b>where do Angels come from?</b> They're all "born from Adam", but how? What is the "White Egg", how can it be the moon, etc? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.64.137.195 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.64.137.195_4004.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.64.137.195">contribs</a>) 12:43, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I have never played the NGE2 game, but it is published by Gainax <b>and</b> is said to be a view from different angles from most of the characters on the same event in the Newtype magazine. This should be enough prove of it being canonical. If not, you have to find proof for why the original series is canonical, which will be a really stupid thing to do. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 13:49, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The CI from NGE2 is considered canon to the plotline of the series and gives us a large ammount of vital information including the origins of the Angels and the nature of the Lance of Longinus, although it's purposedly ambiguous in certain points. A full translation can be found <a href="http://www.evacommentary.org/misc-files/nge2ci_temp.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.evacommentary.org/misc-files/nge2ci_temp.txt" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that the game itself is just a retelling of the series' plot and thus doesn't add anything to NGE's plot and cannot be considered canonical, it is just the Confidential Information from the game that is canon as it was obtained by extensively interviewing the series' creators.</dd>

<dd>That is <b>extremely</b> informative, however I'm confused about section 6-D: "Nerv Headquarters was constructed inside the Black Moon containing Lilith. The Angels are all heading for Nerv H.Q. so that they can make contact with Lilith, the white giant in Terminal Dogma. They were aiming for her from the start, not Adam."...er, as is my understanding, the Angels were heading for Adam, not Lilith. To the point that Kawaru/Tabris refused when he realized it was Lilith and not Adam, plus Gaghiel attacked the UN convoy because Adam was in it, etc. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.64.137.195_4004.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.64.137.195">130.64.137.195</a> (talk) 03:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>For the sake of simplicity: Rei is a clone, though she doesn't actualy fall into that deffenition. From the inferences contained in the series, Rei was "born" from the combination of the DNA of Lilith and Shinji Ikari's mother, Yui. As the previous comment stated, she should be considerd a "derivative" of Lilith. While she maintains a (for lack of a better term) unique personality/soul (actualy it may be more safe to say that she is a human embodiment of Lilith with all awareness of that connection suppressed). She is still bound by her DNA to Lilith so that she eventualy becomes the fuse by which the Third Impact begins. I agree that Rei should be mentioned in connection with Lilith. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.153.183.218_832b.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.153.183.218">216.153.183.218</a> (talk) 17:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Actually (and this is my opinion) I think Rei is “Tabris” ‘cas Kaworu said there “The same”. The fact that the Angels are "another possibility, a race of humans that abandoned human form" supports this. Rei and Kaworu are the same possibility.

<dd>I think I see what he/she is getting at, but it's my understanding that Kaworu is specifically identified as Tabris in all canon materials. Although Rei has some Angelic powers, she is not an Angel, per the discussion above, which is pretty much spot-on IMO. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 03:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Several times in this document, passages like the following are present: "The thirteenth Angel, Bardiel, named after Barachiel," ... "Bardiel literally means "Humiliated Son of God,"". Can someone enlarge on these descriptions or provide some cites?</p>
<p>I would appreciate this, as the current wording seems to be contradictory. Either Bardiel is named after Barachiel, whose name is translated from Hebrew as "the Blessings of God" by Wikipedia ( in which case the claim of a literal translation is incorrect ), or the name is entirely independent, not connected to Barachiel except by virtue of also being a Biblical <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophory_in_the_Bible_71a0.html" title="Theophory in the Bible">theophoric name</a> ( in which case the claim that the angel is named after Barachiel is spurious ). - 219.194.176.65 13:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's that the name Bardiel is based off of the name Barachiel (which means "the Blessings of God) but it isn't <i>exactly</i> Barachiel (since it's <i>Bardiel</i>, which means "humiliated son of god")... However, I can completely see your point. Many of these Angels are named after actual angels, such as Sandalphon. However, wouldn't Bardiel then be named after the <i>angel</i> Bardiel? Where did "Barachiel" come from, anyway? I think it's exactly spuriousness that we're looking at here. Can anyone enlighten me as well? -<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETaggedJC_afd1.html" title="User:TaggedJC">JC</a> 13:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi, this is the initial questioner ( at work though, sorry about the different I.P. ) - it would be remiss of me not to mention that there is an angel Bardiel, who appears in <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Ginzberg_877e.html" title="Louis Ginzberg">Ginzberg's</a> "The Legends of the Jews", Volume 1, Book 3, subsection "The Translation of Enoch". Several copies of this document are available online. In this volume, Bardiel is attributed as the Angel of Hail. I think the obvious conclusion is that Bardiel is simply named after the Angel Bardiel. - 60.36.46.80 07:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's been a long time since I've read the manga, but from what I remember the Angels do not differ in their forms, attacks, or eventual fates in the manga. The only significant difference is that some Angels don't appear in the manga, and Gaghiel's role is pretty much an afterthought. The biggest difference is in Kaworu's personality and roles, but that's addressed both in this article and in his own article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 14:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In his article it says “Although in the anime Asuka suffered no apparent aftereffects of the beam, in the manga, Asuka is reduced to a vegetative state due to mental shock”, but after that her sync rate drops to 0, that seems like a bit of an over sight doesn’t it? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by The Twilight Goddess (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Twilight_Goddess_f5af.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Twilight Goddess">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>While the comment is referring to the fact that she is up and around immediately after the attack in the anime whereas she's flat on her back in the manga, I can see where it could be confusing. I'll edit the statement accordingly.

<p>I would like to remove the following passage from the section on Shamshel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Some fans</i> of the show argue that this Angel's shape and design are <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phallus.html" title="Phallus">phallic</a> in origin, reflecting some <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Freudian</a> references said to be found in the series. (Shamshel's character designer, Yoshitoh Asari, actually depicts the Angel as female in an erotic manga short called "Angel Kiss".) <i>It may</i> also represent a <a href="../../../c/a/d/Caduceus.html" title="Caduceus">Caduceus</a>, with its shaft-like body and two sepentine whips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage is simply speculation and has no place on Wikipedia. The fact that it contains <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a> (Which I have indicated) also retracts from its credibility. Also there is no citation for the claim regarding Yoshitoh Asari. I will remove this paragraph unless someone can supply a reason not to. On the topic I would like someone to provide a citation for the final line in the Shamshel section (<i>Shamshel literally means "Lonely Conqueror of God."</i>). –<a href="../../../r/o/w/User%7ERowan_Moore_60dc.html" title="User:Rowan Moore">cheese-cube</a> 01:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The user 24.21.154.177 has put in a ton of stuff in this article today. Some of it is useful (the note that Ramiel appears to be hollow) but most is speculative and POV. I reverted him earlier, but he's back with a vengeance. I'm too tired to take care of it tonight - is anyone going to police his edits or will they be left? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 03:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>All the Angel entries mix their past and present tenses. When I rewrote/cleaned up the Ramiel and Gaghiel sections (which, by the way, I plan to do to all of them) I wasn't sure whether to use straight present-tense ("The fifth Angel, Ramiel, <i>is</i>") or straight past-tense ("The fifth Angel, Ramiel, <i>was</i>"). Properly, I <i>think</i> it should all be past-tense, but it feels awkward introducing an Angel in the very first sentence as "was". (I feel "was" has a sense of uncertainty about it, as opposed to the secure anchor of "is".) <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioactive_afikomen_79cd.html" title="User:Radioactive afikomen">Radioactive afikomen</a> 06:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say use present tense except when referring to events connected to the Angels that occur in the past in the story. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 12:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
