<p>Also, I would clasify dredging up someone's contributions in an unrelated article, and declaring them to be poor, would be a personal attack. It seems to me to be an example of <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISRUPT_3700.html" title="WP:DISRUPT">WP:DISRUPT</a> directed as a personal attack. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 23:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you consider those personal attacks, you're either extremely thin-skinned or you've never encountered a real personal attack. To my mind, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Angr&amp;diff=46102504&amp;oldid=46011197" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Angr&amp;diff=46102504&amp;oldid=46011197" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a personal attack worthy of a warning. And changing <i>one</i> past edit of yours hardly qualifies as Wikistalking. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 23:26, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please investigate the issue before making statements like this. You would have discovered that it was not changing one past edit, but raising the article on the MoS talk page as a 'bad example' and then proceding to place blame for this with me.

<p>PSYCH is a serial pest, he has put up a complaint there three times now and each time it was removed. This has already been discussed with others and I have received the all clear. This is just harassment. It is not a personal attack. It is a legitimate link and I do not even make any associated disparaging comments. If I were you I would look at PSYCH's contributions. His first hundred or so were all on my page or to do with me and since he has come back, has exclusively editted to harass me. So you will excuse me if I just ignore his ranting. If I cannot link any Wikipedia page that I want on my userpage then I may as well just give up here. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 11:27, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said, I don't know any of the backstory. After seeing his complaint on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> I went to your user page, and seeing a link marked "My successful arbitration" that took me to a year-old RFAr, my impression was "This is gloating" (but not "This is a personal attack against PSYCH", however). That would have been my impression too if I had come to your user page for a completely unrelated reason and had seen that link there. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 11:35, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, just to fill in some of the backstory from a somewhat outsiders point of view. I first noticed this dispute via a <a href="../../../3/0/_/WP%7E30_c1ae.html" title="WP:30">WP:30</a> raised by <a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELefty_on_campus_b4f2.html" title="User:Lefty on campus">Lefty on campus</a> about whether a link on his (Loc) page was a personal attack on Xtra. I agreed that it was as one as written, and recommended its removal. It was eventually removed after insistance from an admin (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">MarkGallagher</a>) and <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> (see <a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELefty_on_campus_e895.html#Unblocked" title="User talk:Lefty on campus">User_talk:Lefty_on_campus#Unblocked</a>). Loc then posted multiple complaints about the same link (Abritatration against PSYCH) on PAIN, but after a little while it seemed to die down until today. Xtra did query whether Loc and PSYCH were the same person (contrary to Loc's complaints, it was not an "accusation" or an "attack"). I, too, would regard the idea of there being connection as a reasonable query, due to the number of similarities: Eg. Arb case against PSYCH ended with one year parole for personal attacks on Xtra on 12 March 2005, and after a few more months of posting, many on Xtra talk page, seemed to stop posting on 21 May 2005. Two days later, on 23 May 2005, Lefty on campus started posting, on similar articles, and also disagreed with Xtra over similar issues in similar ways, including over the Arb case on PSYCH. In the middle of the dispute over the Arb case link/Loc's user page link (10 March 2006), when Xtra suggested the possibility of them being the same person, PSYCH reappeared, starting with a posting on PAIN. To me, anyway, that looks somewhat suspicious, especally if it turns out to the same person, it would be an attempt to avoid an arbcon parole.</dd>
<dd>At the time, I did think that it might have been better for Xtra to remove the link, but as it turns out, I can understand the reasoning. To me, the link is there, not to gloat, but to give people some background. If someone saw the npa warning given to Xtra by PSYCH, without knowing that PSYCH had a proven case of personal attacks against that user, it would make Xtra look a lot worse than his is, and considering what he's been on the receiving end of, he's done remarkably well (as the Arb case also commented). (Sorry this got so long, so much for a quick background note!) Regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 12:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, thanks for the backstory. I'm not going to insist Xtra remove the link from his page, I just wanted him to know what it looks like to someone coming to his user page for the first time. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 12:37, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>In case you missed it, I see PSYCH has again put in another personal attack complaint on PAIN against Xtra on the same topic. Since PSYCH doesn't seem to have many other edits bar complaining against Xtra, do you think this repeated raising complaints is getting out of hand?

<dd>Internet Explorer, probably not.

I simply thought it would be appropriate to bring it to the attention of admins, mainly due to his other rampant personal attacks and spamming actions, and not respond to it directly myself. I appreciate the way you handled the situation; while I'm not holding my breath expecting an apology or anything from him, it's good to know that there are those who are watching the backs of little guys like me.

<p>I've translated this article, let me know what you think. I'm thinking that having the full text of each version of the pledge is unnecessary, and the text of the first and last versions with some text on the transition would be more than sufficient, and would like to hear your thoughts on that as well. The way the language of the pledge gets more and more revolutionary as the Wall gets closer and closer to collapse is certainly interesting in an ironic sort of way. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:06, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angre, you've shown an interest in Sanssouci in the past. The page has now been much altered, and the FAC page is back in business. I've noted your comment on the prose, I'm afraid brilliant prose is a skill one has or does not, so I've given it my best shot, and invited a couple of the better known FAC copy-editors to ammend (which they have). I hope you too will be able to make any alterations you think necessary. Perhaps you would now like to review the page. This is not meant to be a soliciting spam, I'm just contacting those who have already shown an interest, as I'm just concerned that people may not realise, the FAC is back and running.

<p>You really think "free allophone" is a good way of describing a phone that occurs in the speech of speakers from some areas but not others?

<dd>I don't know if "free allophone" is the best way of putting it (in my experience <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʀ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span> are truly in free variation while the difference between those two on the one hand and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r]</span> on the other is regionally determined).

<p>Okay. Is there an Ur-Bantu phonology/Proto-Bantu phonology article? Shouldn't there be? Although I'm basically not internet connected at all I do try to make a difference by communicated with other editors and advising them. It obviously doesn't help if they choose to ignore my help.

<p>Hi, Angr! I don't know if you'll be able to help, but since you are the only native speaker of English with a linguistics degree I've been able to spot around (not that I tried all that hard), I thought I'd give it a try. Recently, there was an argument over the term "subdivision" as applied to a country's administrative, political, and whatever other units (see, for example, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_April_4_cd1c.html#Category:Subdivisions_by_country_to_Category:Political_divisions_by_country" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 April 4">this</a> and also <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_April_11_d2bf.html#Category:Former_country_subdivisions" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 April 11">this</a>). Most dictionaries define "subdivisions" as "housing subdivisions", i.e. lots of land. Would you be able to shed some light (no matter how dim&#160;:)) on this subject from the native speaker and linguistic points of view? If you can, please comment at <a href="../../../s/u/b/Talk%7ESubdivision_b130.html" title="Talk:Subdivision">Talk:Subdivision</a>. If not, could you direct me to someone who can?

<p>Your change of "communion tables" to "altars" with the comment "use the correct term" is inapposite in the context of a discussion of the diocese of Sydney, where that is indeed the term. Indeed, they are on wheels so that they can be immediately removed from the church after the infrequent celebrations of the "Lord's Supper" [sic]. Out of sync with mainstream Anglicanism, to be sure, but that is the terminology and practice in that diocese, the wealthiest in Australia. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 09:22, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow. I should have expected that such a thing exists in Wikipedia, but I never really thought to look before I came across your posts to the reference desk (on "want"). As a Trinidadian who has spent a lot of his life in North America (southern Ontario, Michigan, Oklahoma), I have always been interested in sounds and pronounciations, especially of vowels. Trinidadian pronounciations differ from "typical" Caribbean pronounciations, but also from RP (I've heard it compared to south Welsh often); Indo-Trini pronounciations also differs in sound from Afro-Trini/north Trini pronounications somewhat. And then, having grown up all over the place, I have my own "made-up" accent which differs from everyone else in the world&#160;;)</p>

<p>Hey! I read your epic battle on the talk page with another linguist "contributer". So, what's the "unmarked syllable" (with egs)? Can you give me examples of OT constraints in English (what are they, exactly)? Seems they use OT to explain Bantu tonality, but I couldn't learn much from 'net sources. Where do OT constrs come from? Are they <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">memes</a>? How productive/useful is OT. Why eg does English have irregular stress patterns (ie can I use OT to understand arbitrary problems)? <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 17:20, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oy, I don't think I can explain all of Optimality Theory in a talk page message on Wikipedia, but I'll try to give a quick rundown. The "unmarked syllable" is a syllable that has one consonant in the <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable_onset.html" title="Syllable onset">syllable onset</a> and one vowel in the <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable_nucleus.html" title="Syllable nucleus">syllable nucleus</a>; examples from English are the words <i>bee</i> and <i>paw</i> and each syllable of the word <i>tomato</i>. Ideally, all languages should have the same constraints; the difference between languages' grammars is then just how the constraints are ranked. So for example, in German, all <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstruent.html" title="Obstruent">obstruents</a> are <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_consonant.html" title="Voiceless consonant">voiceless</a> in the <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable_coda.html" title="Syllable coda">syllable coda</a>: the word <i>Rad</i> "wheel" is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁaːt]</span>, because the voiced sound [d] has to become voiceless at the end of a syllable. As a result, this word is homophonous with the word <i>Rat</i> "advice". In English, on the other hand, voiced obstruents <i>can</i> appear in coda position and can contrast with voiceless obstruents: the English words <i>bed</i> and <i>bet</i> are pronounced differently. According to OT, both English and German have two constraints relevant to this discussion: one constraint (call it NO-VOICED-CODA) that says "No voiced obstruents in coda position" and another (call it VOICE-FAITH) that says "No changing the voicing of consonants". In German, NO-VOICED-CODA is ranked higher than VOICE-FAITH, which means you can violate VOICE-FAITH (e.g. by pronouncing the <i>d</i> of <i>Rad</i> as a [t]) in order to keep from violating NO-VOICED-CODA. In English, their ranking is switched: VOICE-FAITH is higher ranked, which means you can violate NO-VOICED-CODA (e.g. by pronouncing the <i>d' of</i> bed <i>as a [d]) in order to keep from violating VOICE-FAITH. Does that make sense? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 19:46, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh... So in <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesotho.html" title="Sesotho">Sesotho</a> VELAR-NASAL-CODA-ALLOWED would be higher than NO-CODA-AT-ALL? But most other Bantu langs would have these 2 switched? Ses has lost the Bantu prenasalised consonants but has rare syllabic nasals. It also has a prenasalised click and unique syllabic nasal followed by a radical or aspirated click. It would appear that there is an infinite number of constrs, then - they seem so arbitrary! What's so amazing about the Australian (?) lang you mentioned with a/the VC "unmarked syllable"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>What's surprising about the Australian language I mentioned is that the constraints on syllable structure are supposed to be ONSET ("a syllable has an onset") and NO-CODA ("a syllable does not have a coda"). The unmarked CV syllable meets both of those constraints. A VC syllable violates both of them, so you don't expect any language to prefer VC syllables. That doesn't mean you don't expect languages to <i>have</i> VC syllables -- English has many, e.g. <i>eat</i> -- merely that you don't expect it to be the preferred (or God forbid <i>only</i>) syllable type in the language. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 22:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that if these categorizations by nationality are to have any objectivity, we should allow any nationality that were held by the articles' subjects during their lifetimes. I don't know if Porkorny ever had a Czech passport, if he didn't, we should remove the template. If he did, we should add whatever other nationalities he held besides. This is only feasible for relatively recent biographies, of course; I am aware that categorization by nationality/ethnicity may be problematic for medieval, let alone ancient, subjects, but Pokorny at least would seem to fall within the age of passports. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:23, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One the problem with Tamil wikipedia is not the characters are not rendered correctly unless you set up the windows. This could either be done by installing Windows LIP (Language Interface Pack) or either by setting up complex scripts for Windows XP/2003 or Indic support in Windows 2000. If you don’t setup windows no body can read it. So windows LIP is more important than Office LIP since it helps the reader to read Tamil wikipedia (and of course other wikipedias as well) whether we need or not how to articles is depending on the requirements. I shall be very thankful if you can restore it. Also have a look at my interview bhashaindia at <a href="http://www.bhashaindia.com/Patrons/SuccessStories/Umapathy.aspx?lang=en" class="external free" title="http://www.bhashaindia.com/Patrons/SuccessStories/Umapathy.aspx?lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhashaindia.com/Patrons/SuccessStories/Umapathy.aspx?lang=en</a> --<a href="../../../u/m/a/User%7EUmapathy_db5f.html" title="User:Umapathy">Umapathy</a> 08:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello again! May I ask you to transcribe the following word for me? "security" (General American, with a flap). Also, do you know a place on the internet where I could read about flaps (not taps)? Thank you very much. Umm, I thought that a retroflex flap is actually an alveolar flap (as opposed to an alveolar tap). Is there any truth to that? I mean, many linguists don't distinguish between the two, but, as far as I can see, it's a terrible assumption to think that people upon reading a phonetic transcription can recognize whether it's a flap or tap being used. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennis_Valeev_c2cf.html" title="User:Dennis Valeev">Dennis Valeev</a> 20:38, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My pronunciation (narrowly transcribed) is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[səˈkʰjɝəɾi]</span>, others may pronounce it <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[səˈkʰjʊɹəɾi]</span>. Hmm... I'm just re-reading what Ladefoged has to say, and he agrees with you: "In a flap, the tip of the tongue is first curled up and back in a retroflex gesture and then strikes the roof of the mouth in the post-alveolar region as it returns to its position behind the lower front teeth." I had always thought that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɽ]</span> was actually a retroflex <i>tap</i>, essentially an ultrashort <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɖ]</span>, the same way <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> is an ultrashort <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[d]</span>.

<p>In rapid speech, I <i>think</i> I use two alveolar taps (the first one nasal, the second one oral), with the briefest of possible vowels between them. My tongue does lose contact with my alveolar ridge really quickly between the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ̃]</span> and the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span>, just long enough to make an audible vowel and to raise my velum to end nasalization, but my tongue tip doesn't go far enough away to make a retroflex flap. I bet my tongue tip is never more than a millimeter away from my alveolar ridge during the entire <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ̃ɪɾ]</span> sequence. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 21:33, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Am I right when I assume that in rapid speech there exists the following transition: "celebrity" (suh-LEB-ruh-tee)--&gt; "celebirty" (suh-LEB-uhrtee), where the "rt" pair is actually an alveolar flap, and, well, the second schwa in the second word is ultra short, for some obscure reason; as far as I'm concerned. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennis_Valeev_c2cf.html" title="User:Dennis Valeev">Dennis Valeev</a> 17:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Angr! Back in March I asked you about the pronunciation of <i>bí</i> in different forms, to which you provided a very helpful answer. I just wanted to clarify some things about the <i>bhíothadh</i> form. Both <a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" rel="nofollow"><i>An Foclóir Beag</i></a> and my <i>Collins Irish Dictionary</i> (not to mention <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_verbs.html" title="Irish verbs">Irish verbs</a>&#160;:)) provide <i>bhíothas</i>, not <i>bhíothadh</i>, as the translation of "one was". Ó Siadhail sticks with <i>bhíothadh</i>, which is probably dialect-specific. Would you please clarify for me what the difference between the two forms is and which would be better for a learner like me to use? Same goes for the Ó Siadhail's <i>rabhadh</i>--<i>Collins Irish Dictionary</i> suggests <i>rabhthas</i>, and <i>An Foclóir Beag</i>--<i>rabhthar</i> (I am not entirely sure if I'm looking at the right tables, though). I would prefer Standard Irish, or a Connacht Irish version.--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 19:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The official standard (<i>Caighdeán Oifigiúil</i>) is <i>bhíothas</i> and <i>rabhthas</i> in the past tense, so those are the forms you as a learner should use. <i>Rabhthar</i> is the autonomous form in the present subjunctive, not the past indicative. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 21:00, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bhuel, níl ionadh orm ar chor ar bith&#160;:) Ó Siadhail is often maddening in regards to the dialect-specific vocabulary and phrases he uses. No matter how much effort I put into trying to catch all those dialect perks and replace them with Standard Irish, I keep finding myself in a position of having learned something that I should have learned in a completely different way. Anyway, thanks again for your help and for clarification of present subjunctive vs. past indicative--I am yet to figure out <i>An Foclóir Beag'</i>s abbreviations, so it was completely my screw-up.--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 21:47, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Greetings. At the risk of being pedantic, I'd like to point out that there is an important difference between <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code-switching.html" title="Code-switching">code-switching</a> and a <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_language.html" title="Mixed language">mixed language</a> as described in our hoax article. In code-switching, the contributing languages are not "compromised"; the switching occurs at the phrase level. In a "mixed language", the mixture typically also occurs at the level of single words. One example of some I've actually seen: <i>Aptekimiz</i> instead of Turkish <i>Eczanemiz</i> or German <i>Unsere Apotheke</i>. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:27, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, you're not being pedantic; there is an important distinction, and I'm aware of it but glossed over it in the AFD. The thing is, genuine <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_language.html" title="Mixed language">mixed languages</a> are really rare, and I don't believe that what I hear on the bus from the Turkish children going to German school in the morning is a mixed language, but rather code-switching. Something like <i>aptekimiz</i> is probably just a loanword at some level; saying that is no different than one English-speaker living in Germany saying to another, "there's an Einfahrt leading into the Hinterhof" (an actual quote from a conversation I once had with another American here; neither of us even noticed until a German friend started to laugh). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 07:39, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, the reason for deletion is that it was a copyrighted image uploaded under a fair use provision, but it wasn't actually used in any articles. Fair use images have to be used in articles, or else they will be deleted. As far as I can tell, the image had only been used in <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Jackman_a4df.html" title="Hugh Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a> but was removed by <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrumbsucker_df4f.html" title="User:Crumbsucker">User:Crumbsucker</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Jackman&amp;diff=46926533&amp;oldid=46315676" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Jackman&amp;diff=46926533&amp;oldid=46315676" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. A week later (20:13, 11 April 2006 (UTC)), the image was tagged as an orphaned fair-use image by <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoomba_b392.html" title="User:Roomba">User:Roomba</a>, which is a bot owned by <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a>. I deleted it nine days after that. I agree you should have been notified when Roomba tagged the image; other bots (e.g. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrphanBot_88cf.html" title="User:OrphanBot">User:OrphanBot</a>) are programmed to do that. Roomba apparently isn't; perhaps you could ask <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a> to program it so it notifies uploaders of orphaned images in the future.

I kind of doubt a link to a now-deleted page via the wayback machine will pass muster with the more copyright-paranoid among us.

<dd>Yes, it's certainly possible. And no, not that I can find, but that has me wondering if it's really legitimately PD. Just because it's a 1909 image doesn't mean it was <i>published</i> then. Maybe that's why the site is now dead? Anyway, sorry to trouble you-- there are plenty of other Wright images around.

<p>Thanks for your help, Irascible Dude! Go to my user page and see the section where it says "In other languages", where can I go to change "seSotho" to "Sesotho" for all pages? Should I explain in linguistical terms? Perhaps the reason why Angie didn't check my edit history is because she didn't know what "Tse ngotsweng ke motho enwa" meant (that's another joke, btw). <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 12:00, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I see what you're talking about. Wherever a page is linked to its equivalent in the Sesotho Wikipedia, the language is called "seSotho" in the "Other languages" box.

<p>Hey, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill--just to "take care" of your friend. That's okay. Do your worst to stick up for those who give fuck all about the rules themselves. Pick and choose which rulebreakers to be kind to! Ever stop to think that I may need a friend? It just so happens, that I doubt the sincerity of this other user and their excuses. It is convenient for you to push for an injunction against my editing, so your friend can edit freely without dispute--in my absence (bringing up month-old bad news). This other person was hoping that nobody would suspect their IP editing, but I noticed it through the edit summaries right away. This person has concocted their own standards about editing the Wikipedia, which do not match those of the Wikipedia community. I and this other editor may be in disagreement--but just because I called him/her out on foul practices, does not mean that it was anything resembling personal attacks. I shouldn't call attention to vandals when they put nonsense up in the articles? I shouldn't make sure others know that what they've been doing is unhelpful? I shouldn't remind others to not sneak in their favoured edits by covertly doing so, under another name or IP address? I wonder what the Wikipedia has come to. <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 04:34, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know of any exceptions (which is why I wrote "always" in the first place), but perhaps there are dialects where it isn't true, or perhaps there are irregular verbs where it isn't true, or perhaps the edit was made by someone with an inherent fear of absolutes, who just changed "always" to "often" to be on the safe side. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 17:59, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As per your request on the translations page, I translated and integrated Tachograph from German to English. A whole lot of the German site has to do with German and European law regarding the tachograph, and therefore so does a lot of the English article now. However I did sequestor a little bit of what was part of the main description in the German article into the <i>Regulations</i> section on the English site. I'm still not so sure if the English site needs to have quite so much information on German law, though.

<p>First, what's the deal with people saying "and" as [eʌnd]? Second, what accounts for people around here [NW Wisconsin] pronouncing [æl] as [ɛl] in syllables having l as [at least part of] the closing end of the syllable [with the notable exception of the nickname "Al"]? Third, what accounts for the [I'm pretty sure, completely unrelated] pronunciation of such words as "milk" as [mɛlk] or Wisconsin as [wɛ·'skaⁿn·sn̩] (or even the hideous sounding [wɛs·'kʰɑn·sn̩]) instead of the "normal Wisconsin pronunciation" of [wɨ·'skaⁿn·sn̩]? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 09:12, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, isn't that just normal æ-tensing before a nasal? Doesn't it rhyme with <i>hand</i> and <i>land</i> etc.? Second, I don't know, I'm not an expert in NW Wisconsin accents. Third, I don't know, I'm not an expert in NW Wisconsin accents. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 09:16, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, I'm not sure...perhaps it's just more "obvious" in "and" than in "hand" or "land". Second, I don't expect you to be an expert in NW WI accents, I just thought perhaps you might have encountered a study that discussed [æl] =&gt; [ɛl], or even perhaps a more far-reaching review of vowel mutations preceding syllable-closing [l]s. Third, the melk and Wesconsin thing isn't a NW WI phenom, it's something I've noticed in the speech primarily of <i>non</i>Wisconsinites...which is, in fact, why I said I was pretty sure it was unrelated... and seems to be a confusion or merger of [ɪ] and [ɛ] independent of the pin/pen merger.

<dd>I don't know of any studies off the top of my head, but I do know vowels tend to get mixed up before tautosyllabic liquids (whether l or r). I wouldn't have thought the first syllable of <i>Wisconsin</i> would be sufficiently stressed to be able to distinguish vowels there anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 09:41, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>removing gallery:</p>
<p>The images are not in context to the sections. Hence they suit to put them into a gallery.</p>
<p>The avatar image disply does not violate the terms of the original publisher (they are intend for website display). "fair usage" is a wrapper to prevent PD usage, and limit it to wikipedia. It is a graphical style and an example for red hairs in graphical styles.</p>

<dd>A gallery would be fine if there were so many images in the article that there's no more room.
