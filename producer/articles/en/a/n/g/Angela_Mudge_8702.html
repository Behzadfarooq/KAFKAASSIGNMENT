<p>Mudge's start in life did not augur well for a future in endurance running. Both she and her twin sister were born with defects in their feet; both of Angela's feet and one of Janice's were pointing backwards. She has commented that <i>"[w]e got a bit squashed in the womb"</i>, and for the first few years of their lives they were required to have their legs in braces and plaster in order to rectify this.<sup id="_ref-lonely_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lonely" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although born and raised in Devon, Mudge has only ever represented Scotland at international level. She has said <i>"It would've been tough to have gone back down south and tried to gain selection there. Once I started running for Scotland there seemed no point in changing because they gave me my opportunity."</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following her graduation from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Leicester_efc5.html" title="University of Leicester">University of Leicester</a> with a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">B.Sc.</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, she moved north to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Stirling_f9c8.html" title="University of Stirling">University of Stirling</a> to obtain her <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">Master's degree</a>, and discovered the sport while there.

<p>Mudge came late to hill running by comparison with more mainstream athletics competitors, not recording results until her mid-twenties, but developed quickly. Placed only 49th in the British Inter-Counties Cross Country Championship in 1995, she won the event four times in succession from 1997–2000.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> In between, she scored a fourth place finish in the 1997 European Mountain Running Trophy, and also won the Scottish Hill Running Championships in 1997 and 1998,<sup id="_ref-shr_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shr" title="">[5]</a></sup> and the Scottish Cross Country Championship in 1999.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> She showed equally rapid development on the international stage, placing 46th in the 11th World Mountain Running Trophy when it was held in Scotland in 1995, only five years prior to winning the event in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>In an early precursor of her international potential, Mudge broke the record for the 11,000&#160;ft course as she won the 1999 <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Kinabalu_aaab.html" title="Mount Kinabalu">Mount Kinabalu</a> Climbathon in <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabah.html" title="Sabah">Sabah</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> to claim the <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">US$</a>2,500 prize.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Her best result in the European Mountain Running Trophy to date was as runner up in Bad Kleinkirchheim, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carinthia_%28state%29.html" title="Carinthia (state)">Carinthia</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> in 1999.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup> She repeated this in 2001 in <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenia.html" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, finishing behind <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> Svetlana Demidenko,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> and again in 2003 in <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trento.html" title="Trento">Trento</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, when <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>'s Catherine Lallemand won.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Her most notable achievement to date came in 2000, when she won the women's World Mountain Running Trophy in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen%2C_Lower_Saxony_aa03.html" title="Bergen, Lower Saxony">Bergen</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. This could be considered unusual, as Mudge is more experienced in British fell-running, which includes running up <i>and</i> down hills; international hill running typically only involves an ascent. In 2000, as with all even-numbered years, the Trophy race followed the international style, so her greater experience in descending could not be used to her advantage.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>She also finished second in the 2003 event held in <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girdwood%2C_Alaska_c301.html" title="Girdwood, Alaska">Girdwood, Alaska</a>, behind <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>'s Melissa Moon. Compatriots Tracey Brindley finished third and Lyn Wilson 18th, and these combined results meant Scotland won the Women's Team championship.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[13]</a></sup> She also won the 2003 <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikes_Peak_9e47.html" title="Pikes Peak">Pikes Peak</a> marathon which she only entered as a warm up for the Alaska race. Her victory in 4h&#160;19m&#160;38s not only set a course record for the 14,000&#160;ft peak, it marked the only defeat in six years for <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Alamos%2C_New_Mexico_802c.html" title="Los Alamos, New Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a> runner Erica Larson, who won in 1999–2002 and 2004.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2001, she triumphed in the <i>Cinq 4,000s</i> in Sierre-Zinal, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Her record time made her the first woman to complete the 31&#160;km course in less than three hours.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mudge missed much of the 2005 season, first recuperating from an operation to rehabilitate a damaged <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knee.html" title="Knee">knee</a> which left her on crutches, and then succumbing to a bout of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantar_fasciitis.html" title="Plantar fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a> between May and July. Of her surgery, Mudge said <i>"I'd worn away all my knee <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartilage.html" title="Cartilage">cartilage</a> – more to do with my running style than the sport itself. I was running on the bare bone of my <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femur.html" title="Femur">femur</a>, so the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgeon.html" title="Surgeon">surgeon</a> drilled a lot of holes, which stimulates scar tissue, and eventually, I could run again. My knee was more painful afterwards than before. I was prepared for that, but was allowed to run for only ten minutes even months after the operation. I deliberately did not ask about the success or failure rate in order to keep a positive frame of mind. It was only six months later that a <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiotherapist.html" title="Physiotherapist">physiotherapist</a> told me there were lots of people for whom the operation did not work."</i><sup id="_ref-herald_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-herald" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
