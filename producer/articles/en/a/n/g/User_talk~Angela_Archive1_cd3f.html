<p>Hi, on ships we've typically been leaving in the "insert caption" line as a reminder to go find a picture. It's not bad that you removed it, but there are hundreds more with the note, all waiting for illustration (which are not hard to add BTW, the US navy has many PD photos to choose from, just takes time). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 21:49 28 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry Stan. I just assumed it was a mistake. I should have checked with you first. Angela. May 31 2003.</dd>

<dd>No biggie! I might not have said anything, but thought you'd probably prefer to know rather than not know. It's not often that anyone takes interest in the ship articles!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 23:04 31 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congratulations, you have just been made a sysop! You have volunteered for boring housekeeping activities which normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops basically can't do anything: They cannot delete pages arbitarily (only obvious junk like "jklasdfl,√∂asdf JOSH IS GAY"), they cannot protect pages in an edit war they are involved in, they cannot ban signed in users. What they can do is delete junk as it appears, ban anonymous vandals, remove pages that have been listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> for more than a week, protect pages when asked to, and help keep the few <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected pages</a> there are, among them the precious <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, up to date.</p>
<p>Note that almost everything you can do can be undone, so don't be <i>too</i> worried about making mistakes. You will find more information at <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a></b>, please take a look before experimenting with your new <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">powers</a>. Drop me a message if there are any questions or if you want to stop being a sysop (could it be?).

<p>No, the special characters (if you cant do it) is probably a function of the old software. -If Simple.wiki were to be upgraded, you and I (being the only ones interested apparently - you more than I lately&#160;;) - then one of us can simply ask Brion to do it --on the wikitech mailing list, or on his new "to do" list under his meta userpage. But as I understand it, that would erase some of the old data -- if he doesnt back it up (sometimes not necessary on wikis with only scratch on them). I would also prefer to deal with/answer the question of the simple wiki's true purpose. I modified this aspect heavily a while ago, when I first started editing it.

<p>If you read my proposal of "SEnpl for fascile translation" (on simple.) that kinda runs over the idea. The idea is that language should only be a component of a page -- like a little langa:en tag somewhere on the doc -- that way all the pages are part of the same wiki and are "closer together."</p>
<p>But thats kinda separate just from using Simple as a kind of sandbox where the grammar rules are extremely lax -- if you read broken English, you can usually piece it together -- same goes for my broken Chinese and Arabic, etc -- why not run an experiment to see if one wiki can take the place of a lot of these smaller wikis -- when there is enough there we can farm the articles out. (will copy to general mailing list for more general discussion -- there is some interest there.) -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><strong>Êà¥&amp;#30505sv</strong></a> 07:04, Aug 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hiya, love your user page! BTW sorry for springing another vote on the Temp5 debate page but I've been watching this and earlier debates go on and on and on . . . and on, with edit wars, revertions, etc. We seem to be going around and around in circles so I thought it was about time the circus was put out to grass by clarifying what do we want and when do we want it. Two votes (on if and when we want a new page, and final approval for the new draft or drafts drawn up on the basis of what the community decides it <i>actually</i> wants) seems the most logical way to get a decision. Otherwise we'll be voting on temp after temp after temp all year, with each new page if approved challenged by another temp ad nausaum. Maybe this time we'll get off the starter blocks and actually take a series of steps with an outcome, rather than endless false starts that decide nothing. lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Fear√âIREANN</a> 15:31, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I do use the preview button. It's that I use the sectioned off edit buttons that's lined along the entire right side of the long page when I'm logged in. I do this because it is easier for me to edit small sections a bit at a time then to use the edit button at the bottom of the entire page (displaying all the technical symbols with the text) to edit just one little section. I'm constantly researching new information and adding them to the timeline if you check the edit history. Also, I try to improve the phrasing, format, punctuation and misleading information. I admit that some edits were preview mistakes, but that fact accounts for a very small percentage of the time (see page history).</p>
<p>I know it looks like a lot but it's because I use the edit-section option running along the side.</p>
<p>Right now I'm on summer break from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (A Senior majoring in Linguistics &amp; Psychology with an Honors GPA) and it's the first summer in a very long time that there's no work in my area. The recession has hit the United States pretty hard, especially in my area; This year has had the worst lay-off rate of workers since World War II, the worst unemployment in 20 years, the worst year for the 10-Year Bond, and the worst year in 5 years for the all the US stock markets.</p>
<p>Thus, I'm out of work and came up with the idea to research the history video games 2 weeks ago when I was listening to some video game music while reading my academic books.</p>
<p>This is how I ran into your fabulous website.</p>
<p>Sorry,</p>

<dd>I was wondering about your redirect of the Guided Missile Destroyers page. I'm putting together an article on the USS Gyatt, the first DDG, and am wondering if it will be affected by this redirect.

<p>What actions, Angela? What actions? You want to revoke my sysop status because I have been urging a ban on a user who posts crap like this: "Pat Robertson has recently felt hardship, for he knows he is losing the war against gay rights and his small penis. Pat Robertson has even been known to give $150,000 to a scam artist who told him he would sell him machines for $275 that would create perpetual motion, or endless power. Clearly not a scientist, Pat Robertson suffers from many diseases of the brain. He also has publically announced that he wishes that the 3 supreme court justices that are ill who voted for sodomy to be legalized to die. He is a sham and uses his position to accomplish vendettas of his own in the name of the christian populus.

<dd>Ill agree that one shouldnt pump themselves to be a "top cop" --but I disagree with you rather pacifist assertion that 172 should just do nothing. Ive noticed that a few people (like RK) seem to get away with crap simply because people like to "avoid them" -- Granted that "one should not argue with a fool, or people wont be able to tell the difference" -- but the ignore it approach is too simplistic an answer. Let me qualify that I'm speaking with next to no knowledge of the specifics -- Ive scanned Nostrums work and was not too impressed with it. What is the sanction specifically about? A specific punishment for a specific offense --bad attitude alone is not a justification. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><strong>Êà¥&amp;#30505sv</strong></a> 06:08, Aug 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">User:RK</a> is a simple bully, who harasses all those who oppose his views on anything. Reverting everything he puts in a talk file would be a good start. His article text isn't so bad, but he puts the text where it will make his political point, not where it belongs. 172 is also usually right, and doesn't seem to whine to authority much or at all, which is the primary requirement for a sysop. Make whiners sysops, and soon the whole project goes right to hell. 142.177.71.11</dd>

<p>I saw your comments on Sv's page. This was a great encouragement to me that we'll be able to put this dispute behind us and someday work cordially on an article if our pursuits on Wiki ever coincide. As JT was saying, my tough responses to vandalism have been generally effective. Just 18 hours ago or so I single-handedly averted the comeback of the hard-banned racist Zog (back as ZOG). He won't be filling up the mailing list and talk pages like last time and there will be no hours and hours of edit wars, like last time. That's because I reacted quickly when I noticed that he had exposed his IP, which I banned. Sometimes those who know the vandals best, and know best how to recognize them, are most adept at thwarting them. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:49, 15 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not trying to change your mind here, just responding to what you said to 172 on his talk page. I would like to say that I know for a fact that Nostrum means no harm, and that the reason I got involved in the issue was becuase I felt 172 was treating newbies unfairly (he was treating Nostrum like a vandal, when all he needed was guidance.). I found out that 172 had a history of labeling people vandals, and scaring them off of wikipedia. I felt that this was reason enough for his sysop powers to be removed, becuase it upsets me to know he is representing wikipedia that way. Anyhow, I've said this a million times. Just wanted to let you know that this was never personal for me, and that I feel the 172 issue should not be dropped so quickly. <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbecker_eaee.html" title="User:Mbecker">„Éû„Ç§„Ç´„É´ (MB)</a> 01:35, Aug 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you don't mind, could you try and help Nostrum out?

It wastes someone's time if they follow a link thinking they will get some useful information, only to find a unprofessional and incomplete article.

<p>You removed some factual information from a page about a small town in Armenia. You stated that it was irrelevant in your summary; it was verifible historical information that I obtained from several independent sources. Am I to assume that any reference to the birthplace of a famous individual is an irrelevant entry? I am not aware of that policy, can you point me to the place were it says that birthplace information is irrelevant and should not be posted here.

<dd>Sure, no problem with that reword. I was trying to much the same thing (I had originally used "requirement", and switched it to the softer "policy").

<p>If we manually move pages over to the new system now, then it's going to make conversion more difficult overall: a list of renamed pages will need to be kept so that the page edit histories can be re-imported later.

<p>Hello again Angela,</p>
<p>As you would like answers to your questions, here they are: I did write a note to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> even before the two of us had our little talk last night. The sheer speed at which the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> page has been growing recently makes me dizzy. Sometimes it seems to me Wikipedia has been taken over by a bunch of newbies who have no idea about what some have called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">WikiLove</a> and who, for some obscure reason, are trying to reduce it to a bare minimum, without any option for expansion. I called them "quick deleters", and I'm sorry that it was you I singled out to have that discussion with. You made it clear you did not want to delete <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interim.html" title="Interim">Interim</a>. But removing or transferring it to Wiktionary is also reducing the scope of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Whenever I have a look at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">VfD</a> these days I'm horrified. Pages that in the past would have gone unnoticed or been improved on the spot by some other user (according to the old policy, "If you don't like it, change it") are now listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">VfD</a> only minutes after they have been posted, or a notice saying <i>The neutrality of this page is <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_dispute_c299.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV dispute">disputed</a></i> is dumped on the page, with some flimsy explanation on the corresponding talk page (like a couple of hours ago at <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_no_return.html" title="Point of no return">Point of no return</a>). And what is supposed to happen then? I could use the "Random page" function and do the one or the other with every other page I get, but why should I?</p>
<p>As I already tried to point out, so many people have left (are leaving) Wikipedia, but their departure also goes unnoticed. I don't think it's a good idea that there are some Wikipedians who hardly ever write articles themselves and who believe it is their job to assess their peers' work only. (To me that's just like the head teacher in a school who does not teach himself any more or the plumber who does not want to get his hands dirty any longer.) I consider such a system (even if the hierarchy is informal and implicit) imbalanced. (But this is nothing to do with you personally.)</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice concerning the <i>Simple English Wikipedia</i>. I'll have a look at it, but I don't want to have my fingers in too many pies and, well, I'm not under stress -- I'm worried. --<a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">KF</a> 14:47, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I just noticed your message. Perhaps in the future I'll add some to WikiQuotes. Currently, I'm working on a new project using the quotes that I like.</p>
<p>I noticed that many of the greats have been quoted about many of the same issues, saying almost the same things, yet with minor twists or extra points. Thus, yesterday I started to rearrange them into a sequence whereby the list now seems to be a conversation among the greats, in which each supports or refutes a point that the previous has stated.</p>
<p>My intention is to arrange a philosophical discussion among the greats that I discern as highly ingenious; a talk which crosses the historical limits of their deaths, and designed similarly as an internet chatroom or message bulletin.</p>
<p>Check out the webpage now, I've added many new quotes and sorted them out as much as I could so far: <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonius_Quotes_706f.html" title="User:Tonius/Quotes">User:Tonius/Quotes</a></p>

<p>Yes; I know of this list. I have considered several times putting me on it. But I have a safety valve. When I am really mad at the french, I come here. When I am mad at the english, I go to the french. When I am really unhappy about both places, I go on meta. Usually, that helps. And each time I get slightly different. Right now, I am over there. Have a couple of ones who I miss. But that does not mean they are entirely gone. Just not very much there. Unfortunately. As I said, I miss kq, and the cunctator, I don't see much of Quercus, so little happen on the topics I like. On the french wiki, I terribly miss Alvaro. I am also worried, because he left all of a sudden 6 weeks ago. Too long for holidays I think. I know that he likes boats, so perhaps he is just having a long time on one. But I also know he already had an heart attack, and his mail has been bouncing back on the french mailing back for being too full. So, leaving is fine but...</p>
<p>Anyway, I am terribly sentimental about people I appreciate&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Nod. Thanks. I'll be back when I feel more secure and when the french wiki will need me less. I think there is a current trend (agressivity toward newbies, libel, insults, hate speech, npov liberal interpretation, censorship, call for ban), that does&#160;:-)<br /></p>

<p>Ok, I suppose that doesn‚Äôt prove anything in reality but that along with comments I have received from other Wikipedians I respect has led me to undelete my user page which was done after thinking I had been stupid nominating a potentially hard-banned user.

<p>Angela, reverting RK's ban page to blank it is a serious mistake. Not only are you favouring a "squeaky wheel" (blanking his renamed ban page while every other /ban page remains in place), but, you are sending him a signal to continue, as his <a href="http://disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=propaganda_techniques" class="external text" title="http://disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=propaganda_techniques" rel="nofollow">propaganda techniques</a> are working. You have fallen for a rather obvious trick: he accepts a measure for a limited time, then after protests that it is not harsh enough die down, he begins agitating against that measure, arguing that it is unique and therefore he has been "singled out" - whereas in fact he has got a special favour, which is, to have his record moved to a less obvious place. It is revolting in the extreme to watch otherwise intelligent people fall for trick which come straight from the Provocateur's Handbook. You must get over your feelings about /ban pages and at least recognize that the same policy must be applied to all of them at once, and that RK may set a precedent, but he may not be allowed to gain special favours for himself by such means as he uses. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntmootsOfTrolls_3b61.html" title="User:EntmootsOfTrolls">EofT</a></p>
<p>This is not a schoolyard. Literally the whole planet can read what is posted here.

The commentary on this has been painstakingly centralized so that decisions taken on his "case" can be fair. But you wish to let him hide all that and simply continue on as he has, with a clean and invisible record, so that others can give him leeway and find the same treatment being applied to them again. You are literally erasing the memory of Wikipedia, by which it can come to grips with this kind of gross infection. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntmootsOfTrolls_3b61.html" title="User:EntmootsOfTrolls">EofT</a></p>

<p>Angela, thank you for pointing out to 172 that my comment regarding Saddam Hussein was tongue-in-check; I guess I have more of an English sense of humour than I thought; perhaps that comes from being a loyal subject of Her Majesty, eh? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 20:22, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding the comment about 172 as SH, I think he is fair game for this kind of joshing too, but I am not going to add it back, anyone can check the page history to see what I say, I am not trying to impose my personal opinion on anyone else. But after all SH's history shows an otherwise inoffensive copyeditor (though some of his edits are inappropriate as I was pointing out) so suggesting that SH and 172 are the same should not really be insulting to 172? I think this all shows that using the name of dictators as user names should not be tolerated as it is being tolerated with the SH case. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 21:02, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my own defence you will note that I say earlier in the post that I will not call that user by the dictator's name but by <a href="../../../s/h/_/User%7ESH_65bc.html" title="User:SH">user:SH</a> ‚Äî that is the name I suggested for him earlier in my posting, if his real name is the same as the evil dictator, then at least he gets to use his initials. I think that is a reasonable compromise. So at the end I was saying that maybe SH is 172, not that 172 is an evil dictator. Geeze sometimes everyone in this place seems like they are walking on pins and needles, I can see why you were thinking of leaving Wikipedia, people can get <i>so</i> upset at times. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 21:25, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I'm Wikibi. Thanks a lot for your message. I'm new here and need time to find my way around the web pages. As a matter of fact, I don't think I did anything wrong uploading my images yesterday. I followed all the instructions on the page and used the "Upload file" button above the "Special pages" button. Anyway, I can't find the images now. Is there a way that I can make up for it? Since I've already made them, I'd like to at least show these logos to some Wikipedians. My sort of way "to be accepted" as a new comer. I don't want to be imposing, but if you are interested, I'd like to show them to you. Thanks.</p>

Martin has suggested adding something to the VfD/copyvio page and our discussion regarding copyright infringement on history pages came up. I just thought that maybe there should be something that discourages people from removing the copyvios and then rewriting the page. If it was clearly stated that new page with violations had to be deleted and then restarted this might prevent and be a better way to prevent copyrighted material from sneaking into the page histories (with new pages at least). Still does not really solve the problem with someone who adds stuff later, though.

<p>Hello. I do not know if EoT is banned right now. I saw you edited the talk page after RK had removed all EoT comments and answer. I think it is not standard practice to remove other people comments unless they are hardbanned. Even when it is the case, I certainly think it would be wise to remove libels and insults from comments from hard banned users (just as regular users btw), but in this case, the comments removed had no destructive goals, but suggested options. I think it real bad to let these comments be removed, be the author banned or not banned. It is just basic politness to allow the different editors in a dispute to express themselves (I also will had that the different editors are rather polite to each other) and it is other neutral editors in the debate to state so. I didnot like doing it, but I think it had to be. If EoT has been banned this night, it should be noted in the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> article. Thanks :-) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anth√®re</a></p>
<p>It is very early here as well, nearly 7, but I got to bed very early, and woke up with nightmares :-( I felt more like a deep black pit, so I am glad some see me as a lamp :-). I am an oil paper lamp. If EoT is not banned, then the comments sure had to be restored. Cheers and don't forget to sleep to fill up the lamp. Anth√®re</p>

<p>I intend to start sending the promotion release in about a week (Mav sait we could expect the 300 000 articles around the 8th of sept. I know I will have quite a bit of work around that time (I have a deadline at work around the 10-15th), so probably I won't be there much. These past weeks, several users have been quite rude to newbies, some newbies have even left clearly stating it was the reason they were leaving. Several have mentionned the fact they did not feel welcome in the past weeks (of couuuuurse, I was not there :-)))) in truth, I am not always very nice to newbies myself, but I try to take care of some sometimes) and had a hard time. And one of our best welcomer apparently left us (you know, the heart guy). I fear a bit what will happen when the press release occur. If you can help at that moment, that will be very greatly appreciated :-) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anth√®re</a></p>

It feels like a small version of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village Pump</a>, what with everyone and their cousins contributing. I was uncomfortable with a statement of how an editor intended to deal with a user ("revert on sight") posted to their user page, and not their talk page.

<p>I disagree with you on the car thing, but only in principle, not as an issue that I have to have my way with. If the justification for having it is frequency of use, I don't think that cars is used more frequently than car, or if it is, it doesn't warrant an additional entry. Take the example of crayons used on the pluralization page. We wouldn't have an entry for crayons with an 'S', though I bet it's used just as often as crayon without an 'S'. And as for reading the guideline pages, I DID read them very carefully before I submitted to the VfD. - TravelingDude 18:31, 31 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The links tables are not in the download dumps. They're only about 4 MB uncompressed, so it might be a good idea to put them in -- perhaps you or I should have a word to Brion. They can be reconstructed from the cur table, if you have a working copy of the PHP script. You just run <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wikipedia/phase3/maintenance/rebuildlinks.php?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup" class="external text" title="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wikipedia/phase3/maintenance/rebuildlinks.php?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup" rel="nofollow">rebuildlinks.php</a>, I think. If you don't have it, it's probably more trouble than it's worth to download it and get it working. Especially if you're running Windows. You'll just have to search the text for "[[....]]".</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, I'll see if I can make a link table dump myself. Give me a day or two. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:14, 1 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whoa, hang on. They aren't 4 MB uncompressed, they're more like 300 MB. I must have been reading the wrong row or something. But cur is 770 MB and that gets packed down to 100MB, so if we get a similar ratio here it should still be pretty reasonable -- say 50MB. Would that still be worth downloading, or should we find another way? -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 03:00, 1 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

Hi Noel, congrats on the adminship!
</pre>
<p>Thanks! And thanks for nominating me!</p>
<pre>
What are the redirects you are creating for?
</pre>
<p>To prevent what happened with <a href="../../../i/t/s/ITS_fcdb.html" title="ITS">ITS</a>, where someone created a new article under <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incompatible_Timesharing_System_ac91.html" title="Incompatible Timesharing System">Incompatible Timesharing System</a> because they didn't know there was already an article on it under <a href="../../../i/t/s/ITS_fcdb.html" title="ITS">ITS</a>.</p>
<pre>
The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_Artificial_Intelligence_Lab_da10.html" title="Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab">Stanford_Artificial_Intelligence_Lab</a> is a broken redirect
</pre>
<p>Only because I hadn't installed the new page yet. It works now.</p>
<pre>
I'm not sure Prevent duplicate article creation is very useful.
It's easy enough to merge the articles if this does occur.
</pre>
<p>Yes, but it would be nice to avoid that happening - and also avoid the chance of people fixng it incorrectly (as with the person who made ITS a disambig page).</p>
<pre>
Redirects show up in the search, and there has been complaint about this
being annoying (see the Atlas Shrugged redirects for an example)
</pre>
<p>Hmm. Well, that's a good point. I have tried to create only the most obvious redirects, ones that might quite likely actually get typed, but still... I'll go check out that discussion. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 00:46, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
