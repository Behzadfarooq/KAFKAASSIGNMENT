<p>This article is extremely offensive and should be removed. I have lived in South Africa all my life and I have never heard of most of this nonsense.</p>
<p>i think you should add afrikners to the realted ethnic groups as alot of settlers married afrikners but kept their english culture.</p>
<p>In the introduction it should say at the end of the first sentence: "English as their first language", and I agree many people of Dutch descent are today so-called Anglo Africans.For some reason the first section can't be edited.</p>
<pre>
Regarding the debate on British South Africans, I think this was a term used in the early twentieth century, hence current people would not be familiar with it. 
</pre>
<p>I have never heard this term Anglo-African before and find it quite obnoxious as an English speaking South African with its connotation of Anglo Indians who didn't have a great record, or for English S.Africans and their other British colony cohorts who overall have a group of people who have quite a colonial and racist history. It sticks in the throat that we should as a group claim "African" in our ethnic identity!</p>
<p>Terminoloy I am a little concerned about how much SA history the writer has read beyond school level (or even how much he really took in at school!) when he writes that the English speakers never established a strong cultural or political entity in SA. This is so completely wrong about the history of SA, and is just a common myth we current English speakers have about the Afrikaners having had the only power.</p>
<p>I am also concerned about the mixup that goes on between SA issues and Zimbabwe and Kenyan history - it is not clear whether the article is about this broader group of Anglo-Africans that the writer needs to claim or about English speaking issues in SA.</p>
<p>As you have gathered the article has got up my nose - sorry about getting up yours probably in response - the culture section is incredibly weak - the history section ditto. There seems to be a Rhodesian cause somewhere in there that hasn't been resolved by the writer - I believe claiming to be African means getting over the white bit. Comfortable with being white, but comfortable being with other Africans. I just don't think it is of encyclopedia quality, sorry and I will leave you alone now. Cheers</p>

<p>Since this article is about Anglo-Africans, surely the history section should only start with British involvement/annexation of the Cape Colony? Anything prior to that is just South African History, not Anglo African History. Also, I'm not convinced by the term British South African - I've never heard it. It's usually just English or English-speaking South African, no? <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 12 April 2006, 21:25 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mmm, yeah. Some very odd stories creep into this page from time to time. The page seems to blur the distinction between Anglo Africans and Anglo-South Africans. It mentions how they live in various countries but then talks almost exclusively about South Africans. Maybe it should specifically be reduced to an article about English-speaking South Africans, since they account for almost all "Anglo Africans" anyway, and are - and this is me stating opinion here - more of a coherent bloc than the scattered white English-speakers in the rest of the continent who tend to regard themselves as British expats. As an English-speaking South African, I certainly feel no particular attachment to the UK, despite what this article often seems to claim (I remember reading omething about respecting the Crown and Commonwealth?!) <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 15 May 2006, 19:20 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It makes good sense to change the focus of the article more closely to English-speaking white South Africans - there is already a corresponding article on <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Zimbabwe_41d4.html" title="Whites in Zimbabwe">Whites in Zimbabwe</a>; and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_African_fe7f.html" title="White African">White African</a>, which deals with European colonists in general. Perhaps <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Kenya_2219.html" title="Whites in Kenya">Whites in Kenya</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Zambia_2a97.html" title="Whites in Zambia">Whites in Zambia</a> will appear a couple of years down the line. My only caveat is that the name of the article might need to change to reflect the limited geographical scope - maybe English-speaking white South African is too long! <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 08:41, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Haha, yeah it definitely is a little long.. and no one would ever find it in searches!&#160;:) I can't really think of what it could be called... South African English? That way it would correspond to the language too... like Zulu (the ethnic group) and Zulu (language) on wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 16 May 2006, 12:26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That makes really good sense. I see the DSAE lists <b>South African English</b> as a collective term for English-speaking South Africans, so it's a recognised expression. Maybe that's the answer? If I can work out which account Luke J is using at the moment I will drop him a line and ask him to post his views, as he appears to be the originator of the page. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 13:43, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It doesn't necessarily need to replace this article. It could just be a separate article which focuses on the South African English. Especially since the table at the bottom is of ethnic groups of South Africa. Although most of the history which is specific to South African English-speakers would need to be taken over to the new page I suppose. <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 17 May 2006, 18:26 (UTC)</p>

<p>Luke, it would be really helpful if you could discuss on this page some of the edits that you are making. I have removed some of them today for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Factual inaccuracy - there is no such thing as a "Rhodesian dialect"; the white Zimbabwean slang term "mush" does not come from Shona.</li>
<li>Stylistic - I assume that you are not using the word to make a racist point, but the word <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantu.html" title="Bantu">Bantu</a>, when used to refer to a black South African person, has strong racist connotations and in modern South Africa is viewed as a deliberately offensive term.</li>
<li>Notability - I have removed the reference to the "English African Front for Liberty" - not only is there no evidence of its notability, but the Wikilink you provided leads straight to a copyvio notice.</li>
<li>Personal opinion - e.g. <i>"The phrase <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kaffir.html" title="Kaffir">Kaffir</a> became common among Anglo Africans"</i>. It isn't a phrase; it's a word. If you're going to make sweeping statements like that, you need to provide a reference. Without a reference, it is nothing more than your personal opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, I'm tempted to revert the picture change too. Considering it's from a one-man movement, and thus not overly representative of Anglo-Africans&#160;:) Let me know what the verdict is on moving the page to South African English (ethnic group) (or something like that) <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 16 May 2006, 17:32 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is good that this article has been edited! I am just wondering, which flag is that on the article? <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Poison_71c3.html" title="User:Dr.Poison">Dr.Poison</a> 18:40, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>During the Apartheid years in South Africa, many Anglo-Africans considered themselves to be more moderate than their Afrikaner compatriots, and generally supported the United Party rather than the National Party which established Apartheid in 1948.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Didn't many Anglo-Africans also vote for the National Party? Should this not be noted also? <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Poison_71c3.html" title="User:Dr.Poison">Dr.Poison</a> 17:08, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is the the number of Anglo-Africans that high? 4 million? In South African, there is about 2million and in Zimbabwe maybe 70 000? But are there over 2 million outside Africa? If somebosy would have a source for that number? ���<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Poison_71c3.html" title="User:Dr.Poison">Dr.Poison</a> 14:20, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In asking this question, are you referring to Anglo-Africans only as those of English descent? If so, your number for Zim is inaccurate because it reflects the number of white Africans there and not necessarily those of Anglo descent. If speaking of just whites, the number is actually even higher than 4 million since there are almost 5 million in South Africa alone.</p>

<p>This whole section seems a little odd. It's a one-man movement, has no support among the South African English and is entirely irrelevant to modern South African politics or culture. Who wishes for a volkstaat? Maybe 0.001% of English-speaking South Africans? <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 23:49, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Considering that Anglo-Africans were much more opposed to an end to Apartheid, it doesn't suprise me that many of my countrymen have wised up. That's like saying that support among Afrikaners for a volkstaat is almost non-existent because they all don't go out and vote for volkstaat-supporting parties, doesn't mean there isn't support.</p>
