<p>Hello! Many of us have been doing a good job, adding a lot to Mumbai suburbs (like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandra.html" title="Bandra">Bandra</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santacruz.html" title="Santacruz">Santacruz</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andheri.html" title="Andheri">Andheri</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulund.html" title="Mulund">Mulund</a> etal.). It's high time we have a standard template for this purpose.</p>
<p>I suggest - A brief intro, Geography(PIN Code, Neighbouring/Nearest Railway Stations, Neighbouring Suburbs, Main Roads), History, Educational Institutions, Places to Visit.</p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>I tried to move <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_billionaires.html" title="List of billionaires">List of billionaires</a> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_US-dollar_billionaires_12a8.html" title="List of US-dollar billionaires">List of US-dollar billionaires</a> (after suggesting it on talk and nobody replying in over a week), but made a mistake and moved the talk page instead. Moved it back again, and tried moving the article (with talk page) but I can't because of the redirect. Got a message saying to ask an admin -- please could you help?</p>
<p>Many thanks. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETrainspotter_4c98.html" title="User:Trainspotter">Trainspotter</a> 14:17, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My mistake. There was nothing on his user page or talk page and he didn't seem to have been there or signed anything. I didn't (think of) checking edits. Just obsessively tidy I guess. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> 18:49, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also by the way since I think you did the disclaimer I think WikiPedia not giving any form of financial advice is also a good idea--<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> 10:58, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, allow me to thank you for your willingness to stand as a Volunteer User Representative. There are many fine admins in Wiki, but I feel a special allegiance to you because you welcomed me here lo those many months ago. You will most certainly have my vote.</p>
<p>However, that is not what brought me here. Images of Mumbai is a page which was on VfD not long ago. It squeaked by, but the concerns raised generally had to do with the quality of the images and the fact that many had no particular focus. I selected about two thirds of them, edited them boldly in Photoshop, and created a new page, <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai_%28Images%29_f551.html" title="Mumbai (Images)">Mumbai (Images)</a>. I don't know how to redirect pages (still a newbie when it comes to some of the more esoteric stuff), and am not sure, as a regular user, I'm allowed to anyway, so I'm asking (a) if you could do it for me, and (b) if it is an operation I'm allowed to perform, the location of the page describing the procedure. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 22:57, 2004 May 10 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, many thanks for your offer to mediate the artificial consciousness article. I find the mediation necessary, because the things there are indeed out of hand. But what worries me is that mediation is about the article, but there the problem is the additude of two users who now already several months used personal attacks against other user (me). But you see yourself, if you read the talk page. And the big problem is that almost nobody ever reminded them that this is not a right behaviour, while I was admonished twice by sysops (for reverting more than three times). I understand that nobody dares to remind them, being afraid to become a subject of personal attacks as I am, but this gives them an impression that their behaviour is silently approved by others. Maybe the best idea I got of the reasons of ridiculing me was when Paul Beardsell wrote me (in the Archive 8 of the talk page) "I want to use the term artificial consciousness in the same way I might one day have to use natural consciousness to distinguish it from the artificial variety and as a separate subset of consciousness. You must not be allowed to impose some other meaning on the term than what it literally does now mean." Then somene in the Village Pump said to me that what he wanted to say was "I don't want you to". I started to think that maybe they indeed just act like a child, who feels hurt when something is not as it likes, and then starts to attack others as a protest. But if this indeed is true, then it's almost impossible to discuss complicated issues with them. And I don't know how to solve this problem. I may relent and fulfil their wishes, what I often did, but this doesn't seem to solve anything, it did not result in any agreement or ending the nonsense personal attacks. The questionable parts of the article should be discussed, but discussion ends in new personal attacks. So nothing can be seriously discussed, and other users don't dare to come to such place to solve the problems by discussion or by voting. They say that article is not NPOV, but all views proposed by anybody, for or against, are included, sometimes said if demanded that some particular view is a minority view, and there are no objections by anybody else to the parts of the text that they say are POV, one of them (attentiveness) was written by Matthew Stannard. Though sometimes maybe their aim is to add questionnable text to the article, for it then to be rejected. I'm thankful though for the contributions they made to the article, it's important to include all views there are, and most of their amendments were constructive. I tried not to reply to offenses, but this also did not cause them to change their behaviour. In other cases I replied to offenses as politely as I could. I am in terrible situation, whatever would change it, should be done. Maybe deleting the article would be a solution, but it's questionnable that deleting the article because of the behaviour of two people would be supported. I don't like to be discredited like that because of writing an article in Wikipedia, I'm not a professor in the University, but I'm still an Automatic Control engineer by education, I'm a completely identifiable person, not just a nickname, and these attacks discredit me far below the pride of ordinary person.

<p>More than two weeks ago, on April 25, the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a> referred a case to us which it had considered regarding <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony DiPierro</a> and a number of other user to us <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html#Issue_of_Anthony.27s_reverts_and_alleged_trolling" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">here</a>.</p>
<p>While Anthony has agreed to mediation, so far, there has been no response from another party in order to begin working on the Anthony mediation. We have drafted a statement at <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_mediation_statement_draft_4700.html" title="User:Bcorr/mediation statement draft">User:Bcorr/mediation statement draft</a> that we would like to post on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Requests for mediation</a> to the Arbitration Committee and all other interested parties, but before we do so, we want to check with the rest of the Mediation Committee. Please review the statement and let me know if you approve, wish to make/suggest changes, or have another way you'd like to suggest that we proceed.</p>
<p>Also, in that statement we refer to ourselves as co-chairs of the committee. There was discussion at the <a href="http://boards.wikimedia.org/viewtopic.php?t=80" class="external text" title="http://boards.wikimedia.org/viewtopic.php?t=80" rel="nofollow">mediation bulletin board</a> on the bottom half of the page, but we wanted to confirm that there was agreement on our being co-chairs for the period noted there before we post the statement. Also, if people are amenable to our serving as co-chairs, I will add that information to the Mediation Committee page.</p>

<p>Not sure i am on the right page or asking the right person but i am getting really annoyed with someone that keeps removing 'Nick Mason'from the Birmingham, England Musician area, i am not registered with wikipedia but i have contributed a massive amount of information since i stumbled across the page from culture to economy and famous residents, whats to stop someone from cpletely ruined all my hard work, i understand that some of my work has not been 100% factually correct and thats fine, but Nick Mason was born in Birmingham, hence, he's from Birmingham but someone doesn't like it? and i don't like it that they are removing his name all the time.</p>

I'm not sure what "other crap" you are talking about. Do you mean other edits by your IP?

<p>Doh! i just wrote a reply and i accidently deleted it, anyway...

<p>Hi again, sorry to bother you with this but this person: 80.86.36.98 is still deleting Nick Mason, and now he's taken to deleting stuff on the Custard factory and even the hip hop section, can he be banned because it really is unfair, if you ban his ip address i will definately join and write you an excellent erm... write up?</p>

<p>Ok, sounds good to me. I'm not the sort of person to get really uptight about things in general but i guess this is quite close to my heart so i do fight my corner. Well thanks again and i will take your advice and register, just need a decent photo and think of something interesting to say about myself. If you need a vote or anything let me know. Cheers, Nick.</p>
<p>Oh dear god, this man is now editing vast swathes of my work, he has even added the ridiculously petty "Famous residents that were born in Birmingham but that never made a home there" Please, please sort this out Angela. I have done as you said and requested the page be locked for a while and Andy Mabbot keeps saying that i am abusing him which i clearly wouldn't lower myself but he has even edited the page so that it would't load properly and if thats not vandelism i don't know what is!</p>
<p>He has even dragged someone called Morwen into the argument, he is trying to sully my name so that he gets his own way which is really, really irritating. I have never known such a pedantic (or troublesome) person... ever.</p>
<p>Cheers Again Nick.</p>

Hi A. i did as you suggested by leaving a nice polite note within the html, came back from work today and not only has this person deleted what he normally deletes but he has removed other nits n pieces, he obviuosly has too much time on his hands and he is slowly ruining my hard work, i even explained that we generally go to discussion when we want to remove or delete other peoples work.</p>
<p>Is there any way the page could be locked for a couple of days as i am the only creative person on the page at present, i understand that this work wont stand forever exactly as it is but to have someone demolish my work at his own free will is really sad. I think he has registered now as pig something or other?</p>

<p>Andy, why would i threaten anyone?

<p>Ok, and yes you did mention dispute resolution process but i really don't think it needs to go that far, i don't really want to get involved in that side of things... i'm sure that if you get time (it's not short) you could read my post on Bham discuss page, i don't have much time to keep on running to listed members just to protect some of my work so i'd much rather reach a group decision so that it is resolved without getting Andy into any grief!

<p>Hi, Angela, I appreciate your kindly attention to the ko-wikipedia. About three months ago you have helped me in revising the Allmassage. The revision is not completed. I suppose you are informed about my "malheur". Well, I am trying to set up the recently established ko-wiktionary. A main difficulty with which I am confronted is the index function. The en-wiktionary seems to function after the alphabetical ordered, self-seeking index. I've looked round wiktionary of other languages like Japanese or French. But they seem to gather words manually in indices they have apparently created for their own - even though French belongs to Indo-European language. You know, Korean is a language which also disposes of alphabet. How functions the myterious anchor "//wiktionary.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Allpages&amp;from=A A"&#160;? I've tried to exchange the Indo-European alphabet with the Korean, but it goes wrong. -- 12:07, 14 May 2004 (UTC) <a href="http://ko.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90%ED%86%A0%EB%A1%A0:%EC%95%84%ED%9D%94" class="external text" title="http://ko.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90%ED%86%A0%EB%A1%A0:%EC%95%84%ED%9D%94" rel="nofollow">ìí(A-heun)</a></p>

<p>dear angela,</p>
<p>i was a little sad when you deleted my what i had to say {"justice=the pieces of peace"}. any way, i think you people are doing a great job. i like the idea of free access to diverse views. should you/editors delete views? i think this is where u&amp;i have an issue. all views are of equal value in a fair system. this includes the "bad" guys. victor kacala.</p>
<p>key issue for your group is that it lacks balance in extreme views. even physics is merely a fairy tale. ps i hope u had a nice week-end.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, Angela. I thought I was doing Wikipedia a favour by (a) bypassing redirects whenever I saw them, so that links would point directly to their articles, and (b) by blanking the redirect page, as it no longer connects with anything and is now redundant. I didn't realize anybody might have a problem with that. Now that I know, I won't do it again.

<p>Hi Angela! I see you've been busy at the pump. good on you! I got a suggestion. when you move text to another talk page rather than just say 'from' blah blah, could you say 'moved from' blah blah.

<p>Angela, why the Arabic Wikipedia? Do you know any Arabic? Or do you just do stuff that doesn't require you to know the language?</p>

I can tell the difference between "edit" and "delete" but that's about it. I very rarely edit on the Arabic Wikipedia anymore. I used to be a sysop there whilst it was very new because most of the things that needed doing didn't require any knowledge of the language; reporting bugs with the R-&gt;L interface, reverting vandalism on the main page etc. When it became big enough to look after itself, and got some Arabic-speaking admins, I de-adminned myself and focused more on looking after some of the small ones that still don't have sysops. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 05:02, May 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Howdy. Playing about with an offline copy of the en namespace, I've discovered a number of articles with identical titles. For example the database contains four articles named "Goblet_of_Fire", each with a unique cur_id. Scouting about you seem to be a SQL-friendly admin who may be in a position to correct this. Let me know if you're interested and I'll pass on details. - <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopbanana_c4c6.html" title="User:Topbanana">TB</a> 15:17, 26 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Angela,</p>
<p>The word <i>Wiktionary</i> could be safely translated into ìí¤ë±ë§ì¬ì  in Korean, so that the Wiktionary namespace <i>wants</i> to be called so as well the sub-text at the top of the page, which you mentioned. I don't know, whether changing the Wiktionary namespace would effect also on the button (i.e. Wiktionaryë) at the bottom of the page where about Wiktionary is in general informed. Thanks for your friendly help. --17:18, 26 May 2004 (UTC) <a href="http://ko.wiktionary.org/wiki/ì¬ì©ìí ë¡ :ìí" class="external text" title="http://ko.wiktionary.org/wiki/ì¬ì©ìí ë¡ :ìí" rel="nofollow">ìí(A-heun)</a></p>

<p>Hi Angela, sorry to bother you but one person (begins with A ends in Y) is now pestering me and trying to wind me up, so far i have tried to stay calm and i certainly havent given a personal attack on this person BUT he continues to delete my work from the Brum page like the middle part of my hip hop section and the links to places of interest. He has deleted my conversation to him and he was warned by another user, now he is reverting the text i deleted from my user page, i don't have anything to hide but i just didnt want it there until i can figure out something more informative about wikipedia, why is this person deleting and now tinkering with my own user page??? Thanks if you can help as i am finding wikipedia quite eliteist from some members at the present and i don't know what to do? Someone even blocked me because i deleted MY own work from the brum page out of frustration, i do want it kept as it was too much hard work but...</p>

<p>I had only just heard about it when I mentioned it to a couple of people on IRC, and that must be how you heard about it. The story is this: the people from the Golden Nica awards want to do a short film about each winner, and so they wanted to know if they could come here and film me doing my work.</p>
<p>But of course, me doing my work here is a very boring thing to watch. &#160;:-)</p>
<p>So I suggested that they film some of our meetings in Europe, as these will be the first time many of us meet, and it's really a big deal for our community as community. They liked the idea, and there you go.</p>
<p>They were planning to meet me at the airport and film me arriving, but the schedule did not work out. But I guess they will be filming me some at Cherry Court Hotel, and then going to our meetup.</p>
<p>You are right that people should know before they show up, in case they are fugitives or whatever.&#160;;-) But I think that almost no one will ever see the film, it's just for the awards ceremony I think. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 10:10, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, Angela, for a couple of things. First, people have been saying "make 'em bigger, make 'em bigger" without saying <i>how much</i> bigger. And I refuse to weigh in with a 1.3Mb picture. My standard large image is 4" wide, but it's just as easy to do 300px wide. If 400px is no problem, I'll even go there. I just don't want to be making it impossible for people with more modest machine resources to have memory issues. Second, thanks for the support on this image. I could go back to the top of that hill and live than moment forever. Good luck on the election - my vote is cast and I'm going to be disappointed if you don't win. Denni</p>

<p>On the eve of probably becoming an admin, I thought I'd finally figure out some of those things I'd never quite figured out. Buuuuuut--I haven't completely managed to sort out the whole namespace thing. After reading the descriptions of the Mediawiki and Wikipedia namespaces, I still don't get why there's some wiki-related humor in both; why there are categorized lists of wikipedians in both; nor how to search in any specific namespace. For example, I know that there are humor pages about wiki/wikipedia/wiki articles in the Wikipedia namespace. I can't find them. I don't know how to search for them, apparently. I would move The Web Encyclopedia Song to one of the namespaces but I'm not convinced which is really the best location to move it to. Anything you can point me to on any of these issues that will help me sort it all out?

<p>for your well-wishes during my wikivacation. I appreciate your comments, especially as it is you who have (with a few others) been the model I have sought to follow as a Wikipedian since arriving here. I wish you the best of luck in the current election, and hope you know that, regardless of the results, you are much appreciated in this place: without you, we would be much diminished. I hope you will consider these few words my inadequate expression of thanks, not just for a kind note left on my talk page, but for all the occasions I have received good advice from you, or learned how to deal with difficult situations by observing your approach to them.

<p>Hi Angela, thanks for the info message on <a href="../../../j/r/d/User_talk%7EJrdioko_1b04.html" title="User talk:Jrdioko">my talk</a>. I had a quick admin question that I wanted to run by you. I see on <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a> that several sysops have protected their user pages for obvious reasons. I planned to do this as well, but I wanted to ask if there would be any problem with protecting <a href="../../../j/r/w/Template%7EJrwm_b28d.html" title="Template:Jrwm">Template:Jrwm</a> and <a href="../../../j/r/w/Template%7EJrwma_a08e.html" title="Template:Jrwma">Template:Jrwma</a> as well. These are templates I use in welcoming new users, and are quite specific to me like the subpages are. I assume there's no problem with these protections, but I want to take my first admin actions nice and slow so I thought I'd ask first.

<p>Your (brief) Klingon self-introduction at <a href="http://tlh.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Angela" class="extiw" title="tlh:User:Angela">tlh:User:Angela</a> is grammatically incorrect.

<p>There are also a lot of people offering places to stay over night (if we find time to sleep at all&#160;;-) Elian and me will stay at Necrophorus place. I think there are still many offers open.</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>First, I must say that I'm very impressed from the work you did. How did you avoid the need to sleep and eat&#160;;-)?</p>
<p>I do not understand some of the changes you did to article I worked on. Why did you remove the link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_publications_in_science.html" title="List of publications in science">list of publications in science</a> from <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>. It seems to be the most suitable place for it.</p>
<p>Removing the word important form the title is ok but not required. There are many publications. We should not list all of them. On the other hand, the importance of the publications is implicit so the new title might be better.</p>

<p>I'm a bit late in joining in the congratulations, but I'm someone who had very little doubt that you would win. I divided my vote between very good candidates for the other position, but I did not see anyone more worthy than you in the position you have been elected to. (I was relieved when you chose not to run for both positions, because this allowed me to vote for someone else besides you).

<p>May I offer a wee smile that an anti-deletionist has a deletion bot? A kind smile, of course&#160;: ). A suggestion - /ng/, as you have no need for me to tell you, is always hard, unless followed by e or i, and since your name has a handy 'e'... That way, /ang(er)/bot (or 'angst'bot, as if...) becomes /ange(la)/bot. I hope you come to love your little bot too. She is doing an important job, and it is better that bots do the vandal-erasing than humans.

<p>hope Angela, that your return trip was fine and that you are full of energy. We missed you on IRC yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Since you are british, let me tell you a little story that happened yesterday evening. When results were officially announced, Jimbo nicely came to on the french channel to tell us. The channel was rather quiet then, probably because it was in the middle of the football match. I was busy with the kids, so was not much around when he got there first.</p>
<p>While I was near the computer, I heard it bipping, and came around the screen. I saw the results were official. While I was answering to Jimbo and thanking people, my husband got a champaign bottle he had hidden in the fridge, called the kids so that we could all have a drink together. I must say that my husband is at the same time very proud and totally in despair. So, he said he was celebrating the position, and me leaving the family. My daughter took it for granted, and I had to spend a good while with her later on, as she was crying in her bed&#160;:-(<br />
Anyway... just as he was putting the wine in the 4 glasses (yup, the kids had some too), there was a horrendous tremor in the whole appartment, and screams in the street. The people in the appartment above were making a pogo danse above our head. And some ceiling parts fell on our carpet, just next to the glasses. I thought "this is probably football good news for french team". I looked on the irc screen, and yes it was the penalty. We just had the time to pick up the glasses, while a second earth quake occurred (the long lasting consequences of the penalty), but fortunately with no damage this time&#160;:-)</p>
<p>There is a french/celtic saying, reported in belgian <a href="../../../a/s/t/Ast%C3%A9rix.html" title="AstÃ©rix">AstÃ©rix</a> books "Nous n'avons peur que d'une chose, que le ciel nous tombe sur la tÃªte" (we only fear that sky fall on our heads). Yesterday, litteraly, sky fell on my head&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Of course, before I say anything else, congratulations on your election: you've taken enough compliments from me in the past few months to imagine how pleased I am that you will be representing the masses on the Board. Good luck.</p>
<p>On a completely unrelated topic, I am wondering if you will offer me your thoughts concerning a trip I will soon be taking? I am <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeymoon.html" title="Honeymoon">honeymooning</a> in <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutland.html" title="Rutland">Rutland</a> in mid-July for a week (after which a few days in London), and my fiancee and I are not very familiar with that part of England. We will be without a car (can't swing it financially), and so will be wholly dependent on public transport and walking to get from place to place -- we don't know what sights would be best worth seeing, as guidebooks over here tend to be long on descriptions of the big cities and relatively short on the quiet rural areas. I asked advice from <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay</a> when I was at his talk page for other reasons, thinking for some reason he was English -- he informed me that, as a Scot, he really can't advise much at all, but suggested three Wikipedians who he thinks live closest to Rutland. I know you best of the three, and I've recently intervened in a dispute between the other two (I do think they both still like me, but it's always hard to say), so I've decided to ask you first. Certainly I don't want you to go to any trouble on my account, but if there is anything you can think of that might be good to see (or if you have any tips on using public buses in England), it would be more than welcome. A note here, on my talk page, or emailed to me, would be very fine, and if you don't have time (with your new responsibilities, etc.) please don't worry about leaving anything like an explanation -- we'll have a wonderful trip regardless, I am sure. Thanks for whatever help you can provide, and congratulations once again on your new position. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:17, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Angela,</p>
<p>there is a technical knotty point on ko wikipedia as well as wiktionary. Since days the namespace "wikipedia" is suddenly there instead of the ko-translation of it. All pages which have the namespace ìí¤ë°±ê³¼ resp. ìí¤ë±ë§ì¬ì  appear empty. Would you check up it (see e.g. <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC:%EB%8F%84%EC%9B%80%EB%A7%90" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC:%EB%8F%84%EC%9B%80%EB%A7%90" rel="nofollow">ko help page</a>). --12:31, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC) <a href="http://ko.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90%ED%86%A0%EB%A1%A0:%EC%95%84%ED%9D%94" class="external text" title="http://ko.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90%ED%86%A0%EB%A1%A0:%EC%95%84%ED%9D%94" rel="nofollow">ìí(A-heun)</a></p>

<dd>Well, I've been informed it was at his request. I'm a little troubled, though. I found one of his edits in a page history and it was credited to "Former user", which apparently was at his request also. The problem is, when I try to view Former user's contribs, they don't show up -- must be a database thing. But it makes me very edgy as to how this works under the GFDL -- it's now impossible to track Grazingship's contributions. If we found out he'd been adding copyvios, I see no easy way of finding them and excising them. I don't know...the whole thing is a little disturbing. I'm surprised there wasn't more discussion somewhere for such an unusual request that has such important impact. Do you have any thoughts on the matter you'd be willing to share with me? I wouldn't ask, but as my rep on the board (you'll probably get tired of hearing that soon!) I figure you've been thinking about issues like licensing and angry users, so maybe you've considered this. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:35, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your comments make perfect sense -- thanks for taking the time to explain. I would agree that it's something the community doesn't need involvement in...as long as we can retain the kind of "formeruser1" identity you mentioned. If someone's choosing to do this eliminates any way of tracking their edits systematically, then I think that's an important enough problem to have the community discuss it in the abstract, though once a policy was agreed on, I imagine we could stay out of individual cases. Your point, though, that it's just someone choosing to be anonymous, has definite merit -- if we can keep those contributions together somehow, that would be ideal.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>thanks to you, Andy Mabbett and G- man i am still here on Wikipedia and it gets more intrigueing by the week, <i>people are strange when your a stranger</i> as Jim Morrison sang and Wikipedia is a perfec example.</p>
<p>So one question, obviously your photo is there to see for one n all and it possibly only enhances your port folio here if most of your wiki admirers were to be honest but... do you actually read all your questions on here and do you work full time, (are you angeling for a position on Wikipedia)??? i wonder this as i find it very difficult myself working full time and revisiting forums, web sites, email addresses and so on with peoples comments to me let alone responding and keeping up with my own life and anti-internet activities. I have tried talking about Wikipedia to friends and they find me quite strange for it so i keep it to myself now, i think it is healthy to keep a foot in every door you may ramble across as you never know when you may need to use that particular exit.. i<i>shut up now as i may be drunk!!! <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 22:57, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)</i> p.s. thanks to G-man for providing me with info on how to sign with the four ~'s</p>

<dd>I am reading this Saturday despite people running about moving boxes around me. I'd better go now or they're going to pack me into the van... <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 10:21, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After some though and lots of time I finally found out how to reply to your comment on <a href="../../../c/l/e/Template_talk%7ECleanup_e794.html" title="Template talk:Cleanup">Template talk:Cleanup</a>.

<dd>Thanks for letting me know. It seems a fair argument. I'll be interested to see if anyone does object. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 18:44, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that <a href="../../../p/i/c/Template%7EPic_of_the_day_Archive_8921.html" title="Template:Pic of the day/Archive">Template:Pic of the day/Archive</a> has the archive of which pics have been used, and I also would like to see an archive of the actual pages that you compose in the postcard-like format that gets used in expanding {{pic of the day}}. Maybe you could just add links to them to <a href="../../../p/i/c/Template%7EPic_of_the_day_Archive_8921.html" title="Template:Pic of the day/Archive">Template:Pic of the day/Archive</a>&#160;? I really like the presentations that you compose to complement the images. - <a href="../../../b/e/v/User%7EBevo_cf25.html" title="User:Bevo">Bevo</a> 14:10, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
