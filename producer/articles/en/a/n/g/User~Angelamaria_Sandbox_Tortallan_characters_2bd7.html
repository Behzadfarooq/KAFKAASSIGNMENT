<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelamaria_Sandbox_Tortallan_characters_2bd7.html" title="Edit section: Alanna of Trebond and Olau">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alanna of Trebond and Olau</span></h2>
<p>Alanna has always dreamed of becoming a female knight, and her chance came when she and her twin brother Thom decide to trade places, allowing <i>her</i> to become the knight. She hides her true sex and trains with the rest of the knights-in-training, and befriends, among others, <a href="#Jonathan_of_Cont.C3.A9" title="">Jonathan of Conté</a>, the heir to the throne of Tortall, and <a href="#George_Cooper" title="">George Cooper</a>, the King of Thieves. The latter had seen her with his Sight, and had loked for her since her entrance into Corus.</p>
<p>The friendship doesn't go to waste. Ralon of Malven tries to pick on her while at court, and she refuses to let her new friends fight for her. She keeps quiet about Ralon's obvious bullying, and turns instead to George in order to learn hand combat and streetfighting in secret. She finally defeats Ralon, who leaves court. George later on finds out her true sex from her, but promises to keep the knowledge to himself.</p>
<p>Alanna has always been reluctant to use her powers, unlike her twin, so when the mysterious Sweating Sickness came over the capital to strike down inhabitants and drain healers, she kept knowledge of her Gift to herself until Jonathan himself fell sick. With the palace healers drained and a mutual friend dead from the sickness, Alanna finally emerges with her Gift, and brings Jon back from between life and death -- inadvertently showing her real sex to Sir Myles of Olau, who decide to let her keep her secret a secret and not tell her what he found out. The whole ordeal, however, has shown Alanna that she must heal in order to replace the lives that she will extinguish later on when she succeeds in becoming a lady knight.</p>
<p>Suspicious of Jonathan's uncle Roger, who comes to Corus shortly after the Sickness to train all Gifted pages and squires in the use of their Gift, Alanna keeps close, if secret, guard for the prince especially during the visit to Persopolis, where they were forced to battle a group of immortals called the Ysandir. Jon shortly after made her his squire, even though her true sex was revealed to him during the battle.</p>
<p>George very shortly after showed her indications of his having feelings for her, which she tried to ignore. Much later on, Jon himself realizes that she is a woman, and Alanna gets into a relationship with him.</p>
<p>After her knighthood, she was forced to fight Roger, defeating him but revealing her true sex in the process. Against the wishes of her friends, shortly after this she leaves and travels with Coram, her manservant and foot soldier. She goes to the Bazhir desert, where she soon gets adopted by a tribe. After being forced to defend herself and her honor by killing the resident shaman in a duel, she stays on to be the temporary shaman and teach prospective new shamans.</p>
<p>Jon and her friend/mentor Myles of Olau visit her during her stay as shaman. Myles adopts her as his own daughter, and among other concerns, Jon proposes marriage, believing the answer to be evident; but she turns him down. Angered, Jon goes back to Corus and Myles is forced to follow. Alanna leaves as well and meets up with George at Port Caynn (?), who is quelling a thieves rebellion there. During the long stay there, Alanna soon turns to George and they become involved, realizing that it should have happened long ago.</p>
<p>Alanna's traveling days aren't over yet, though, and she leaves again to travel to the Roof of the World to obtain the Dominion Jewel to give to Jon and prove her worthiness as a knight to all the rest. Along the way, she meets up and gets involved with <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lioness_Rampant_3b3d.html#Characters" title="Lioness Rampant">Liam Ironarm</a>, the Shang Dragon. She also brings along with her <a href="#Thayet_jian_Wilima" title="">Thayet jian Wilima</a> and her maidservant and guard <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lioness_Rampant_3b3d.html#Characters" title="Lioness Rampant">Buriram Tourakom</a>, who are fleeing Saraine.</p>
<p>Once she reaches home, she has discovered that a lot of things have happened since losing touch with Tortall: King Roald and his queen are dead and Jonathan is preparing for his coronation; and impulsive, proud Thom has resurrected her old nemesis, Roger, who finally strikes during Jon's coronation. Thom dies, his Gift corrupted, and she is forced to duel with her old friend Alex of Tirragen to the death, before she reaches Roger, who is just waiting for the whole of Tortall to fall apart in massive earthquakes. She kills him.</p>
<p>Alanna is also appointed King's Champion, and marries George who is now the Baron of Pirate's Swoop and Royal Spymaster. They have three children: Thom, the eldest, and the twins Alan and Alianne. Her title calls her frequently from her home, however, and she later on befriends Daine, a wild mage who greatly helps Tortall battle the immortals that break lose into the mortal world.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelamaria_Sandbox_Tortallan_characters_2bd7.html" title="Edit section: George Cooper">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">George Cooper</span></h2>
<p>The King of Thieves, George is common-born and has had to keep his wits about him, although having the Sight makes it easier for him to keep his throne. He first sights <a href="#Alanna_of_Trebond_and_Olau" title="">Alanna</a> as Alan in Corus, and keeps an eye out for her first visit to the city -- and once she does, he shows up. George and the page Alan become friends and he teaches her streetfighting to help her win her first battle with an insolent court page, named <a href="../../../t/h/e/Alanna%7E_The_First_Adventure_6d70.html#Characters" title="Alanna: The First Adventure">Ralon of Malven</a>. Alan also introduces him to her friends at court, notably "Johnny", who he recognizes as <a href="#Jonathan_of_Cont.C3.A9" title="">Prince Jonathan</a>. He wins her trust, and in repayment, she turns to him for help and reveals that she is actually a girl. He is shocked, but keeps her secret.</p>
<p>He falls in love with her soon after, but is forced to stop any advances when he sees that she is in love with Jon and that the latter returns her feelings. He is kept busy with renegade thieves, and travels to Port Caynn (?), where he later meets up with Alanna, who has broken off with Jon and soon realizes that they should be together.</p>
<p>After Alanna leaves again for her Dominion Jewel quest, George has no time to pine as the Rogues seem to be even more aggressive. He hunts down a thief named Claw who wishes to unseat him from his throne at the Court of the Rogue and is killing innocent thieves and people in the process. He learns that Claw was once Ralon, and that he was involved in a plot to assassinate the incoming King Jon. Torn between his Court's law (never to turn over a fellow thief) and his friendship with Jon, he hides himself and chooses to stand by Jon. Jon repays him by granting him a Royal Pardon (as King of Thieves, he may be punished if caught) and the Baronetcy of Pirate's Swoop, which is usually given to the Royal Spymaster. He later on helps protect Jon during the attack during the latter's coronation.</p>
<p>After the coronation, Jon puts him to work as the new Royal Spymaster, and he becomes busy both with his new responsibilities and with setting up Pirate's Swoop properly -- after which, he comes for Alanna in the Bazhir desert and asks her to marry him. She accepts, and they have three children: Thom, and the twins Alan and Alianne. He continues to serve Tortall as Spymaster together with Myles of Olau.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelamaria_Sandbox_Tortallan_characters_2bd7.html" title="Edit section: Jonathan of Conté">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jonathan of Conté</span></h2>
<p>Jonathan is the only son of King Roald and Queen Lianne, who makes friends with the page <a href="#Alanna_of_Trebond_and_Olau" title="">Alan</a> and the King of Thieves, <a href="#George_Cooper" title="">George Cooper</a>. His friendship with both proves to shape his life in a significant way: he finds out that Alan is really a girl named Alanna, and falls in love with her; and George teaches him of a different way of ruling from his peacemaker father.</p>
<p>Gifted and trained by his uncle Roger, he refuses to suspect the latter of any wrongdoing, even positive that Roger sent them to battle the dangerous immortals the Ysandir because his uncle knew he could do it. Naturally interested in the kingdom that he is bound to rule, he asks Ali Mukhtab, the governor of Persopolis, to create written text about the history of the Bazhir tribes.</p>
<p>Later on, he picks Alanna as his squire and later has a relationship with her. His eyes are opened to his uncle's evil plans, which are to kill the royal family, but Alanna, forced to fight the older man, later on feels compelled to leave court.</p>
<p>After a space of missing her, he goes after her in the Bazhir desert. In addition, he meets with Ali Mukhtab who has finished the text, and s actually the Voice of the Tribes, a man who connects all Bazhir tribes. Ali wishes him to be the next Voice, and he is soon adopted by the Bazhir. He goes through numerous lessons with the dying Voice, kept alive only by Alanna and the Bazhir shamans, but the power of the Voice is successfully transferred over to him, where he is simultaneously himself as well as all the tribes and peoples of the Bazhir.</p>
<p>However, he has grown a little cocky, expects that Alanna would accept his marriage proposal right off. She doesn't, and he leaves her and tries to get into the social scene back at court, entertaining one Princess Josiane of the Copper Isles.</p>
<p>However, the premature deaths of his parents force him into early responsibility, as well as the shock of Thom resurrecting Roger. The people whisper that his reign is cursed, but good news await: Alanna has found the Dominion Jewel and is bringing it back to Tortall. He finds out that she also brought back <a href="#Thayet_jian_Wilima" title="">Princess Thayet</a> of Saraine, and starts to fall in love with her. He appoints Alanna as the King's Champion, and learns from George that an assassination attempt is well under way. He then readies George for the position of Royal Spymaster once he takes the throne.</p>
<p>On the coronation, once Jon has been crowned, Tortall is shaken by massive earthquakes. Tied to the land, Jon tries to keep the land knit together by the sheer force of his own Gift, the magic/power of the land itself which is tied to him as its King, and his Bazhir desert magic. Alanna sends him the Dominion Jewel, and he is also sent her own Gift. Thus, holding on to the land with numerous Gifts, he waits until Alanna kills Roger deep in the palace catacombs, and the massive earthquakes stop.</p>
<p>He weds Thayet and rules over Tortall as King Jonathan III. Later on, in the battle against the immortals and Carthak, he is forced to send a peace treaty to Carthak, and while the peace treaty is later signed, the barrier between the mortal world and the world of the immortals melt away and he is forced to fight apart from his wife -- she in Corus while he is in Port Legann. They have two children, Roald and Kalasin.</p>
