<p>I noted that you said that you would support an AfD attempt for this article. I am currently trying to decide whether it is worth it to try. I am mostly trying to decide what is wrong with the article that can be presented to other voters. Specifically, I can think of a few things: fair use image violation, original research, speculation, off-topic (cites book for film synopsis), verging on patent nonsense, and innappropriate tone. All of those are well and good, but I don't know how to word that so that other won't dismiss the reasoning ("It's a film synopsis of one of the greatest films ever. <i>Keep</i>") What do you think? — <a href="../../../s/c/m/User%7EScm83x_dc0d.html" title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/m/User_talk%7EScm83x_0490.html" title="User talk:Scm83x">hook 'em</a></sup> 19:39, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think we should keep "patent nonsense" out of it, because it's nowhere near Wikipedia's definition of that. People will say the excessive use of fair-use images can be solved by removing them, deleting the whole article isn't necessary for that. I think an AFD should focus on the fact that it's original research (almost entirely one single user's personal interpretation) and that it's unencyclopedic: it's not an encyclopedia article about the film (we already have one), it's an extremely detailed summary of the film. We also have to point out that it's already been moved out of the main article, which was getting too long, or else people will vote "merge" into the main article. I'm also tempted to say it comes close to infringing the copyright of the film because it's so detailed no one who reads the article needs to see the film (at least as far as the plot is concerned, of course this synopsis is no replacement for the audiovisual atmosphere of the movie). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 19:53, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>OK, I think the language to use would be similar to the fair use argument: "The article's content infringes on the ability of the copyright holder to effectively market his work."

<dd>Wikipedia's founder, Jimbo Wales, has described original research as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase "original research" originated primarily as a practical means to deal with physics cranks, of which of course there are a number on the Web. The basic concept is as follows: It can be quite difficult for us to make any valid judgment as to whether a particular thing is <i>true</i> or not. It isn't appropriate for us to try to determine whether someone's novel theory of physics is valid; we aren't really equipped to do that. But what we <i>can</i> do is check whether or not it actually has been published in reputable journals or by reputable publishers. So it's quite convenient to avoid judging the credibility of things by simply sticking to things that have been judged credible by people much better equipped to decide. The exact same principle will hold true for history" <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-December/017557.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-December/017557.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history. <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-December/017591.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-December/017591.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<dd>If the content there is based on previously published research by other people, the article needs to do a much better job of showing that. It also needs to be written in the tone of an encyclopedia article reporting on other people's research, along the lines of "Smith has argued XYZ, while Jones has countered ABC". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 17:16, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You --"Contested PROD. Original reasoning was "Personal essay and interpration of film. This article violates core policies Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view by definition." To that I would add that the large number of "fair use" images, as well as the fact that every single scene of the film is described in detail, infringes on the copyright of the film. The content of this article has been moved out of 2001: A space Odyssey (film) because the main article is too long. For this reason (and because the content itself is inappropriate per the above arguments), merging the content back into the main article is not a viable option.

<p>Given the arguments <i>above</i> "the above arguments," why are you saying OR? -- Jason Palpatine speak your mind</p>

<dd>Because you still haven't shown that the analyses you give come from other people. Simply listing some reference works without saying who says what isn't sufficient.

<dd>The article is a sub-article branched off from the main article. The souces were/are listed in the main article. The branch off was done on account of the main being listed as too big and recomended for split. I thought the source info being <i>there</i> made listing them <i>here</i> inappropriate. In response to your above arguments, have now listed them with the article. But I am limited -- I do not know/comprehend the procedure to set up references links. (I've been to the instuctions page and it made me dizzy) Also, as this article is a description of the film events, the film itself IS the primary souce and by the title referenced.

<p>Hi, I've just noticed that you removed the deleted <a href="../../../b/a/k/Image%7EBakisair.jpg_2a54.html" title="Image:Bakisair.jpg">Image:Bakisair.jpg</a>, an image which I originally uploaded, from the <a href="../../../b/%C3%A2/k/B%C3%A2k%C3%AE.html" title="Bâkî">Bâkî</a> article.</p>
<p>This is perfectly fine, insofar as the image no longer exists on Wikipedia. However, what I would like to know is, <b>why was it deleted</b>? I was never notified of the deletion (as I believe I should have been for an image which I uploaded), and anyhow full source information was given for the image, and the image was in any case long out of copyright (being approximately 400 years old). If you don't know the answer to why it was deleted, could you possibly point me to a place where I could find out?</p>

<dd>It didn't have a copyright tag. Images without copyright tags can be deleted within 7 days of being labeled as lacking a copyright tag. Notifying the uploader upon labeling the image as lacking a copyright tag is a courtesy that isn't observed as often as it should be. If it was in the public domain by virtue of being that old, it should have had {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old_4083.html" title="Template:PD-old">PD-old</a>}} on it. As I recall, the source info said what book the image was scanned from, but not who the original artist was, so there was no way to determine whether the image was really as old as it looked or whether it was a recent painting made in an old-fashioned style. You're welcome to upload it again, but this time it would be better to give the original artist's name and dates (with a link if he has an article on Wikipedia) in addition to the book the image was scanned from. And of course add the {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old_4083.html" title="Template:PD-old">PD-old</a>}} tag! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 12:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since the image is gone now, and I cannot remember all the way back to March 31, I cannot confirm this, but I doubt that it lacked some sort of copyright tag (though perhaps I chose a slightly wrong one from the drop-down list) inasmuch as, as you can perhaps induce from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Saposcat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Saposcat" rel="nofollow">my log</a>, I am always assiduous in the placing of copyright tags (though again, occasionally I may choose a slightly wrong tag from the somewhat confusing list, I admit).</dd>

<dd>As for the original artist, he/she is unknown, as were the vast majority of artists at that time and place. However, it was most definitely <b>not</b> "a recent painting made in an old-fashioned style".</dd>

<dd>I will be uploading it again, and will be careful to place the {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old_4083.html" title="Template:PD-old">PD-old</a>}} tag (though again, I doubt that I failed to do so the first time). Of course, I won't be putting the artist's name and dates (perhaps "Artist unknown" or "Anonymous" would do), for the very clear reasons stated above. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 12:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I am an admin at Hindi wiki, but not at English. I have an urgent request: Please add certain characters to the English wiki's Insert toolbox. They are very urgent and are required again and again for India related articles, which are in thousands. The characters are <a href="../../../i/a/s/IAST_856a.html" title="IAST">IAST</a>: ṛ Ṛ ṃ Ṃ ṭ Ṭ ḍ Ḍ ṇ Ṇ ṣ Ṣ (the minimum set; there are some more), and IPA: t̪ d̪ n̪ (or simply the subscrit ̪ for the dental consonants, and a suitable superscrit tilda that can be placed on any vowel-sign to indicate nasalization). It is good to find a linguist here--I too have linguistics as a hobby. It pains me very much that languages with few thousands of active speakers have filled up half of the insert box, but the ones with hundreds of millions of speakers (like Hindi) dont have any place yet.

<p>I apologise for not providing the image's source! I'm not entirely sure how to classify it, since I scanned the image from a publication that promotes and advertises underwear, but I don't have a subscription to it (it was a one-time affair), so I have no recollection of the publication's name because I only kept a few images of my liking and discarded the rest. Perhaps a fair use tag would be more appropriate? Or I could replace the image in question with one possessing a known source. Thank you for notifying me of my mistake!

It would be nice, if you had a spare moment that is, to review some of the other edits/uploads of that particular user. I gave up trying communicate with him a long time ago. He uploaded a raft of images from photobucket and scattered them throughout the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megadeth.html" title="Megadeth">Megadeth</a> article. Over the past months his edits have been rv'd by many users and the talk page concensus is that his additions are not wanted. But to no avail. Many attempts have been made to reason with him but he ignores them and keeps replacing his pics. He has ben blocked for 3RR at least once for doing that. There is an anon IP that shows up periodically with similar edits to his. An ARIN lookup indicates that the IP is located in the Caribbean.(and I am just assuming that it's the same user based on the edit history...mainly adding Spanish spam links) Perhaps it is a simple language issue?

<dd>If he continually uploads images with bogus licenses, after being warned not to, he can be blocked for doing that. Some admins will block people just for being a PITA (falls under the heading "exhausting the community's patience"), but I personally do that very rarely. If there's a fair number of people getting annoyed by his behavior, I'd recommend starting an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> to get some outside views. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 07:12, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the tip. I wouldn't normally take note of his edits but that page is in my watchlist and pops up quite frequently in my VandalProof window. His edits are sporadic sometimes only 1 day a week. There's lots of Users/Anons who comment on him. If I see it turning into a drawn out edit war, I'll recommend an RfC.

<dd>Just following up on the user in question. He returned today and, as expected, rv'd against concensus on the the main article. He also removed a copyvio tag from an uploaded image. I tried reading his explaination on the image...it is very poorly written. To my best guess the user believes that the owner of the photobucket "album" is actually the photographer who took the photo.(which is highly unlikely) My suspicions, based on what is written, is that English is not the user's first language. So far his edits have not been rv'd...I expect they will be sooner or later. I am not sure an RfC on this would make much difference. He has not shown any respect towards too many Wiki-policies up to this point. It's too bad as some of his contributions have been semi-valid. Is there a spanish speaking administrator(as mentioned above...that's just a guess based on similar IP edits) who can reason with the user so that he doesn't alienate himself completely? Just wondering. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnger22_483f.html" title="User:Anger22">Anger22</a> 22:08, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know of one off the top of my head, but I doubt it makes a difference. I suspect he doesn't <i>want</i> to understand why the images are not acceptable, and telling him so in Spanish isn't going to change that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 06:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Mr. Angr,<br />
I am Soso from Georgia (Europe) and I would like to ask you if it is ok to use <b>html</b> tags to create an article. For example to use <b>&lt; table &gt; ....&lt;/ table &gt;</b> tag instead of using a typical wikipedia infobox. I am not familiar with the wikipedia system yet and please write if you find time for it.<br />

<p>Hi, just wanted to mention that I think you should use a little bit of dicression when speedying stuff under I4, sometimes the images are <b>very</b> easy to identify and fix (albumcovers logos etc), the uploader may simply have picked the "don't know" option because they are not familiar with Wikipedia or whatever. Deleting them is perfectly in line with policy naturaly, but IMHO it's only common sense to salvage things that can be fixed even if they technicaly fulfill a speedy deletion criterea. We should not spend hours investigating things naturaly, but if you see a logo, albumcover, screenshot and simmilar tagged as no license/source take a few seconds to check the article they where used on, 9 times out of 10 it takes no effort at all to identify the primary source source (logo/cover/screenshot of/from X) and apply the corect tag. You are not obligated to fix such images naturaly, but you are not obligated to delete them either, so if something looks salvagable but you don't feel like looking into it right then consider just skipping it and leave it for someone else to sort out rater than just deleting.</p>
<p>The reason I mention it is that I fixed the tagging and added source to <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_Image%7ESongs_In_The_Key_Of_Eh%21.jpg_2dac.html" title="Special:Undelete/Image:Songs In The Key Of Eh!.jpg">Image:Songs In The Key Of Eh!.jpg</a> and removed the "no license" tag (it was an albumcover) only to have you speedy delete it 8 minutes later as I4. Now I'm not blaming you for not noticing my edit, you probably opened a bunch of tabs and worked your way though them, I do the same myself (think that may be worth a bug report, you should get a warning if you hit the delete button if the page have been edited since you loaded it). However as I mentioned that image was an example of something that is blatantly easy to fix without resorting to deletion. Takes a wee bit longer, but "unnessesary" deletions often anoy people even if they are done by following policy to the letter. Just a thought. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 07:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if it sounds like I'm implying that you don't use good judgement when processing image deletions, a quick glance at your contribs indicates that you do. That one example probably gave me a slightly bad "first impression" of you, and when I start typing a message I tend to get long winded and over explain things (might even come across as patronising, sorry if I do). Still a reminder to think twise defore deleting never hurt I guess, hope I can remember to do it myself too&#160;:P --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 07:41, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you mean, although in the case of "Songs In The Key Of Eh!" I notice you still didn't add a source even though you added a copyright tag, so technically it was still speediable. I <i>do</i> use discretion when it comes to images that are both (1) used in articles and (2) pretty obviously user-made, in which case I will replace the "unsourced" or "unlicensed" tag with {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-presumed_1b70.html" title="Template:GFDL-presumed">GFDL-presumed</a>}}. But when it comes to fair use images, I'd rather just delete them than spend time tracking down their source and the appropriate fair-use tag, especially since if I do, then <i>I'm</i> the one responsible for writing a fair-use rationale. And since I personally am opposed to the presence of fair-use images on Wikipedia anyway, I'm really not inclined to do that! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 08:09, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rosa-Luxemburg-Strasse and Ebertstrasse are <b>not</b> incorrect spellings. They are the correct spellings written in the standard Roman alphabet. The German digraph "ß" is not used in English, and this is the English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:49, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They are incorrect spellings, because the streets have only German names.

<p>This is very tiresome, and a typical example of Wikipedia competitive uber-pedantry. There is only one spelling of "strasse" - s-t-r-a-s-s-e. This is not a matter of spelling, it is solely a question of how letters are written. The use of "β" for "ss" is a German orthographic convention, not a different spelling. It is not a convention used outside Germany and Austria, and is not recognised by the great majority of English-readers. They will read it as "strabe." Using it is an insult to readers and is just a form of showing off by Wikipedia editors. Arguing for the use of "β" in the English Wikipedia on the grounds that "they write it that way in Germany" is the same as arguing that Beijing ought to be written "北京" because they write it that way in China. Or perhaps we ought to write all German placenames in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraktur_%28typeface%29.html" title="Fraktur (typeface)">Gothic script</a>? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:37, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry to butt in here. Just happened to notice this discussion. I happen to be a translator, scholar of various German topics, and someone familiar with the publishing world. Trust me: you're both correct (and incorrect). Transliteration conventions are matters of "house style" in the publishing world. <i>Scientific American</i>, for example, actually does use Chinese characters for the names of its Chinese authors (which I find bizarre). Other publishing houses (though not many) won't even accept <i>naïve</i> (even though it's in Webster's and most British dictionaries). "β" is somewhere between Chinese characters and "ï". The vast majority of academic publishers, especially when publishing books about things German, would spell <i>Ebertstraβe</i> "Ebertstraβe". Many (if not most -- not sure here) non-academic publishers would spell it with the double-s. So... this matter should perhaps be brought up for discussion in one of WP's policy forums in order to set Wikipedia's "house style". --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 07:35, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To me it's clear Wikipedia should follow the example of academic publishers then. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> about pandering to the lowest common denominator. Until Adam deleted it, there was a note at the top saying "The title of this article contains the character <a href="../../../%C3%9F/_/_/%C3%9F.html" title="ß">ß</a>. Where it is unavailable or not desired, the name may be represented as Ebertstrasse." Because there's a link to <a href="../../../%C3%9F/_/_/%C3%9F.html" title="ß">ß</a>, people unfamiliar with that character can click on it and read all about it, and will have learned something new! (That is the point of an encyclopedia, isn't it?) Having it at <a href="../../../e/b/e/Ebertstrasse.html" title="Ebertstrasse">Ebertstrasse</a> simply increases ignorance, because that is not the street's name in English (the English name, if it had one, would be Ebert Street) or German (except in Switzerland). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 08:34, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr, JackLumber here, about to start a much needed improvement, repair, and remodeling of the above-mentioned article. My first edit will only change the layout, shucking off the table format (which makes the page very hard to maintain), with no content changes for the sake of clarity. But in the meantime I will factor the regional tables into main dialect areas—as you know, such a classification can be questionable anyway you slice it; my idea is New England, Mid-Atlantic, North, Midland, South, and West, just not to stray too far from <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_regional_differences_b08e.html" title="American English regional differences">American English regional differences</a>, although the distribution pattern of lexical and phonological differences is definitely not the same. Alternately we can completely get rid of the "Midland" (somewhat troublesome) and lay out a more "geographical" classification. Anyways, drop by if you got the time and please let me know what you would change or change it yourself so that I can start cleaning up the beast.

<p>This is going to sound strange, but could I ask you to leave a quote that was in all caps that you changed back to the way it was? The person said the most outrageous thing I had ever heard and said so with all caps, no sources, proof, ect. You did them a favor by correcting their grammar, but they have little. Posters should be aware of the outrageous saying and the fact that the person felt the need to yell it. I gave it its own section so that other posters could challenge the theory as well. Originally I was hoping for clean up on the page since some posts have gotten hideously off-topic. Maybe all of the topics should go behind the "old page" archive and leave way for new ones?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't correct grammar, all I did was change it from ALL CAPS SCREAMING to lower-case. I agree that what he said is preposterous, but it's preposterous from its content, not from its style. It's customary to archive old talk on discussion pages, as I have done, but it's not polite to archive threads where the most recent post is less than a few weeks old. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The poster is actually a she (if that makes it anymore confusing) and the "blondes vs. albinos" topic is a month old, I was the last person to post. I honestly won't get offended if you move it, I'm personally sick of this person not dropping the subject and telling me that blondes are albinos. It's one of many posts that does not help the actual article itself.

<p>Hey. I changed the spelling of <a href="../../../b/s/c/Image%7EBscript_bamasa.png_a084.html" class="image" title="Image:Bscript bamasa.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/6/68/Bscript_bamasa.png" alt="Image:Bscript bamasa.png" width="39" height="7" longdesc="../../../b/s/c/Image%7EBscript_bamasa.png_a084.html" /></a> to <a href="../../../m/y/a/Image%7EMyanmaSa.png_2826.html" class="image" title="Image:MyanmaSa.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/15/MyanmaSa.png" alt="Image:MyanmaSa.png" width="53" height="24" longdesc="../../../m/y/a/Image%7EMyanmaSa.png_2826.html" /></a> in Burmese because the former is infrequently seen in writings (i.e. newspapers and official publications even prior to 1989). I can't explain it, but people literate in Burmese just inherently know it (<a href="../../../m/y/a/Image%7EMyanmaSa.png_2826.html" class="image" title="Image:MyanmaSa.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/15/MyanmaSa.png" alt="Image:MyanmaSa.png" width="53" height="24" longdesc="../../../m/y/a/Image%7EMyanmaSa.png_2826.html" /></a>) can be pronounced two ways. I'm not sure if I explained that adequately in the "Diglossia" section of the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_language.html" title="Burmese language">Burmese language</a> article (I can't find a source to cite that). Also, I don't know whether images or Unicode should be used to display all of the Burmese text, because Burmese Unicode is still in development, and requires installation of several items. Can you help me? Thanks. <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHintha_01a1.html" title="User:Hintha">Hintha</a> 23:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say use Unicode for most purposes, but occasionally using images for important words (like "Burmese" in the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_language.html" title="Burmese language">Burmese language</a> article) is OK. But I wouldn't go through that article an make an image for every single word being used in an example! As for the opening sentence, I think it's probably least confusing to have both spellings, but if <i>mranma ca</i> is more commonly written than <i>ba.ma ca</i>, even before 1989 and regardless of pronunciation, then we should put it first. But for people (like me) who have never been to Burma and don't know all the nuances of language use, but can nevertheless read the script a little, it's confusing to say that the spelling <i>mranma ca</i> can be pronounced [bəmàsà]. Which is the more common spelling in informal writing? For example, say a Burmese immigrant to America was writing a letter home to his mother and wanted to say "I'm using so much English nowadays, I hope I don't forget how to write Burmese." Would he be more likely to write <i>mranma ca</i> or <i>ba.ma ca</i>? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 08:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even in an informal letter, one would write <i>mranma ca</i> rather than <i>ba.ma ca</i>. But, I <i>ba.ma ca</i> is phonetically correct, although that is non-standard usage. It's sort of like <i>hkang bya:</i> (you in formal Burmese), which is never pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kʰìNbjà]</span>, but as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kʰìNmjá]</span>. And, which should be usen to refer to tbe Burmese language? <i>mranma ca</i> refers to the written language, while <i>mranma caka:</i> (မ္ရန္‌မာစကား) refers to the spoken language. <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHintha_01a1.html" title="User:Hintha">Hintha</a> 01:52, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you would write <i>mranma ca</i> even in an informal context, then I guess we should only use that spelling on the page. And we should mention both <i>mranma ca</i> for written Burmese and <i>mranma caka:</i> for spoken Burmese. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 10:16, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Angr!</p>
<p>Somebody has put an irrelevant picture in place of the actual picture of me on my user page. I am a little annoyed about this, and consider it to be vandalism, as it is exactly the same as editing a wikipedia article by deliberately putting false information on it.</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can find out who did this, and therefore lodge a formal complaint against this person?</p>
<p>I will leave the picture there until you can reply to me, so maybe you can find out who did it (and then tell me how you found out).</p>

<dd>Hi, the way to check who has made an edit is to check the <b>History</b> of the page. This is true for user pages as well as for articles. Checking your user page history, I saw that no one edited your user page. Then I went to the image description page of your picture and found the problem: someone uploaded a different image under the same name as yours. It was probably an honest mistake, not vandalism, but I left them a message on their talk page asking them to be more careful in the future. I also reverted to your image by clicking on (rev) in the "File history" section. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 12:17, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Angr, for enlightening me. In this particular case, not only did the minority view apparently win out over the overwhelming majority consensus, but, interestingly, the minority view was predominantly held by an assortment of non-specialists in the relevant fields, while the majority view was predominantly held by the specialists (linguists, toponymists, geographers, etc.). Perhaps you will now tell me that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a place where a specialist's opinion counts at all, but, on the contrary, it's the minority non-specialists that carry the day. Now, how do you like that? If this is not abuse, I don't know what is. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:56, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term <b>flapping</b> most commonly refers to what a bird does and so should not redirect to where you're pointing it to. Most people searching for "flapping" will want information on that as that's the most common meaning. We have an article <a href="../../../g/l/i/Gliding.html" title="Gliding">gliding</a> which is clearly about the most common meaning, not the linguistics process of gliding, the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flapping.html" title="Flapping">flapping</a> article similarly should point to the most common meaning, not the linguistics process.

<dd>There is no linguistic process called "gliding", so the comparison is invalid. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Flapping" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Flapping" rel="nofollow">What links to "Flapping"</a>: all links to that word are referring to the phonoogical process. The <a href="../../../h/a/t/WP%7EHAT_3be5.html" title="WP:HAT">hatnote</a> at the top of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonological_history_of_English_t_aa55.html" title="Phonological history of English t">Phonological history of English t</a> points people to other instance of the term. That's what hatnotes are there for. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 22:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only reason that there are so many links to <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flapping.html" title="Flapping">flapping</a> as a linguistics process is because that's what the article was originally about. It's not about that now, and there will be even fewer "flapping" links about the linguistics process in the future. Grook 22:57, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Apparantly, there is such thing as "gliding" in linguistics if you check Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22gliding%22+%22linguistics%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22gliding%22+%22linguistics%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22gliding%22+%22linguistics%22&amp;btnG=Search</a> However, that's not the main topic at the "gliding" article, nor does the redirect point to an article that talks about that. The "gliding" article sensibly refers to the most common meaning in the main article. Personally, I agree with Grook that it should redirect to flap, but I'm not going to change it. <a href="../../../v/o/o/User%7EVoortle_783b.html" title="User:Voortle">Voortle</a> 22:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
