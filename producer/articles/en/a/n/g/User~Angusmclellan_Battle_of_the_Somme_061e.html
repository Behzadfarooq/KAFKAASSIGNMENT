<p>The <b>Battle of the Somme</b>, fought in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>, was one of the largest battles of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>. With more than one million casualties it was also one of the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_lethal_battles_in_world_history.html" title="Most lethal battles in world history">bloodiest battles in human history</a>. The <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_%28World_War_I%29_dc9e.html" title="Allies (World War I)">Allied</a> forces attempted to break through the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">German</a> lines along a 25-mile (40&#160;km) front north and south of the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somme_River_95a9.html" title="Somme River">River Somme</a> in northern <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Third_Republic_a254.html" title="French Third Republic">France</a>.

<p>While Verdun would bite deep in the national consciousness of France for generations, the Somme would have the same effect on generations of Britons. The battle is best remembered for its first day, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>, on which the British suffered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead — the bloodiest day in the history of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> to that day. As terrible as the battle was for the British Empire troops who suffered there, it naturally affected the other nationalities as well. One German officer famously described it as "the muddy grave of the German field army."<span id=".7B.7B.7Bref.7D.7D.7D" class="citation">{{{author}}}, <i>{{{title}}}</i>, [[{{{publisher}}}]], [[{{{date}}}]].</span> By the end of the battle, the British had learnt many lessons in modern warfare while the Germans had suffered irreplaceable losses. British historian Sir <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Edmonds_1ae2.html" title="James Edmonds">James Edmonds</a> stated, "It is not too much to claim that the foundations of the final victory on the Western Front were laid by the Somme offensive of 1916."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Allied war strategy for 1916 was largely formulated during a conference at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chantilly%2C_Oise_1b47.html" title="Chantilly, Oise">Chantilly</a> held between <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">6 December</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, when it was decided that for the next year, simultaneous offensives were to be be mounted by the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russians</a> in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_I%29_03b3.html" title="Eastern Front (World War I)">East</a>, the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italians</a> (who had by now joined the Entente) in the Alps and the Anglo-French on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_%28World_War_I%29_c3a0.html" title="Western Front (World War I)">Western Front</a>, thereby assailing the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Powers_767f.html" title="Central Powers">Central Powers</a> from all sides.</p>
<p>In late December 1915, General <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Haig%2C_1st_Earl_Haig_ea8a.html" title="Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a> had replaced General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_French%2C_1st_Earl_of_Ypres_c913.html" title="John French, 1st Earl of Ypres">Sir John French</a> as Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF). Haig favoured a British offensive in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> — it was close to BEF supply routes via the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">Channel</a> ports and had a strategic goal of driving the Germans from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> coast of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, from which their <a href="../../../u/-/b/U-boat.html" title="U-boat">U-boats</a> were menacing Britain. However, though there was no formal arrangement, the British were as yet the junior partner on the Western Front and had to comply with French policy. In January 1916, the French commander, General <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Joffre_9b10.html" title="Joseph Joffre">Joseph Joffre</a>, had agreed to the BEF making their main effort in Flanders, but after further discussions in February, the decision was reached to mount a combined offensive where the French and British armies met astride the Somme River in <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picardy.html" title="Picardy">Picardy</a>.</p>

<p>Plans for the joint offensive on the Somme had barely begun to take shape when the Germans launched the Battle of Verdun on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_21.html" title="February 21">21 February</a> 1916. As the French committed themselves to defending Verdun, their capacity to carry out their role on the Somme disappeared, and the burden shifted to the British. France would end up contributing 3 corps to the opening of the attack (the XX, I Colonial and XXXV Corps of the 6th Army).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> As the bloodbath at Verdun dragged on, the aim of the Somme offensive changed from delivering a decisive blow against Germany to relieving the pressure on the French army.</p>
<p>The original British regular army, six <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">divisions</a> strong at the start of the war, had been effectively wiped out by the battles of 1914 and 1915. The bulk of the army was now made up of volunteers of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Force_b323.html" title="Territorial Force">Territorial Force</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener_of_Khartoum_a4bf.html" title="Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum">Lord Kitchener's</a> <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitchener%27s_Army_f5f3.html" title="Kitchener's Army">New Army</a>, which had begun forming in August 1914. The expansion of the army demanded <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">generals</a> for the senior commands, so promotion came at a dizzying pace and did not always reflect competence or ability. Haig himself had started the war as commander of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_I_Corps_f710.html" title="British I Corps">British I Corps</a> before commanding the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_First_Army_587f.html" title="British First Army">British First Army</a> and now the BEF, in effect an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_group.html" title="Army group">army group</a>, made up of four armies (soon to be five) of 60 divisions.</p>
<p>By mid-1916, the <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker_Scourge_27d9.html" title="Fokker Scourge">Fokker Scourge</a> was over, and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> had achieved <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_supremacy.html" title="Air supremacy">air supremacy</a> over the Somme battlefield. On the Somme front, the RFC fielded 10 squadrons and 185 aircraft against the 129 of the Germans. The British pursued a vigorous offensive policy that enabled them to spot for the artillery, via aircraft or tethered <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balloon_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Balloon (aircraft)">balloons</a>, while denying the Germans the same. It was not until September that the introduction of new aircraft would swing the balance back in favour of the German Air Service once again.</p>

<p>The first day of the battle was preceded by five days of preliminary <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> bombardment in which the British fired over 1.7 million shells. Ten <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mine_%28warfare%29.html" title="Mine (warfare)">mines</a> had also been dug beneath the German front-line trenches and strongpoints; the three largest mines contained about 21 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton.html" title="Ton">tons</a> (18&#160;tonnes) of explosives each.</p>
<p>The attack would be made by 13 British <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">divisions</a> (11 from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Fourth_Army_2ea8.html" title="British Fourth Army">Fourth Army</a> and two from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Third_Army_d136.html" title="British Third Army">Third Army</a>) north of the Somme River and 11 divisions of the French Sixth Army astride and south of the river. They were opposed by the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Second_Army_959c.html" title="German Second Army">German Second Army</a> of General <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_von_Below_db4f.html" title="Fritz von Below">Fritz von Below</a>.

The reason he detonated the mine earlier than was planned is unknown. At 07:28, the remaining mines were exploded (except for the mine at Kasino Point, which was late). At zero hour there was a brief and unsettling silence as the artillery shifted their aim onto the next line of targets.

<p>North of the Albert-Bapaume road, the advance was almost a complete failure from the outset. In a few places the attackers got into the German front line trench system or even the support line, but invariably their numbers were too few to withstand the German counter-attacks. As the German defensive barrage descended on no man's land, it became impossible for reinforcements to get through or for reports to get back.</p>
<p>Communications were completely inadequate, and commanders were largely ignorant of the progress of the battle. A mistaken report that the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_29th_Division_7e93.html" title="British 29th Division">29th Division</a> had succeeded at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumont_Hamel_c21e.html" title="Beaumont Hamel">Beaumont Hamel</a> led to the reserve brigade being ordered forward in support. The 1st <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_Regiment_8dde.html" title="Newfoundland Regiment">Newfoundland Regiment</a> was unable to reach the forward trenches, so it advanced from the reserve trench. Most of the battalion was wiped out before it crossed the front line, and it suffered 91% casualties, the second worst battalion loss of the day. 801 men from the regiment marched onto the battle field that day, and only 67 made it out unharmed, with over 500 dead. Nearly an entire generation of Newfoundland's future leaders was killed. For their efforts, The 1st Newfoundland Regiment, was given the name "The Royal Newfoundland Regiment" by King George V of England.</p>
<p>British progress astride the Albert-Bapaume road was likewise a failure, despite the explosion of the two mines at <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Boisselle_6dd7.html" title="La Boisselle">La Boisselle</a>. Here another tragic advance was made by the <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyneside_Irish_Brigade_616a.html" title="Tyneside Irish Brigade">Tyneside Irish Brigade</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_34th_Division_52ee.html" title="British 34th Division">34th Division</a> which started nearly one <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile.html" title="Mile">mile</a> from the German front line, in full view of the defenders' <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a>, and was effectively wiped out before it reached its own friendly forward trench line.</p>
<p>In the sector south of the road, the French divisions had greater success. Here the German defences were relatively weak, and the French artillery, which was superior in numbers and experience to the British, was highly effective. From the town of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montauban-de-Picardie_8f82.html" title="Montauban-de-Picardie">Montauban</a> to the Somme River, all the first day objectives were reached. Though the French XX Corps was to only act in a supporting role in this sector, in the event they would help lead the way. South of the Somme, French forces fared very well, surpassing their intended objectives. The I Colonial Corps departed their trenches at 9:30 am as part of a feint meant to lure the Germans opposite into a false sense of security. The feint was successful as, like the French divisions to the north, they too advanced easily. In under an hour, they had stormed Fay, Dompierre, Becquincourt and attained a foothold on the Flaucourt plateau. The entire German first line was in French hands. By 1100 hrs, the second line - marked by Assevillers, Herbecourt and Feuillères - was reached without even having to send in reserves. To the right of the Colonial Corps, the XXXV Corps also attacked at 9:30 am but, having only one division in the first line, had made less progress. Nevertheless, all first-day objectives were met. The Germans trenches had been completely pulverized. The enemy had been completely surprised by the infantry attack. On the north bank, the French had advanced 1,600&#160;yards (1.5&#160;km) and on the south, 2,200&#160;yards (2&#160;km).</p>

<p>Overall, however, the first day on the Somme was a failure. The British had suffered 19,240 dead, 35,493 wounded, 2,152 missing and 585 prisoners for a total loss of 57,470. Initial casualties were especially heavy among officers, who still dressed differently from <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-commissioned_officer.html" title="Non-commissioned officer">non-commissioned officers</a> and other ranks, and whose uniforms the Germans had been trained to recognize.</p>
<p>An exact count of German casualties for 1 July is difficult to make, because German units only submitted casualty returns every 10 days. It is estimated that the Germans suffered 8,000 casualties on the British front of which 2,200 were <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners_of_war.html" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a>. The disparity between British and German casualties was highest at <a href="../../../o/v/i/Ovillers.html" title="Ovillers">Ovillers</a>, where the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_8th_Infantry_Division_f673.html" title="British 8th Infantry Division">British 8th Division</a> suffered 5,121 casualties while the defending German 180th Regiment had only 280 casualties — a ratio of 18 to 1.</p>

<p>At 22:00 on 1 July, the commander of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Fourth_Army_2ea8.html" title="British Fourth Army">British Fourth Army</a>, Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_S._Rawlinson_debf.html" title="Henry S. Rawlinson">Henry Rawlinson</a>, had issued orders for the attack to be resumed. Confusion and poor communications through the extended chain of command meant it was some days before the British leaders realised the scale of the disaster. Haig appointed Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_Gough_7dd8.html" title="Hubert Gough">Hubert Gough</a> to take over the northern sector while the Fourth Army dealt with the southern sector. Gough recognised the fiasco on his sector and prevented an immediate resumption of the offensive — operations would not resume until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">3 July</a>.</p>
<p>The British were also ignorant of opportunities that existed south of the Albert-Bapaume road where they had achieved partial success. It is now known that there existed for a time a large gap in the German defences between Ovillers (on the road) and Longueval. On 3 July a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> patrol from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_18th_%28Eastern%29_Division_f871.html" title="British 18th (Eastern) Division">18th (Eastern) Division</a> ranged two miles into German territory without encountering an established defensive position. However, the opportunity was missed or the British lacked the resources to exploit it, and the Germans were able to fill the gap in time.</p>
<p>Mametz Wood was still vacant on July 3 but was reoccupied by the Germans the following day and would not be captured until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a> after two costly attempts. Places such as <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Wood_e96c.html" title="High Wood">High Wood</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delville_Wood_27d2.html" title="Delville Wood">Delville Wood</a>, there for the taking in the aftermath of the first day, would require an enormous expenditure of lives before they were eventually captured in August and September. In August Rawlinson wrote of the period 1–<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>These four days would in all probability have enabled us to gain full possession of the hostile third line of defence, which was at that time less than half finished... It makes me sick to think of the "might have beens"</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As the British struggled to jump-start their offensive, the French continued their rapid advance south of the Somme. 3 July - 4 July was the critical point in the offensive when the possibility of a breakthrough actually seemed achievable. But just as quickly as it appeared, it began to slip away. When the XX Corps was forced to halt its advance on the north bank in order to wait for the British to catch up, a simmering hostility toward the British rose up among the rank and file of the French army. Elsewhere, the I Colonial Corps pressed on and by the end of 3 July Frise, Méréaucourt Wood, Herbécourt, Buscourt, Chapitre Wood, Flaucourt, and Asseviller were all in French hands. In so doing, 8,000 Germans had been made prisoner, while the taking of the Flaucourt plateau would allow Foch to move heavy artillery up to support the XX Corps on the north bank. The French continued their advance on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a> as Hem was taken. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">8 July</a> Hardecourt-aux-Bois and Monacu Farm (a veritable fortress, surrounded by hidden machine-gun nests in the nearby marsh) both fell. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">9 July</a> -10 July, Biaches, Maisonnette and Fortress Biaches.</p>
<p>Thus, in ten days of fighting, on nearly a 12.5 mile (20&#160;km) front, the French 6th Army had progressed as far as 6&#160;miles (10&#160;km) at points. It had occupied the entire Flaucourt plateau (which constituted the principal defense of Péronne) while taking 12,000 prisoners, 85 canons, 26 minenwerfers, 100 machine-guns, and other assorted materials, all with relatively minimal losses.</p>
<p>For the British, the first two weeks of the battle had descended into a series of disjointed, small-scale actions, ostensibly in preparation for making a major push. Between July 3 and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_13.html" title="July 13">13 July</a> Rawlinson's Fourth Army carried out 46 "actions" resulting in 25,000 casualties but no significant advance. This demonstrated a difference in strategy between Haig and his French counterparts and was a source of friction. Haig's purpose was to maintain continual pressure on the enemy while Joffre and Foch preferred to conserve their strength in preparation for a single, heavy blow.</p>
<p>In one significant respect, the Battle of the Somme was a major strategic success for the British as on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">12 July</a>, in response to the Somme fighting and the situation in the east, Falkenhayn called off the German offensive at Verdun. While the fighting would continue there until December, it would be the French who dictated the course of the battle.</p>
<p>On the Somme, von Below's Second Army would not be able to endure the continued British and French pressure alone. Each front line German division was being attacked by three or four Allied divisions. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">19 July</a>, the German forces were reorganised with von Below taking command of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_First_Army_0725.html" title="German First Army">German First Army</a>, responsible for the northern sector, and General <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_von_Gallwitz_52fa.html" title="Max von Gallwitz">Max von Gallwitz</a> taking over the Second Army which covered the southern sector. In addition, von Gallwitz was made <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_group.html" title="Army group">army group</a> commander responsible for both German armies on the Somme.</p>
<p>As early as <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">2 July</a>, seven German divisions were on their way to the Somme as reinforcements, and seven more were on their way within another week. In July and August the Germans poured in 35 extra divisions on the British sectors and a further seven divisions on the French sector. The combined pressure on Germany meant that <i><a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberste_Heeresleitung_31ea.html" title="Oberste Heeresleitung">Oberste Heeresleitung</a></i> (OHL, army high command) had only one division left in reserve by August.</p>
<p>The British had hoped to stem this flow of German reinforcements to the Somme from other sectors of the front. To do this a series of raids and demonstrations were carried out with the aim of "pinning" the German divisions to the front. The largest and most infamous of these was the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fromelles_2eb8.html" title="Battle of Fromelles">Battle of Fromelles</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">19 July</a> - <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">20 July</a>, opposite Aubers Ridge in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artois.html" title="Artois">Artois</a>. For the cost of 7,080 <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> and British casualties, no ground was captured and no halt was made to the withdrawal of German divisions from Artois to the Somme.</p>

<p>There is considerable contrast between the preparation and execution of this attack and that of 1 July. The attack on Bazentin Ridge was made by four divisions on a front of 6,000 yards (5.5&#160;km) with the troops going over before dawn at 03:25 after a surprise five minute artillery bombardment. The artillery laid down a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creeping_barrage.html" title="Creeping barrage">creeping barrage</a>, and the attacking waves pushed up close behind it in no man's land, leaving them only a short distance to cross when the barrage lifted from the Germans' front trench.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, the first phase of the attack was a success with nearly all objectives taken, and as on 1 July, a gap was made in the German defences. However, again as on 1 July, the British were unable to successfully exploit it. Their attempt to do so created the most famous <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> action of the Battle of the Somme when the 7th Dragoon Guards and the 2nd Deccan Horse attempted to capture High Wood. It is likely that the wood could have been captured by the infantry in the morning, but by the time the cavalry were in position to attack, the Germans had begun to recover. Though the cavalry held on in the wood through the night of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a>, they had to withdraw the following day.</p>
<p>The British had a foothold in High Wood and would continue to fight over it as well as Delville Wood, neighbouring Longueval, for many days. Unfortunately for them, the successful opening of the 14 July attack did not mean they had learnt how to conduct trench battles. On the night of 22–23 July, Rawlinson launched an attack using six divisions along the length of the Fourth Army front which failed completely. The Germans were learning; they had begun to move away from the trench-based defences and towards a flexible <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_in_depth.html" title="Defence in depth">defence in depth</a> system of strongpoints that was difficult for the supporting artillery to suppress.</p>

<p>No significant progress was made in the northern sector in the first few weeks of July. Ovillers, just north of the Albert-Bapaume road, was not captured until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">16 July</a>. Its capture, and the foothold the British had obtained in the German second position on 14 July, meant that the chance now existed for the German northern defences to be taken in the flank. The key to this was <a href="../../../p/o/z/Pozi%C3%A8res.html" title="Pozières">Pozières</a>.</p>
<p>The village of Pozières lay on the Albert-Bapaume road at the crest of the ridge. Just behind (east) the village ran the trenches of the German second position. The Fourth Army made three attempts to seize the village between <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">17 July</a> before Haig relieved Rawlinson's army of responsibility for its northern flank. The capture of Pozières became a task for Gough's <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Reserve_Army_6dcf.html" title="British Reserve Army">Reserve Army</a>, and the tool he would use was the three <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> divisions of <a href="../../../i/_/a/I_Anzac_Corps_ae1b.html" title="I Anzac Corps">I Anzac Corps</a>.</p>

The attack was scheduled for the night of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> to coincide with the Fourth Army attack of 22 – 23 July.</p>
<p>Going in shortly after midnight, the attack on Pozières was a success, largely thanks to Walker's insistence on careful preparation and an overwhelming supporting bombardment; however, an attempt to capture the neighbouring German second position failed, though two Australians were awarded the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a> in the attempt. The Germans, recognising the critical importance of the village to their defensive network, made three unsuccessful counter-attacks before beginning a prolonged and methodical bombardment of the village. The final German effort to reclaim Pozières came before dawn on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">7 August</a> following a particularly heavy bombardment. The Germans overran the forward Australian defences, and a wild mêlée developed from which the Australians emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Gough planned to drive north along the ridge towards <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouquet_Farm_965c.html" title="Mouquet Farm">Mouquet Farm</a>, allowing him to threaten the German bastion of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiepval.html" title="Thiepval">Thiepval</a> from the rear. However, the further the Australians advanced, the deeper was the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salient_%28military%29.html" title="Salient (military)">salient</a> they created such that the German artillery could concentrate on them from three directions.</p>

By <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a> a line had been established just south of the farm, which the Germans had turned into a fortress with deep dugouts and tunnels connecting to distant redoubts.

<p>By the start of August, Haig had accepted that the prospect of achieving a breakthrough was now unlikely; the Germans had "recovered to a great extent from the disorganisation" of July.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> For the next six weeks, the British would engage in a series of small-scale actions in preparation for the next major push. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> the German Chief of the General Staff, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Falkenhayn_ed24.html" title="Erich Falkenhayn">Erich Falkenhayn</a>, was replaced by General <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_von_Hindenburg_9fef.html" title="Paul von Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a>, with General <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Ludendorff_40ad.html" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> as his deputy, but in effect the operational commander. The immediate effect of this change was the introduction of a new defensive doctrine. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">23 September</a> the Germans began constructing the <i>Siegfried Stellung</i>, called the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg_Line_01be.html" title="Hindenburg Line">Hindenburg Line</a> by the British.</p>
<p>On the Fourth Army's front, the struggle for <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Wood_e96c.html" title="High Wood">High Wood</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delville_Wood_27d2.html" title="Delville Wood">Delville Wood</a> and the Switch Line dragged on. The boundary between the British and French armies lay southeast of Delville Wood, beyond the villages of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Guillemont_deac.html" title="Battle of Guillemont">Guillemont</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ginchy_c89c.html" title="Battle of Ginchy">Ginchy</a>. Here the British line had not progressed significantly since the first day of the battle, and the two armies were in echelon, making progress impossible until the villages were captured. The first British effort to seize Guillemont on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">8 August</a> was a debacle. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">18 August</a>, a larger effort began, involving three British corps as well as the French, but it took until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">3 September</a> before Guillemont was in British hands. Attention now turned to Ginchy, which was captured by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_16th_%28Irish%29_Division_55ee.html" title="British 16th (Irish) Division">16th (Irish) Division</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">9 September</a>. The French had also made progress, and once Ginchy fell, the two armies were linked near Combles.</p>

<p>The British now had an almost straight front line from near Mouquet Farm in the northwest to Combles in the southeast, providing a suitable jumping-off position for another large scale attack. In 1916, a straight front was considered necessary to enable the supporting artillery to lay down an effective creeping barrage behind which the infantry could advance.</p>
<p>This intermediate phase of the Battle of the Somme had been costly for the Fourth Army, despite there being no major offensive. Between <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> (the eve of the next battle), the Fourth Army made around 90 attacks of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a> strength or more with only four being general attacks across the length of the army's 5 miles (8&#160;km) of front. The result was 82,000 casualties and an advance of approximately 1,000 <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yard.html" title="Yard">yards</a> (915&#160;m)—a performance even worse than <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a>.</p>

<p>The battle is chiefly remembered today as the debut of the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The British had high hopes that this secret weapon would break the deadlock of the trenches. Early tanks were not weapons of mobile warfare — with a top speed of 2&#160;<a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_per_hour.html" title="Miles per hour">mph</a> (3.2&#160;km/h), they were easily outpaced by the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> — but were designed for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trench_warfare.html" title="Trench warfare">trench warfare</a>. They were untroubled by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbed_wire.html" title="Barbed wire">barbed wire</a> obstacles and impervious to <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifle</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a> fire, though highly vulnerable to artillery. Additionally, the tanks were notoriously unreliable; of the 49 tanks available on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">15 September</a>, only 32 made it to the start line, and of these, only 21 made it into action. Mechanical breakdowns were common, and many others became bogged or ditched in the shell holes and trenches of the churned battlefield.</p>

<p>The British made gains across the length of their front, the greatest being in the centre at <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flers.html" title="Flers">Flers</a> with an advance of 3,500 yards (3.2&#160;km), a feat achieved by the newest British division in France, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_41st_Division_45b7.html" title="British 41st Division">41st Division</a>, in their first action.

On the left flank, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_2nd_Division_f4c1.html" title="Canadian 2nd Division">Canadian 2nd Division</a> captured the village of Courcelette after heavy fighting, with some assistance from tanks.

<p>The British had managed to advance during Flers-Courcelette, capturing 4,500 yards (4.1&#160;km) of the German third position, but fell short of all their objectives, and once again the breakthrough eluded them. The tank had shown promise, but its lack of reliability limited its impact, and the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactic.html" title="Military tactic">tactics</a> of tank warfare were obviously in their infancy.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The least successful sector on 15 September had been east of Ginchy where the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadrilateral.html" title="Quadrilateral">Quadrilateral</a> redoubt had held up the advance towards Morval — the Quadrilateral was not captured until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">18 September</a>.

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">26 September</a> Gough's Reserve Army launched its first major offensive since the opening day of the battle in an attempt to capture the German fortress of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiepval.html" title="Thiepval">Thiepval</a>. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_18th_%28Eastern%29_Division_f871.html" title="British 18th (Eastern) Division">18th (Eastern) Division</a>, which had excelled on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a>, once more demonstrated by capturing most of Thiepval on the first day that careful training, preparation and leadership could overcome the obstacles of trench warfare. <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouquet_Farm_965c.html" title="Mouquet Farm">Mouquet Farm</a> finally fell to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_11th_%28Northern%29_Division_148c.html" title="British 11th (Northern) Division">11th (Northern) Division</a>, and the Canadians advanced 1,000 yards (915&#160;m) from Courcelette.</p>
<p>There followed a period from <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a>, known as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Ancre_Heights_25af.html" title="Battle of the Ancre Heights">Battle of the Ancre Heights</a>, of grinding attritional fighting for little gain. At the end of October, Gough's army was renamed the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Fifth_Army_e56a.html" title="British Fifth Army">British Fifth Army</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the Fourth Army's front, Haig was still under the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> he had outlined plans for <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Allenby%2C_1st_Viscount_Allenby_5b94.html" title="Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby">Allenby's</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Third_Army_d136.html" title="British Third Army">Third Army</a> to rejoin the battle in the north around Gommecourt and for the Fourth Army to attack towards <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambrai.html" title="Cambrai">Cambrai</a>. The first step required the capture of the German Transloy Line, effectively the German fourth defensive position that ran from the village of Le Transloy in the east to Le Sars on the Albert-Bapaume road.</p>
<p>Opening on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Le_Transloy_d313.html" title="Battle of Le Transloy">Battle of Le Transloy</a> became bogged down as the weather broke, and heavy rain turned the churned battlefield into a quagmire. Le Sars was captured on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">7 October</a>, but elsewhere there was little progress and a continual flow of casualties. The final throe came on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">5 November</a> with a failed attack on the <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butte_de_Warlencourt_6744.html" title="Butte de Warlencourt">Butte de Warlencourt</a>. On the Fourth Army's front, major operations in the Battle of the Somme had now ceased.</p>

<p>The final act of the Battle of the Somme was played out between 13–18 November along the Ancre River, north of Thiepval. Haig's purpose for the attack was more <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a> than military — with winter setting in, there was no longer any prospect of a breakthrough. Instead, with another conference at Chantilly starting on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">15 November</a>, he hoped to be able to report of success to his French counterparts.</p>
<p>The opening moves were almost a replay of 1 July, even down to another mine being detonated beneath <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorn_Ridge_Redoubt_b147.html" title="Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt">Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt</a> west of <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumont_Hamel_c21e.html" title="Beaumont Hamel">Beaumont Hamel</a>. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_31st_Division_1dbc.html" title="British 31st Division">31st Division</a> had attacked Serre on 1 July and four and a half months later was called on to do it again; the results were similar. South of Serre the British, with the benefit of their hard-earned experience, succeeded in capturing most of their objectives. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_51st_%28Highland%29_Division_%28World_War_I%29_2ae0.html" title="British 51st (Highland) Division (World War I)">51st (Highland) Division</a> took Beaumont Hamel while on their right the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_63rd_%28Royal_Naval%29_Division_5c29.html" title="British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division">63rd (Royal Naval) Division</a> captured Beaucourt, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Freyberg_3e34.html" title="Bernard Freyberg">Bernard Freyberg</a> winning the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a> in the process. South of the Ancre <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_II_Corps_be47.html" title="British II Corps">II Corps</a> had also made progress.</p>
<p>Haig was satisfied with the result, but Gough argued for a final effort which was made on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">18 November</a> with an attack on the Munich and Frankfurt Trenches and a push towards Grandcourt. Ninety men of the 16th Battalion, <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_Light_Infantry_489b.html" title="Highland Light Infantry">Highland Light Infantry</a> (the "Glasgow Boys Brigade" <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pals_battalion.html" title="Pals battalion">Pals battalion</a>) were cut-off in Frankfurt Trench where they held out until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">21 November</a> when the 45 survivors — 30 of them wounded — surrendered. So ended the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Ancre_bc27.html" title="Battle of the Ancre">Battle of the Ancre</a> and with it the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>It is difficult to declare the Battle of the Somme a victory for either side. The British and French did succeed in capturing ground but little more than 5&#160;miles (8&#160;km) at the deepest point of penetration, well short of their original objectives. The British themselves had gained approximately only 2 miles and lost about 420,000 soldiers in the process, meaning that a centimetre cost about 2 men. Taking a long-term view, the Battle of the Somme delivered more benefits for the British than it did for the Germans. As British historian Gary Sheffield said, "The battle of the Somme was not a victory in itself, but without it the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Entente_f747.html" title="Triple Entente">Entente</a> would not have emerged victorious in 1918."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_Battle_of_the_Somme_061e.html" title="Edit section: Strategic effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategic effects</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the battle, Germany had regarded Britain as a <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval.html" title="Naval">naval</a> power and discounted her as a military force to be reckoned with, believing Germany's major enemies were France and Russia. Starting with the Somme, Britain began to gain influence in the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition.html" title="Coalition">coalition</a>, especially following the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutiny.html" title="Mutiny">mutinies</a> in the French army in 1917. In recognition of the growing threat Britain posed, on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">31 January</a> Germany adopted the policy of <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare.html" title="Unrestricted submarine warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> in an attempt to starve the island nation of supplies, an act that would ultimately bring the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> into the war.</p>
<p>At the start of 1916, the British army had been a largely inexperienced mass of volunteers. The Somme was the first real test of this newly raised "citizens army" that had come into being following <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener_of_Khartoum_a4bf.html" title="Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum">Lord Kitchener's</a> call for recruits at the start of the war. It is brutal but accurate to observe that many of the British soldiers killed on the Somme lacked experience, and therefore their loss was of little military significance. However, they had been the first to volunteer and so were often the fittest, most enthusiastic and best educated of the citizen soldiers. For Germany, which had entered the war with a trained force of regulars and reservists, each casualty was sapping the experience and effectiveness of the German army. The senior German commander <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Prince_Rupprecht_of_Bavaria_333c.html" title="Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria">Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria</a> stated, "What remained of the old first-class peace-trained German infantry had been expended on the battlefield."</p>
<p>The Battle of the Somme damaged the German Army beyond repair, after which it was never able to adequately replace its casualties with the same calibre of soldier that doggedly held its ground during most of the battle. By the end of the battle, the British and German armies were closer to being equally matched; effectively <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militias</a>.</p>
<p>German commanders did not believe the army could endure continual <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_attrition.html" title="Battle of attrition">battles of attrition</a> like the Somme. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">24 February</a> 1917, the German army made a strategic <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorched_earth.html" title="Scorched earth">scorched earth</a> withdrawal from the Somme battlefield to the prepared fortifications of the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg_Line_01be.html" title="Hindenburg Line">Hindenburg Line</a>, thereby shortening the front line they had to occupy. In the grey area of gains and losses, it is therefore possible to claim that the Entente's territorial gain from the battle was greater than that which existed at the battle's close.</p>
<p>The strategic effects of the Battle of the Somme cannot obscure the fact that it was one of the costliest battles of the First World War. A German officer, Friedrich Steinbrecher, wrote:</p>

<p>The original Allied estimate of casualties on the Somme, made at the Chantilly conference on 15 November, was 485,000 British and French casualties versus 630,000 German. These figures were used to support the argument that the Somme was a successful battle of attrition for the Allies. However, there was considerable scepticism at the time of the accuracy of the counts. After the war, a final tally showed that 419,654 British and 204,253 French were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner; of the 623,907 total casualties, 146,431 were either killed or missing.</p>
<p>The British official historian Sir <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Edmonds_1ae2.html" title="James Edmonds">James Edmonds</a> maintained that German losses were 680,000, but this figure has been discredited. A separate statistical report by the British <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Office_e75c.html" title="War Office">War Office</a> concluded that German casualties on the British sector could be as low as 180,000 during the battle. Today commonly accepted figures for all German losses on the Somme are between 465,000 and 600,000. In compiling his <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biography</a> of General <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_S._Rawlinson_debf.html" title="Henry S. Rawlinson">Rawlinson</a>, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice was supplied by the <i>Reichsarchiv</i> with a figure of 164,055 for the German killed or missing.</p>
<p>The average casualties per <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">division</a> (consisting of circa 10,000 soldiers) on the British sector up until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">19 November</a> was 8,026 — 6,329 for the four Canadian divisions, 7,408 for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Division_8e58.html" title="New Zealand Division">New Zealand Division</a>, 8,133 for the 43 British divisions and 8,960 for the three Australian divisions. The British daily loss rate during the Battle of the Somme was 2,943 men, which exceeded the loss rate during the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Battle_of_Ypres_dcca.html" title="Third Battle of Ypres">Third Battle of Ypres</a> but was not as severe as the two months of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Arras_%281917%29_1af9.html" title="Battle of Arras (1917)">Battle of Arras (1917)</a> (4,076 per day) or the final <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Days_%281918%29_0a6a.html" title="Hundred Days (1918)">Hundred Days</a> offensive in 1918 (3,685 per day).</p>

This was no light burden, and the follow up troops, coming immediately after those who carried out the actual assault, carried a great deal more. It is one thing to capture ground, quite another to hold it. Once into a German position the objective had to be consolidated and held against the inevitable counter attack. This meant that the existing defence works had to be turned round to face the other way, wire obstacles had to be constructed and communications had to be established. Ammunition, grenades and digging implements had to be there, to say nothing of signals cable, water and food, and there was no other way of making all this immediately available to the infantry than by having them carry it with them.</p>
