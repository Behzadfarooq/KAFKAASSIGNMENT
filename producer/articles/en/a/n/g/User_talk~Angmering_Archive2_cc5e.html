<p>Please see my response on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English_6979.html" title="Talk:List of words having different meanings in British and American English">Talk:List of words having different meanings in British and American English</a>. I would dispute that this is a British usage - more it is an uncommon British borrowing from American. Many (possibly most) American words fall into this category, since we understand so many of them through constant bombardment by the American broadcasting industry and some impressionable people insist on adopting them for whatever reason. This doesn't, I would argue, make them British usage. In this specific instance, I have never heard or read of the word 'prom' used in this way in the UK, and I would suggest that this would be most people's response.

<p>I have no idea why the BBC would make the statement you reported. Several Canadian performances before the UK trip are well-documented -- here's a setlist for one</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bjorner.com/DSN00150%201962.htm#DSN00220" class="external free" title="http://www.bjorner.com/DSN00150%201962.htm#DSN00220" rel="nofollow">http://www.bjorner.com/DSN00150%201962.htm#DSN00220</a></p>
<p>which was recorded, has been described by people who were there, etc.</p>
<p>Dylan has also claimed to have been in Mexico before his arrival in New York, and while that's probably one of his tall tales it can't be completely disproved.</p>
<p>The '62-63 visit (and it definitely began in December '62, documented by folks like Martin Carthy and Peggy Seeger) was probably his first trip to the UK or Europe. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:26, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looking over the article, I think that <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junking.html" title="Junking">Junking</a> would probably be a better description of what's going on, and various redirects created if necessary. I was initially thinking of something like Junking (film) or Junking (tape), but neither one precisely fits. If you want further input, Requested Moves probably is the place for it.</p>
<p>The other thing is, now that the wiping/junking article contains a sizeable chunk of general info as to why and how the junking policy was carried out, should that duplicate information in <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes_cbfa.html" title="Doctor Who missing episodes">Doctor Who missing episodes</a> (which is not directly connected to <i>Doctor Who</i>), be cut down or removed with a pointer to the junking article? --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 00:11, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I'll probably be bold and go ahead and move the page to <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junking.html" title="Junking">Junking</a>, then – there aren't <i>that</i> many links that would need fixing, less that fifty anyway, and it's a better description for it. You're probably right about cutting down the general info in the <i>Doctor Who</i> piece and creating a link to the Junking article, too.

<p>That's a good point. I hadn't thought of that, and only re-added because there ought to be two examples, and, well, I like Dad's Army&#160;:).

<p>Hello. Firstly, thank you for your gracious compliment, that's very kind. I'm afraid I won't be much use to you this time. I haven't seen the programme. Yes, I know: <i>OUTRAGEOUS!</i> It has, in fact, been on my postal DVD rental list for a few months (along with a couple of hundred other things). I went to look at the article in any case, as one doesn't have to have seen a programme to help out with flow, spelling, layout etc. But (as is fair for an encyclopedic article) I notice that it warns me of spoilers - so I hope you won't mind if I don't spoil the drama for myself. I'm not quite sure how I missed it when it was broadcast but I know it's supposed to be very, very good. Don't hesitate to ask me to look at anything else in future, there's really no need to think it "cheeky" or an imposition at all. Good luck with the <i>featured article</i> status. Right, I must get back to work on missus <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Whiteread_f749.html" title="Rachel Whiteread">Rachel Whiteread</a>. --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 18:45, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fair enough – many thanks for taking the time to reply, in any case. I hope you enjoy it when you do finally get the chance to see it. I personally think it's one of the finest television dramas ever made, if not <i>the</i> finest.

<p>If I may say so, kudos to you for writing such great articles. I remember seeing the pitiful stub on State of Play a few months ago, and then coming back a couple of weeks ago to find that it'd been fully fleshed out. I just saw The Girl on the Cafe last night and checked on here to see whether we had an article on it, and was very pleased to see the same thing. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:35, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to say, I found it very bizarre on hearing it - it sounded a most unlikely turn of events. I only had the DVD on rental and it has gone back now. Ummm.

<p>Man, that article needs a hell of a cleanup, quite aside from the POV issues with that editor. Yes, that claim requries a source, and it's not good enough to say "I was at the meeting," since we have no idea who he is, and not to mention if it's from his own personal knowledge, it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 14:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello-this seems to be the only way I can contact the authors of this page, as far as I can see- its certainly interesting to see the ins and outs of information, and perhaps I can help a little. I don't know who the errant contributor is, or to what meeting they refer to, possibly an "offers" meeting of some kind, but as far as the information was passed back to me, DW was certainly a favoured project of the Conroller at the time, Lorraine H, and she certainly told us she preferred to reallocate possible resources for a second Strange to it instead. The comments on the scheduling are pretty accurate imo but the above may slightly enlighten them, perhaps. (Do I detect an inbuilt bias towards DW disguised as zealous application of the rules? I hope not.) The appearing and disappearing "quotes" section is interesting- I wonder who collected them? I believe I did say all those things at some point or other (though I dont think the Thatcher one is particularly witty)- interestingly I'm certain I <i>never</i> said the one quote that remains, concerning Awards Ceremonies. How come that one slipped through? Now I'm starting to get slightly hurt- is "attempted" a drama a rather scathing remark? Isn't this supposed to be non-judgemental? And, in the spirit of pedantry, surely Strange didn't "find a sufficiently large audience for a Saturday Night Slot" is more accurate- as it stands it implies nobody watched at all. And by the way- if you are Russell T Davis's Mother- please tell your son, I'm a fan. best wishes, Andrew Marshall.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Andrew — biasing towards <i>Doctor Who</i> is certainly not my intention, although as you can doubtless tell from my contributions I am a fan of that series. The comment about New Who being responsible for Strange's cancellation was completely unsourced and not something I'd read anywhere else — I did try tracking down any other verification, but I couldn't find any. It was also written in a tone that suggested that had <i>Strange</i> continued <i>Doctor Who</i> wouldn't have happened. In any case, it's certainly not my intention to create a <i>Who</i> bias, merely to make sure that information is correctly sourced. Perhaps it's best if I stay away from the article from now on and leave other more neutral editors to it. Keep up the good work, by the way. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 18:19, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for the note - I enjoyed working on the article. I did wonder whether it was worth noting that football was brought to Argentina by English ex-pats, hence all the English-isms in Argentine football, and the English names of some of the teams (River Plate, etc.). (from the longer press articles quoted as references). Sort of a pre-1966 build up... The 50's comment from the politician could go in there. What do you think?

<p>Yeah, it's one of those stupid, semi-irrational things that make no logical sense.
