<p>Churchie's rich history and long-standing traditions date back to 1912 when Canon William Perry French Morris founded the school at Toowong, before establishing it on the present site in East Brisbane in 1918. Canon Morris based the school's ethos on the school's patron saint, St. Magnus, a Viking Earl known for his strength of character and his qualities as an educated Christian man. The school crest reflects the Viking tradition – the shield and battle axes stand for Viking courage and the axes are crossed to signify self-sacrifice. Churchie's core values of scholastic attainment, personal development, spiritual awareness and community service build on the characteristics and attributes displayed by St. Magnus.</p>
<p>The school's Viking tradition is reflected in many aspects of school life – rowing boats are named after Vikings; architecture represents Viking icons; and the school's mascot, 'Eric', a Viking effigy, makes regular appearances at sporting events. In early days Canon Morris called on the boys to 'finish hard' in all their pursuits and this cry is often called on today. In Canon Morris's first address to parents he stated his aim was to 'train characters as well as minds'. He encouraged boys to take part in physical activity, as well as their studies.</p>
<p>Early in 1913 the school's name was changed to The Cathedral School following a move to new premises at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_John%27s_Cathedral%2C_Brisbane_0689.html" title="St John's Cathedral, Brisbane">St John's Cathedral</a> in the city, where 33 boys finished the year. Numbers continued to grow and in 1916 with an enrolment of 106 students and the new name of Church of England Grammar School (CEGS), a decision was made to purchase land to build a new school. In 1918 the foundation stone was laid on the site where the school stands today. The school name was changed to Anglican Church Grammar School (ACGS) in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>The school came under controversy when Frederick Roy Hoskins, a former teacher and Father of the Year at the school, pleaded guilty in May 2004 to 16 child sex offences committed against seven victims aged nine to fifteen between 1947 and 1955. He continued to teach for 40 years. The crimes were not discovered until plans were made to name a building after the teacher.<sup id="_ref-fatherofyear_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fatherofyear" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Churchie is one of the group of schools controlled by the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane. While enrolment is open to students of all faiths, or none, the school values spiritual awareness highly amongst its four aims. Students are expected to share fully in chapel life and the religious education program. Anglicanism has traditionally valued intellectual debate of a high order in matters of Christian faith and tradition and does not welcome either religious bigotry or closed minds.</p>
<p>The school has three chaplains on staff, all of whom are ordained priests. As such, they are responsible for a large range of activities in the school. Chapel worship for the preparatory middle and senior schools is a regular occurrence, as well as special services for boarders and other groups in the Churchie community. Active involvement by boys in the presentation of these services is an important emphasis. Religious education is taught by a large number of staff in each of the sub-schools. Middle school has an assistant head of faculty (religious education) whose sole job it is to keep teachers and students well-resourced for the delivery of the program. The senior chaplain is head of faculty for religious education.</p>
<p><b>Head Chaplain:</b> Reverend Marcus Edwards</p>
<p>The Churchie school hymn is "The Head That Once was Crowned with Thorns". The tune of this hymn is St. Magnus and was chosen by the founder Canon Morris. because of this link to the school's patron saint. Another hymn associated with the school is "On Eagles' Wings", although it is not an official school hymn.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_Grammar_School_77bc.html" title="Edit section: Day Boy Houses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day Boy Houses</span></h3>
<p>There are nine day boy houses.</p>
<p><b>Biggs:</b> Biggs was named after Mr. E.E. Biggs, who was a member of the first school council and attended the school from 1918-1923. This family's association with the school has continued to the present day. The house places particular emphasis upon service to the school community and involvement in house and school activities. The house colours are blue, white and yellow and the house motto is 'Always Striving'. Its current housemaster is Mr. Damien A Fall.</p>
<p><b>Casey:</b> Casey was founded in 1971 and named in honour of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Casey%2C_Baron_Casey_978d.html" title="Richard Casey, Baron Casey">Richard Gardiner Casey</a> (1890-1976), later Baron Casey of Berwick, the distinguished Australian diplomat, politician and Governor General. The house motto 'Vis et Unitas' is usually translated as 'progress through unity,' and reflects one of the aims of the house system at Churchie, to build a unit of cohesion, identity and support for the boys within the framework of the school at large. The house coat of arms incorporates themes from Casey's own coat of arms, with the addition of the crossed Viking swords. The house colours are gold and royal purple, which were Baron Casey's own colours. Its current housemaster is Mr. Adam N. Knight.</p>
<p><b>Grenfell:</b> Grenfell was one of the first four day houses at Churchie, founded in 1935 and named after <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfred_Grenfell_8b73.html" title="Wilfred Grenfell">Sir Wilfred Thomasson Grenfell</a>, who was born at Parkgate, England, in 1865. He was a doctor who gained his degree at London University. Grenfell was interested in boating and his great love of the sea led him to becoming a Master Mariner. A lecturer suggested he join a large fishing fleet as their doctor. Within five years he had encouraged the fishermen to stop drinking and Queen Victoria's interest in this feat led to her presenting the fleet with its first hospital boat. In 1891 Grenfell sailed to Cape St. John's in the North Atlantic. He was mobbed by people who needed medical attention. The following spring he returned to Labrador with two doctors and nurses, where he set up two hospital bases for the Eskimos who populated Labrador. A third hospital was set up at St. Anthony in about 1898. He acted as an arbitrator between the fishermen and traders which led to a cooperative being developed. Most would be satisfied with this work but Grenfell wasn't. He gathered up the orphans, and as the number of wards grew, he raised money and built houses for them. He built schools to which teachers from all over the world came, at their own expense, to teach useful crafts and occupations. Grenfell traveled the world lecturing to raise money for Labrador. He met his wife during one of these tours and had three children. During World War I he assisted the Harvard Surgical Unit in service in France. There are many Grenfell associations which help raise money or do missionary work around the world. This house was named after a great man in the hope of inspiring the boys to greater heights. Sir Wilfred Grenfell gave the school permission to use his personal motto, 'Loyal Devoir', and coat of arms when the house was established. The name of Grenfell is surely a thing of which to be proud. The Grenfell colours are red and gold. Its current housemaster is Mr. Michael A. Olm.</p>
<p><b>Hillary:</b> The name Hillary was chosen for this house by the late Charles Fisher, after looking for men who had achieved success in their chosen field. <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Hillary_e493.html" title="Edmund Hillary">Sir Edmund Hillary</a> was in 1953 one of the first men ever to climb Mt. Everest, a feat recently emulated by his son, Peter. The house colours and crest were chosen by the first students of Hillary from designs submitted by students. The crest incorporates the symbols of knighthood - knight's helmet, a castle, and a fist pointing upward. This reinforces the house motto "Semper Sursum" ("ever upward"), a fitting tribute to Hillary's achievement. The house has a high academic standard and strives to emulate this on the sporting fields. The colours are black and gold. Its current housemaster is Mr. Rod D. Olsen.</p>
<p><b>Kingsley:</b> Kingsley was one of the original four houses. It held both day and boarding students until 1950, when two boarding houses were created. In 1971, Kingsley House was divided to create Biggs and Hillary Houses. Canon Morris chose <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Kingsley_90d6.html" title="Charles Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a> as a 'Patron Hero', as he was seen as a Christian with a Viking's courage. History reveals Charles Kingsley to have been a man who practiced his Christian beliefs and followed his social conscience to help the less fortunate, with whom he chose to live. The Kingsley House motto translates to something like 'Do what you do well'. The house colours are black and white. Its current housemaster is Mr. Gary Bruce.</p>
<p><b>Magnus:</b> In 1935, Canon Morris implemented the house system at the school. Magnus is one of the original four day houses. The house is named after <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Magnus-the-Martyr_cbad.html" title="St Magnus-the-Martyr">St. Magnus</a>, Churchie's patron saint. Magnus has as its coat of arms a simple shield with St. Magnus holding a sword and a palm of martyrdom. This image of St. Magnus is from a stained-glass window in St. Magnus Cathedral in the Orkneys and dates back probably to the thirteenth century. The house motto is "Sibi Fidelis" ("be faithful to oneself"). The colours are maroon and royal blue. Its current housemaster is Mr. David Grogan.</p>
<p><b>Mansfield:</b> This day house was named after <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Alan_Mansfield_d53e.html" title="Sir Alan Mansfield">Sir Alan Mansfield</a>, a distinguished barrister, judge, chief justice and governor of Queensland. Sir Alan attended this school when it was known as St. Magnus Hall. To the boys of Mansfield House, Sir Alan provides an example of distinguished service to the public. Writing in the 'Old Boys' Scrapbook' in 1961, he said: "The real proof of the quality of a School, however, is to be found in the character of the men whom it has produced. Many of the Old Boys of this School have distinguished themselves in various walks of life and their names are well known, but it is not only by their achievements that the soul and spirit of this School can be gauged. It is to be seen in the character and conduct of many old boys whose names are not well known, but have infused them into everyday life of the community something that is healthy and good." This contribution to the community has been the result of one of the underlying principles emphasised by this school, namely, that true education of the individual depends not only upon what he gets from the school but also upon what he gives to the it - loyalty, honesty and service. Those are the true qualities of citizenship. The house crest borrows heavily from the Mansfield family coat of arms. The motto is 'Steadfast' and the house colours are white and blue. Its current housemaster is Mr. Shane L. Smith.</p>
<p><b>Mawson:</b> This house was named after <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Mawson_c92a.html" title="Douglas Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a>, a professor of geology and distinguished academic, who became famous for his discovery of the South Magnetic Pole in 1908 and his tragic second journey to Antarctica in 1911. He continued to visit and explore Antarctica up to 1931. To the members of Mawson House, Douglas Mawson provides an example of great strength of personal character. He would never let anyone do anything that he was not capable of doing himself, nor would he be deterred in the face of extreme hopelessness. His most famous characteristic was the fact that he had to prove himself because many people doubted his intelligence and stamina. He therefore provides the house members with a valuable role model and the message that we all have the ability to prove ourselves in all situations. The house motto is "Alis Austri", which translates to "On the wings of the South Wind". The coat of arms for the house includes the vessel Mawson used on his voyages south and the Southern Cross. The house colours are Red and Green. Its current housemaster is Mr. John A. Collins.</p>
<p><b>Nansen:</b> Nansen House, one of the original houses of the school, was named after <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fridtjof_Nansen_06c0.html" title="Fridtjof Nansen">Fridtjof Nansen</a>, whose distinguished career as a scientist, explorer and humanitarian has epitomised the true Viking spirit and has set a fine example for the boys of the House to follow. The Nansen House crest was established at Churchie in 1938; inscribed on the crest is the motto "Fram", which means "Forward". This motto reflects the proud tradition of service to the school and to the community and the involvement of its members in extracurricular and inter-house competitions. The house colours are green and white. Its current housemaster is Mr. Alan Greenbank.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_Grammar_School_77bc.html" title="Edit section: Boarding Houses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boarding Houses</span></h3>
<p>There are two boarding houses, both based on the school grounds.</p>
<p><b>Gerald:</b> Gerald was opened in 1934 as the need for new boarding accommodation grew. Prior to 1959, boarders took part in competitive sport as members of a day house. Thus you could live in Gerald but play sport for Magnus House. This changed in 1950 when the boarding houses became sporting competitors in their own right. The house was named after Archbishop Gerald Sharpe. The house crest shows the Bishop's mitre which symbolises the connection with Archbishop Sharpe; the large star signifies God; the two smaller stars king and country, and the five small stars signify truth, honesty, duty, comradeship, and charity.

<p>Churchie is a very strong debating school. In 2004 the Senior A team were semi-finalists in the Queensland Debating Union State Finals Series. In 2006, the Senior A team were placed third in the GPS Competition, as well as a number of other teams winning the premiership for their respective age groups, including the 10.1 debating, which finished the GPS season undefeated and brought home the premiership for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>In 2006, the 10.1 team not only won their respective GPS premiership, but, along with the 11.1 team, were also crowned state champions of the QDU Competition. This result helped secured Churchie the Queensland Debating Schools Cup, awarded to the most successful debating school in the state.</p>
