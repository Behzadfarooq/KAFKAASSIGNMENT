<p>Hi Angela!</p>
<p>Thanks for posting me the 'how to stay cool' advive&#160;! Yes i need to take a page out of the above comment by Dante 23:59. Because i do not as yet understand editorial policy or decisions whether all are truly objective or subjective, it get's a bit frustrating. When i first started I had a VfD for pasting my essay onto wiki before editing, fair enough protection from copyright infringement and plagarism; do you recommend i leave the page in its present state and work on something else&#160;? I really though i was offering something original and linkable. I tucked it away with Libraries now. So sorry for the bother but the 'elemental beast that is wiki , capricious and forgiving and appearing a draconian at times (according Cimron) is a hard creature to come to terms with. I need to know more about objectives, long-term plans, ownership of something if I am really to commit myself to writing for 'pedia. O well worse things happen at sea, at least by the talk it seemed to arouse some controversy, debate never being a bad thing. I just wish the person who propses a VfD would either contact the offender or perhaps remain anonymous, anything to avoid volatile insults in a virtual reality community. Hope i have not blotted eschutcheon too badly.

If you search for John Donisthorpe, none of the Google hits is relevant. So, anyway, I was saying to delete these 5 pages:</p>

<dd>Huh? They had more than 80% votes against. Its reasonable that the trend would continue. The notion that pages stay on for 7 days is obsolete.

<dd>Thanks again -- I got a bit carried away-- but I also got a better sense of how the whole process works-- Ive never been one of those people to sit by VFD-- I would like to discuss with you a change to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> to reduce the time necessary to delete a page to a vote level-- some of these get seven votes in a day-- seven negative votes in a row, would require at least 8 affirmative votes to keep it, eh? So there needs to be some math, and some reasonable interpretation of a trend going. So, considering that the <a href="../../../c/u/_/WP%7ECU_027e.html" title="WP:CU">cleanup</a> page will take a huge load off of VFD-- we can perhaps maintain the length of voting on VFD items, but will have to set some limits. Seven thumbs down by most standards is consensus. Im sure someone else will disagree, but we do have some leeway I think to delete pages after enough comment (maybe a 2 day grace pd.) because they can easily be recovered, as long as there's a link to. Some limits of comment on VFD may be necessary too. I will be out for a week starting Thursday, so I wont start anything new now-- just some inpoot. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">æ´&amp;#30505sv</a></dd>

<p>Re copyvio boilerplate: I don't intend to unrevert; I didn't know there was discussion and consensus on it. But the thing is awful; I don't know how much everybody else's copy buffer holds but mine holds only one thing at a time. Even the old way I had to have three windows open, one for the article, one for the place where it was taken from, and one for the VfD page; having to add that extra stuff that 99 times out of a hundred isn't even going to be used is just too much. I won't be tagging copyvios any more until this is more streamlined, and I doubt I'm alone.

<dd>That makes more sense then thanks, I'll use the Cleanup page from now on.

<p>Don't feel guilty, you did your job. You were meant to contact a developer, which you did. Erik and I both did the same thing when we arrived on the scene -- we said "nothing I can do", posted a brief comment, and left. I was getting complacent -- usually when anything happens at this time of the day, Brion is on to it immediately, and he contacts Jason and they sort out the problem between them. But this time, Brion wasn't around. It was only after a couple of hours with no word from Brion that I started to wonder what was going on.

<p>Foo! <i>Any</i> TLA is going to have more than one expansion! I was just trying to get ahead of the game and avoid having to <b>fix</b> all the links to <a href="../../../l/s/i/LSI_08bb.html" title="LSI">LSI</a> when someone added another expansion. If I'd known you were going to apply that rule, I'd have dug up some more instances on the spot and added them. I have done so now. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 23:12, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying we should create a disambiguation page for every TLA, even if there's nothing at all in them, just so that we have a complete set. However, I do think it's good to avoid work down the line, when 50 articles have been linked to "xxx", and we then discover we need to turn "xxx" into a disambiguation page. Having done quite a few of those now, as I'm sure you know it's no fun, and it just seemed so much easier (given how widespread TLA's are in the world, and therefore the likelihood of a later collision) to take one simple extra step now to avoid the chance of that extra work later.</dd>
<dd>I don't know if anyone is likely to link to LSI when meaning Latent Semantic Indexing, but I can point to actual cases of people who meant Movimiento Social Italiano (which I would consider equally obscure) linking to MSI, so your hypothetical may not be as unlikely as you think. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 00:00, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your reply at the pump. I understand the Bush list situation now, I mistakenly thought it had been resolved.

<p>&lt;rant&gt; How can I not. I came here very open about my own personal POV as a conservative on my user page in the spirit of openness. I vowed not to allow that personal POV to get in the way. I defended the community against the antics of JoeM and BuddhaInside who were essentially trolling to try and prove hypocrisy and liberal POV here. Rather than engage in an edit war I went in and inserted Wesley Clark's own view of the Kosovo incident in an effort to calm a draft-Clark supporter who was erasing the incident even though I can't stand Clark. I voted to delete the obnoxious Hillary list because it is ridiculous. I inserted <b>critical</b> statements about the Republican governor of my home state, a governor I have voted for multiple times. I wrote neutral articles about a reconstruction governor of my state <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Murphy_a7a7.html" title="Isaac Murphy">Isaac Murphy</a>. I wrote fair articles about 100 years of Democratic governors of my state. I rewrote the article about gay poet <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Merrill_c13d.html" title="James Merrill">James Merrill</a> so that it would not pass its VfD vote and be deleted. I have supported the homosexual list and fought the heterosexual list and the white people list. I supported LittleDan in his Non-liberals are stupid antic. I went in and rewrote the homophobic hate speech article to de-emphasize the overemphasized derogatory term that was causing such a fuss. I did all that because I promised to be neutral.</p>
<p>This week I tried to take out some POV comparisons inside the <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._William_Fulbright_770d.html" title="J. William Fulbright">J. William Fulbright</a> article that were basically making a critical analysis of George Bush's foreign policy in the guise of a biography of J. William Fulbright. I tried to neutralize the text not be critical of the particular administration of the moment while still keeping a generic criticism of American interventionism in general. What did I get? I got someone accusing me of being partisan for wanting neutral text and only one liberal defender chiming in to defend my neutral edit. I tried wikilove, I compromised, I tried to make suggestions, I explained why my text was less POV. But I didn't win because I decided to just let it stay rather than engage in an edit war.</p>
<p>What do I see now? This community willing to be blatantly hypocritical in deleting the partisan list of Hillary nicknames and keeping the partisan list of Bush nicknames. Will they feel the same when the first neo-Confederate arrives with the long list of anti-Lincoln nicknames? The list of derogatory Sun Myung Moon nicknames? The list of Joe Lieberman nicknames could get ugly. If I tried to put those nicknames in the article I would be booted out here but lists are ok. But the precedent is set with George Bush to keep all those (except Hillary so far). I feel pretty bad telling JoeM that he was wrong about this community and wrong to make silly tit-for-tat lists.</p>
<p>So how do I <b>not</b> judge this project now? I can do a few things, I can continue to do my little thing and try to be neutral and nice and watch <a href="../../../j/2E/_/Talk%7EJ._William_Fulbright_b827.html" title="Talk:J. William Fulbright">Talk:J. William Fulbright</a> happen a thousand times. Or I can change my utopian concept of NPOV to match what I see and instead of being neutral, be POV in a <i>fair and balanced</i> tit-for-tat way (add an Lincoln nickname list, put a little Bill Clinton analysis inside a George Washington article, etc.). Or I can say, thank you, it was fun, good luck, but its not what I thought it was.</p>
<p>I will not do the tit-for-tat game playing idea and I don't like looking the other way on obvious POV just so I can get a reputation as the resident wimpy little conservative doormat, so what else am I to do except take my last suggestion?&lt;/rant&gt; <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArk30inf_d1d1.html" title="User:Ark30inf">User:Ark30inf</a> 23:18, 13 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>a couple of comments on your deletion of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nicknames_for_George_W._Bush_2a69.html" title="List of nicknames for George W. Bush">List of nicknames for George W. Bush</a> page.</p>
<ol>
<li>I do not think that we have any policy that determines a percentage of votes necessary for deletion. If such a policy has been formed recently, let me know. Otherwise I will assume that our policy still stands that a "rough consensus" has to be achieved. What this usually means is that a couple of objectors can be ignored, especially when they are not regular users of the site or primary authors of the article. But if regulars strongly oppose deletion, this needs to be debated further, and it is quite possible that deletion cannot take place. I do not know if this was the case re: the Bush nicknames, but I don't think saying that "2/3" voted for deletion is proper justification under our present policy.</li>
<li>When you delete a contentious page, please do not delete its talk page. Long debates about deleted pages, except for the obvious cases, should remain accessible to everyone as a matter of public record. We can collect these on <a href="../../../a/r/c/Wikipedia%7EArchived_delete_debates_a169.html" title="Wikipedia:Archived delete debates">Wikipedia:Archived delete debates</a> and refer to them when similar cases arise.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure if the Bush nickname list should be undeleted (it did not provide many references for the nicknames, so I'm not too heartbroken about it), but please do keep in mind that, while "Votes for deletion" has <i>votes</i> in the title, it is not a formal vote but an attempt to reach consensus, especially among regular contributors to the site.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">âEloquence</a> 17:33, Oct 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed, it was Jimbo not Ed. Thanks for telling me. I knew about the comment on <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediator_0cec.html" title="User:Mediator">User:Mediator</a>, and I still think a log may have prevented the situation, because I think Jimbo would have been more likely to read a log than <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediator_0cec.html" title="User:Mediator">User:Mediator</a>.

<dd>The fact Martin would have unbanned the account is no more motive to admit the unblocking than the fact I did. There was all the explanations for the unblocking on the page. The reason given for initially blocking the user is that it was held by a banned user. When I unblocked the account, I was not a banned user, so I had the right to edit; I also did it in good faith, and did not breach any rules, since the account was not held by a banned user any more. But it is obvious that very very very few people admit I was acting in good faith. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">AnthÃ¨re</a> 10:49, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela. I wasn't actually voting on "<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_ONE_1e05.html" title="BBC ONE">BBC ONE</a>", though it's true I do think this all-capitalised style is a bit of an affectation. It's just a style thing the BBC have currently got, and I have no doubt that sometime within the next 10 years they'll rebrand their channels again to a more sensible BBC One or BBC 1. To my mind the numeric form of channel name seems more natural, but that's probably because I can remember when they first started having two channels, and they've used a digit for all except the last few years!&#160;:) I think if we were having a vote on channel names I'd settle for <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a> or <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_1_cdb2.html" title="BBC 1">BBC 1</a>, but ONE makes no sense as it doesn't represent an acronym.

<p>Thanks Angel&#160;!</p>
<p>Say...I understand quite little (if not none) what 142 is trying to suggest. What is that 3 forks idea&#160;??? AnthÃ¨re</p>
<p>I remember that at some point, on fr, someone suggested that for every "a bit complicated" article, there were 2 parts in an article, a clearly separated top with a very easy to understand definition (or introduction) to the topic. Then a line, and below a very fleshy complete article (complete, so with a new introduction fitting the complete article. Noone seems to really disagree with the idea.</p>
<p>Another proposition (which was an approach for NPOV actually) was that on most controversial topics, there be a sort of central and easy to understand at many levels of understanding from where several articles, each presenting a point of view, would branch. I know that severak people are interested by this notion of pov branching from a main article, these pov being very clearly identified as such.</p>
<p>That was just a thought. A topping in very very simple english might make sense, on top of a simple article. But at the maximum. Three is horribly confusing. Do you think we could agree on this&#160;? A top in very simple, then an article in simple. I must say I am not seeing well myself the level of english that must be respected. And still find confusing not to see very well who that wikipedia is adressing too. If it is for kids, it must be easy to read and very simple in content. If it is for adults, the content of some articles is not far from being insulting toward our intellectual abilities. I am still wondering...</p>

<p><b>GRE vs. Graduate Record Examination</b><br />
I'm under the impression that Wikipedia encourages people to use full names rather than abbreviations in article names, but I am not sure of that. The page <a href="../../../g/r/e/GRE_d874.html" title="GRE">GRE</a> does also exist, it just redirects to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduate_Record_Examination_92a0.html" title="Graduate Record Examination">Graduate Record Examination</a>, and so does <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduate_Readiness_Exam_6c7f.html" title="Graduate Readiness Exam">Graduate Readiness Exam</a> because I got it wrong myself to start off! Maybe we should should get some more input from other people. Unfortunately, I already moved TOEFL to <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_Of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_a974.html" title="Test Of English as a Foreign Language">Test Of English as a Foreign Language</a> before you and I started this conversation, but it too has a redirect now. Also, the <a href="../../../s/a/t/SAT_684e.html" title="SAT">SAT</a> pages are kinda inconsistent with the naming format they take, so we can't really model after those. If you want to move it back to GRE or TOEFL, feel free, I'm not attached to either format. I think it's an issue of consistency (throughout the Wikipedia) vs. ease of use.<br /></p>

<dd>Hi Angela. Last night's kerfuffle over Warwickshire prompted me to take a look at some of the Welsh counties, and I'm horrified to see that the ones I've looked at describe the pre 1974 counties rather than the post 1996 ones of the same name...

<p>Angela, on <a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith03_1a3e.html" title="User talk:Smith03">Smith03's talk page</a> you said that regarding the lists of nicknames of GWB and HRC, "both <i>were</i> deleted." However, <a href="../../../w/i/w/User%7EWiwaxia_c8bb.html" title="User:Wiwaxia">User:Wiwaxia</a> essentially incorporated the entire GWB list of nicknames straight into <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. That greatly upset ark30inf (see <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush">Talk:George W. Bush</a>), and I have to agree with him that the GWB article is basically a joke in regards to neutrality at this point. I think that whole "Public Image and Personality" section could and should be condensed to two or three paragraphs, but there's just too much muck to wade through. So, anyway, this was just one thing, but I'll bet it was a contributing factor in their decisions to leave. -- <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinesweeper_5696.html" title="User:Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> 05:49, Oct 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Angela, I saw your discussion with minesweeper. You said <i>but I think they are generalising what Wiwaxia does too much and taking it as a reflection of the whole community which I don't think it is.</i></p>
<p>You are misunderstanding why I left. I did not leave because of what some people do. I left because of what many people do not do. I took it upon myself, as a conservative, to stand up to JoeM. I could do that without charges of partisanship, whereas a liberal could not. I thought it a duty to add Wesley Clark's defense of himself to his article even though I do not like the man. I thought it my duty to add the common liberal criticisms of my conservative governor who I have voted for twice. I thought it my duty to fight against the anti-homosexual slogan "AKFD" even though I am about as far from a homosexual activist as you can get. I thought it my duty to get rid of the list of derogatory nicknames of Hillary Clinton even though I have probably used several of them at one time. But the nicknames of George Bush still sit in his article even though they were voted for deletion. Not ONE liberal has stood up to get those out of there. It is left to Smith03 and myself to argue about them. I don't know about Smith03, but I feel uncomfortable removing liberal POV from the George Bush article, it should be liberals writing for the enemy and demanding NPOV of their liberal brethren just as I did of JoeM. Writing for the enemy does not seem to have a high priority, policing you own POV does not have as high a priority as policing the other guy's POV does, there is no demand from the community for this type of writing for the enemy behavior. The strategy seems to be to let the partisans fight it out and put offsetting crap into articles rather than demanding NPOV.</p>
<p>I have read thousands of American Civil War books, Civil War letters, the official records, journals, and newspapers of the time. I know a great deal about many of the complexities of the war and the run up to the war. I know about the differences between the upper South and lower South, the differences in the Southern views as the war progressed, the differences in Northern views as the war progressed, the reasons why Kansas became such a focal point, etc., etc. I recently suggested on the talk page that the article was currently simplistic and "lowest common denominator as to the causes of the war and contained none of these complexities. I was immediately set upon as a potential southern revisionist/slavery defender. I only commented on the talk page...imagine if I had actually edited the article. Can anyone look at my contributions on <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Murphy_a7a7.html" title="Isaac Murphy">Isaac Murphy</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Colored_Troops_9908.html" title="United States Colored Troops">United States Colored Troops</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_Lawrence_Chamberlain_ba82.html" title="Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain">Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain</a> and think that I am not serious and am some sort of revisionist anti-yankee bastard? Please. The fact is, that I would never be able to edit the American Civil War article without a huge fight despite my knowledge of the subject. My neutrality is automatically suspect because I am a Southerner. The fact is, I should not be responsible for that. Some Yankee should be writing for the enemy to make damn sure that the Southern view is presented correctly and I should be writing a fair piece about the abolitionist point of view.</p>
<p>And finally, you remember, I mentioned J. William Fulbright. In that article criticism of Bush and the current war in Iraq was inserted in the Fulbright article despite the fact that Fulbright was talking about the Vietnam war and was dead before the Bush administration ever came to power. Suppose you had an article about a critic of Richard Nixon and inserted a comparison of Bill Clinton's actions with those of Nixon's into the article? Would it belong there? No and I would revert it despite the fact I might say it <i>on my own time</i>. But no liberal except DanKeshet (thanks Dan) tried to police that POV and it remains there. I expected the community to reject it, not just me and Smith03. It was not my place to police the liberal POV since I am not a liberal. It was my place to police the conservative JoeM's of the world. It was uncomfortable for me to have to police liberal POV, it opened me to charges of partisanship, I was much more comfortable policing people with my own views and defending NPOV against them.</p>
<p>You have the "anal sex" thing in the Santorum article. That piece of obscure bilge from a minor 'zine' is up for VfD. Somebody tried to move it INTO the Santorum article itself, and then move it into the "word coinage" article. Sheesh. Who had to fight that? Smith03 did. He did not want to see it snuck off into those articles to avoid the VfD vote like the Bush nicknames did. But it should not have been the conservative Smith03 that had to do that.</p>
<p>I hope that clears up what I was disappointed about. It was not the trolls. Writing for the enemy should be demanded by the community, policing your own POV against fellow partisans should be demanded by the community. I don't think it really is. This is the last I will say on the issue of my leaving. I have no interest in arguing with anyone on this and I could be wrong. But its the perception I have of the community and why I have left. Thanks again. --Ark30inf</p>

<p>Hi Angela - I've been editing the page for <a href="../../../s/u/l/Suleiman_the_Magnificent_4f7d.html" title="Suleiman the Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a>, and there is something odd going on. Linking forward to his successor, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selim_II_6dc6.html" title="Selim II">Selim II</a>, and then back to Selim's predecessor goes back to a seemingly different page (apparently at .. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_I" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_I" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_I</a>) . However, when this page is opened for editing, it turns out to have the expected content after all - but it is not displayed as such! Something for the technical people, perhaps? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Martland_bcf8.html" title="User:David Martland">David Martland</a> 06:51, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks - your refreshing the cache seems to have done the trick. Is this something that anyone can do, or is it only people with admin privileges, such as yourself? If the latter, is it best to just wait a while - problems will fix themselves, or to contact one of you - e.g mav, brion etc? If the latter, who is best placed? Maybe there could be a refresh request page - I haven't checked to see if there is one! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Martland_bcf8.html" title="User:David Martland">David Martland</a> 10:04, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Finding dictionaries with pronunciations for placenames/familynames it not so easy, but</p>
<ul>
<li>The American Heritage Dictionary thinks it is pronounced 'Winzer'</li>
<li>as does <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/nm/w.html" class="external text" title="http://www.behindthename.com/nm/w.html" rel="nofollow">Behind the Name</a></li>

</ul>

I was unable to find any links claiming these are wrong.</p>

<dd>But surely if we are being really picky we might say win-d-zor - but mostly I think we do actually say 'winzer' (or even 'winza') as suggested - though Brits might put the accent slightly differently from others? On balance I think that the American HD is more or less right! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Martland_bcf8.html" title="User:David Martland">David Martland</a> 10:10, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My 'winzer' was attempting to represent <a href="../../../s/a/m/SAMPA_English_0d82.html" title="SAMPA/English">SAMPA</a> /wInZ@/ - and is i think the same as your 'win-za'. I dare say this is how the Queen pronounces it. ;) (I noticed her pronounce 'Enhance' with a northern A once!) The d is not important (although I rarely hear it spoken), but the main points were to establish that it is not /waIn/, and not /O:/ - ie not "wined-sore". <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 16:07, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, Thanks for helping out. Perhaps the two aren't the same person yet they seem to working together hand in glove. For one thing, why on earth would Nydigovoth have been lurking on the Wikipedia IRC in the first place if he was not already involved in the project? Second, for a newbie who started editing early yesterday evening, Nydigovoth knows all the ropes. He immediately started making lots of edits, vocally defended them, and within an hour nominated someone for sysop! My suspicions remain. Also, as a point of etiquette, is there a convention w.r.t removing text from public (ie, non-User:) Talk pages? Nydigovoth removed my suggestion the two were the same and <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandros_406d.html" title="User:Alexandros">Alexandros</a>'s refutation that they were not from <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProblem_users_555a.html" title="Wikipedia:Problem users">Wikipedia:Problem users</a>.

<dd>Hi once more, I never know whether to answer on my own page or here. Do you watch other people's User pages when you leave a message? Anway, I just left a note on <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandros_406d.html" title="User:Alexandros">Alexandros</a>'s page apologizing for thinking he was Nydigovoth. It was late last night and I got irritated by Nydigovoth's stupid antics at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaux_Hemingway_d484.html" title="Margaux Hemingway">Margaux Hemingway</a>. I have sysop powers now and I could have just as easily protected the page myself, but I had reverted his changes a few times and I was leery about being reproached for misusing privileges, especially as he seemed to know his way around. I don't know, seemed like a grey area. What would you have done?</dd>
<dd>You are right though: just a troll. How much time I wasted on this... Now on to more interesting things. Bye for now, <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 21:46, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela. Thanks for moving the stuff from the Vandalism page to 80.255's talk page. I don't know where else you could have moved it -- there are so many counties to consider! I have to say I <i>really</i> don't like the way this 'historic county' business is putting misleading info on many of the county pages, on the other hand I can see how someone with a bee in their bonnet can argue as 80.255 has, even though it's totally irrelevant to how most people refer to counties today, so I'm loath to declare him a problem user. As far as I'm concerned, Warrington is in Cheshire and the fact that it used to be in Lancashire is of little interest! I don't really want to start editing counties if it's going to set off lots of edit wars, OTOH if each article has to be nearly doubled in size to fully describe both the historical and current counties of the same name that's going to be a hell of a job... -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 00:09, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
