<p><b>Anglo-Saxon military</b> organization is difficult to analyze. This is due to the fact that there are many contrasting records, as well as many debates by modern historians as to the precise occurrences and procedures. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> England was known for its tumultuous nature. The constant presence of outside threats and dangers made it necessary for a solid military to constantly be in place. Even though there is some controversy as to the accurate forms of military organization, one is able to deduce some aspects of from the records that have been preserved. Though the clarity of the military organization has been lost, it is still very prominent in Anglo-Saxon society. =</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Military_6a2b.html" title="Edit section: Tactics and Strategies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics and Strategies</span></h2>
<p>In the actual battles, there were many tactics and strategies that were used. There was a division between armies who fought on land and on sea. In some instances, the two would combine their efforts to provide a more effective defense against the approaching armies. In this instance, the fyrds aboard the ships would strategically place their seamen on the shore or would arm themselves to provide a suitable defense towards the oncoming attackers. In the same fashion, both the great fyrd and the select fyrd would combine their efforts in battle in order to defeat opposing armies.</p>
<p>The tactics for land battle is another issue which has spawned much debate. The conflict lies in how the armies engaged in battle. Some historians believe that horses were used, though most argue that the battles took place on foot. <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">Infantry</a> battles are reported in many texts from the period, though it is also written that horses were present during the battles. Some historians have compromised and suggested that the armies would ride their horses to battle, only to get off of them once the actual fighting had begun.</p>
<p>The strength of the Ango-Saxon army is another issue which cannot be agreed upon by scholars. Some believe that the army was weak and only used infantry as a means of defense and battle; whereas others believe that the army was much more powerful, employing both infantry and cavalry. The former argument suggests that the infantry, though great, did not possess an enormous deal of power. The Anglo-Saxons did not, in theory, carry many high powered weapons and nor did they have archers or other missile weapons. Also, only some of the men who were sent to battle, namely the select fyrd, were actually trained to fight. Because of this much of the battles were seen as disorganized and fruitless. The theory of the inefficiency of the Anglo-Saxons has been challenged by some historians who claim that it is impossible for them to have created such a brutally dismal army. Later in the century, the English managed to win numerous battles with some ease.</p>
<p>There are some battles in which scholars generally agree on which tactics and methods were used. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">battle of Hastings</a>, in <a href="../../../1/0/6/1066.html" title="1066">1066</a>, demonstrates some interesting military tactics. At Hastings, the soldiers were organized in such a fashion that the best soldiers were in the front line, and the less adequate fighters in the following lines. They formed a tightly packed wall, protecting the areas behind them. Though this seems like a rather ineffective method, it was in fact rather effective at repelling the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">Cavalry</a>. This strategy was also used in the battle of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherston.html" title="Sherston">Sherston</a> in <a href="../../../1/0/1/1016.html" title="1016">1016</a>, only with a slight difference. Instead of simply standing in a solitary position, the army moved to the opposing line as a large solid group. They moved very slowly and managed to maintain their formation while advancing on the enemy. This tactic was further developed and used in the crusades. The same procedure would take place, however at an eventual point in the advance; a hole would open in the wall of soldiers to allow a charge of cavalry to attack the opposition. Military tactics did developed gradually throughout the Anglo-Saxon period. Though there is still much debate as to how efficient the soldiers and the fighting was, it is clear that as the ages progressed, so to did the power and intelligence of the army.</p>
