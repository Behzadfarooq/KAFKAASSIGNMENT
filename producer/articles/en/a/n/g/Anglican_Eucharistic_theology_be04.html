<p><b>Anglican Eucharistic theology</b> is divergent in practice, reflecting the essential comprehensiveness of the tradition. Some few <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Church_f3c3.html" title="Low Church">Low Church</a> Anglicans, expressing a <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwinglian.html" title="Zwinglian">Zwinglian</a> ethos, tend to take a strictly <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorialism.html" title="Memorialism">memorialist</a> view of the sacrament. In other words, they see Holy Communion as a memorial to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>'s suffering, and participation in the Eucharist as both a re-enactment of the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Supper_561f.html" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</a> and a foreshadowing of the heavenly banquet -- the fulfillment of the Eucharistic promise. Most Low Church Anglicans believe in the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Presence_d1d0.html" title="Real Presence">Real Presence</a> but merely deny that the presence of Christ is carnal or can be localised in the bread and wine. Some <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Church_593a.html" title="High Church">High Church</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Catholic_1507.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> Anglicans hold closely to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> doctrine of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transubstantiation.html" title="Transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a>, first promulgated by <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholasticism.html" title="Scholasticism">Scholastic</a> theologians in the Middle Ages. This sees the Eucharist as a re-enactment of Christ's <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement.html" title="Atonement">atoning</a> sacrifice, with the elements transformed into Christ's <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessed_Sacrament_74dd.html" title="Blessed Sacrament">Body and Blood</a>.</p>
<p>Most Anglicans, however, implicitly or explicitly adopt the Eucharistic theology of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consubstantiation.html" title="Consubstantiation">consubstantiation</a>, first articulated by the <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lollards.html" title="Lollards">Lollards</a>, or <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramental_Union_4c71.html" title="Sacramental Union">Sacramental Union</a>, first articulated by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>. Luther's analogy of Christ's presence was that of the heat of a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horseshoe.html" title="Horseshoe">horseshoe</a> thrust into a fire until it is glowing. In the same way, Christ is present in the bread and the wine.</p>

<dd><i>Main article: <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_sacraments.html" title="Anglican sacraments">Anglican sacraments</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>With the Eucharist, as with other aspects of theology, Anglicans are largely directed by the principle of <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_orandi%2C_lex_credendi.html" title="Lex orandi, lex credendi">lex orandi, lex credendi</a> (ie., "the law of prayer is the law of belief"). In other words, sacramental theology as it pertains to the Eucharist is sufficiently and fully articulated by the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> of a given jurisdiction. As defined by the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_Century_f644.html" title="16th Century">16th Century</a> Anglican divine, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hooker_%28theologian%29_58fc.html" title="Richard Hooker (theologian)">Richard Hooker</a>, a sacrament is defined as "an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace." It thus has the effect of conveying <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctification.html" title="Sanctification">sanctification</a> on the individual participating in the sacramental action. In the Eucharist, the outward and visible sign is that of bread and wine, while the inward and spiritual grace is that of the presence of Christ (either symbolically or actually).</p>
<p>Sacraments have both <i>form</i> and <i>matter.</i> A <i>form</i> is the verbal and physical liturgical action, while the <i>matter</i> refers to any material objects used. In the Anglican Eucharist, the form is contained in the Rite and its <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubrics_%28ecclesiastical%29.html" title="Rubrics (ecclesiastical)">rubrics</a>, as articulated in the authrorized <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missal.html" title="Missal">missal</a> of the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical province</a>. Central to the Rite is the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharistic_Prayer_b48e.html" title="Eucharistic Prayer">Eucharistic Prayer</a>, or "Great Thanksgiving." The matter is the bread and the wine.</p>
<p>For all Anglicans, the <i><a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a></i> (also called "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Communion_f177.html" title="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a>," "<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass.html" title="Mass">Mass</a>," or "the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Supper_40a8.html" title="Lord's Supper">Lord's Supper</a>"), is the central act of gathered worship, and is the means by which Christ becomes present to the Christian community gathered in his name. For the majority of Anglicans, this event constitutes the renewal of the Body of Christ as the Church through the reception of the Body of Christ as the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessed_Sacrament_74dd.html" title="Blessed Sacrament">Blessed Sacrament</a>, his spiritual body and blood. In this sacrament, Christ is both encountered and incorporated. As such, the Eucharistic action looks backward as a memorial of Christ's sacrifice, forward as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet, and to the present as an <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">Incarnation</a> of Christ in the lives of the community and of individual believers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Eucharistic_theology_be04.html" title="Edit section: Varieties of Eucharistic theology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Varieties of Eucharistic theology</span></h2>
<p>Anglican <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">incarnational</a> theology emphasizes the importance of God using the mundane and temporal as a means of giving people the transcendent and eternal. For many who hold such a view, they consider the manifestation of Christ in the Eucharistic elements to belong to the realm of spirit and eternity, and not to be about Christ's corporeal presence. This "middle view" does not necessarily negate memorialist and transubstantiationist views, but instead allows for a comprehensive range of perspectives and for an emphasis on the fundamental mystery of how Christ is present. This respect for the mystery of the Real Presence is reflected in the aphorism attributed by some to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Donne_3c1c.html" title="John Donne">John Donne</a>, by others to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_4e8e.html" title="Elizabeth I">Elizabeth I</a> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/100/145.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/100/145.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>: "<i>He was the Word that spake it; He took the bread and brake it; And what that Word did make it, I do believe and take it</i>" without any further explicit detail.</p>
<p><a name="Transubstantiationism" id="Transubstantiationism"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Eucharistic_theology_be04.html" title="Edit section: Transubstantiationism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transubstantiationism</span></h3>
<p>Article XXVIII of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty-Nine_Articles_3b7d.html" title="Thirty-Nine Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a> declares that "Transubstantiation...cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthrowtheth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions." Nonetheless, a minority of <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Church_593a.html" title="High Church">High Church</a> Anglicans adhere to this view, at least implicitly.

<p>The concept of <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorialism.html" title="Memorialism">Memorialism</a> is largely found in the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Sydney_4389.html" title="Diocese of Sydney">Diocese of Sydney</a> of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Australia_9135.html" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a>.

Instead, they adopt a <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinistic.html" title="Calvinistic">Calvinistic</a> (Spiritual Presence) or <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwinglian.html" title="Zwinglian">Zwinglian</a> (Dynamic Memorialism) view of the Eucharist, resembling views held by other denominations such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterians.html" title="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a>.

<p><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cranmer_521e.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, principal author of the first <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>, wrote on the Eucharist in his treatise <i>On the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Lord's Supper</i> that Christians truly receive Christ's "self-same" Body and Blood at Communion--but in "an heavenly and spiritual manner". He also maintains in the 39 Articles that the "wicked" only consume the elements and do not receive Christ. In some ways, Cranmer's Eucharistic doctrine resembles the idea of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transignification.html" title="Transignification">transignification</a>.</p>
<p>This view has tended to predominate in Anglican Eucharistic theological discourse and practice. A common maxim in Anglicanism concerning Christ's presence in the matter is that "it may not be about a change of substance, but it is about a substantial change." This view is expressed in the allied but <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysically</a> different doctrines of consubstantiation and Sacramental Union. In sum, both views hold that Christ is present in the Eucharistic elements spiritually. Such spiritual presence may or may not be in bodily form, depending on the doctrine with which one allies oneself. Many contemporary Anglicans would concur with the views of the 19th Century divine <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Bouverie_Pusey_36cb.html" title="Edward Bouverie Pusey">Edward Bouverie Pusey</a>, who argued strongly for the Lutheran idea of Sacramental Union. In this doctrine, the Bread and Wine do not disappear at the consecration, but that the Body and Blood become present without diminishing them.</p>
<p>While a consubstantionist or Sacramental Union view is typically associated with the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Church_d7f0.html" title="Broad Church">Broad Church</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latitudinarian.html" title="Latitudinarian">Latitudinarian</a> camps of Anglicanism, it is also widely held by those who would identify with the evangelical or Anglo-Catholic wings.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a> for Eucharist is important in Anglican Eucharistic theology because of the principle of lex orandi, lex credendi. The liturgy is derived from the authorised prayer books of the national churches and ecclesiastical provinces of the Communion. The structure of the liturgy, crafted in the tradition of the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_Settlement_743e.html" title="Elizabethan Settlement">Elizabethan Settlement</a>, allows for a variety of theological interpretations, and generally follows the same rough shape, derived from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Some or all of the following elements may be altered or absent depending on the rite used by the province or national church:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Liturgy of The Word
<ul>
<li><b>The Gathering of the Community</b>: Beginning with a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarian_formula.html" title="Trinitarian formula">Trinitarian</a>-based greeting or <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgical_year.html" title="Liturgical year">seasonal</a> acclamation; followed by the prayer of humble approach; the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_in_Excelsis_Deo_4884.html" title="Gloria in Excelsis Deo">Gloria in Excelsis Deo</a>, <a href="../../../k/y/r/Kyrie_eleison.html" title="Kyrie eleison">Kyrie eleison</a>, and/or <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trisagion.html" title="Trisagion">Trisagion</a>; and then the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collect.html" title="Collect">Collect</a> of the day.

<li>The Liturgy of The Eucharist
<ul>
<li><b>The Celebration of the Eucharist</b>: The gifts of bread and wine are received, along with other gifts (such as money and/or food for a food bank, etc.), and an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offertory.html" title="Offertory">offertory</a> prayer is recited. Following this, a <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharistic_Prayer_b48e.html" title="Eucharistic Prayer">Eucharistic Prayer</a> (called "The Great Thanksgiving") is offered. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Sursum_Corda_3a80.html" title="Sursum Corda">Sursum Corda</a>), a preface, the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctus.html" title="Sanctus">sanctus</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictus.html" title="Benedictus">benedictus</a>, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Words_of_Institution_74e4.html" title="Words of Institution">Words of Institution</a>, and the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiclesis.html" title="Epiclesis">epiclesis</a>.

<p>The rubrics of a given prayer book outline the parameters of acceptable practice with regard to ritual, <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestments.html" title="Vestments">vestments</a>, ornaments, and method and means of distribution of the sacrament. The communal piety of a given parish or diocese will determine the expression of these rubrics, and thus the implicit eucharistic theology maintained by the congregation.</p>
<p>Until the latter part of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_Century_16f1.html" title="19th Century">19th Century</a>, the so-called "Ornaments Rubric" of the 1662 Prayer Book inhibited much of the ceremonial contemporary Anglicans take for granted. Priests were directed to stand at the north side or north end of the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a>, candles on the altar were forbidden, as was the wearing of a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasuble.html" title="Chasuble">chasuble</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maniple_%28vestment%29.html" title="Maniple (vestment)">maniple</a>.

<p>In many <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Church_f3c3.html" title="Low Church">Low Church</a> parishes, ceremonial is kept at a minimum. The priest may be attired simply in a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassock.html" title="Cassock">cassock</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surplice.html" title="Surplice">surplice</a>, and a black scarf (called a <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tippet.html" title="Tippet">tippet</a>). This is a priest's "<a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir_habit.html" title="Choir habit">choir habit</a>," as opposed to Eucharistic vestments. Manual action may be kept to the minimum standards of the rubrics (often confined to placing one's hands on the elements during the Words of Institution). <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candle.html" title="Candle">Candles</a> may be absent, and the material on the altar limited to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalice_%28cup%29.html" title="Chalice (cup)">chalice</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paten.html" title="Paten">paten</a>. The celebration of Eucharist may be weekly, or even less frequent (such as monthly or quarterly). This infrequency is in keeping with the Anglican practice that predominated prior to the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_9dae.html" title="20th Century">20th Century</a>. There is little or no attention given to the unconsumed bread and wine. It is usually consumed, and only rarely reserved.</p>

<p>In most <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Church_d7f0.html" title="Broad Church">Broad Church</a> parishes, there is slightly more elaboration. Attending the Eucharist at a Broad Church parish nowadays is likely to remind one most directly of attending a contemporary Roman Catholic Mass. The priest will be vested in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alb.html" title="Alb">alb</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stole.html" title="Stole">stole</a>, and - in some instances - a chasuble. He or she may make use of a <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lavabo.html" title="Lavabo">lavabo</a> in preparation for the celebration, and the chalice and paten may be initially concealed by a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burse.html" title="Burse">burse</a> and ornamental veil. Candles will almost always be present on the altar. Broad Church Anglicans typically celebrate Communion every Sunday, or at least most Sundays. The Rite may also be celebrated once or twice at other times during the week. The reserved sacrament is usually kept in an aumbry or consumed. Broad Church Anglicans may not reverence the sacrament, as such, but will frequently bow when passing the altar</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Catholic_1507.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> worship involves further elaboration. The priest will often be joined by a <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacon</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdeacon.html" title="Subdeacon">subdeacon</a>, fully dressed in the historic Eucharistic vestments specific to their office (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasuble.html" title="Chasuble">chasuble</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmatic.html" title="Dalmatic">dalmatic</a>, and <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunicle.html" title="Tunicle">tunicle</a>, respectively). They will sometimes wear maniples and ornamented <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amice.html" title="Amice">amices</a>. In many churches, the altar will be fixed against the "east wall," and the sacred ministers will perform the Mass facing the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_tabernacle.html" title="Church tabernacle">tabernacle</a> (often surmounted by a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifix.html" title="Crucifix">crucifix</a>) above the altar, i.e., the sacred ministers and the congregation will all be facing the same direction. Apart from the tabernacle (containing the reserved sacrament), the altar is often adorned with six candles. <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incense.html" title="Incense">Incense</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctus_bell.html" title="Sanctus bell">sanctus bells</a> are often used during the liturgy, and the Eucharist itself is supplemented by a number of so-called "secret prayers" uttered by the presiding celebrant. Needless to say, the lavabo and burse and veil are unfailingly used in Anglo-Catholic ceremonial.</p>
<p>High Church/Anglo-Catholic Eucharistic theology places an emphasis on frequent Communion, ideally daily. The unconsumed elements are typically reserved in a tabernacle, either attached to a fixed altar, or placed behind or to one side of a free-standing altar. When the sacrament is present, Anglo-Catholics will <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genuflect.html" title="Genuflect">genuflect</a> when passing in front of it. When absent, they will bow to the altar. Often, the <a href="../../../a/u/m/Aumbry.html" title="Aumbry">aumbry</a> is dignified in the same way. Many Anglo-Catholics practice <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharistic_adoration.html" title="Eucharistic adoration">Eucharistic adoration</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benediction_of_the_Blessed_Sacrament_492c.html" title="Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament">Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, either informally or through a corporate liturgical rite.</p>

<p>While the matter is unfailingly bread or wine, there is variation. The bread may be in the form of individual wafers or an actual loaf, from which pieces are torn off and distributed. Wine is typically red, but may be white (to avoid unsightly staining of the linen purificators which wipe the chalice rim after each administration). In some instances, fortified wine such as <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherry.html" title="Sherry">sherry</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_wine.html" title="Port wine">port wine</a> is used. In still others, the option of juice is offered, usually in consideration of recipients who may be <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> (although it is perfectly acceptable and valid to receive the sacrament only in one kind, i.e., the bread).</p>
<p>Modes of administration vary. Many Anglican parishes retain the use of an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar_rails.html" title="Altar rails">altar rail</a>, separating the area around the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a> from the rest of the church. This practice is meant to convey the sanctity associated with the altar. In such churches, those who wish to receive Communion will come forward and kneel at the altar rail, sometimes making the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sign_of_the_cross.html" title="Sign of the cross">sign of the cross</a> and cupping their hands (right over left) to receive the bread, then crossing themselves again to receive the chalice. Anglo-Catholic Anglicans are often careful not to chew the bread (hence the popularity of wafers in Anglo-Catholic parishes) or touch the chalice. Indeed, some prefer to have the bread placed directly on their tongue. In other parishes, recipients stand before the administrators to receive Communion, while in still others, participants may communicate one another, often standing in a circle around the altar. The practice of using individual cups (derisively called "shot glasses" or "<a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooters.html" title="Shooters">shooters</a>") and handing out individual wafers or pieces of bread to be consumed simultaneously by the whole congregation is extremely uncommon in Anglicanism, but not unheard of.</p>
<p>Anglican practice is that those who administer the sacrament (that is, distribute the bread and the wine) must be licensed by the diocesan <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a>. Traditionally, priests and deacons were the only ones authorised to administer; however, many provinces now permit the licensing of so-called "lay administrators." In some localities, a lay-person is restricted to distributing the wine, while the clergy administer the bread.</p>
<p>The question of who may receive communion likewise varies. In historic Anglican practice, the altar was "fenced" from those whose manner of living was considered to be unrepentantly sinful. As parishes grew and the private lives of individuals became less accessible to public knowledge, this practice receded — although priests will, on occasion, refuse to admit to the altar those whom they know to be actively engaged in notoriously sinful behaviour, such as criminal activity. Most Anglican provinces keep an "open table," that is, all <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptised</a> Christians are welcome to receive Communion. In many others, access to the sacrament is reserved for those who have been both baptised and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation.html" title="Confirmation">Confirmed</a>, either in the Anglican or affiliated denomination. Those who are ineligible or do not wish to receive are frequently encouraged to come forward and cross their arms across their chest in order to indicate that they wish to receive a blessing.</p>

<p>In many Anglican dioceses, reservation of the sacrament other than for use with the sick is not authorised. In these cases, reverent consumption or disposal is often practiced. When disposed, the elements may be broken/poured over the earth or placed down a "piscina" in sacristy, a sink with a pipe that leads underground to a pit or into the earth. What is done with the remaining elements is often reflective of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchmanship.html" title="Churchmanship">churchmanship</a>. <a href="http://www.anglicanjournal.com/opinion/029/article/dealing-with-eucharistic-leftovers-can-cause-deep-offence/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anglicanjournal.com/opinion/029/article/dealing-with-eucharistic-leftovers-can-cause-deep-offence/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>In other Anglican jurisdictions, reservation is permissible. Some parishes will place the sacrament (along with holy oils) in an aumbry - a cupboard inserted in the wall of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancel.html" title="Chancel">chancel</a>. As mentioned above, Anglo-Catholic parishes will often make use of a tabernacle, with which is associated various acts of reverence and adoration.</p>
