<dd>Yes; when an article is deleted and the AfD closed as such, it is common for the discussion page to be deleted as well. However, this is a unique circumstance; the AfD was first closed as delete, with both the article and talk page deleted. Following that, though, the AfD was re-opened and the article, but not the talk page, restored. If the article is kept, I'll restore the talk page and merge this discussion in, but for now I'll leave it at the status quo.

<dd>Difficult. On principle, I dislike the idea of decreasing the usefulness of a biographical article because of the whims of the subject (regardless of how respected the subject). On the other hand, it's good to be polite to people and respect their wishes; I'm just not sure we should do so at the expense of article quality. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 00:01, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Go with the replacement.

<dd>She is not—to the best of my knowledge. The article did talk one time about who she was "romantically involved" with, but I removed this mention as being thoroughly unencyclopedic.

<dd>"Elected into the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation in 2004, she is the vice-president of Wikia, a commercial wiki hosting company, and acts as a consultant to Ourmedia."</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Into" a board doesn't make sense. The joining of the first two sentences makes it sound like Wikia has something to do with Wikimedia, which it doesn't. Wikia is not a commercial wiki hosting company - it runs Wikicities, which could be described as that but that's not exactly what it is, and Wikia certainly isn't that since it started as a company to create a search engine. I don't see why they fact I co-founded Wikicities was removed. "Acts as a consultant" to Ourmedia seems a weird unsourced phrase. Why not leave it as the more accurate statement that I'm on their advisory board? The smh link would be better as a link to the article in <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/next/quest-for-the-universal-wiki/2005/11/21/1132421577605.html" class="external text" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/next/quest-for-the-universal-wiki/2005/11/21/1132421577605.html" rel="nofollow">The Age</a>, where it was originally published rather than a copy of that article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 11:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've never lived in Prahran. Ourmedia is not newly launched. Who I live with is not encyclopedic information. Some slides from one of a dozen presentations in not a useful link, and it's not even a proper copy of the final slides I used, but a draft version I sent in advance. I go to conferences every month, so I don't see why WikiSym is being singled out.

<p>Angie: Please indicate on this talk page if "Community Relations" is inappropriately linked to "public relations". These non-standard job titles can be a little confusing sometimes.

No such bias exists, or at least logically should exist, with basic factual information and information regarding organization structural changes. As such, I've restored the Wikimedia Foundation ref, moved the Meta page to the "official" copy of the press release (C'mon, I know it was easier to just blanket delete, but you couldn't take 10 seconds?), and restored The Age reference, which should not have been deleted in the first place.

<p>There are two new proposals being discussed in the TALK page of WP:BLP. One would create a policy in which biographies could not be created for living people on Wikipedia UNTIL they had already been the subject of substantial biography in other published sources. This would address the <i>notability creap problem</i> which naturally results from Wikipedia having far more bio space than Britannica, and the Parkinson's law need to fill it.</p>
<p>My own proposal is even more stringent (although it also includes the no first bio policy): I propose that any living person be given the option to request that Wikipedia carry no dedicated biographical article on them at all (although biographical material would still appear on members of teams and bands and so on, it would be under a different heading and would therefore be strictly topical, with trivia and personal detail left out).</p>
<p>So far, it looks like my own suggestion has not been doing well-- it seems that people are crazy to read about Bill Clinton's sex life on Wikipedia, and nowhere else (even though of course thera are multiple and more detailed sources out there if you're really into that sort of thing).</p>
<p>Either of these proposals would make Ms. Beesley happy. It will be interesting to see if she gets satisfaction without them. If she does, it will because of a sort of favoritism which isn't shown to the general semi-notable person who has to suffer through Wiki bios on themselves. So I follow the case with interest. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 08:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC) <a name="Question" id="Question"></a></p>

<dd><i>Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly common for people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information. When in doubt about the notability of the person in question, or if the subject of a biography complains about the publication of his or her date of birth, err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date.</i></dd>

<p>This is for others as well. Since I haven't been following this closely, and I would like to have voiced in on an AfD, consider this a comment to be copied to the next AfD that takes place. It's for "strong delete."</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines have a item regarding being published in multiple news sources as the _primary subject_ (uncle G overlooked this last part before). I have done a google news search for "Angela Beesley" and it would seem that she's not a primary subject in even one, just a person who happened to be mention as a board member and founder of some projects. It would also seem that several of the very few results weren't from a news source anyone has heard of. I think people are trying really hard to justify it simply because she's associated with teh project, but realistically, even in notable news mentions of Wikipedia, she's almost always just a brief mention.</p>

<p>The Register reports that "One of the most prominent evangelists for the site, Angela Beesley, recently resigned from the board of the non-profit that runs Wikipedia, the WikiMedia Foundation, in the hope of having her own entry removed from Wikipedia."<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> If the Register says she is "prominent" then deleting her would be vandalism? You can't get unfamous. It doesn't work that way. Once you are known, you can't cry "I want a do-over." This is reality. She played a key role in a world famous enterprise. She sought publicity as an evalgelist for wikipedia. Pretending to be an unknown is simply not a workablr option at this point. She could change her name or go incognito, but she wishes to continue to be associated with Jimbo, Wikia, and Wikipedia. Frankly, trying to be delisted from Wikipedia is just one more noteable thing about her (maybe on purpose for all I know, but I don't really care). The bottom line is just let it go and stop fighting to delist a noteable person. Further efforts just look like an attempt to increase noteability by creating controversy. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 03:43, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without commenting on Angela's notability, just because <i>The Register</i> says she is "one of the most prominent evangelists," doesn't mean that she meets notability. <i>The Register</i> isn't a credible source and that article was written by Andrew Orlowski, who is just slightly notorious for slagging off at Wikipedia.

<p>I became aware of Angela Beesley because of the special election that's on now. I wondered, why was there a special election? Who is Beesley, how did she come to join the board, and why did she leave? This seems important, as her resignation letter isn't very specific. Anyway, in the course of looking into that it was hard to find the information I wanted, so after doing the searches, I have summarized it here. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 16:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone have a better image of Beesley? I think that the one that's on the page right now looks a bit photoshopped (I'm not saying it is photoshopped, but it has that kind of airbrushed appearance that they like in certain magazines...). Anyway, there's a CC-BY-SA image here <a href="http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=222005956&amp;size=l" class="external autonumber" title="http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=222005956&amp;size=l" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> that's a possibility an a bit better IMO. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 04:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beesley's attempt to remove this page is relevant, because it is connected to her resignation from the board. There is even some evidence that she resigned in order to have the page removed, since she initiated a removal attempt immediately following her resignation, on the grounds that she was no longer relevant as a bio subject. It's not open-and-closed evidence, and so I didn't present that argument in the article, although someone else might think that it should be.</p>
<p>In any case, this isn't really a meta article in the same way that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> isn't a meta article. The matter of a board member, and her resignation, and her efforts to delete a page about her, are potentially relevant to anyone in the world who is interested in Wikipedia, whether or not they are a user or an insider. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 16:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why are (say) Mel Gibson's drunken comments about Jews relevant <i>in an encyclopaedia</i> but Ms. Beesley's (presumably level-headed) actions to game the biographical system of an encylopaedia which she herself helped develop, not encyclopaedically relevant? Granted that Mr. Gibson is more famous than Ms. Beesely, but on the other hand, what Mel Gibson did had nothing at all do to with encyclopedias or how they are made, operated, and came about in the world. If ever there was a natural topic FOR an enclyclopedia, I think it would certainly BE encyclopedias themselves, and the actions of the people who make them and the rules which operate them---- not details of drunk driving arrests of U.S. movie actors. In any case, if you have some oracle which informs you on matters of what information about the world and the people who inhabit it, is intrinsically "encyclopedic" and what information is NOT, I'm sure we'd all like to have access to it. Would you mind sharing? Because otherwise, all this is a real <i><b>problem</b></i>. One that far transcends any particulars in the lives of Ms. Beesley or Mr. Gibson.

<dd>If you mean me, I never suggested that. I'm simply noting that it appears that you want the rules of Wikipedia (its policies) changed for you, now that they crimp YOUR life. Well, they crimp many people's lives. The system you helped build contains an inherently aggressive and annoying feature, and to some extent you are therefore responsible for it. You actually helped craft and set present privacy policy for Wikipedia, and if you proposed a rule that people should control their own biographies, you haven't mentioned it. In any case, I'm sorry you didn't notice the bad effects of the privacy policy you helped create, before it began to bother you personally. Education is painful; pain is educational.
<p>And by the way, I find your use of the word troll somewhat insulting, as it suggests that I'm here arguing this problem for the sake of the argument, rather than because I care about the issue.

<dd>I can't understand this argument that Wikipedia internal issues cannot be written about in Wikipedia articles. Lots of people who read about Wikipedia log in to Wikipedia. When they log in, they will (currently) see an election notice. Thus, this is a public issue, even if it is (in some way) internal. And -- the election was driven by Beesley's resignation, so she's relevant. And -- she's attempted to have her page deleted several times, including directly after resigning, which is suggestive, if it isn't intentional. The issue of various people attempting to have their pages deleted has come up in the press, and it's a contentious issue outside of Wikipedia-editing community, making it even more relevant.</dd>
<dd>Now, looking at <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it seems that Beesley meets the criteria of both policies. So, can you point me to a policy that states that Wikipedia people are exempt from biographies? Or that their notable actions (which affect thousands of people) are verboten? Because if you can't, then it seems to me that the content should stay. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 02:33, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And finally please stop suggesting that she resigned in order to get the article deleted, it's a preposterous suggestion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 03:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that you started out by arguing that internal functions of Wikipedia should not be written up in Wikipedia articles. Now, it seems like you are saying that they can / should be written up, but only if anyone outside of Wikipedia cares about them. To me, your second standard seems like a reasonable standard. It seems to me similar to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</dd>
<dd>In this particular case, there is outside interest. Let's say someone is curious as to why she resigned and they turn to Google. As of this writing, when I google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=angela+beesley+resigned" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=angela+beesley+resigned" rel="nofollow">angela beesley resigned</a>, on the first page is a <a href="http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley" class="external text" title="http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley" rel="nofollow">wikitruth article</a> that discusses her attempts to have her own article deleted and connects her resignation to that effort. That is where I first learned about this issue, and I was surprised to find no mention of it here. Also, there is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" class="external text" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">a The Register article</a> that covers the same territory, and <a href="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/001049.html" class="external text" title="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/001049.html" rel="nofollow">a blog post by Seth Finkelstein</a> on the same subject.</dd>
<dd>You accuse me of making a "preposterous suggestion" but I am not the originator. I won't deny that I find the argument has some merit. Especially since Beesley herself linked the two subjects together quite clearly in her <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angela_Beesley_%283rd_nomination%29_36bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley (3rd nomination)">third deletion nomination</a>. However, I'm inclined to be conservative on the matter, and so you will find that the content I wrote in the article does not make the speculation, merely reports the facts (she resigned, then she nominated the article for deletion). Since the content is relevant, and NPOV, they should be in the article. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 05:41, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, in case you haven't noticed, Wikimedia (which includes Wikinews and many other infomation outlets besides Wikipedia) is a monster now so large, and has tentacles into so many places, that there has long since ceased to be any good bright dividing line between its purely internal affairs and things have have leaked into whatever you think of as "the outside world." FYI, the information world is not just whatever comes out of Anderson Cooper's lips on yer TV. If something was ever notable enough to have been featured as a Wiki for long, it's notable enough to be so forever, just by nature of having survived non-deletion as vandalism, on a medium as large as Wikipedia is. If you think not, you're still part of the world of 8-track tapes and TRS-80's (I suggest you clear your mind of the past and put all that out in the garage, maybe in that Studebaker you have out there up on on blocks...) You may object that if I'm right, that this is self-referential and unfair. Indeed. But it is also true. It's also part of a problem, and one of the reasons why ANY dedicated bio information on media like Wikipedia is such a bad idea to begin with.
<p>Second of all, Angela Beesley may have resigned from Wikimedia but she has not exactly attempted to crawl into a hole somewhere and pull the dirt in after. She'd be notable as a subject of a Wikibio under current rules, merely from her continued involvement with Wales and a few other insiders in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>. You know-- those guys who finally figured out that there's Adsense gold to be made from those Wikis that you and I write for free? Who raised 4 million from angel investors this year, and will no doubt one day float an IPO, and get rich? But I digress. The subject is biography. I simply don't want Wikipedia to be the repository of personal information. I don't want somebody else deciding who's "notable" enough to be profiled, because notability is (as I said) no longer a thing which can be isolated from information databases themselves. The only way to deal with this whole problem is not to let the camel get its nose in the tent in the first place. Not to decide that you have to do something, only <i>after</i> you realize that you personally have a problem. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 21:15, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The camel and tent is a metaphor I'm sure you can google. It has to do with situations where one-thing-tends-to-lead-to-another once they get started, so the best thing to do is not to let them get started, so you don't go down that road. Nor try to make ends justify means. In law they call this fruit of a poison tree.
<p>As for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> you can read it like the torah and the talk page like the talmud and it won't do you the least good in this situation. For the problem is, that one cannot write an encyclopedia without some originality--- to do otherwise would be simple plagiarism, and even then, there's some originality involved in deciding what to plagarize and where and in what order and sequence. Now, you can call such originality "research," or you can can call it your Uncle Bill. I don't care what you call it, it smells the same by any name. And it is what it is. You can compile quite a dossier on anybody without doing any of what Wikipedia calls "original research" and I'm not even getting to the question of what kinds of qualitative stuff you do when you dig up difficult-to-find sources like a yearbook in a high school library, and make it available on the net, zits and all, linked to a name searchable by Google. Suffice to say that the results of this do not accord with The Golden Rule. You wouldn't like the kind of bio I could write/compile on you without any "original research", nor would I like the kind you could write on me. Thus, the whole thing is inherently a nasty and evil business. I'm not even sure we can do much about it, by keeping it off Wikipedia. But it's a start. So I propose that we start.

<dd>I'm afraid that there is a legitimate controversy here. El Reg is certainly reliable as to a) we know that this is a published opinion from a verifiable source, and b) it's not sourced to claim that Beesley resigned to delete the article, but that they interpreted it that way. Please re-read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in order to understand this subtle distinction. The sources are reliable in the sense that real people can be reliably confirmed to hold the view that she resigned in order to have her article deleted. I must admit I find these constant deletions to be very abrubt. I have reviewed <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> very carefully and I find that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Opinions_of_critics.2C_opponents.2C_and_detractors" title="WP:BLP">it supports my interpretation</a>. I have demonstrated that this is not the view of a tiny majority. Since people keep deleting the content, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley&amp;oldid=76520930#Wikipedia_biography_controversy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley&amp;oldid=76520930#Wikipedia_biography_controversy" rel="nofollow">here is my latest version</a>. In my opinion this is an important issue since it deals with Wikipedia's ability to hold itself to a consistent standard on biographies for Wikipedians. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 03:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAngela_Beesley_4d1d.html" title="Edit section: Why did Beesley resign?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why did Beesley resign?</span></h2>
<p>I would like to split off the discussion on a specific point that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">User:Thebainer</a> made, quote: <i>She resigned because of internal board matters, end of story.</i></p>
<p>Now I'm very interested in this because myself and many other people had to vote to replace her. Is there a problem with the Foundation that needs to be addressed? If so, that would be important. However, I can't find any evidence to support <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">User:Thebainer</a>'s interpretation. Do you have inside information, if so, please share it. As far as I can find, Wikimedia has made no official statement about why she resigned (which is unusual). Beesley herself said: <i>Overall, it's not because I'm unhappy being involved with Wikimedia, though I am concerned about certain events and tendencies that have arisen within the organisation since the start of this year. I would prefer to be involved in Wikimedia from a different angle rather than focusing my attention on Board matters.</i> <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-July/008167.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-July/008167.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Again, a mid-term resignation is unusual and disruptive, so I think that we, as voters, are forced to read between the lines at least a little bit and wonder what "certain events and tendancies" refers to. However, there's not much more that I've found there.</p>
<p>Then we have the only other piece of evidence that I have found, which is that immediately following her resignation <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angela_Beesley_%283rd_nomination%29_36bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley (3rd nomination)">Beesley asked to have her biography deleted</a>. Not only that but she herself linked her resignation to the deletion request. She said: <i>My justification for making a third nomination is that my circumstances have changed significantly since the last AfDs - I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation. Given that this was previously kept on the grounds I was on that Board, there is no longer any reason for this page to be kept.</i></p>
<p>Now we have several reliable sources (at least <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/001049.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/001049.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>) who made (potentially unreliable, but that doesn't matter) interpretions of the available information to conclude that (a) it was ironic for Beesley to want her page deleted and (b) she resigned to have her page deleted. Personally, I don't know if she resigned to have her page deleted. It seems extreme in my view. But the sequence of events DOES for me highlight a definite double-standard on the part of a (former) high-level Wikipedian, to wit, that articles about herself, or maybe Wikipedians in general, should be treated differently from articles about non-Wikipedians. And that, to me, would be a very bad policy for Wikipedia to have, since I believe that Wikipedia should be fully transparent and even handed in all matters. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 04:18, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Clarification - For myself, I've only made an issue of the irony, not the reason she resigned. The fact of the matter is that, whatever the background, a (former) Wikimedia Foundation Board Member proposing her own Wikipedia biography be deleted, describing it as "full of lies and nonsense", is <em>ironic</em>. -- Seth Finkelstein 03:24, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I frankly don't care about the whys and wherefores of internal wikipedia spats, but I would ask <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">User:Thebainer</a> and other editors to spell out exactly why they keep deleting an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" class="external text" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/wikipedia_school_lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">adequately sourced</a> section from this article with summaries like "remove irrelevant material and imagined "controversy""?

<dl>
<dd>I think the article ought to be merged into <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>, but that's neither here nor there, because many people seem to react rather vehemently to the suggestion that anything be done with this page (see the previous AfDs).</dd>
<dd>Regarding the content in question, there are several reasons why it ought to be removed:
<ol>
<li>The AfD process is an internal matter which is not of interest to the outside world. See discussion above. When the mainstream media (not Orlowski, the fringe media) starts to discuss the inner workings of the deletion process, then that part can go back in.</li>
<li>The part in parentheses in the first paragraph removed is quite blatantly conducting an argument about whether or not the article should be deleted.</li>
<li>Wikitruth is not a reliable source for anything, ever.</li>
<li>Andrew Orlowski is a fringe opinion writer, and cannot be said to represent a significant opinion base. Even if he could, the article of his that is cited is quite plainly incorrect; he states that Angela "recently resigned from the board... in the hope of having her own entry removed from Wikipedia", a conclusion which is demonstrably wrong. His opinion is based on this conclusion, and ought to be disregarded (if it were given regard in the first place).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In short the content is speculative and untruthful, and doesn't belong in an encyclopaedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 16:04, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not convinced this warrants an article, but as we seem to be stuck with one, I have a few comment to make about your argument:
<ol>
<li>The AfD is of interest only insofar as it has been referred to by outside parties, but it has, so there is justification for some limited reference to it (i.e. perhaps less than there is here, particularly the utterly irrelevant links to the first two AfDs)</li>
<li>The comments in parentheses are both clumsy and an unnecesary argument (i.e. I agree they should be removed)</li>
<li>Wikitruth is a source of anti-wikipedia comment (i.e. as a source of 'wikitruth says...' criticism), but not as a stand alone source for verifiability of factual claims.</li>
<li>Whether Andrew Orlowski is a fringe writer, or whether he represents a significant opinion base is currently irrelevant personal opinion on your part (i.e. not even <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). The aspects you regard as demonstrably incorrect are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> on your part. The Register is very widely read and considered a reliable source for most other articles. That it, and particularly Orlowski have been vocally anti-wikipedia is not a reason for us to suddenly decide to blacklist them. As a similar example, I think <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Phillips_2720.html" title="Melanie Phillips">Melanie Phillips</a> of the Daily Mail is a fringe opinion writer who represents a minority opinion, but I wouldn't get very far censoring articles based on that belief, partly because some people don't think she's fringe, and partly because it isn't up to me to decide questions like that.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The content is not speculative if it is sourced, it doesn't seem to be untruthful (i.e. it doesn't repeat the claim you object to; although, sadly, truth is not a wikipedia criterion anyway), and in fact belongs in an encyclopedia much more than dull information about what Angela Beesley eats for breakfast or whetever other pointless biographical details have been included in the rest of the article (the list of public appearances is particularly galling) --Coroebus 16:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a problem with this method of verification, though, in that just asking associates before writing articles on them violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>; that method of resource creates a primary source. Also, Wikipedia usually doesn't cite internal pages as sources, though here I suppose we have to. And though I don't think Ms. Beesley is lying, I think we technically have to say that her <i>claim</i> is that she resigned because of "certain events and tendencies" (which don't involve this page) and a desire to be "involved in Wikimedia from a different angle." That is to say, we can't write the article citing her word as truth just because we personally trust her. The other sources, even though they are critical of Wikipedia, can't be written off in a neutral article just because the editors know the subject. —<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivacissamamente_d5f6.html" title="User:Vivacissamamente">vivacissamamente</a> 03:58, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thebainer: Beesley's public letter is pretty vague, and I don't see how it answers the question: "are you resigning in order to have your article deleted". Of course, Beesley above says that the answer is no. But still -- ignoring Beesley's stature in WP -- we must always consider actions as well as words. And we should ignore her stature in WP, because Wikipedians and non-Wikipedian subjects should get equal treatment in living bios.</dd>

<dd>If we are allowed to infer nothing from her actions, I guess the path would be to simply cite the actions, Angela's reasons, and any articles suggesting other reasons. However, if there is just the one speculation that she may have done resigned to help get the article deleted, it may be too weak to merit inclusion. I think the "responsibility to get things right" here emphasizes a truth-over-verifiability claim, which is not supposed to be how things operate. Only Ms. Beesley knows for sure why she resigned. —<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivacissamamente_d5f6.html" title="User:Vivacissamamente">vivacissamamente</a> 07:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Though secondary sources is a necessary condition, the secondary sources ought to be themselves notable, and I'm not entirely convinced of that here. We have 1) an article from Wikitruth, 2) a post on Finkelstein's blog is not, and 3) a Register article.</dd>

<dd>Now, I think we are mostly agreed that the original AFD deletion debates were themselves not notable enough for mention in the Angela Beesley article. Further, I would say that the notability of sources 1) and 2) is less than or equal to that of the Wikipedia AFD debates. So the most compelling reason for the insertion of the anecdote is, to me, the Register article. If we can produce a bit more notable third-party coverage of the debate, then I'll be convinced it should be included. Right now I'm on the fence. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 22:42, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When it comes to the sources, first it's a matter of reliable sources <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As discussed above, El Reg and Finkelstein's blog both pass the reliability test easily enough. Wikitruth is technically speaking a wiki, but it's only edited by a small number of known people, not the public in general, so we know who it comes from. As for notability the key point is whether or not the "controversy" is notable enough. Since it's been brought up outside of Wikipedia in several reliable sources, and since it involves a major Wikipedia election, then yes, it is notable. As for the AfDs, it's more a matter of whether they are relevant (yes...) and are they reliable sources. I suppose that it's not certain they are technically RS but since they've been quoted by reliable sources, you could just switch the citation to them. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 02:58, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never agreed that Finkelstein's blog was "reliable" as per WP:RS; in fact that page is quite clear that "self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources."</dd>
<dd>As for notability: first, because I don't accept Finkelstein's blog as a Reliable Source (TM), it hasn't been brought up outside of Wikipedia in "several reliable sources", though even if I did, I wouldn't say "two" is enough. The election itself may be notable, if only for this article and a few other related ones, but that doesn't mean the AFD ought to be mentioned.</dd>
<dd>With regard to the AFD votes being Reliable Sources, I think the page WP:RS pretty much directly implies that they are not. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 14:02, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Citation and proper sourcing isn't my main concern. What bothers me is that we have non-notable meta-data in here. Do people really need to know that the subject of the article is trying to get this very article deleted? I don't see too many biography articles mention the subjects' on-Wikipedia activities. While Angela's activities as part of the Foundation and similar "high-level" entities is certainly notable, I really don't see how this is. Angela tried to get her biography deleted. Woop-di-doo. That piece of trivia is hardly encyclopedic, nor is it notable. Oh, and while I'm at it, I don't really thing a detailed timeline of when she was administrator, bureaucrat, and steward is particularly notable either. This article positively reeks of Wikipedia-cruft much more appropriate for a user page. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:57, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The policy of giving subjects of wikibios some control over their own biographies is certainly a matter of a great deal of detate (as you an see on the TALK page of WP:BLP), as so are the attempts of Wikipedians at exalted levels in the Wikimedia power structure to buff or change their own bios--- a privilege they don't accord to others. Ms. Beesley is not alone in doing this; Wales famously has been caught editing his own biography to remove warts, several times.
<p>As for the timeline of Ms. Beesley being promoted to various statums of powers within Wikipedia, including admin, sysop, bureaucrat, steward (which includes ability to crown other users with any powers you like, and also the majic "oversight" function where you alter anything you like on here are make it go away like an unperson figure in a USSR photo), that's notable for what it is implies. Anybody who makes it up through the ranks that fast (did you know there are only 300 sysops, and a lot fewer stewards?) has a LOT of upward pull (I'm talking space-elevator type) with diamondoid strings. Ms. Beesley's rise to that level, THEN Challenger-shuttle-type fall back to zero no doubt probably sets THE all-time record for any human being in Wikimedia. You don't find that notable? I sure do. Inquiring minds want to know who got kicked out of who's whatever, literally or figuratively. If this had happened at a company like FORD or GOOGLE, it would rate many articles in Forbes or whatever. But here on Wiki, you're saying it's trivia, not even rating a sentence? No. I disagree. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 19:02, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the information! I did perform a check and saw something, perhaps in the bureaucrat lists, which indicated inactivity. But it is not there now. Either it's been changed since, or I simply made a mistake. Anyway, looks like you are correct and Ms. Beesley continues to hold all relevant titles and uses their powers actively. Which is a head-scratcher to me, considering her stated reasons for resigning from the Wikimedia Foundation (what-- she thinks it's going in the wrong direction, BUT she still wants to help it go faster? What, she wants more time to work on Wikia and her other projects, BUT she has time to be bureaucrat of bureaucrats here?). But anyway, facts is facts, and these facts are as you state them.

<dd>I don't think even her activities as a part of the Foundation are particularly notable (how many representatives of notable companies speak as their representatives and yet would not be considered notable themselves? Lots, that's how many). Yet since we're stuck with this article (a bit of wikicruft double standards coming back to bite us) the deletion mini-controversy is something where outside notice has actually been focused on Angela Beesley qua Angela Beesley. As to the timeline, yeah, delete with extreme prejudice. --Coroebus 21:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came over here because of the remark posted on Wikipedia:Criticism of Wikipedia. Perhaps we can make the article more self-referential: maybe Angela said something citable say about the controversy about whether to include discussion in the article about her wanting the article deleted. Or maybe we could write an article of broader public interest? Maybe about the lint we see when we gaze at our own navels? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:14, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hello Jmabel, and welcome to Angela Beesley's article talk page. Your proposal is very interesting, and could be expanded upon further. Perhaps we can list some of her contributions to Wikipedia, such as the fact that she used to welcome a lot of new users, or that she used to do most of the admin promotions. Or maybe we could provide a list of all the barnstars and wiki-awards that she has received. We could even go further and provide a list of some of her milestone edits, such as her 1st, 100th, and 1000th edits. Together, we can make this the most exciting article yet! --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:05, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"What on earth?" indeed. We have here a demonstrably true claim (that Angela Beesley tried to have her bio deleted) that isn't contested by the subject of the bio. We also have a citation backing it up from a widely read IT news site. Yet still the section gets repeatedly and wholesale reverted by a variety of individuals, mostly admins, who don't stick around to justify themselves. I am intrigued that we have a new policy that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Register_1954.html" title="The Register">The Register</a> can't be used as a source if <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a> is the author of an article, apparently because he's been rude about wikipedia (shock horror, how will we cope?) Presumably, having written for the <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1752257,00.html" class="external text" title="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1752257,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian</a>, that is also no longer an acceptable source. So I'm putting the section back, come and argue your case here, I do not see anything in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> that precludes the use of the register as a source, particularly given as Angela Beesley doesn't deny the factual claim made in the article (she may deny other things said in the article, but we haven't repeated them). I'm afraid your personal dislike of Orlowski is no reason for us to accept that the Register is not a reliable source, Angela Beesley doesn't deny that she tried to get her bio deleted, and it has been commented on elsewhere (i.e. in the Register), which makes it a hell of a lot more notable than the other gushing wikicruft the article was filled with (if you don't want there to be an article at all then there are other avenues open to you). It is self-referential because it has to be, that is nature of self-referential things (cf <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>), and does not violate <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>. If you can't stand the wikitruth reference then delete it, Seth Finkelsetin was quoted by The Register, so that stays.</dd>

<dd>It is not a contested fact by Angela Beesley, because it is obviously true (i.e. just look at the deletion requests!), whether you choose to deny it is utterly irrelevant (although it would be a bit barking). The Orlowski objection is utter utter rubbish, and no one has justified rejecting him as a source other than simply asserting he's not reliable (which, as I pointed out, is just like me randomly deleting references from people I disagree with from articles, just cos I don't like them). If you think some of the other sources are unreliable, just remove them, not the whole thing, otherwise it looks like people have ulterior motives. Define meta-content, establish why this section is it, and refer me to the relevant policy forbidding it. Currently this article (about someone that is practically a nobody) refers to one of the few events in Ms Beesley's bio where anyone has referred to her as a person (as opposed to a spokesperson for wikipedia). --Coroebus 13:05, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Are people here trying to 'defend' Angela Beesley through some sort of misguided apprehension that she'll be 'hurt' by reference to this, or is it yet more sad wikipedia intolerance to anything that might even hint at criticism? I'm not sure what is sadder. --Coroebus 13:07, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What more is there to object to? The Orlowski objection is utterly unnacceptable, and simply boils down to us arguing we don't like him because he criticises wikipedia, which is frankly utterly irrelevant to the acceptability of a source, and very nicely reinforces the objections of wikipedia's critics. The other objection is that somehow this event and criticism is "not notable", which seems a little rich given we talk about where this woman went to university - if you think she is not notable then list it as an AfD - but this is one of the few even marginally notable aspects of Angela Beesley's life. --Coroebus 10:30, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - voicing your opinion on an internal AfD discussion is completely useless information to the average person. Resigning from the board of a large non-profit organization, because of conflict and having your endorsed candidate win is not.

<dd>Additionally, that the Register is the article on this supports its completely non-notablity 1) the info you want to quote is not even the focus of the article 2) the Register is barely above www.blogger.com as a credible source, and 3) the paragraph referenced includes unsubstantiated claims (resignation reason). --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 14:51, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(1) The register article is not completely about Angela Beesley, rather about the problems in the innacuracy of wikipedia articles, and yet still it is better than the non-existent coverage of her supporting her ex-boyfriend for a job she resigned from. (2) why yes, a widely read tech news site is indeed the same as a blog, and wikipedia is as reliable as Encyclopedia Dramatica. (3) what does the presence or absence of claims that we don't repeat have to do with anything? We use it as a source for things we know to be true (i.e. she resigned, they criticised, Finkelstein moaned). What kind of new levels of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> do we reach if we go about trying to find claims in sources that we think are wrong and then rejecting those sources on the basis of our own beliefs? --Coroebus 15:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've removed the para yet again. You have yet to overcome the key objection that mentioning the AfD debate is self-referential: it's about things which happened <i>entirely on Wikipedia</i>.

The criterion is external attention. Compare the external attention here (non-notable tech blogger <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_Finkelstein_6930.html" title="Seth Finkelstein">Seth Finkelstein</a>'s opinion) with the attention given to really notable internal matters, such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a>.

<p>Wikipedia can, of course, write about Wikipedia, but context is important. If you read about Shakespeare's works, you are not interested in reading about Wikipedia's policies or conventions.

The following are some examples where such links can be useful: Articles where Wikipedia played a major role in the subject of the article, for example: John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy Articles about prominent people involved in Wikipedia, for example: Jimbo Wales Articles about Wikipedia Articles where Wikipedia is illustrative of the subject, for example: online community, encyclopedia Articles where it is likely the reader actually wants a Wikipedia policy article or similar, such as userbox</p>

<dd>So the self-referential argument is simply another way of saying that the bio deletion business is not a notable event in the life of Angela Beesley (as wikipedia biography subject - the notable events in her personal life are not necessarily our business). It is utterly disingenuous to argue that notability in this case must be judged to be comparable with Seigenthaler because the rest of the bio fails to meet that standard (especially see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley&amp;diff=78493997&amp;oldid=78486450" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley&amp;diff=78493997&amp;oldid=78486450" rel="nofollow">this</a> switch). I think I'll list the article for deletion again, this time highlighting not just the obvious non-notability of Angela Beesley, but also the explict double standards in policing what is and isn't in the article, it is currently utterly unworkable --Coroebus 19:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that a former three-year member of Wikipedia's Board of Trustees advocated the deletion of her own biography entry, on the grounds it was "full of nonsense," is an important part of her biography (and an extremely pointed repudiation of the Wikipedia concept). The actions taken within Wikipedia by leaders like Beesley and Wales should be treated differently -- in terms of judging whether they belong in the encyclopedia -- than the actions others take here. The exclusion of this fact appears like protective bias to keep Wikipedia from looking bad. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcade_aa62.html" title="User:Rcade">Rcade</a> 14:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly, you're missing the point: it's not up to us, when considering internal Wikipedia matters, to determine what is and is not notable; we leave that to the outside world. The AfD has not been subject to sufficient external attention to warrant inclusion in the encyclopaedia. Compare with, say, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_staffer_edits_to_Wikipedia_af58.html" title="Congressional staffer edits to Wikipedia">Congressional staffer edits to Wikipedia</a> for examples of external attention to internal matters warranting inclusion.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, your argument as to why it is notable is fallacious; if you would pay attention to <i>all</i> of what she said, you would learn that Angela's reason for nominating the article was that she had resigned from the board, and since the only clear reason for ever keeping the article was because the community thinks it's nice having articles about the current board members, there was no longer any reason for keeping the article. That said, both your opinion and mine are of no consequence, since what must be considered here is external judgment. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 15:23, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your suggestion that Beasley is in Wikipedia only because "the community thinks it's nice having articles about the current board members" is a pretty odd defense of excluding information from a board member's bio that has been reported in The Guardian.

Reading this discussion page shows that most, if not all of the editors, have made this addition to the article in good faith, and not anonymously.

<p>It's completely false to say I cited the deterioration of collaboration as <b>the</b> reason for my resignation. That was a tiny part of the problem and I never even said it was a reason for my resignation - I just happened to mention in one email to foundation-l <i>after</i> Wikizine had already announced my resignation.

<p>Angela, the original article said the reasons were "unspecified" and when I checked that was clearly contradicted by what you'd written in your email to foudation-l announcing yor resignation, so I corrected the inaccurate claim that you hadn't given reasons. That is, I was under the impression based on your email that your position was being misrepresented.</p>
<p>Your email to foundation-l announcing your resignation included two bits of text that could describe reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It's been a great two years and I've enjoyed the role, but the collaborative consensus-based nature Wikimedia had before the start of this year continues to deteriorate and it's no longer an environment I can work effectively in"</li>
<li>"I would prefer to be involved in Wikimedia from a different angle rather than focusing my attention on Board matters"</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry if you didn't like it that I believed the reasons you gave were your real reasons but that's what happened. Do you have other cites that would more completely represent the reasons for your resignation and place those reasons in better context? I'm very interested in not misrepresenting your reasons but they appeared clear from your official resignation announcement email. I'd welcome any clarification you can offer. Perhaps "personal reasons" not described in this edit would be the most significant reason? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 18:03, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a member of the Wiki Biography Project, I just assessed this as stub, and the subject as of low importance. If there was a classification of "no importance", I would have chosen that.

Nobody outside of the cult of Wikipedia would consider her notable, and all of the overruled nominations for deletion smack of double standard. My dry cleaner is as notable as Ms. Beesley is, and I am certain that if I wrote a biography of her, it would be deleted in a heartbeat.

<p>I have to agree it has increased my cynicism of Wikipedia also. With each passing day this place seems to implode on itself with the constant bickering about what is right and wrong regarding articles etc. Apparently peoples rights aren't worth a damn here. She is NOT notable nowadays, delete her already and give her some peace. Just because she's not a cult of Wiki nerd doesn't mean she deserves this kind of treatment. In fact, this insane cult mentality of Wiki is exactly why it is doomed to fail eventually.</p>

Surely their personal liberty and right to privacy overrides some socialistic ideal to share the worlds information at the expense of everything else. WHOEVER KEEPS REMOVING THIS WITHOUT DISCUSSING IT IS VIOLATING WIKI TOS. DISCUSS THIS DELETION REQUEST AND VOTE, DON'T SWEEP IT UNDER THE CARPET.

<dd>It is a legitimate point I raised. This is exactly where wikipedia falls down. You feel your opinion is more valued since you are some admin or whatever. And further discussion is trolling? Is this the way you go about silencing people with differing opinions, by threatening them that they are trolling or causing trouble if they don't agree with you? On a final note, if privacy isn't a legit concern in your opinion, would you care to create a wiki entry for yourself listing your DOB, vitals, picture, home town etc?

<p>Bramlet, can you explain why you're keen on adding dob?

<dl>
<dd>The question is why you're keen on keeping it out. A dob is a substantive part of any bio. I haven't seen that Angela has explicitly said she considers the dob private, and we're not systematically removing birth dates from articles about marginally notable people, do we? As I've said before in an edit summary, it is not using "Wikipedia" as a source, because "Wikipedia" officially is not a publication anyway. Things on Wikipedia are "published" by the respective editors. The reason Wikipedia <i>articles</i> per se are not acceptable sources is that anyone can edit them, and their contents change all the time. However, specific <i>edits</i> are fixed and have one author. The reason we can't usually use diffs either is that those authors are usually non-notable persons and thus not reliable sources. However, public persons notable enough to have their own articles are generally reliable sources about their own birth data. No doubt many biographies on Wikipedia include birth dates which come from the person's own website. And then it doesn't matter <i>where</i> a person publishes her own birth date. A private website is as good as Wikipedia, provided that the identity of the person is not in doubt. But in this case we can be sure that <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">User:Angela</a> is indeed the subject of this article, and she has published this data. The links are in the article, it is directly verifiable for everyone. Nor does it violate NOR if you take an information directly from a reliable source. It would be NOR if you somehow got hold of her birth certificate, or got the information by private communication. But she published it herself and it's on record for everyone to see. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBramlet_Abercrombie_9dae.html" title="User:Bramlet Abercrombie">Bramlet Abercrombie</a> 01:31, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. You are simply wrong. You need to find a published source for her date of birth. If you know of other unsourced date of births and want to remove them, go ahead. But it's the policy here that if an edit is challenged, you need to provide a source for it to reinstate it. You haven't, so please don't reinstate it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is a published source. Self-published by Angela, which is acceptable for a non-contentious fact like this. Surely she knows her own birth date better than anyone else, and there's no reason to assume she would have faked it. Why should this not be good enough? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBramlet_Abercrombie_9dae.html" title="User:Bramlet Abercrombie">Bramlet Abercrombie</a> 13:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't. It says "Wikis ... are not reliable sources, because the content is self-published, anyone can edit them, and the current version of an article may change at any time." I have addressed those very points above. The last two points don't apply to fixed diffs, and while self-published content is not reliable for most things, it certainly is adequate for a person's own birth date. If, say, a newspaper were publishing her birth date, it would have obtained it simply by asking her without requiring documentary proof. So can you just explain in practical terms why this would be more reliable than directly using her self-published date? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBramlet_Abercrombie_9dae.html" title="User:Bramlet Abercrombie">Bramlet Abercrombie</a> 12:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think this is more relevant: "When writing about Usenet itself, or other Usenet-related topics such as particular personalities or Usenet memes, Usenet posts may be acceptable as a source.", where it would seem Wikipedia as collaborative community should be treated essentially the same as Usenet. The wiki section: "Wikis, including Wikipedia and other wikis sponsored by the Wikimedia Foundation, are not reliable sources, because the content is self-published, anyone can edit them, and the current version of an article may change at any time." is not relevant here as it is not information in a Wikipedia article we're talking about but an individual's actions on Wikipedia the collaborative community (for instance, it is not true that the history of a user's contributions can be altered by anyone or changed at any time - i.e. it is not a wiki, even though the articles are). However, as I'm sure you are aware by now, however bizarre the interpretation of the written word, if it supports their argument then the rules are a policy set in stone, but if they support your argument you are simply wikilawyering. --Coroebus 19:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Bramlet, you have no way of establishing that the person who made the edit <i>really was</i> Angela that wouldn't involve <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<dl>
<dd>It's original research that User:Angela is Angela Beesley? If that isn't the most ridiculous wikilawyering argument I don't know what is. All "research" you have to do is, for example (and there are countless other ways to do it), to look at <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:Angela" class="external free" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:Angela" rel="nofollow">http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:Angela</a> - the official foundation site which can not be edited by anyone - which identifies Angela Beesley with en:User:Angela. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBramlet_Abercrombie_9dae.html" title="User:Bramlet Abercrombie">Bramlet Abercrombie</a> 13:27, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
