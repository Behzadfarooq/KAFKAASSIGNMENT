<h2><span class="mw-headline">It's hip to be square!</span></h2>
<p>Well, "the standard in the literature" shows that IPA is perhaps not as scientific as I thought it was. i and u are always used in Sesotho, though an i and u with a circumflex are used when talking about Ur-Bantu (it has both close and superclose vowels).</p>
<p>Note how both the vowel in "boot" and French "deux" (I think) are given the same symbol when the French is clearly higher than the English.</p>
<p>I need to distinguish between them because in some rare cases the half-close vowels "look" and "lick" become raised to positions more akin to English "seat" and "suit" but not superclose. It's the reason why <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maloti.html" title="Maloti">Maloti</a> is often written "Maluti" (if the vowel was really u then the name would be pronounced "Maduti").</p>
<p>Am I safe if I just use slashes for single phonemes and square brackets for longer sequences? Would eg the class 8 plural prefix "di-" be both /di/ and [ li ]?</p>
<p><a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 14:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, I mean /li/ and [di]. <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 15:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the IPA isn't unscientific, but it doesn't make unnecessary distinctions. The English vowel in <i>boot</i> is the highest, backest vowel English has, so it's transcribed [u]. The French vowel in <i>doux</i> (not <i>deux</i>) is the highest, backest vowel French has, so it's transcribed [u]. If you're sticking to one language at a time, that's all that's necessary. But the IPA does provide diacritics that allow you to make finer distinctions: if you want to compare the English vowel with the French one, you can transcribe the French vowel as [u] and the English one as [u̞].</dd>
<dd>For Sotho, I'd transcribe the half-close vowels as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ ʊ/</span> and their raised allophones as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɪ̝ ʊ̝]</span>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 16:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, another problem I have is that I can't see those funny symbols in Opera Mini. I'll assume the half close vowels look like strike throughed i and u (<s>i</s> and <s>u</s>); please describe what the allophones look like (they seem to consist of two symbols each).</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, the example text given at the end of the article (from Senkatana) is from a copyrighted book. Does this mean I should remove it? <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 16:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To your first question, no; they're the IPA symbols for half-close vowels with the "raising diacritic" beneath. The sentence I wrote above should look like this:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To your second question, yes, you should probably remove it, especially if there are texts you could use that are in the public domain. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to be such bother (don't be angry!) but I can't see that image on my phone as it's too wide (and ends up 3 pixels tall)! Could you possibly make a high resolution square-ish image of just the 2 symbols?</p>
<p>I'll think I'll just get rid of the copyrighted text, Senkatana is a bad story anyway... <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 22:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow! That's perfect!</p>
<p>Okay, so I was thinking of using those two symbols for the half close vowels (since that's what my Oxford English dictionary uses) but EVERYBODY ELSE uses <s>iu</s> (0268 and 0289 ish).</p>
<p>Are these two different vowel sets!? I don't think it's a good idea to change the entire article to use a symbol not usually associated with Sesotho. Your thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your patience - this has been very helpful. <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 09:45, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If <s>i</s> and <s>u</s> are standard in the literature, I'd still use the official IPA symbols (so as not to confuse people unfamiliar with the standard literature, since <s>i</s> and <s>u</s> have completely different meanings in IPA, see <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_central_unrounded_vowel.html" title="Close central unrounded vowel">close central unrounded vowel</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_central_rounded_vowel.html" title="Close central rounded vowel">close central rounded vowel</a>), but leave a note explaining that I↑ and U↑ are conventionally transcribed <s>i</s> and <s>u</s> in the literature. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 10:45, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's a rather large decision to take, but I shall do it. That's just one of the benefits of taking on such a great responsibility.</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>The Marcus Allen magazine photo I downloaded came from this website:</p>
<p><a href="http://imageevent.com/caediii/marcusallen?n=0&amp;z=9&amp;c=4&amp;x=1&amp;m=20&amp;w=0&amp;p=20" class="external free" title="http://imageevent.com/caediii/marcusallen?n=0&amp;z=9&amp;c=4&amp;x=1&amp;m=20&amp;w=0&amp;p=20" rel="nofollow">http://imageevent.com/caediii/marcusallen?n=0&amp;z=9&amp;c=4&amp;x=1&amp;m=20&amp;w=0&amp;p=20</a></p>
<p>Which I highly doubt holds the original copyright...the original holder would be:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freshmen.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.freshmen.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freshmen.com/</a></p>
<p>I realize that under "NORMAL" situations, images like these are not "fair use." However, might I ask: how many Freshmen Magazine cover boys have been charged with murder? ONE, "Marcus Allen" or Timothy J. Boham. Second, Marcus Allen's porn career was meteoric, going from a virtual unknown to fairly-well known virtually overnight. Being voted "Freshman of the Year" was pivotal. Thus, this image was pivotal to show his early-career success. Other photos don't. Showing a picture of him later, when he was on the downside of a career, is hardly what is needed to 'flesh out' the biography.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a tale of an ordinary guy skyrocketing to early heights, soon running into problems/disputes and not able to handle it, and not able to deal with the 'downside' of a crashed career. This is not much different than a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Nowak_b29a.html" title="Lisa Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a> story, who after training for 10 years to make one space run, was now not likely to ever go back up again.</p>
<p>Certainly in the Boham case, he shares blame but at the same time, its a sad story that someone can go from success to failure so quick.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 20:49, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with your decision to delete a pair of images of vintage station wagons, a 1972 Cutsom Cruiser and a 1969 Galaxie Squire. Have you ever tried to find a station wagon of that age? It's nearly impossible. Station wagons get beat to death and junked, and the ones that survive usually end up in demolition derbies. The Galaxie image was noted by another editor in the articles it was in as being a factory prototype, therefore, it is entirely unreplaceable because the car no longer exists. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 17:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, the problem is that the picture you uploaded can only be used under a claim of "fair use", but Wikipedia policy is that fair-use images of living people are not allowed in most cases, since it would be possible for someone to make a freely licensed image of the person in question. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 05:01, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">G_Ben_Thompson.jpg</span></h2>
<p>On March 3, you deleted Image:G_Ben_Thompson.jpg as a "replaceable image" -- this is incorrect. The image used was specific to the article about <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaither_Ben_Thompson_89dd.html" title="Gaither Ben Thompson">Gaither Ben Thompson</a>, discussing his claims to ownership of a Bahamas property. There are no other known images of Mr. Thompson, and no <i>reasonable</i> way to obtain such; as a notable, but not public figure there is no means to replace the image.</p>
<p>The image fulfills the requirements of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Policy" title="WP:FU">Fair Use Policy</a>, in particular "<i>No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information.</i> " Further, as I provided a fair use rationale in the image description, as per policy, it was not a candidate for speedy-deletion; it should have been placed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_for_deletion_61a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Images for deletion">Wikipedia:Images_for_deletion</a>. I would request it be restored; and if you still desire it to be deleted, to place it at WP:IFD.

<dd>It was a speedy candidate because you uploaded it with the "fair use image of a living person" tag from the dropdown menu, which automatically tags the image for speedy deletion. As far as I can tell from the article, he is a living person and not a recluse, meaning a freely licensed image of him could be made. That makes the fair-use image of him replaceable and in violation of Wikipedia policy. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 11:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a non-public figure, he is akin to a "recluse". Granted, a free image could be made, if some persons were to track down Thompson's home address in Myrtle Beach, make their way to his property, peek in his windows and snap clandestine photos. But then, that would be considered an <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_privacy.html" title="Invasion of privacy">invasion of privacy</a>, and again, as noted at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> would not be <i>reasonable</i>. That is why there are Fair Use exceptions, which this image fulfills. It was non-decorative, as it presented information that was not available in the text of the article. And because this image included a clear <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a>, speedy deleting it was <i>contrary</i> to policy. It should go to IfD, if you wish it to be removed. I again ask you to return the image, and follow the appropriate procedure. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 20:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looking over his article again, I think you're right about him being a non-public figure--so much so that he's too nonnotable for a Wikipedia article. He has absolutely no notability apart from his relationship with ANS that warrants him getting his own article at all. A redirect to her article is quite sufficient. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:56, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is of course, in your opinion and you're welcome to place the article for AfD.

<p>Hi Angr, <s>would the reason you deleted the images at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Biggest_Loser_%28Australia%29_d003.html" title="The Biggest Loser (Australia)">The Biggest Loser (Australia)</a> because they're not fair use?</s> - replaceable images, living persons, taken from web site etc? And do you know if we can upload company logos into Commons? Wiki english has the license of fair use as long as there is a reason but there seems to be no equivalent at commons - is this correct?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My very first template! Yay!!</span></h2>
<p>Yo! So like how do I create a template in my user space and use it, dude? What are the rules regarding using it in mainspace articles?<br />
There's a huge style decision I've taken with Sesotho language, but I fear it will result in too much repetitive HTML code; it won't LOOK different from other articles, but hovering your mouse over certain parts will reveal a pleasant surprise, and <a href="../../../h/3A/t/Template%7EH%7Etitle_c6ad.html" title="Template:H:title">Template:H:title</a> has the unfortunate side effect of underlining the text... <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 10:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To create a template in your user space, just make a subpage of your user page: User:Zyxoas/Whatever. But if you're going to use the template in actual articles, why not just create it in Template space? —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 10:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just in case your buddies, in an apoplectic paroxysm, decide to XfD it. Aren't there laws, statutes, bills, and constitutions (otherwise collectively known as alphabet soups) regarding the creating of templates in main space? If anything does happen I might not be around to stop it. <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 15:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. The only big no-nos are single-use templates (since there's no reason for them to be templates at all) and templates designed to save an editor a few keystrokes when typing. You could create it in your userspace first, let me take a gander at it, and if it seems unlikely to be TFD'd you can move it to main template space. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 15:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Zyxoas/Hover. Another concern I have is that it only superficially differs from H:title, but then, that's the reason why I felt the need to create another template in the first place...<br />

<dd>Maybe you could discuss with the makers of {{<a href="../../../h/3A/t/Template%7EH%7Etitle_c6ad.html" title="Template:H:title">H:title</a>}} whether there's some way to add a parameter allowing the underlining to be turned off? For example, maybe one could add a parameter like <code>underline=off</code> to {{<a href="../../../h/3A/t/Template%7EH%7Etitle_c6ad.html" title="Template:H:title">H:title</a>}} that would turn underlining off, then you wouldn't have to create a whole separate and largely redundant template. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 17:35, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FYI: I have some tools that may simplify your "Where I have been" secton of your user page</span></h2>
<p>I see you have a list of nations and/or states/provinces on your user page. I would like to offer you some templates for this task I created for <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Pittenger_1026.html#Places_I_have_been" title="User:Will Pittenger">my own list</a>. One pair of templates will create entries identical to the one I use. (I suggest you copy my <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Pittenger_1026.html#Legend" title="User:Will Pittenger">legend</a> if you use them.) Other templates will provide just a flag or name (nation or province/state).</p>
<dl>
<dt>Highlights</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>All use a simple code.
<ul>
<li>Nations are identified with a two letter top-level Internet domain code (except for the United States of America, which uses "USA").</li>
<li>States and provinces are identified with postal codes (so far anyway).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nation and state/province names are linked.</li>
<li>The low level templates return flag images with just the filename allowing you to control the image size and caption.</li>
<li>All flag images located so far are <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVG_cd15.html" title="SVG">SVG</a>.</li>
<li>If any flag images or names on your page officially change, your user page will get the update as soon as I know about it.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dt>One drawback</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Currently the province templates can only look up data for the United States of America and Canada. However, additional capability can be readily added. All I need to do is create a starter template and let you add the provinces.</li>

<p>Hello Angr! Once again I'd appreciate your opinion/guidance. It's the same old problem really... King Lear on the Berlin page.. I've noticed you got "bored?" with Berlin but still hope you can help!</p>
<p>Urban Centres: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear21_7e53.html" title="User:Lear21">User:Lear21</a> will insist on using "Urban Centres" as a sub-title for what I think is more like "Historical Sites &amp; Places of Interest". I'm not sure if I understand what he means by Urban Centres and have asked him to explain: see <a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBerlin_0f4f.html" title="Talk:Berlin">Talk:Berlin</a>. He always acts as if he's Lord of the Manor and reverts. I don't accept his arguments.. But if ..YOU.. tell me that "Urban Centres".. is OK then I'll "go quietly guv'".</p>
<p>I'm not stuck on the title "Historical sites &amp; places of interest" and would accept another compromise name. Any advice?</p>

<p>Angr, you were recommended as someone who has zero tolerance for stolen images. I must ask you to look into the activities of user smith006, his sock GeneralPatton and another possibe sock Brandmeister. I have tried the correct channels <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_problems/Fair_use_claims#Numerous_Images_by_smith2006_.26_suspect_sock_GeneralPatton" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_problems/Fair_use_claims#Numerous_Images_by_smith2006_.26_suspect_sock_GeneralPatton" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> but there are so many images and I am so inexperienced that I need some help of any expert.</p>
<p>Images uploaded by smith2006 that I have positively identified as copyright infringements (all are copyright under <a href="../../../p/d/_/WP%7EPD_9540.html#World_War_II_images" title="WP:PD">EU law</a>) belong to two German photographers — Walther Frentz &amp; Jäger Hugo. They are <b>all</b> copyright Ullstein Bild and Getty images respectively. Ullstein Bild have made a legal threat with regard to their images appearing on wikipedia before, (including all tagged Fair Use), this prompted all Frentz images to be removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2006_August_26&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72578625" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2006_August_26&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72578625" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>I've searched Flicker for "Bishara". No appropriate picture was found. I've searched Yahoo! for all these words: "azmi bishara", restricting the search to Creative Commons licensed content. No appropriate picture was found (actually, i've found a video interview with Bishara: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/85811" class="external autonumber" title="http://blip.tv/file/85811" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (which i've already used as a reference in the article), but it is licensed under a NoDerivs license, so it's impossible to take a screen shot of the video and use it, and it would be pushing a POV planting the video as is in the article.) I've searched Yahoo! for pictures as well as for articles containing all these words: "azmi bishara" in the the ".gov" domain. No appropriate picture was found.</dd>
<dd>Under these circumstances, would i be justified to use Bishara's picture from the Knesset site (the one you deleted), claiming irreplaceable fair use? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 14:40, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, no, because someone in the future could still make a freely licensed photo of him. Jimbo has said that in cases like this it's better to have no image at all than a nonfree one.

<dd>Thanks, Angr, for patiently answering my questions. I'd like to take advantage of your patience and ask you a couple more things, please.
<ul>
<li>I've inserted into the Azmi Bishara article a quote excerpted from the above mentioned video interview (see the folowing diff: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azmi_Bishara&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=108887136" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azmi_Bishara&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=108887136" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). Should i take it off, in view of the fact that the interview was released under a CC NoDerivs license?</li>
<li>More generally, i've used direct quotation from copyrighted sites (particularly newspaper sites, such as the Jerusalem Post and the Ha'aretz online editions) in several places in the article. In all cases these quotes are used to support factual claims. Should they be removed? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 15:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would say it's better to summarize his statements in your own words and provide a reference to the article where you found them rather than give direct quotes, especially the lengthy first one in the diff you gave.

<dd>Hmmm... photos made by news agencies generally can't be used, quite apart from the replaceability issue, because news photographers make their living from them, so using them runs afoul of <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">criterion 2</a> as exemplified by <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:FU">counterexample 5</a>. In this case, however, the picture is credited to Pearse Jordan himself, so it must be some privately made photo of him. (A school photo maybe? It looks like a mugshot.) At any rate, it certainly wouldn't be considered replaceable by a free image. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 09:21, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds like an argument for having current photos of them <i>in addition</i> to the child photos, not instead of.

<dd>Beyond making sure Wikipedia is not hosting two different images of Alice the Maid unnecessarily, what does the image content of one article have to do with another? There's no reason why the actor articles and the character article can't both use the same fair use image, as with whenever there is an overlap of content (e.g., musician and album articles). <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 17:25, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point is, the screenshots have a much stronger fair use claim in the characters' article than in the actors' articles.

<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>Could you possibly do one minor little favour for me? Please go over to <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesotho.html" title="Sesotho">Sesotho</a> and look at the table of affricates under the Consonants section.</p>
<p>Does that over-bar look right on your browser? If not, is this a problem only on some computers or did the guy who wrote the table make a mistake? If I simply move the bars to the right will that be sufficient or will it look funky on some other browsers?</p>
<p>Is this related to the problem with vowels in Indian scripts?</p>
<p>Also, shouldn't the 2 laterals that are listed under plosives be with the affricates instead? <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 16:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is with the font Arial Unicode MS. It has a bug that makes the overbar appear much further to the left than it ought to. This is mentioned at <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html#Affricates_and_double_articulation" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet#Affricates and double articulation</a>. It should stay the way it is, but if you know how to force a font in markup (I don't), you could do that so the text appears in a different font than Arial Unicode. Or you could leave the tie bar out altogether; it isn't really necessary. And yes, those are lateral affricates and should be listed with the other affricates. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 16:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr. I see you removed Image:Ralfkoenigpanel.gif, and register that you are not the greatest fan of fair use imagery and are devoted to the issue. But I am puzzled, so just to confirm this: you do <i>not</i> feel this illustration falls within the WP:FU policy. I think the image illustrates the text next to which it appears, is of lower resolution than the original, does not limit the copyright owner's rights to market or sell the work in any way, and is used on various websites, so its use on Wikipedia does not make it significantly more accessible or visible than it already is etc.. I also think an article about a comics creator without an inkling of visuals showing the nature of the work described in text is amputated, so really I wish you could elaborate upon the brief reasoning <i>"img is not fair use here"</i>.

The text it was next to was König's biography; no mention of <i>Der Bewegte Mann</i> or the character of Axel Feldheim is made (or would be appropriate there). If you want to start an article on the <i>Der Bewegte Mann</i>/<i>Pretty Baby</i> series, the image could probably be used there. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:25, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Dear Angr,<br />
<br />
I hope that you can review the deletion of this particular article. The reason given for the deletion of this article in the deletion log was that the content had been taken from this particular website: <a href="http://www.vpa.nie.edu.sg/music/hohweelong/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.vpa.nie.edu.sg/music/hohweelong/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vpa.nie.edu.sg/music/hohweelong/index.htm</a>. Hence I assume that the reason for deletion was a possible copyright infringement of this webpage. However, I would like to clarify that the creators of the wikipedia article Ho Hwee Long are associated with the National Institute of Education Symphonic Band (NIESB), which is one of the performing arts branches under the NIE visual and performing arts department. The NIE is an educational institution and the profile of Associate Professor Ho Hwee Long as provided on the website is available for all to use for non-commercial purposes, as long as it is reproduced in its entirety. Hence the wikipedia article on A/P Ho is not a copyright infringement of this webpage.<br />
<br />
Also, another reason earlier stated for the deletion of this article was that A/P Ho may not fulfill wikipedia's criteria for posting articles on musicians. I hope that these doubts about A/P Ho's notability have since been dispelled by the points that I and another user have listed on the deletion review page.<br />
<br />
I apologise for not stating the source of the content earlier. This is the first time that I am creating a wikipedia article and I hope that I have not caused too much inconvenience to you and any other administrator.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<dd>Sorry I would like to correct myself here. The profile of A/P Ho on the given page is not for non-commercial purposes ONLY. It is a free-use article that has been used whenever appropriate for anything related to A/P Ho. For example, concerts which feature A/P Ho would commonly use this profile of him in the concert booklet. Some of these concerts are for profiteering purposes. Another example of the free use of this article would be illustrated on this webpage: <a href="http://www.musefestival.com/judgesandcriteria.htm#" class="external free" title="http://www.musefestival.com/judgesandcriteria.htm#" rel="nofollow">http://www.musefestival.com/judgesandcriteria.htm#</a>. The article is once again used as a profile of A/P Ho's career to certify his position as a judge for this particular competition. As such, the article is indeed on a free use license. In conclusion, I hope that you can kindly approve this article. Thank you. Lmao123 09:43, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not in that form, no. There's no reason to copy-and-paste the information from that page instead of just writing an article about him in your own words. That said, I'm still unconvinced that he's notable enough to warrant an encyclopedia article. Please read the notability criteria listed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. If you feel he meets those criteria, you can rewrite the article to focus on the aspects of his career that show how he meets them. Please remember to <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">attribute the statements</a> you make to reliable sources--independent of Prof. Ho and those who know him personally--so that others can verify the information. Also, please remember to write from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>; the reader shouldn't get the impression that the Wikipedia article is praising (or condemning) Prof. Ho. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 12:31, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reliability of the source cannot be questioned since at least two separate organisations completely unaffiliated with each other use the same profile of A/P Ho. This is illustrated in the two separate websites provided in previous arguments. Also, I personally see no problem with the neutrality of the article. It merely traces out A/P Ho's musical career, but it does not go to extraordinary lengths to "praise" A/P Ho. It does not mention minor achievements and points of interest such as listing out all of his arrangements and compositions or elaborating on him being featured in a 45-min interview on national television in 2005. Coincidentally, these are also evidence that A/P Ho more than fulfills the criteria from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. However, as a musician, his work is centred around music and hence I believe that the content as of current is relevant enough and should not be changed in any way, as you have suggested. Should you still see any problem with the article, please indicate clearly the particular sections which do not seem relevant or neutral, rather than deeming the entire article inappropriate. Lastly, I would like to emphasise the fact that this is not the only article which copies directly from free use content. There are plenty of other articles on wikipedia which takes content straight off from other websites. If there are no problems with those articles, I do not see why the article on A/P Ho should be so heavily scrutinized when I have in fact shown the relevance of the article and also the free use licensing of the content.

<dd>My two cents, and I'm just adding this so that it cam be seen as more than just "one-on-one". Wikipedia frowns upon having content copied verbatim from Internet websites, especially where it is impossible to determine for 100% sure what the copyright status is. I would say that between the AFD, nomination, and DRV, that there is a consensus among established editors of Wikipedia that the article as it stood is inappropriate for Wikipedia, due to it having been copied verbatim. Therefore, trying to convince people to put the content back verbatim would be a waste of your time. This really makes the only option to rewrite the source into your own words prior to posting it here. While a number of editors are confirmed of Ho's notability, the only way to achieve a proper debate at this point on his own merits is to rewrite the article, in your own words, attributing your sources. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 16:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Gaelic</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure why you removed "Gaelic" from the opening of "Irish language". "Gaelic" is one of two primary names for the language. It's not a rarely used alternative name - at not least in speech - it is a common way of denoting it, and can't be dismissed as a deviant only used in the ignorant Irish diaspora. I was just at a talk by the Irish historian Enda Delaney, and he called the language "Gaelic" (he also called it Irish later in the talk, without apparently thinking about it); one of my best friends, who has no interest whatsoever in language politics, and who is Irish (son of the ex Irish ambassador to South Korea), always calls it "Gaelic". I'm not exhausting my experience here btw, I could go on! Being discussed elsewhere in the article doesn't seem relevant to me ... everything in the opening is discussed elsewhere in the article, that is the point of the opening. BTW, on a separate topic, and under your hat as an experienced admin, one person tried to remove my template on American English; the template is only tongue and cheek, but do you think I should actually remove it?

<dd>(1) The word "Gaelic" is a highly ambiguous. While it's true Irish is often referred to as "Gaelic", Scottish Gaelic is also often referred to as "Gaelic", and probably more frequently than Irish is. Starting out the article with "<b>Irish</b> or <b>Gaelic</b>" conveys an authority on an ambiguous word that it shouldn't have. I wouldn't mind starting it with "<b>Irish</b> or <b>Irish Gaelic</b>" though, since "Irish Gaelic" is unambiguous, and the name used in Ethnologue. (2) It's up to you. I know I get pissed off at editors who have tongue-in-cheek (not "tongue and cheek") userboxes that are derogatory toward American English, so it's not surprising if others get pissed off at userboxes that are derogatory toward un-American English. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 16:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(1) Well, the language is referred to simply as Gaelic prolly more often than Irish Gaelic, which is why it originally had [Irish] <b>Gaelic</b>. Someone deleted the [Irish] part, which was the point that you got to it. (2) I've always thought the irony and tongue-<b>and</b>-cheek (didn't know you linguists believed in usage prescription) nature of my userbox should be obvious by the fact that I'm not an American user. Frankly, pissing off a few people who are obsessed with and hold their identity to a few meaningless spelling differences doesn't really bother me. That of course is not the box' intention. I was just asking to find out if i can defend my right to keep it and get away with it.

<dd>You dont have to assume it is image of Rana or Maharana Pratap's statue situated at Moti Magri Udaipur.I have known the place and the Image long back.However I am not certain this perticulerly pic was taken by me or not.It might be possible that it is downloaded from a web page or CD.I also have another pic of the same taken by me but not so clear.Well image of Taj Mahal taken by differnt angles and by different persons can not be copyright.It can not be questionable if it appeared in Greek News papers and all that.But I am sad to know that you put too many questions about it.I am sure at least 90% images in Wikipedia taken from web pages.I personally feel some crooked persons want to destroy history and want to defame Rajputs.If you are reallly not of that stock kindly restore it unless it is challenged by the copyright holder himself.If it was a copyright why did it appear in Greek news papers.Did they obtain licence from the auther of this perticulerly image.Image of a famous person can appear anywhere in the world.Still its your choice delete it if you want.But I am sure ask your soul before doing it.</dd>

<dd>It got deleted because when you uploaded it, you labeled it as a fair-use image of a living person, which automatically tags the image for deletion, because Wikipedia policy doesn't allow fair-use images of living people in most circumstances (see <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:FU">counterexample 8</a> of the fair use policy). Do you know who the photographer is? If so, you could ask him to release the image under a free license such as the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> or one of the Wikipedia-compatible <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_Licenses_4308.html" title="Creative Commons Licenses">Creative Commons Licenses</a>. The important thing is that the photographer <i>not</i> gives permission to Wikipedia alone, but rather that he gives permission for anyone to reuse the image, including for commercial purposes and to make derivatives. Alternatively, since Andy Malcolm is your father, you could take a picture of him yourself and upload that, using one of the licenses at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#For_image_creators" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#For image creators</a>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 05:17, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not think that a picture of Andy age 73 would do justice to the article really - I would prefer a picture showing him as a player - a piece of history - he was at the time a very well known figure particularly in East London.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">image deletion</span></h2>
<p>You initially deleted Image:posner_1.jpg because it did not have adequate fair use documentation, which I understand. I replaced the initial photo with a new one that was open to Public use from Flickr, and provided a link where you could view it. The person who took this photograph (and if you follow the link you can see all their bio information) has expressly permitted public use of the photo. I am not sure what else you would like to see documented. Let's discuss but I would like to re-add the photo as I think it is appropriate. Perhaps documentation needs improved? <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadreNuestro_558c.html" title="User:PadreNuestro">PadreNuestro</a> 13:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Flickr page you linked to said clearly "© All rights reserved"; nevertheless you put a {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} tag on it. It isn't licensed by the GFDL, or by a Wikimedia-suitable Creative Commons License. "This is a public image" on Flickr only means you don't have to be a logged-on user to <i>see</i> the picture; it says nothing about using the image. "All rights reserved" means it's an unfree image, so we can't use it here. Anyone in the vicinity could take a picture of the building and release it under a free license, so there's no reason to use a copyrighted image of it (and doing so violates Wikipedia policy). —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I personally know the person who took the photo and they gave me express permission to use it, would that change anything? Also, not familiar with the creative commons stuff you're talking about (fairly new to all this). Once I get this person's express permission to use this do I need to do anything else?

<dd>You can read about the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_Licenses_4308.html" title="Creative Commons Licenses">Creative Commons Licenses</a> at that article. The ones that are acceptable are CC-BY (attribution) and CC-BY-SA (attribution, sharealike). "NC" (noncommercial) and "ND" (no derivatives) licenses are not acceptable. If you know the photographer, try to persuade him to change his Flickr licensing to CC-BY or CC-BY-SA so that Wikipedia can use it. Permission for Wikipedia to use the image isn't actually enough, because Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_content.html" title="Free content">free content</a> encyclopedia, meaning our material has to be reusable by others, even for commercial purposes. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:29, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi sir, thank you for your good advice i really appreciate it. It is to soon to nominate myself for adminship indeed. I am not the kind of user that edits really. I only read but as i have spent alot of time on reading articles i´ve discovered users who do not follow Wikipedia´s policy. Therefor i am sure i can become an admin more quickly than most in order to convince and help users who are in trouble, to make them better users for Wikipedia. I´ve read almost everything there is to know about Wikipedia. I also would like to help with images as i see many risk to put Wikipedia in legal jeopardy so i hope to help with that aswell. Please write to me again if you still think i should be giving a quick adminship.

<p>Hi, Please let me know what is the definition of notability? and is this a strong reason to delete my contribution about John Tait, this sounds very strange.</p>

Anyway this wasn't a finished contribution and shouldn't be deleted, kindly return the con tent back.</p>

<dd>The terminology is discussed in the "Names of the language" section. The infobox should be kept short and sweet, using the most common names for the language, which is "Irish" in English and "Gaeilge" in Irish. Especially in Irish, it's only called "Gaeilge na hÉireann" if it's being contrasted with Scottish Gaelic and/or Manx. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 17:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
