<dd>Red Angus cattle are indeed from a recessive gene, however, they remain two completely different breeds of cattle.

<dd>Excellent question. The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marbled_meat.html" title="Marbled meat">marbled meat</a> article is flat-out deficient. Marbling, when it comes to steak, is generally considered to be "a good thing" (especially in the corn-fed US beef system). It is referring to the whitish color mixed in amongst the meat. <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagyu.html" title="Wagyu">Wagyu</a> are renowned for their marbling characteristics, and are probably the extreme example with regards to marbling in beef. <a href="http://www.certifiedangusbeef.com/meijer/" class="external text" title="http://www.certifiedangusbeef.com/meijer/" rel="nofollow">This site</a> discusses marbling with regards to angus beef specifically. Marbling inside the lean meat can taste good, marbling in the steak cuts is also important, and angus cattle have an excellent lean meat percentage yield (as compared to some other breeds). I'd love to improve that marbling article, but the article I cited for this discussion is obviously more than a little biased on the subject. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelviper_3994.html" title="User:Steelviper">Steelviper</a> 17:10, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lean is relative: it could be worse! Just remember that the USDA beef grading system is backwards. It was designed back when we had little understanding of heart disease. Back then, most people needed the calories too.

<dd>Not to sound rude, but what's your experience in beef production? I see you bashing fat in meat because of your personal tastes but industry wide, fat/marbling is a positive, not a negative. It's not a personal preference of mine, it's one of the cornerstones of running a successful feedlot and marketing beef. Packers pay more for beef that is properly finished (the right amount of fat) because that's what consumers demand. However, I'm not sure what this has to do with Angus cattle. Wouldn't it be more appropriate for you to take this to an article on marbling or the USDA grading system? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Schroeder_c5f6.html" title="User:Jeff Schroeder">Jeff Schroeder</a> 04:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can well believe that increased fat is a positive for the industry. It probably requires less animal feed per pound to produce, and it certainly requires less space. Consumers demand what is advertized, no matter if the fat content is high or low. I suspect that a typical shopper buys Angus Certified, not realizing what it means, but chooses the leanest piece available. (as for appropriateness, well, <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> raised the issue here) <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 03:34, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Packers spend quite a bit by finishing cattle to the right amount of fat. If it weren't for the fact that consumers demand marbling in their meat, it would make more sense to just leave cattle on grass. The grading system we have was designed to objectively grade beef based on what consumers demand. The grading system was in place a long time before the CAB program existed and Angus were known for providing increased marbling LONG before CAB. In fact, there has actually been an increase in demand for lean beef during the time of the CAB program. May I ask what your experience is in beef production/marketing?<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Schroeder_c5f6.html" title="User:Jeff Schroeder">Jeff Schroeder</a> 19:54, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the last few days of finishing cattle are usually a waste because the only weight that is added is back fat, which is the enemy of the industry. Intramuscular fat is made well before the final finish. Back fat is what must be trimmed, and is considered a loss by packers because they paid for the animal by weight, and the more muscle, the more profit they can get from one animal. If finishers would stop a few weeks earlier, they'd save a lot of that back fat. But if you're selling by weight, and not by yield grade, then putting that extra fat on is profitable for the producer, because he'll get more whether the animal is all muscle or all fat. MY experience in beef production comes from working on farm with 500 head of Angus cattle. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukemeiser_16f3.html" title="User:Dukemeiser">Dukemeiser</a> 04:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The correct term for what Angus beef provides is marbling. Somebody with an axe to grind might call that bad but it's a key factor in the popularity of the Angus breed. Please keep commentary on the health impact of marbling out of this article, it has no place here.</p>
<p>Relative to other breeds, Angus cattle do not produce lean beef. They provide a genetic source of better marbling. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Schroeder_c5f6.html" title="User:Jeff Schroeder">Jeff Schroeder</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jeff_Schroeder_301d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jeff Schroeder">contribs</a>)</p>

<dd>No, it's "better marbling", how is that POV? The Angus breed has genes that promote better marbling, period. I'm not saying that marbling is better in terms of your personal taste but Angus do provide better marbling than other breeds. You seem to be on some kind of anti-fat kick. I certainly understand that even if I don't agree with it but why do you insist on bringing it into this article? Shouldn't you target the marbling article instead? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Schroeder_c5f6.html" title="User:Jeff Schroeder">Jeff Schroeder</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jeff_Schroeder_301d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jeff Schroeder">contribs</a>)</dd>

Compare: Spending more time in the sun will give you a <i><b>better</b></i> sunburn? Well, yeah, if a major sunburn is your goal. For the rest of us, spending more time in the sun will give you a worse sunburn.

<dd>First, your straw man argument about sun burns does nothing to help the conversation. Honestly, marbling is not a bad word. Marbling is something that has a definition of what is better/worse. There are standards for marbling that have been established by the USDA. I don't just assume that better marbling and increased marbling are the same thing, it's the standard of how meat is graded. For some reason you seem to have decided to assign a personal bias to the word marbling because you don't like it. Again, if you wish to continue it, it would be much more appropriate to continue it in the article on the USDA grading system, not here. I don't understand why you thought it was appropriate for this article in the first place.<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Schroeder_c5f6.html" title="User:Jeff Schroeder">Jeff Schroeder</a> 19:45, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you know what a "straw man" is? His mention of sun burns wasn't an argument, it was an analogy, and it was a perfect one. "Increased" (or "more" or "greater") is a perfectly clear and NPOV way to describe a more prominent marbling; moreseo than "better" is, so why fight?--128.164.229.179 13:53, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure how many people in the discussion actually raise cattle for a living, but let me give you a first hand account. I work for (and will eventually help manage) a large pure bred Angus herd (over 500 head). Marbling is a VERY good thing to us. In fact, we are doing everything in our power to increase the marbling (also called intramuscular fat) in our heard. Consumers WANT marbling. Marbling provides a more tender, juicy, flavorful cut of meat. If that wasn't what consumers wanted, we sure wouldn't be trying to increase it. <i>Personal preference</i> is different from the <i>vast majority</i> which is why marbling is here to stay.<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukemeiser_16f3.html" title="User:Dukemeiser">Dukemeiser</a> 04:13, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's been suggested that Angus cattle be merged with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Angus_57f7.html" title="Red Angus">Red Angus</a>. I created the Red Angus page, and I don't think these two pages should be merged for the following reasons...</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Angus are acknowledged as a different breed, and has different breed associations.</li>
<li>Red Angus also have a different studbook to Black Angus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the genetics of the two breeds are very similar, the fact remains that the breeds are separate breeds. Angus Australia talks about the 'red angus relatives' <a href="http://www.angusaustralia.com.au/AiA_RedAngus_in_Aus.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.angusaustralia.com.au/AiA_RedAngus_in_Aus.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and Australia, as well as a lot of other countries, has an official website <a href="http://www.redangus.org.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.redangus.org.au/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is also being discussed at the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Angus_57f7.html" title="Red Angus">Red Angus</a> talk page. I should also mention that although the two breeds are similar, the reason they are classified as different breeds is because of different genetics and coat colour Once more, I would like to stress that these are two different breeds of cattle, and I think that both breeds should merit separate pages on Wikipedia.

<dd>I completely agree and second your motion! As a Black Angus producer (in the U.S.) I was appalled that the two articles might be merged. The breeds are very distinct now and each deserve their own pages with their own history, which is why I removed the suggested merger. Seeing the disarray this black Angus page is in, I will attempt to clean it up, expand, and generally "wikify" it.<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukemeiser_16f3.html" title="User:Dukemeiser">Dukemeiser</a> 05:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As this page is about the breed Black Angus, I think it would be a good idea to move the page to its actual name. This also will give it more equality with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Angus_57f7.html" title="Red Angus">Red Angus</a>, and it will have the article make more sense- in the very first sentence (in italics) it says 'this page is about the Black Angus breed of cattle' or equivalent to that. I'd move this page anyway, but as more people than before are visiting it now, I decided to mention it here first.

<li><b>Comment</b> There <i>is</i> a problem here in that Americans do not refer to red and black animals as being the same breed. So for the Americans that read (and edit) the article, it becomes difficult to write about the black breed while keeping the red in mind for others. I still support the change to Black Angus because thus far nobody has offered a non-American view point for the article. If somebody else wants to write up what it's like in the UK or (I assume) New Zealand, or Canada then that could be posted on the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_cattle.html" title="Angus cattle">Angus cattle</a> page and have the American version on the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Angus_7ecc.html" title="Black Angus">Black Angus</a> page. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukemeiser_16f3.html" title="User:Dukemeiser">Dukemeiser</a> 11:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, that is neither a complete nor an accurate picture, not even of American usage.</dd>
<dd>Americans will use "Angus" to refer to Black Angus; they are less likely to use "Angus" standing alone without an adjective for Red Angus.</dd>
<dd>That is especially true with crosses. "Angus-Limousin" (or Angus-whatever) is often used for a Black Angus cross, more often than "Black Angus-Limousin" is. It's likely the opposite usage frequency with Red Angus, usually including the adjective.</dd>
<dd>Americans do sometimes use "<a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_Angus_3c4e.html" title="Aberdeen Angus">Aberdeen Angus</a>" today.</dd>
<dd>The term "American Angus" is sometimes used to refer to a breed, not just to the organization known as the "American Angus Association".</dd>
<dd>There are still purebred Black Angus sires and dams with redcolored offspring, who according to this article would not be eligible (since 1917 in the U.S., but it may differ elsewhere) for registration as either a Black Angus or a Red Angus.</dd>
<dd>Black red-carrier Angus cattle are sometimes treated differently from non-carrier black ones, and differently from red ones as well.</dd>
<dd>The history of Angus cattle long predates the separation of the two strains. Putting this article at "Black Angus" would be very misleading, a much more serious mistake than the "difficult to write about" complaint in your comment above. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 18:02, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't make myself very clear in my previous post but what I already knew and what you clarified was that when I tell people I work for a large Angus ranch, I don't have to tell them it's black Angus; it's implied. When I'm talking to other Americans it is implied. However, if I were talking to someone from the UK, I might need to clarify although they might know enough about the situation that I wouldn't. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_cattle.html" title="Angus cattle">Angus cattle</a> means different things to different people reading <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. I've never heard anyone refer to it as Aberdeen Angus. You don't think that <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_cattle.html" title="Angus cattle">Angus cattle</a> has some ambiguity to it? A page entitled <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Angus_7ecc.html" title="Black Angus">Black Angus</a> would most certainly clarify that the article refers to the black strain of the breed and would have an opening something like this: <b>Black Angus</b>, or more commonly referred to simply as <b>Angus</b> is a breed of cattle that originated from Scotland.

<dd>I think one of the biggest problems is that the notion of "Black Angus" as a distinct breed, as opposed to "black Angus" with "black" as a descriptive term for the coat color of either an individual or even for most of a herd, is a mid-20th century invention, and Angus are a whole lot older than that. That, however, is a distinction we cannot make in our article names, with initial capitalization turned on. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Humans (<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_sapiens.html" title="Homo sapiens">homo sapiens</a> are much older than the Angus breed, and yet we still categorize people by the color of their skin. The notion that Angus are old and therefore the distinct color of their hair is irrelevant is silly. As far as the history books tell us Hugh Watson took polled cattle and started selecting black animals. This practice of promoting a <b>black</b> breed started long before the mid-20th century, the Angus breed was founded on black animals! But this is the 21st century where there are two distinct breeds of black and red animals. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukemeiser_16f3.html" title="User:Dukemeiser">Dukemeiser</a> 18:40, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Working on a farm in Australia, I find that we normally specify whether the breed is '<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Angus_57f7.html" title="Red Angus">Red Angus</a> or Black Angus. As the breed <i>is</i> called Aberdeen Angus, this would mean that the article would normally be called this, however, as virtually no one uses this term anymore, it should be under the name 'Black Angus'. 'Angus cattle' implies a much more general term, whereas 'Black Angus' implies more equality and eveness with 'Red Angus'. 'Angus cattle' in my opinion, seems to be a more 'superior' term, than 'Black Angus'. Also, at shows, you'll find that the cattle have 'Black Angus judging' and 'Red Angus judging'- not Angus cattle judging and Red Angus judging. <b><a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_9ae1.html" title="User:CattleGirl"><font color="blue">Cat</font><font color="darkblue">tleG</font><font color="black">irl</font></a></b> <sup><i><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECattleGirl_3ed2.html" title="User talk:CattleGirl">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_Esperanza_1bb2.html" title="User:CattleGirl/Esperanza"><font color="green">e@</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_CattleGirl_4f9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/CattleGirl">review me!</a></i></sup> 23:42, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It may well be that in Australia, and in North America, "Aberdeen Angus" is less often used than it once was, and may not be immediately recognized by the vast majority of people who have gotten away from agriculture as a way of making a living. But I'd bet that all cattlemen, anywhere with a significant Angus population whether they raise Angus themselves or not, still immediately recognize and understand the "Aberdeen Angus" term. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Some comments from an outsider. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_cattle.html" title="Angus cattle">Angus cattle</a> to me is a catch all name for several breeds. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Angus_7ecc.html" title="Black Angus">Black Angus</a> is a common name for a type of angus cattle.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_cattle.html" title="Angus cattle">Angus cattle</a> should be a dab page or a short overview and maybe history of the Augus cattle breeds/types/names (<a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen-Angus_9c3a.html" title="Aberdeen-Angus">Aberdeen-Angus</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Angus_7ecc.html" title="Black Angus">Black Angus</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Angus_57f7.html" title="Red Angus">Red Angus</a> and any others).</li>

<dd>It is still just a recessive gene. There are still red-carriers among the Black Angus herds. Mating a black cow and a black bull can still result in red offspring 1/4 of the time, black red-carriers 1/2 the time, and black non-carriers 1/4 of the time.</dd>

<dd>It is still just a recessive gene. If you breed a black, non–red carrier bull with a red cow (or vice versa), what you would expect to get is black red–carrier calves. Those are still purebred Angus, not really crosses, and they aren't Gelbvieh or anything else. They are Angus. In some jurisdictions it appears likely from what the article says that they can be registered as such. In other jurisdictions, they might not be able to be registered as Red Angus or not be able to be registered as Black Angus or both.</dd>

<dd>This may be the case in rare instances, but black red-carriers are getting rarer all the time. Just like other traits the make them ineligible for registration (such as white above the naval), the selection process is moving away from these traits. Red calves may have been common 30 years ago, but now they would be an embarrassment and a brand of inferiority in an all black herd. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukemeiser_16f3.html" title="User:Dukemeiser">Dukemeiser</a> 00:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a lifelong Angus cattle breeder and had some notes to make. Firstly, the article claims that Angus have a high-yielding carcass. In fact, the Angus have the next-to-worst dressing percentage. The only worse yields are from the dairy breeds. Our own herd averages just under 63% dressing. That is right in line with Angus average. The Continentals will beat that by 1 or 2 points. Secondly, the term marbling seems to have generated some controversy. Marbling (IM fat) is entirely different from BF (backfat or external fat). Marbling is known to increase tenderness and flavor. BF is simply wasted and trimmed off at the packing floor. There is a common misconception that ONLY grain feeding will produce marbling and that ONLY high BFs will give good marbling. We have had many, many "fats" that grade choice or prime with less than .2 inches of BF. Explain that! Some cattle can grade choice with no grain whatsoever. Thirdly, regarding the comments about the reds being present in "Black Angus" as a recessive gene. This is patently false. All purebred Angus (black) are homozygous black and will not create "1/4 reds" or "1/4 red carriers" unless there is a red animal back in the pedigree somewhere. This is common in the commercials, but not registered Angus. The comment about Angus being heavier milkers is also not true. They milk at a very OPTIMAL level (sustainably....which is positive), but they will not outmilk the Continentals as a percentage of milk per bodyweight. That is why they do re-breed (fertility!) better than any cattle, bar none. Another thing...Angus are not the champs at marbling either, much as we would like our consumers to think. The Jerseys and the Shorthorns will beat the Angus anyday. In fact, many "disreputable" breeders create higher marbling cattle by injecting an 1/8 or 1/16 of Jersey or Brown Swiss or Wagyu. You must remember how they got the rep for marbling---because the consumer and packer was comparing it to the Continentals and the Bos Indicus, which are inferior marblers. The latter are also known to be tough on the Warner-Bratzler Shear Test.66.82.9.17 01:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
