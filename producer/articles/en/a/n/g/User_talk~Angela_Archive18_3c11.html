<p>I just closed an AfD as DELETE <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Body_parts_slang_2_159f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Body parts slang 2">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Body_parts_slang_2</a>. However, a similar(<i>some</i> of it is redemable as it <i>is</i> common knowledge and the terms are used in numerous maintream books) article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_sexual_slang_1f87.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of sexual slang">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of sexual slang</a> had KEEP. The intro to <b>sexual slang</b> article is better, <i>but</i> the rest drifts off into O.R. just like the "article" that I just deleted.</p>
<p>We really need to get a standard for these, are they OK or not? And how should they be done? WP:NOR and the fact that Wikipedia is not a random assortment of info (also policy) present huge problems for such articles. I could say 656 means "sex using X and Y and position Z" and there is <b>nothing</b> to back it up. I just don't think this stuff belongs at Wikipedia. If one wants to search for such things, then use Google.</p>
<p>Hopefully, my decision will be a landmark one, so we can get all this O.R. nonsense off Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Wouldn't adding sources and removing any unsourced terms solve the problem? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, in a way, that is why the other article survived, as some of it was citable, although much garbage still exists. The Body Parts Slang article had <b>nothing</b> salvagable. Still, a clear(as much as possible) standard should be established. [[User:Voice of All(MTG)|]] 13:50, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More generally, I believe that <b>r</b>evealing <b>IP</b> (<i>rIPping</i>) vandals should be an option in the most disruptive cases of sockpuppet vandalism (especially vandalbots) that prevents Wikipedia from functioning normally (causing articles to be permanently protected, for instance). This would be an alternative to the earlier proposal to give more users Checkuser privilege, with the advantage that the privacy of ordinary users (and even garden-variety vandals) would be as secure as before.</p>
<p>Publicly revealing the IP would allow the grunt work of liaising with ISP's abuse contact person to be delegated to a "ToS committee" (Terms of Service) of ordinary users (without checkuser privilege), so reporting of terms of service violations to ISPs and followup could be done more systematically and effectively than is the case today. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:50, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't need to publicly reveal the IP in order to write to the ISP.

<p>Hi, I've been discussing this with David Cannon who does the stats pages, and he referred me to you!</p>
<p>You see, all the stats and rankings for all wikis are all skewed by the fact that the "numberofarticles" counter for the Afar wikipedia for reasons I can't explain, reads "6", when the actual number of articles there happens to be more like "0"... There have not been any articles whatsoever there for months, not even the vandals' joke articles that were all deleted...

It is also very interesting that users Ted Wilkes and Wyss, who frequently worked together in deleting my contributions to Wikipedia articles, are now working together in denigrating a member of the arbitration committee, simply because his opinion was not in line with their personal view.

<p>I had a discussion on IRC today with editor <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasa_Stefanovic_d4b6.html" title="User:Sasa Stefanovic">Sasa Stefanovic</a>, who was looking for someone to block 65.9.143.188 over a dispute over which image to use on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Serbs_d101.html" title="List of Serbs">List of Serbs</a>. He claims to be an admin on srwiki (which I don't doubt) and insists that the image he wants on the article is the one preferred by the admins of srwiki. Now, frankly, enwiki isn't required to follow the vote of a bunch of srwiki admins. I pointed out that this appears to be a content dispute and asked him to follow en's dispute resolution policy, but he refused, saying instead that he would ask you to take care of it on the grounds that "you would understand him". I would ask you to refuse to bypass en's dispute resolution processes simply because he requests it of you. This matter should be resolved according to en's policies; his role, rank, or status on a sister project is not grounds for special treatment in this regard.

<dd>Hi Angela, as you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Serbs&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Serbs&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a> i put image Image:Srbi.jpg on article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Serbs_d101.html" title="List of Serbs">List of Serbs</a> because that image is voted <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbs_19ba.html#Voting_for_picture_of_Serbs" title="Talk:Serbs">here</a>, almost all active admins vote for that picture. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> is start to revert that picture with his own Image:Srbs3.JPG on article <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> (you can see that in history). Now after i put that same image on article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Serbs_d101.html" title="List of Serbs">List of Serbs</a> *vandal* 65.9.143.188 is start to revert it. I looking on IRC for some admin who can help me and block that vandal, and thay told me to discuss that with that vandal, i think that this unregisterd user is <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a>, and he start again to revert this picture. Picture that i request to be on article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Serbs_d101.html" title="List of Serbs">List of Serbs</a> is voted picture (i must say this again because it very important here).

<dd>I agree with Kelly that votes of admins on another project shouldn't overrule policies or community decisions here. Adminship isn't about this sort of content decision anyway - it's just about trused people having access to some functions that make it easier for them to maintain their wiki. I can only advise you discuss this on the talk page and try to come to some consensus about it rather than appealing to any supposed auhority. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:53, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, I have been putting it off because I realized that it would be odd to walk into Wiley to recruit on behalf of Wikipedia just because Joe and I think its a good idea. I thought it would be best if I consulted Anthere, Jimbo, and you and see what ya'll think; before running off and making an appointment to discuss an outreach program.

<dd>Hi again, I sure you've been busy and can't remember. However the impact of what have you done is visible. I would reiterate - the page is protected and the protected text is in weasel terms. No more, no less. I am <b>not</b> asking for adminship but for user's page to be unprotected. How much you can read Bulgarian to make up your mind (or you took side based on some translations)?</dd>
<dd>What I am asking is:
<ul>
<li>Remove the protection on user's personal and talk pages. It cannot do any harm.</li>
<li>Write on the page why you've done that. If you can't remember it would be nice if you write it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I do not know what have happened, and cannot find any clue. Your answer, though polite, leads to a deadend. I would advocate to leave such disputes to the community, and not to act like some sort of a big daddy.</dd>
<dd>Please accept my sincere apologies if you find any offense in my words. No offense is meant.

<dd>Hi, Angela. The user Bggoldie has not raised any questions or concerns about this on bg.wikipedia. The (emergency) desysopped user has done death threats on me (on <a href="../../../../bg/%D0%BA/%D1%80/%D1%8A/%D0%A3%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F%7E%D0%9A%D1%80%D1%8A%D1%87%D0%BC%D0%B0_b35e.html" class="extiw" title="bg:Уикипедия:Кръчма">bg.wikipedia</a> and on <a href="../../../../bg/e/m/i/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%7EEmil_Mehanik_wodach_4660.html" class="extiw" title="bg:Потребител:Emil/Mehanik_wodach">irc/bg.wikipedia</a>) and to another user Emil (on an external website, now defunct). Several users/admins have confirmed the concerns in the e-mail. <b><a href="../../../../bg/%D0%BF/%D1%80/%D0%B5/%D0%A3%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F%7E%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8_0f44.html" class="extiw" title="bg:Уикипедия:Предложения_за_администратори">The parallelly conducted vote actually de-admined this user</a></b>. About the query from Bggoldie, there are several admins/bureaucrat on bg.wiki that can unprotect the pages if the user requests it (although he has publicly stated that he leaves the project), and (re-)sysop any candidate, also if community consensus is reached. To Bggoldie: the (Bggoldie|PrinceYuki)-(Emil) conflicts about article titles on&#160;:bg: should not be transferred here. --<a href="../../../5/k/o/User%7E5ko.html" title="User:5ko">5ko</a> 08:28, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now having some trace back to Bulgarian Wiki I can further discuss it there with Petko/5ko. However I can only urge both Angela and Petko to leave some more meaningful information on user's pages (for example links provided here). Though dead threats were clearly seen (and duly logged by user Emil) I doubt Petko was that scared living in France, and The Engineer most probably being in Bulgaria. From the history I can see some Petko's words which can be considered provocative/offensive, and can be one of the reasons for the frustration and subsequent alienation of user The Engineer. IMHO Petko way too late started to calm down (though I might be wrong lacking some information).</dd>
<dd>Anyways going through the links I just saw an alarming text: nomination for de-admin, one vote, and ... second voter confirming literally "Angela have already taken care of it". The rest of votes (though all positive) came afterwards. So it seems you intervened <b>before</b> people have voted to remove admin rights of the user. "parallelly conducted vote" means without a time machine one cannot have the reason for action, and with the "I can't remember"-justiication currently am seeing this as admin abuse.</dd>
<dd>I am interested to go through all details of this single incident, as am going to use the findings to make my mind about Wikipedia in general and Bulgarian one in particular. And what I am seeing up to now is going from bad to worse.

<dd>Under the window I am typing in lies the following text: "...and must be based on verifiable sources". Is there a difference between content and meta-data? Sorry if it is offensive to you but your lack of traceable and verifyable reasons for desysopping might be considered abusive. And I am discussing this with you as you (and not a BG-Wiki admin) have desysopped the user in question. I fully understand you might have had compelling reasons to do so back in July (and would like to know them). However I joined Wiki in September and cannot distinguish whether you abused your power or there was a really sound reason. If you had done so after the vote in Bulgarian editors - I can understand, and would agree. For me personally the problem is in uncertainity - you might have done it in good faith or may not.

<p>Hi Angela ... I liked to discuss this issue with u firstly , i have heard that creation of new pages property will be canceled for unregistered users , actually i was thinking in something similar regarding the Arabic Wikipedia , but not with cration of new pages but in the Editing , actually most unregistered users come just for vandalism or for putting their unbalanced opinions , they expereseed their intolerance and fanatism when they r anonymous and destroy the work of many users who tried to give balanced view of the issue , the policy of restricting IP is not so usefull as most of arabic users has dynamic IP not static and blocking a domain caould prevent users of whole country . also the protection of pages isn,t so practical , i think the person must register before allowing him to edit and then we can punish him for vandalism or discuss him about his opinions and other issues .</p>
<p>so is that possible that we try cancelling the Editing for unregistered users in AR wikipedia ... and i,m sure that would be so good for Ar wikipedia ... Discuss that with jimmy wales and if that is ok i can make Voting in AR wikipedia to make this change .</p>

<dd>I don't think that would be appropriate at all. Wikipedia should be openly editable, and it's even more important on a small wiki like ar to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible to encourage new users.

<p>Hi Angela ... Thanks for ur reply ... i understand totally ur viewpoint , and i agree with you that barrier for editing shouldn,t be high , but i was just angry from some unresponsible anons behaviour , recently the proposal for semi-protection seems so practical and very important for me to ban such unresponsible users especially that their vandalism happens in particular issues like religious and political issues so such semi-protection policy would be so important to increase the quality of Wikipedia articles in all languages as i guess .</p>
<p>At last , i have restored again my request for getting access in Ar_Wiktionary to organize this projects as the only sysop there is absent for long time . please take care about this Request . thanks alot again --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfinishedchaos_15c9.html" title="User:Unfinishedchaos">Unfinishedchaos</a> 18:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela, I am SWD316. I was just wondering if you could answer a couple of questions for me about a Wikicity I stumbled upon. <a href="http://prowrestling.wikicities.com/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://prowrestling.wikicities.com/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Is this you</a> in the edit history of the WikiCity rolling vandalism? Another question I have for you is that this project is pretty much deserted. Deserted based on there hasn't been an edit on there since August, I think.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I could do something to save the project. It would be a shame to loose a whole Wikicity over being abandoned. I have invited the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Professional_wrestling_ab8a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Professional wrestling">Pro Wrestling Wikiproject</a> over there to see if they would like to take a stab at fixing it.</p>
<p>Since every Main space edit I have on Wikipedia is under the genre of pro wrestling, I want to save the Wikicity the best I can. I know I can't save it alone, especially since there are no users. That brings me to this question, are there any Developers, Bureaucrats, or even admins on that Wikicity? How do I become an admin on an abandoned WikiCity? I know, stupid question, but I really don't want to see this die out. <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316"><font color="#FF0000">S</font><font color="#EE0000">W</font><font color="#DD0000">D</font><font color="#CC0000">3</font><font color="#BB0000">1</font><font color="#AA0000">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316"><font color="#0000FF">talk to m</font></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#00FF00">e</font></a></sup> 01:39, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to bother you again Angela but I responded on your talk page on Meta-Wiki to no response. So I'll respond here. I am currently awaiting your decision about whether or not I can be admin on the Pro Wrestling Wikicity or not. I know you said if I needed the powers you could give me access, so can I? I haven't been able to really start today because I don't know where to start. Although I got a couple of people to join in, it might be easier with admin powers.</p>
<p>PS. I want to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Years. <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316"><font color="#FF0000">S</font><font color="#EE0000">W</font><font color="#DD0000">D</font><font color="#CC0000">3</font><font color="#BB0000">1</font><font color="#AA0000">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316"><font color="#0000FF">talk to m</font></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#00FF00">e</font></a></sup> 23:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela, i´m contacting you from Georgia (Europe), i´m presenting myself as member of Georgian Internet Alliance. We have some plans around one project about Open Source Software, Community Portal, support and open documentation &amp; etc. Maybe we can help wikipedia/wikimedia to make it´s mirror on our future server in Georgia to help local visitors view wikipedia much faster, effective. We need to know, how is possible to make only ka.wikipedia.org-s mirror for first step and then whole your database.</p>
<p>We are officialy working under translation of KDE, mozilla, opera, &amp; other free software. Currently we are now little busy to work under translations, while we are organizing several projects and portals but i think it will be done with mediawiki translation in a week. Main programming-specific part is already done, but i have not uploaded it on sourceforge yet.</p>
<p>Also we want to help wikpedia editors to communicate - we will create special section and we also plan to add mediawiki engine for tests.</p>
<p>Sorry for my broken english.</p>

<dd>Thanks Angela, i have contacted them via IRC. It seems, that bulding mirror is impossible due security and flexibility, controlling problems, only cache-servers allowed, but we will contact your team about it at FOSDEM 2006 meeting in Belgium. You may delete this record if you wish it. Huge thanks for help!</dd>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Do you happen to know if there's been any discussion relatively recently about using second-hand hardware (for the squid or apache computers)? The only thing I've found about the possibility of that is in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_we_use_the_money_for" class="extiw" title="meta:What_we_use_the_money_for">Meta:What we use the money for</a> which is over a year old. I also tried asking at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28proposals%29_6eab.html#Second-hand_hardware" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Second-hand_hardware</a>, and there were some people in favour and against, and one person saying that rack space is a limiting factor, but no links to discussions of the proposal.</p>

<dd>Hello. Non-commercial licenses and licenses exclusive to Wikipedia are not acceptable since we are aiming to produce a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_content.html" title="Free content">free</a> encyclopedia, so the content needs to reusable by others. Since this is a wiki, you need to expect your work will be altered by others, so you can't specify that it can not be altered. Outside of Wikipedia, the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/" rel="nofollow">by-nc-nd</a> would be a license that prevents commercial work and derivative versions, but this would be deleted if you tried to use such a license on Wikipedia. If you change your mind and want the image to be used on Wikipedia, the most commonly chosen license would be <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> ({{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}) or GFDL dual-licensed with a Creative Commons license such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">by-sa</a> ({{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">Cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}}). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 19:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. I always expected my <i>prose</i> to be altered by others on Wikipedia, but I was rather unsure of things like photographs. I was worried about a vague notion of "malicious changes" to my photographs which might reflect badly on me as the creator or on the subjects of the photos. I thought that as long as Wikipedia didn't have to pay for the content uploaded by its editors, and Internet readers didn't have to pay to use it as a reference, that this satisfied the free content principle. It bothered me that commercial interests would be able to take my photographs off of Wikipedia and utilize them for profit. But if it must be so, it must. I expect I'll be using GFDL-self on Wikipedia. Thank you for your help. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 23:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would you consider demoting some of the long-inactive bureaucrats, like <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">user:Optim</a> back to sysop. I would be more likely to support new BCrats if they replaced inactive ones. 1/2 of BCrats are not even active anymore. This is an important wikipedia task, if you can no longer do it or are no longer willing, then someone else should get the job. I don't want a bunch of inactive BCrat accounts floating around waiting to be comprimised. I think that demoting seems like a reasonable think to do in this case. Only Stewards like you can do this though. Thank.</p>

<dd>I would prefer if inactive bureaucrats (and admins) had their access removed, but that isn't my decision to make. There'd have to be community consensus before you could ask a steward to change this (and you should ask one not involved with the English Wikipedia since they're not meant to deadmin people on their own wiki except at the request of that user). There isn't any process for de-bureaucratship on this wiki, so it might not be easy to get this to happen.

<dd>Currently I am opposing the new BCrat nominee due to this issue. I want to see something done about all of these inactive BCrats before just making new ones. We have have enough active Bcrats to get by and with Francs2000 promoted, there is little need for more BCrats. I would not mind replacing the inactive 1/2 though.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_da05.html" title="User talk:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All%28MTG%29_2563.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All(MTG)">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 16:05, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, too, am of the opinion that we have enough Bureaucrats, and recently tweaked the list at <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats_5503.html" title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">Wikipedia:Bureaucrats</a> to reflect the actual bureaucratic activity of those with The Power, such as it is (moving a couple to "inactive"). As Bureaucrats have a very limited area of responsibilty, it seems only logical that we should take a "You don't use it, you loose it" attitude similar to the standards set up for Stewards. Bureaucratship has become, IMO, more of a status symbol than an actual tool, which is borne out by the fact that ten of our twenty-two Bureaucrats are inactive (with at least an additional two [Secretlondon and Ilyanep, specifically; see <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EBureaucrats_b008.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bureaucrats">Wikipedia_talk:Bureaucrats</a>] that should be considered inactive, as well). --Jeffrey O.

<dd>Lunixbreak, Nichalps, Cecropia, Francs2000 are the main Bcrats now. 1/2 where listed as inactive, but really only 1/5 to 1/4, or 20 to 25% are trurely (at least somewhat regularly) active. Around 80% are just people with a "high title". How could we <i>not</i> already have a policy for this?

<p>Hi Angela, how's things?</p>
<p>I've been approached by an administrator who is leaving the project, asking how he can get de-sysoped. What is the process of getting oneself de-sysoped? I shan't give his details here in case others don't know of his intention to leave.

<p>I seem to recall you once told me you didn't like to use interlanguage links on your user pages (some of them, anyway). You should know, therefore, that there's a bot (on a few different wikis) that's adding interlanguage links to user pages. For example, <a href="http://ro.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Utilizator:Angela&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=175515" class="external text" title="http://ro.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Utilizator:Angela&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=175515" rel="nofollow">here's its edit of your Romanian user page</a>. I've <a href="../../../q/u/i/User_talk%7EQuistnix_99b3.html#RobotQuistnix" title="User talk:Quistnix">asked the owner of this bot</a> to stop changing user pages. - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/c/l/User_talk%7EDcljr_034e.html" title="User talk:Dcljr">talk</a>)</small> 01:18, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for telling me. I tend to use interlanguage links on my user pages a lot more now than I did when I said that, since it's useful for navigation around related languages, which outweighs the risk of more cross-wiki vandalism of my user page. So, if someone thinks it useful to link my Romanian page, I won't revert it. It might be more of a problem on en, though I upset a lot fewer vandals than I used to, so it's not much of an issue. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:58, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself. I am Manjithkaini a bureaucrat with Malayalam Wikipedia and a well-wisher of Wikimedia Foundation. My message comes here with a request.</p>
<p>Though the Malayalam edition of Wikipedia runs behind other wikis in number of articles, the participation and user creation is in its boom. The main reason for the lack of articles is the Malayalam language didn’t have much Unicode Fonts. We, a group of Malayalis residing in various countries like USA, Japan etc have made this possible. Now we have fonts and Unicode supported transliteration softwares - important tools for wiki editing in Malayalam.</p>
<p>With these tools we are planning a competition in Kerala, the homeland of Malayalam language, to promote Wikipedia participation. We would like to represent ourselves as Malayalam Wikimedia Community and conduct the competition to popularize Wikis among school, college students and among elders in our homeland.</p>
<p>As you know we will need a number of posters and other publicity materials for this. Hence the need of a Banner and Emblem to get identified. We will be grateful if the Wikimedia Foundation grant us permission to use the banner Malayalam Wikimedia Community and also to use the Wikipedia emblem through out our campaigns.</p>

<p>Angela - it was hearing you on Radio 4 months ago that first got me involved in Wikipedia and since then I have encouraged many others to become contributors, my grown up children included. I work as <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelela_9e42.html" title="User:Velela">User:Velela</a> but several of us , using our own user names, use the same PC for editing and sometimes jointly edit or contribute. We hope that this helps to bring some knowledge and experience from some older minds into Wikipedia - certainly we can remeber facts long forgotten by some. This approach has come up against an admin view that because several of us use the same IP address that we are <i>de facto</i> sock puppets and , over the last couple of days my access has been blocked. I guess I can live with that although the reasoning is flawed and seems to be a degree of angst in one admin <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">User:Snottygobble</a> because I dared to improve one of his articles (<a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Bolton_672a.html" title="Geoffrey Bolton">Geoffrey Bolton</a>). The use of blocking against vandalism seems an exemplary policy but to use it to suppress change and improvement is more reminsicent of more totalitarian regimes. I would welcome your views.</p>

<p>I recently read a mailing list post by ~notafish and learned that there is a backlog in the OTRS system. I would be happy to help categorize and respond to the incoming mail. Among those contacts listed on the meta for OTRS, you're the one I know best, so I thought I'd ask here whether you'd like to have my help.</p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>An abusive admin has blocked my pal on IP address 24.147.103.146. The admin is named Gamaliel. This admin has been reported in the past by 24.147.103.146 for copyright violation and made to revert. He must be holding a grudge. It may also be due to his POV on the Kennedys and his past invlovement in edit wars. The reason given for the block was an old RFC on Ted Kennedy. My pal added appropiate links to other Kennedy pages not mentioned in the RFC. The admin is pro Kennnedy so he blocked my pal. In any case, this is an abuse of his priv and I ask your help in bringing this to light. Thank you193.120.103.205 06:08, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia's "credibility crisis" is not being helped by failing to recognize when articles are blatantly slanted by politics. This entry on the Swift Boat Vets is egregiously bad. That will not be noticed by anyone of the Democratic persuasion, but the article fairly screams "a Democratic partisan wrote this" to anyone who is not.</p>
<p>I do not wish to debate this, I seek only to warn you that half of the people coming to Wikipedia will begin to dismiss the site as having been ruined by politics (as so many other 'reference' sites have) if this sort of thing continues.</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I don't believe accounts should be taken over in this way. Many users may have made an account here because they edit under that name in another language and want to make sure they maintain the same name on all wikis so they can keep that name when we get <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/single_login" class="extiw" title="m:single_login">single login</a>. No edits do not necessary mean the account is not in use. For example, readers may have accounts so they can use their <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">Preferences</a> to set a different skin. Also, the user might have only deleted edits, which won't show up in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_de0d.html" title="Special:Contributions">Contributions</a> but will do elsewhere, and taking their account would mean you would be blamed for those past edits and activity in the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELogs_32c8.html" title="Special:Logs">Logs</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 01:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The way robchurch told me it works is, the account I want gets renamed, then my account gets renamed to I want. So all logs are left inatact. <a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms2_e271.html" title="User:Ems2">Ems2</a> 05:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, renaming a user does not correctly fix the logs. If User:Ems had been blocked, and it was renamed User:Whatever so that you could move to User:Ems, the block log would still show that User:Ems, not User:Whatever, had been blocked. But that's not my main objection. My objection is that someone made that account for a reason, and it wouldn't be right to steal it from them just because they have no undeleted edits on this language version of Wikipedia, especially not so soon before plans to implement single login. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 07:47, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The single login proposal must provide a solution if the same nick is used in differernt languages, and all do. It is clear this use isn't using it on en.wikipedia. The user would of only registered it to hold it because there was no single login, but once one of the proposals have been accepted this will be obsolute. <a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms2_e271.html" title="User:Ems2">Ems2</a> 16:54, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am seeking your guidance and advice on a particular issue. <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahuri.html" title="Mahuri">Mahuri</a> page on wikipedia was initiated by me, and I have contributed to the page from time to time. As per policy of the wikipedia anyone can use the contents of wikipedia, but I understand that use of such contents should indicate the source, that is, the wikipedia. The contents of the page Mahuri have been used in the site <a href="http://www.mahurivaisya.com/#" class="external text" title="http://www.mahurivaisya.com/#" rel="nofollow">mahurivaisya</a> without giving any reference to wikipedia - though I am glad that they have used our contents. In this case, a problem may arise at a future date if that website takes a stand that the contents of page <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahuri.html" title="Mahuri">Mahuri</a> on wikipedia have been copied from that site and thus violates copyrights. In an alternative scenario, a user here may tag our Mahuri page with copyright violation under the impression that our contents have been copied from that site, reference to which was given by me long back as an external link when that site was not active and having only a welcome page. Although I am not aware of any such issue, which wikipedians may have encountered in the past, I believe that such a situation may have arisen earlier too. I seek your advice and guidance to deal with this issue, which you are requested to kindly post on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bhadani" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bhadani" rel="nofollow">my talk page please</a>.

<p>Aloha!! <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesotho.html" title="Sesotho">Remember me</a>...? I stumbled upon the remarkably bad Sesotho Wikipedia - you unlearn something new everyday!! Are you the Angela involved in "editing" some of the pages? How many Angela's are there?! Oh, I just realised it's the Sesotho version of your page! 8-D. I honestly wish I could do something about it, but it's <b>absolutely braindead</b>. Are the other African Language Wikiped's this bad? Am I honestly the only person to have previously contributed to Wikipedia who's competent in Sesotho? A pessimist like me feels that this "Wikipedia in every language" experiment is bound for failiure...</p>
<p>Sorry for "vandalising" one of the pages (Mmino), but I won't remove the comment. It pretty much sums up what I feel about the grossly malinformed articles about Africans on Wikiped'. -ZyXoas/Tebello Thejane (sorry, I've been away for so long that I forgot my password...) 198.54.202.234 13:13, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is me that has edited there. Most of the African Language Wikipedias are not yet active, so there will be problems on them. If you can write in Sesotho, perhaps you could help to clear up the problems you see there. Rather than making comments on the articles, is there something you could do to fix them? It's easy to be pessimistic at this early stage, but there's no reason to think a real community could not form there at some stage and create a useful resource. It will simply take longer than one in a language used by more people who are online. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:33, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If there is still no answer from him after asking again, how about revoking his bureaucrat's and administrator's privileges?

<dd>Angela, could you pull Optim's admin/bureaucrat status and I'll move him to "former bureaucrats"? I don't think we need process--he's been gone two years. If he resurfaces we can deal with that then. Thanks.&#160;:) BTW, you are not listed as an "inactive bureaucrat," I redid the Bcrat page and you are listed as active on rename, just as I'm listed as active on RfA.

<p>Hi. I wonder if you could give some advice - there is a pretty deep-seated disagreement over whether the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names.html" title="List of interesting or unusual place names">List of interesting or unusual place names</a> should sit in the article namespace or the Wikipedia namespace. The article has been up for deletion from the article namespace once, and no consensus was reached (in my opinion), but it was moved to the Wikipedia namespace anyway. The article was then listed for Deletion Review, again, the result of the discussion was inconclusive. It was then listed at AfD a second time, but the AfD entry has been closed, even though nothing has changed in terms of the balance of opinion. Basically the current situation is one of instability &amp; confusion, with the article potentially flip-flopping between namespaces. I'm lookng for guidance on what options there are to bring a more harmonious conclusion to the issue.

<p>Hi again Esperanzians!
