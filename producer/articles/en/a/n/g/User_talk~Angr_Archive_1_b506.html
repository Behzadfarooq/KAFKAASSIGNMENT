<p>Hi there. I just spotted your article on Irish dialects, and I was wondering if you wrote this article here: <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~green/gaeilge/canuinti.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~green/gaeilge/canuinti.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The pair appear very similar, and I'm hoping that you wrote both, so that there isn't any legal question. Anyway, have a good one. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 10:16, Dec 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>

Must say I've only ever heard the former from Americans; the latter sounds distinctly British to me. Does the fact that you're in a position to take photos of Ithaca mean you're at Cornell? If so, maybe you could ask Abby and Amanda what they say. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 07:05, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I made that change actually based on consulting Merriam-Webster which lists the /ɑ/ pronunciation as an <i>also</i>, meaning significantly less common. I've just now checked the American Heritage Dictionary, which only gives the /oʊ/ pronunciation. Also, my Jones 15th ed. <i>English Pronouncing Dictionary</i> gives only /oʊ/ for American pronunciation, but it gives /ɒ/ as a second British one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm no longer in Ithaca, but Abby was my adviser and I took phonetics from Amanda. I was in her first phonetics class at Cornell. To be honest, I don't remember with any clarity how they pronounced <i>phonetician</i>, but I spent 3 years in the linguistics department at Cornell and the /ɑ/ pronunciation strikes me as one I don't believe I've ever heard. I will consult with my co-workers tomorrow who are formerly of the UCSC linguistics department tomorrow, but I'm fairly certain they'll agree. Do you have any written authority for the /ɑ/ being more prevalent in American English? If so, perhaps we can select a word with a less disputed pronunciation situation...

<p>Hi Angr, just noticed that you changed the SAMPA pronunciations on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_names_in_English_with_non-intuitive_pronunciations_13ec.html" title="List of names in English with non-intuitive pronunciations">List of names in English with non-intuitive pronunciations</a> to IPA, citing Wikipedia preferences as your rationale. Could you point me in the direction of the page where this policy is outlined? I'm personally very much against this change (largely because it's a total pain to edit) and would like to argue against it -- only problem is, I can't find where the policy is defined! Thanks, <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELancevortex_a6a9.html" title="User:Lancevortex">Lancevortex</a> 10:11, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi Lancevortex, the policy is stated at <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_phonetic_alphabet.html#Wikipedia_usage" title="International phonetic alphabet">International_phonetic_alphabet#Wikipedia_usage</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/SAMPA_53ec.html#Wikipedia_usage" title="SAMPA">SAMPA#Wikipedia_usage</a>. Personally I like the policy because SAMPA is a total pain to read. Editing with the IPA is a lot easier if you do the editing in Microsoft Word <i>vel sim.</i> and then paste into Wikipedia. There's also <a href="http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex#Tipa" class="external text" title="http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex#Tipa" rel="nofollow">WikiTeX</a> if you know how to use it (I don't). --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 10:50, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Readability is a matter of opinion, I guess. That said, I must confess I didn't realise that SAMPA was merely a hack; I suppose that's why I've never seen it anywhere but Wikipedia. Thanks for piquing my interest and making me actually find out about what I was arguing for. I'm converted -- just wish I had an IPA keyboard. --<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELancevortex_a6a9.html" title="User:Lancevortex">Lancevortex</a> 01:28, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wymondham - the "windham"/"windum" pronunciation is the only one used for Wymondham (the place in Norfolk) which is how it is referenced in the listing, which is why i made the mod. On a separate note how about adding a non IPA guide to the pronunciation of each word for those who can't read the IPA characters. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeLeggett_5a1f.html" title="User:GraemeLeggett">GraemeLeggett</a> 08:40, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosemite_National_Park_c394.html" title="Yosemite National Park">Yosemite National Park</a>, you also changed the SAMPA to IPA. Problem is, now I can't find anywhere that tells me how to read it! I looked at the article <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> which is clearly for linguists with a specialized terminology and not for people who just want to know h ow to pronounce things, and I looked at <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_English_4b7c.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet for English">International Phonetic Alphabet for English</a> but after scrolling up and down dozens of times I had still found only a couple of the characters. Can you point me to a table that shows the characters on the left and sample words on the right showing the pronunciation? (And add a link to such to each occurrence of this notation, as was originally there for the SAMPA notation)? Otherwise this is pretty much useless.

<p>Hello, I'm not sure that some of the recent changes you've made to several Native American tribes are appropriate. You've categorized among others the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasttine.html" title="Tasttine">Tasttine</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/o/Onondaga_%28tribe%29.html" title="Onondaga (tribe)">Onondaga</a>, and <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsuu_T%27ina_3d8c.html" title="Tsuu T'ina">Tsuu T'ina</a> articles to be included in several language-based categories. I feel this is incorrect as those articles are not for the languages of these aboriginals. I think that stubs for the Tasttine language, <a href="../../../o/n/o/Onondaga_language.html" title="Onondaga language">Onondaga language</a>, and <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsuu_T%27ina_language_d10c.html" title="Tsuu T'ina language">Tsuu T'ina language</a> should be created, and only those should be in the language categories.

<p>It's not that they're annoying me--in fact I already have them turned off--it's just that IPA is impossible to read if there are underlines, and with underlines is the default for users and the only option for anonymous readers. In general, IPA should not appear in links. It's kind of a pain, I know, but I think it's the best solution unless links containing IPA can be forced to not have underlines for everyone, and that's not just a technical question, but one of policy. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:52, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand the general concept of not doubling up on categories, but in this special case (Popes in general and then subcategorized by name) I feel it is necessary, because Category:Popes also serves as a list of popes. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 23:43, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason I started making those pages was that right now there's no way to jump from, say, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_VIII_f0c8.html" title="Pope Benedict VIII">Pope Benedict VIII</a> to a list of the other Popes Benedict. Putting all of the like-named popes in a category enables that. The reasoning behind it is simple... let's say I know I need a "Pope Benedict" but I don't know which one... so I just go from one to the next til I find the right one.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 23:58, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I did add it, and it wasn't vandalism. I got it from a German tabloid newspaper. But I should have known better than to trust a tabloid newspaper to get its facts straight. April 16, 1927, was in fact Holy Saturday, not Easter Sunday. And since it's the same newspaper that claims he was baptized only four hours after being born, I no longer know whether that's true either. They have a photograph of an entry in a baptismal register for April 16 (no year) at 8:30 AM showing that *someone* named Ratzinger was baptized, but I can't make out the first name. It doesn't look like Joseph (or even Alois), though. Anyway, thanks for letting me know. --Angr/comhrá 05:58, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>I add a music section section there just wish some hymnal experts can add some more hymns like that title there so that people can enjoy and think about the meaning of the Lord's Prayer. I think we may discuss about the two MIDIs, but I totally can not agree that you delete that section!! Music is an important "something" in liturgy, right? By killing that section, do you mean that none of the music about the Lord's prayer is good?</p>
<p>The 2nd MID is collected in 2nd ed. of Hymnal book of Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and I heard that song in many other denominations in Taiwan. I am now in USA (and that's the reason why I can not find who is the composer and left 'unknown' there). The conductor and the two church organists of the church I attend in USA tell me that the song is famous. A serious handicap christian musician from north Europe sang this song in an important meeting held by China Christian union Association. Thousands of people attended that meeting. I don't know why you say that it is not famous.</p>
<p>The 1st MID is composed by a good Christian Ph.D whose major is composing music. He is also a Professor in the best music department of university in Taiwan. He won many championship about composing music throughout USA, Taiwan, Europe, and south of America. Although you are a Ph.D in theoretical linguistics, that does not mean that you have good musical background nor even have better musical background than a Ph.D of music. What are your argumentations that the tune is not good? Just like what you say, "whether or not they're good is POV," can you delete such a "good" music just by your POV without any argumentation?</p>

<dd>Sorry, English is not my mother language and I am not good in my mother language, neither, (what a bad linguistic persion am I!) so I think and type in English very slow. Before I modify some sentences in previous parapraghs, I checked my <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacob_grace_a761.html" title="User talk:Jacob grace">my talk</a>, you did not reply at that time. Just after I fix some errors, add 1 or 2 sentences and click on "Save page," it shows something like "you have message."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The followings are messages I reply you about your answer in my <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacob_grace_a761.html" title="User talk:Jacob grace">my talk</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>About the copyright issue:</b> I am not very sure about that. (Therefore, I am not arguing with you about this.) As I know:
<dl>
<dd>1. The 2nd hymn is more than 40, even 50 years. It seems that past the ordinary copyright period. (I should make sure about that.)</dd>
<dd>2. In Taiwan, regilious broadcast is outside the copyright law. Maybe it is not the case in international copyright law, I should try to know it.</dd>
<dd>3. MIDI is a form different from printing. Though someone can print a music sheet from a MIDI file, the quality is really bad and a little bit far from use. As a MIDI lover, especially who is much more older than 20, I think I should know that issue. I will consult a lawyer recently. Thank you.</dd>
<dd>Thank you for remind me about that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About the signature:</b> Thank you for telling me that. And sorry for I forget to add link from my signature to my <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacob_grace_2649.html" title="User:Jacob grace">user page</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacob_grace_a761.html" title="User talk:Jacob grace">my talk</a>. I am new to Wikipedia, therefore, a lot of things need to learn. I just learn ~~~~ about 1 hour before I post the 1st message to you. The reason why I still left my name by typing instead of ~~~~ is to show my title. Discussing to a Ph.D. without evdience and/or title seems funny.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About the music background:</b> It's happy to hear that you have music background. I played a musical instrument from the age of 7 up till the age of about 37, and I attended an orchestra (which has about 100 members) about 2.5 years, 3 chambers upto about 4 years, conducting church choir about 4 years and attending church choir about 20 years. The two reasons that I show you this are why I am happy to talk to one who has music background and why I make a lot of MIDIs (more than 600).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About the POV / NPOV:</b> I admit that famous / good are POV. Thank you to let me know the NPOV policy of Wikipedia. (I did not know it before.) But about this issue, I think the appropriate action is to change the title, not to delete the section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About your dictions on the Edit summary, you write 'their inclusion smacks of vanity':</b> Is it POV or NPOV?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About the message you leave in edit summary:</b> They are nothing about copyright. But what you answer me is almost about the copyright issue. Why?</dd>
<dd>By the way, you leave 2 messages whick look like almost the same in my <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacob_grace_a761.html" title="User talk:Jacob grace">my talk</a>. May I or you delete the older one?</dd>

<dd>^^ &amp;&#160;:). The reason I wrote 'MIDIs which are done by me' is just for copyright problem: I do not copy MIDIs done by some others without permission! I don't think about whether it violates the copyright law to public the MIDIs without the composer's permission. So ridiculous am I!!</dd>
<dd>I'll check the copyright problem up. If it is ok, I will restore it/them with suitable title. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacob_grace_2649.html" title="User:Jacob grace">Jacob grace</a> 23:07, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hi Angr — since Z's only reaction to his rfc so far is an invitation to "suck dick, you bum", while he happily keeps reverting IE languages, I do think you could take the case to the arbcom now.

<p>Hello. I am sorry I did not get back to you earlier, but I am answering your question, the official laws printed by Belarus are printed in Russian.

<p>At <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_English_4b7c.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet for English">International Phonetic Alphabet for English</a> (and pretty much everywhere else) it describes the <i>-er</i> in "runner" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɚ]</span> and the <i>-ir-</i> in "bird" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɝ]</span>. Is this a convention so that each reader will read it according to the way they understand the word to be pronounced? And if so, of what use is it? I have always thought of "runner" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'rʌn r̩/</span> and "bird" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/br̩:d/</span>. Have I missed something somewhere?</p>
<p>On another tissue, are you familiar with phonemic differentiation between the diphthongs <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ai/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌi/</span>? I'm assuming that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ai/</span> before voiced consonants and in syllable-final position and that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌi/</span> before unvoiced consonants is common, but how widespread is the differentiation between the noun "hide" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">(/haid/)</span> and the verb "hide" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">(/hʌid/)</span>, and between "wider" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">(/'wai ɾr̩/)</span> and "whiter" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">(/'wʌi ɾr̩/)</span>? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:49, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I do. And I've conducted minisurveys on the subject (about 20 individuals, all men 18-25, all from the Twin Cities area or northwestern Wisconsin, all Comp. Sci. majors) and found that, at least in northwestern Wisconsin, this differentiation is almost universal. The one person I spoke with who didn't differentiate between them (a 20-year-old guy from Sparta, Wisconsin, who as it happens is somewhat asocial) pronounces "whiter" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'ʍʌi tr̩/</span> and "wider" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'wai dr̩/</span> (the vast majority of the others did not differentiate between /w/ and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʍ/</span>). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 18:23, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
