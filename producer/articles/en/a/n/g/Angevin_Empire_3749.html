	    <p>The term <b>Angevin Empire</b> describes a collection of states ruled by the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angevin.html" title="Angevin">Angevin</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenet.html" title="Plantagenet">Plantagenet</a> dynasty. The Plantagenets ruled over an area stretching from the <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrenees.html" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> during the 12th and early 13th centuries. Their 'empire' was roughly half of medieval <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> as well as all of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. The term 'Angevin Empire' is a modern construction as the empire had no such collective term at the time. However, despite the extent of the Plantagenets rule, they were defeated by the King of France, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_France_c1b4.html" title="Philip II of France">Philip II Augustus</a>, of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Capet_10d6.html" title="House of Capet">House of Capet</a> which left their empire split in two, losing the provinces <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/j/Anjou.html" title="Anjou">Anjou</a>. This defeat which left the ruling Plantagenets with their English territories and Gascon in France set the scene for the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saintonge_War_f079.html" title="Saintonge War">Saintonge</a> and the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years%27_War_fd8c.html" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Angevin Empire</b> is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> defining the lands of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenets.html" title="Plantagenets">Plantagenets</a>: <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_I_of_England_89e8.html" title="Richard I of England">Richard I</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_England_14d6.html" title="John of England">John Lackland</a>. As far as historians know, there was no contemporary term for the region under Angevin control, however descriptions such as 'our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be' were used.<sup id="_ref-AngevinEmpire_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AngevinEmpire" title="">[1]</a></sup> The term 'Angevin Empire' was coined by Kate Norgate in her 1887 publication, "England under the Angevin Kings".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> In France, the term "Espace Plantagenêt" is sometimes used to describe the fiefdoms the Plantagenêts had acquired.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the adoption of the Angevin label this term marked a re-evaluation of times, considering that both English and French influences were spread throughout the dominion in the half century the union lasted. The term <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angevin.html" title="Angevin">Angevin</a> itself is the adjective applied to the residents of Anjou and its historic capital, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angers.html" title="Angers">Angers</a>, the Plantagenets were from Anjou hence the term.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The use of the term Empire has arisen controversy amongst some historians. As it is an assemblage of the inherited and acquired lands of Henry there is some question as to whether or not a common identity existed within the dominions.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup> Some historians argue that the term Empire should be strictly referring to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, the only Western European political structure actually named "Empire".<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> Other historians argue that Henry II's empire was not powerful, nor centralised, nor large enough to be seriously called an Empire.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> There was no such thing as an <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Emperor_ec75.html" title="Western Emperor">imperial</a> title unlike the name "Angevin Empire" may imply.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> Although, if the Plantagenets themselves did not claim any imperial title some chroniclers, often working for Henry II himself, used the term "empire" to describe this assemblage of lands.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup> In essence the highest title was "king of England" to which the crown went with yet the titles of dukes and counts held in France were completely and totally independent from the royal title and not subjected to any English royal law.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup> Because of this a few historians prefer the term <i>commonwealth</i> to Empire, to emphasis on the fact the Angevin Empire was more an assemblage of seven fully independent sovereigns loosely bound to each others.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>At its largest extent, that "so called empire" consisted of the Kingdom of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, the principality of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the duchies of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gascony.html" title="Gascony">Gascony</a> and <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquitaine.html" title="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> (also called Guyenne)<sup id="_ref-hiatus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hiatus" title="">[14]</a></sup> as well as of <a href="../../../a/n/j/Anjou.html" title="Anjou">Anjou</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitou.html" title="Poitou">Poitou</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine_%28province_of_France%29_05b0.html" title="Maine (province of France)">Maine</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touraine.html" title="Touraine">Touraine</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saintonge.html" title="Saintonge">Saintonge</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Marche_64d5.html" title="County of Marche">Marche</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perigord.html" title="Perigord">Perigord</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limousin_%28province%29.html" title="Limousin (province)">Limousin</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quercy.html" title="Quercy">Quercy</a>. While the duchies and counties were held with various levels of <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassalage.html" title="Vassalage">vassalage</a> to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_monarchs_03f6.html" title="List of French monarchs">King of France</a>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup> the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenets.html" title="Plantagenets">Plantagenets</a> held control over <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulouse.html" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> to varying levels of power although they were not formal parts of the "Empire". Further claims had been laid over <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berry_%28province%29.html" title="Berry (province)">Berry</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/v/Auvergne_%28province%29.html" title="Auvergne (province)">Auvergne</a> yet these were not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Sometimes the frontiers were well known and easy to draw like the one between the royal <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demesne.html" title="Demesne">Demesne</a> of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_monarchs_03f6.html" title="List of French monarchs">King of France</a> and the <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Normandy_e95c.html" title="Duchy of Normandy">Duchy of Normandy</a> while in other places they were not so clear, especially as regards the eastern frontier of Aquitaine where there often was a difference between the frontiers <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a> and, later, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_I_of_England_89e8.html" title="Richard I of England">Richard I</a> claimed and the ones where their real power ended.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[16]</a></sup> One of the most important characteristic of the Angevin Empire being it was "polycratic", term taken from one of the most important political pamphlet written by a subject of the Angevin Empire: the <i>Policraticus</i> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Salisbury_9b08.html" title="John of Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>England was under a rather firm control and was probably one of the most controlled areas. The Kingdom was divided in <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shires.html" title="Shires">shires</a> with <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff.html" title="Sheriff">sheriffes</a> enforcing the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a>. A <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justiciar.html" title="Justiciar">Justiciar</a> was appointed by the King to make his voice respected while he was away. As the kings of England were more often in France than England they used a larger amount of writs than the Anglo-Saxon kings did, curiously this rather helped England than anything else.<sup id="_ref-absenteeism_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absenteeism" title="">[17]</a></sup> Under <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William</a>'s rule, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> nobles were often replaced by <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Normans_5701.html" title="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> ones who could not own large expanses of contiguous lands, which made it much harder for them to rise against the King and defend all of their lands in the same time. <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl.html" title="Earl">Earls</a> held a status similar to that of the continental <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">counts</a>.

<ul>
<li>In Greater Anjou,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[18]</a></sup> for instance, two kinds of officials enforced the rule: prévots or <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneschals.html" title="Seneschals">seneschals</a>. These were based at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tours.html" title="Tours">Tours</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinon.html" title="Chinon">Chinon</a>, Baugé, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaufort.html" title="Beaufort">Beaufort</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brissac.html" title="Brissac">Brissac</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angers.html" title="Angers">Angers</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saumur.html" title="Saumur">Saumur</a>, Laudun, Lauch, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langeais.html" title="Langeais">Langeais</a> and Montbazon. However the other places were not administrated by the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenets.html" title="Plantagenets">Plantagenets</a> but by other families. For instance Maine was, at first, largely self-ruling and lacked of administration. The Plantagenets did a lot of efforts to improve the administration of this land by installing new administrators such as the seneschal of Le Mans. These reforms came too late though and the Capetians were the ones that really took benefits from these reforms after annexing Greater Anjou.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[19]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gascony was certainly a very loosely administrated region, with officials only stationed in <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entre-deux-mers.html" title="Entre-deux-mers">Entre-deux-mers</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonne.html" title="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/x/Dax%2C_Landes_6141.html" title="Dax, Landes">Dax</a>, as well as on the pilgrimage route to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_de_Compostela_2d3c.html" title="Santiago de Compostela">Santiago de Compostela</a> and on river <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garonne.html" title="Garonne">Garonne</a> up to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agen.html" title="Agen">Agen</a>. The rest of Gascony was left without an administrator, and was a large area compared to several other provinces. It was very difficult for the Angevin, just like it was for the previous Poitevin dukes, to install their authority over the duchy.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[20]</a></sup> This part of Gascony was unattractive to rule because of the landscape and it was difficult to install a firm rule on it.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[21]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As for Poitou and Guyenne, the castles were concentrated in Poitou where there were official representatives while in the eastern provinces of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perigord.html" title="Perigord">Perigord</a> and Limousin there simply were none. Indeed there were lords that ruled these regions as if they were "sovereign <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince.html" title="Prince">princes</a>" and they had powers in fields such as minting coins. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_I_of_England_89e8.html" title="Richard I of England">Richard the Lionheart</a> himself met his demise in Limousin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Normandy was probably one of the most administrated state of the Angevin Empire. prévots and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount.html" title="Viscount">vicomtes</a> lost of their importance to the advantage of <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailie.html" title="Bailie">baillis</a> who held both judicial and executive powers. They were introduced in the 12th century in Normandy and organised the country more like the sheriffs did in England. The Ducal authority was strong on the frontier between the Royal Demesne and the Duchy but was more loose elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ireland was ruled by the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_Ireland_41a3.html" title="Lord of Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a> who had a hard time imposing his rule at first. <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> were Angevin stronghold while <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">Cork</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a> were taken by <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambro-Norman_657d.html" title="Cambro-Norman">Cambro-Norman</a> nobles.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[22]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The economics of the Angevin Empire was quite complicated due to the varying political structure of the fiefdoms. Areas like England which had a centralized power structure generated larger revenues than the more loosely administrated regions such as Limousin; where local princes could mint their own coins.</p>
<p>It is commonly believe that money raised in England was used for continental issues.<sup id="_ref-absenteeism_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-absenteeism" title="">[17]</a></sup> Also, due to the high level of administration of England and, to a lesser extent, Normandy, it was only area where revenue was the fairly consistent.</p>
<p>The English revenues themselves varied from a year to year:</p>
<ul>
<li>When Henry II Plantagenet became king, his income for England were a mere £10,500 a year or half of what the English revenue were under Henry I Beauclerc.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-HenryIIearlycontext_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HenryIIearlycontext" title="">[27]</a></sup> This was due in part to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Anarchy_89c8.html" title="The Anarchy">The Anarchy</a> and as well as Stephen of Blois' loose rule. As time went on Henry II installed his authority and incomes went up consequently to £22,000 a year.</li>
<li>When it was time to prepare for the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_crusade.html" title="Third crusade">crusade</a>, revenues increased to £31,050 per year but they dropped down to £11,000 a year when Richard I the Lionheart was away.</li>
<li>Under John Lackland incomes had remained stable for a time at £22,000 a year. In order to pay for the reconquest of France, he registered an income of £83,291 and yet that didn't include all sources like the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> which could have increased it to £145,000 that year of 1211.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ireland, the revenue was fairly low, a mere £2,000 for 1212 however, records are missing for the most part. For Normandy, there were a lot of fluctuations relative to the politics of the Duchy. In 1180, the Norman revenues were only £6,750 while they reached £25,000 a year in 1198, higher than in England.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[28]</a></sup> What was more impressive was the fact the Norman population was considerably smaller than England's which was estimated at 3.5 million as opposed to 1.5 million in Normandy.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>For Aquitaine, Anjou and Gascony there was no record at all about revenues. It was not that these regions were poor; there were large vineyards, important cities and iron mines. This is what <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_of_Diceto_61e1.html" title="Ralph of Diceto">Ralph of Diceto</a>, an English chronicler, wrote about Aquitaine:</p>

<p>In order to secure the succession, castles and supporters were need in both England and Normandy. Had Matilda and Geoffrey succeeded, there would've been two authorities in England; King Henry I and his daughter, Matilda. Henry I didn't allow this happen by refusing to hand over any castle to Matilda as well as confiscated the lands of nobles he suspected of supporting her. By 1135, there were major disputes between Henry I and Matilda which drove the barons that were loyal to Henry I against Matilda. In November 1135, when Henry "Beauclerc" was dying, Matilda was with her husband in Maine and Anjou while <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_of_England_b476.html" title="Stephen of England">Stephen of Blois</a> was in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a>.

<p>Geoffrey sent Matilda alone to Normandy, first ,in a diplomatic mission in order to get recognized Duchess of Normandy to replace Stephen. However, Geoffrey V wasn't far behind, at the head of his army, and quickly captured several fortresses in southern Normandy which he never lost again. It was then that an Angevin noble, Robert III of Sablé, rose up against Geoffrey V opening a front on his rear causing him to withdraw to Anjou and end the revolt. When Geoffrey V returned to Normandy in September 1136, the region was plagued with local struggles and infighting among the barons. Stephen was not able to travel to Normandy and as result, the situation remained chaotic. Geoffrey had found new allies with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counts_and_dukes_of_Vend%C3%B4me_b8b0.html" title="List of counts and dukes of Vendôme">Count of Vendôme</a> and most importantly, the Duke of Aquitaine. At the head of a new army and prepared to conquer Normandy, he was wounded and was forced to return to Anjou once more. Adding to that, an outbreak of diarrhea plagued his army. Orderic Vitalis stated <i>"the invaders had to run for home leaving a trail of filth behind them"</i>. Stephen finally arrived in Normandy in 1137 and restored order, but he had lost much of credibility to the eyes of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_of_Gloucester_c7d9.html" title="Robert of Gloucester">Robert of Gloucester</a> who supported Geoffrey. Geoffrey took control of the strongholds of <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caen.html" title="Caen">Caen</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentan.html" title="Argentan">Argentan</a> without resistance but he now had to defend Robert's possession in England against the anger of the King. In 1139, Robert and Matilda crossed the channel and arrived in England while Geoffrey kept the pressure on Normandy. Stephen was captured in February 1141 at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lincoln_%281141%29_a828.html" title="Battle of Lincoln (1141)">Battle of Lincoln</a> which prompted the collapse of Normandy. Geoffrey was now controlling almost all of Normandy. Previously King Louis VII of France had married <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine_9952.html" title="Eleanor of Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> becoming Duke of Aquitaine thus adding to his Royal Domain, the lands of Aquitaine in 1137 so he had no interest in the shift in Norman politics since he already ruled vast and powerful territories. Finally, while Geoffrey V asserted control of Normandy, Matilda was suffering defeats against Stephen's allies.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[35]</a></sup> At <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester.html" title="Winchester">Winchester</a>, Robert of Gloucester was captured while covering Matilda's retreat where she then would exchange Stephen for Robert.</p>
<p>In 1142, Geoffrey V was pleaded to cross the channel and assist Matilda but he refused. He became more interested in Normandy. Following the capture of <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avranches.html" title="Avranches">Avranches</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortain.html" title="Mortain">Mortain</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherbourg.html" title="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>, Geoffrey V launched a decisive attack on <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen.html" title="Rouen">Rouen</a> capturing it in 1144. He then anointed himself as Duke of Normandy and in exchange of the cession of <a href="../../../g/i/s/Gisors.html" title="Gisors">Gisors</a> to Louis VII was formally recognized by the King. Geoffrey V, satisfied with his new role in Normandy, made no effort to assist Matilda in England even as she was on the verge of defeat. Helie (Elias), Geoffrey's younger brother, felt that he deserved his fair share and asked for Maine. No sooner had that issue been settled, another Angevin noble rebelled: <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Berlay_b3a2.html" title="Gerald Berlay">Gerald Berlay</a>, newly appointed seneschal of Poitou by Louis VII, led a revolt in southern Anjou against Geoffrey V.</p>

<p>Stephen had by no means given up his claims on Normandy, even though Louis VII had clearly recognised Geoffrey Plantagenet as duke. An alliance between the two Kings was possible because of the issue over Gerald Berlay.

<p>In March 1152, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine divorced under the pretext of consanguinity at the council of Beaugency because the couple was not going on well at all.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[36]</a></sup> Eleanor was left Duchess of Aquitaine but under rule of the King in the terms of the divorce and eight weeks later she married Henry Plantagenet who was no less related to her than was Louis VII. With Henry becoming Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony it was obvious he would never give Anjou up to his brother, since it would mean splitting his land into two parts. A coalition of all of Henry's enemies was set up by Louis VII: King Stephen of England and his son <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustace_IV_of_Boulogne_dd22.html" title="Eustace IV of Boulogne">Eustace IV of Boulogne</a> (married to Louis' sister), <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_I_of_Champagne_414e.html" title="Henry I of Champagne">Henry the Liberal</a> (promised to Eleanor's daughter), <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_I_of_Dreux_40ef.html" title="Robert I of Dreux">Robert of Dreux</a> (Louis VII's brother) and finally Geoffrey who had no hope of acquiring Anjou any more.</p>
<p>In July 1152, Capetian troops attacked Aquitaine while Louis VII himself, along with Eustace IV, Henry of Champagne and Robert of Dreux attacked Normandy. Geoffrey raised a revolt in Anjou while Stephen attacked Angevin loyalists in England. Several Anglo-Norman nobles switched allegiance, feeling the forthcoming disaster. Henry Plantagenet was about to sail for England to pursue his claim when his lands were attacked. He first reached Anjou and compelled Geoffrey to surrender and then took the decision to sail for England in January 1153 in order to meet Stephen. Luckily enough Louis VII fell ill and had to retire from the conflict while Henry Plantagenet's defences held against his enemies. After seven months of both battles and political gambles he failed to get rid of King Stephen. Eustace IV died in dubious circumstances, "struck by the wrath of god", this was the last straw and King Stephen gave up the struggle by ratifying the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Wallingford_f3c5.html" title="Treaty of Wallingford">Treaty of Winchester</a>. He made Henry Plantagenet his heir on condition that the land possessions of his family were guaranteed in England and France, these were the terms Matilda had refused after her victory at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%2C_Lincolnshire_34d3.html" title="Lincoln, Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a>. Henry Plantagenet became Henry II of England in December 1154. Subsequently the question of his oath about Anjou and his brother Geoffrey was raised again. Henry II received a dispensation from <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Adrian_IV_1644.html" title="Pope Adrian IV">Pope Adrian IV</a> under the pretext the oath had been forced upon him, Henry II proposed compensations to Geoffrey at Rouen in 1156, but the latter refused and returned to Anjou to rise once again against Henry II. If Geoffrey had a solid moral claim, his position was nonetheless very weak. Louis VII wouldn't interfere since Henry II paid homage to the King of France for Normandy, Anjou and Aquitaine as vassal. Henry II crushed Geoffrey's revolt and he had to be satisfied with an annual pension.</p>

<p>Henry II clearly claimed further lands and worked on the creation of a ring of vassal states, especially around England and Normandy, as buffers. The most obvious ones were Scotland, Wales, Brittany and Flanders, which could be also used as starting points for further expansions.</p>

<p>Henry II bought <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon%2C_Eure_3f60.html" title="Vernon, Eure">Vernon</a> and Neufmarché back in 1154. From now on this new strategy regulated the Plantagenets-Capetians relationship. Louis VII couldn't deny his own unsuccessful attempt at breaking Henry II down. Because of the Angevin control of England in 1154 it was pointless to object to the superiority of cumulated Angevine forces over the Capetian ones. Yet, Henry II wouldn't stop claiming the land until the Norman Vexin was entirely recovered. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Beckett_6a4d.html" title="Thomas Beckett">Thomas Beckett</a> was sent as embassador to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1158 for leading negotiations and he displayed all the wealth the Angevins could boast of to the Capetians.

<p>Although Thierry of Alsace had taken part in the assaults against Henry II along with Louis VII the wool trade between England and Flanders favoured a cordial relationship between the two men up to the point that the Count appointed Henry II guardian of his lands so that he undertake on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem without concerns. In 1159, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Blois_48b0.html" title="William of Blois">William of Blois</a> died without an inheritance, he was Stephen's last son, leaving the titles of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_of_Boulogne_1321.html" title="Count of Boulogne">Count of Boulogne</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Counts_of_Mortain_a6b0.html" title="List of Counts of Mortain">Count of Mortain</a> vacant.

The title of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_of_Boulogne_1321.html" title="Count of Boulogne">Count of Boulogne</a> was accompanied with important manors in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a>.</p>
<p>England received much of its wool from Flanders via the port of Boulogne. An alliance with these two counties was then logically sealed by this wedding and the concessions of manors. Henry II had to get Marie out of her convent first, which had been a common practice in England since the Normans. In 1163, the few official remaining documents showed Henry II and Thierry renewed the treaty signed by William the Conqueror. Flanders would provide Henry II with knights in exchange of an annual tribute in money.</p>

<p>In Brittany, the duke <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_III%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_335d.html" title="Conan III, Duke of Brittany">Conan III</a> declared his son <a href="../../../h/o/e/Hoel_III%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_a834.html" title="Hoel III, Duke of Brittany">Hoël</a> a bastard and disinherited him. It was his sister Bertha who became Duchess of Brittany making her husband of the time, <a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudes%2C_Viscount_of_Porhoet_761f.html" title="Eudes, Viscount of Porhoet">Eudes</a>, nominally Duke. Hoël was co-ruler with his brother in law then, and had to be satisfied as Count of Nantes. Bertha was the widow of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_de_Bretagne%2C_1st_Earl_of_Richmond_3a5a.html" title="Alan de Bretagne, 1st Earl of Richmond">Alan de Bretagne</a> with whom she already had a son, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_IV%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_36e8.html" title="Conan IV, Duke of Brittany">Conan</a>. Conan who had become <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Richmond_4027.html" title="Earl of Richmond">Earl of Richmond</a> in 1148 was Henry II's perfect candidate to become the new Duke of Brittany as any Duke with possessions of importance in England could be easier to control.</p>
<p>In 1156, the Duchy of Brittany was hit by civil unrest which led to Conan IV's accession while in <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> the population called for Henry II's help against Hoël. Geoffrey (Henry II's brother again) was made new Count of Nantes by Henry II, but he did not hold the position for long, as he died in 1158 at only 24 years of age. In 1158, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_IV%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_36e8.html" title="Conan IV, Duke of Brittany">Conan IV</a> briefly ruled as Count of Nantes however, Henry II took the title that same year by mustering an army in <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avranches.html" title="Avranches">Avranches</a> to threaten Conan. In 1160 Henry II married his cousin <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_of_Scotland_47ab.html" title="Margaret of Scotland">Margaret of Scotland</a> to Conan in an arranged wedding. He then appointed the archbishop of <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dol-de-Bretagne_4dce.html" title="Dol-de-Bretagne">Dol</a>. Without a tradition of a strong rule in Brittany, nobles grew discontent. This led to a revolt that Henry II answered in 1166. He betrothed his own 7 year-old son -<a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_II%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_f1de.html" title="Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany">Geoffrey</a>- to Conan's daughter and later forced Conan to abdicate for his future son in law, making of Henry II the ruler of Brittany yet not the Duke. <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breton_people.html" title="Breton people">Breton</a> nobles strongly opposed that and more attacks on Brittany followed first in 1167 then in 1168 and finally in 1173. Each of these invasions were followed by confiscations and Henry II installed his men in the place, William Fitzhamo and Rolland of Dinan. Although it was not formally part of the Plantagenet fiefdom Brittany was under firm control.</p>

<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcassonne.html" title="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a> was one fortified city of the County of Toulouse</div>

<p>Much less morally dependable was the claim over <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulouse.html" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, Eleanor's ancestors claimed the huge <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Toulouse_cab9.html" title="County of Toulouse">County of Toulouse</a> as it used to be the central power of the ancient Duchy of Aquitaine back in the times of <a href="../../../o/d/o/Odo_of_Aquitaine_bfe8.html" title="Odo of Aquitaine">Eudes the Great</a>.<sup id="_ref-hiatus_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hiatus" title="">[14]</a></sup> Henry II and maybe even Eleanor were probably totally unrelated to this ancient line of Duke (Eleanor was a <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramnulfids.html" title="Ramnulfids">Ramnulfid</a> while Henry II was an Angevin). Toulouse was a very large city; it was heavily fortified and much richer than many cities of its time. It was of strategical importance as it is between the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. As if it wasn't enough the County of Toulouse was the largest state of the Kingdom of France with its large access to the Mediterranean Sea itself, and included significant cities like <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonne.html" title="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahors.html" title="Cahors">Cahors</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albi.html" title="Albi">Albi</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimes.html" title="Nimes">Nimes</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcassonne.html" title="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>.</p>
<p>Toulouse wasn't an easy prey though, the city was incredibly large and fortified for a medieval city.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[41]</a></sup> Not to mention the least, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_V_of_Toulouse_63f3.html" title="Raymond V of Toulouse">Raymond V</a> was married to Louis VII's sister therefore attacking Toulouse would have endangered the policy of peace with the King of France. The <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languedoc.html" title="Languedoc">County of Toulouse</a> had also many heavily fortified areas like Carcassonne and its five sons: <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queribus.html" title="Queribus">Queribus</a>, Aguila, Termes, <a href="../../../p/e/y/Peyrepertuse.html" title="Peyrepertuse">Peyrepertuse</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/y/Puylaurens.html" title="Puylaurens">Puylaurens</a> and many more castles and fortified cities.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1159 Henry II gathered in <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitiers.html" title="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> what probably was the biggest army he had ever set, formed by troops from all of his fiefdom (from Gascony to England), that army also included reinforcements sent by Thierry and Malcolm IV. Henry II attacked from the north while other of his allies, namely the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trencavel.html" title="Trencavel">Trencavels</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramon_Berenguer_IV%2C_Count_of_Barcelona_15e0.html" title="Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona">Ramon Berenguer</a> opened a different front. Henry II couldn't capture Toulouse proper and the recurrent conflicts with Toulouse would be called the Forty Years War with Toulouse by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Newburgh_a911.html" title="William of Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a>.

<p>Even <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Map_acf3.html" title="Walter Map">Walter Map</a>, a contemporary English satirical chronicler, had been kind toward Louis VII and praised him marking a contrast with the harsh critiques he did toward other kings.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[45]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>King Louis VII was a man of peace who hated violence and war<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[46]</a></sup> but the attacks on Toulouse made clear that peace with Henry II wasn't peace at all but just the opportunity to make war elsewhere. Louis VII himself was in an awkward position, his subject was more powerful than him and not just a little and worse of all he had no male heir. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constance_of_Castile%2C_Queen_of_France_4bd0.html" title="Constance of Castile, Queen of France">Constance</a>, his second wife, died in childbirth in 1160 and Louis VII announced he would remarry at once, in the urgent need of a male heir, with <a href="../../../a/d/%C3%A8/Ad%C3%A8le_of_Champagne_cca8.html" title="Adèle of Champagne">Adèle of Champagne</a>.

<p>In 1164 King Louis found a rather turbulent ally in Archbishop Thomas Beckett.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[47]</a></sup> King Louis and Thomas Beckett had met previously in 1158, but now the circumstances were very different.

<p>Thomas Beckett was murdered in 1170, and the Christian world blamed Henry for this. Louis, who had protected Thomas Beckett, gained general approval against Henry. Although his secular power was still much weaker than Henry's, Louis now had the moral advantage.</p>
<p>In 1165, the idea of a possible succession of Henry the Young to the throne of France was all gone away as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_France_c1b4.html" title="Philip II of France">Philip</a> was given birth by Adèle. With the birth of the next King of France it was clear peace was over, Henry II claimed <a href="../../../a/u/v/Auvergne_%28province%29.html" title="Auvergne (province)">Auvergne</a> in and marched on it in 1167 while he also claimed <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourges.html" title="Bourges">Bourges</a> and attacked it in 1170. Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin forcing Henry II to relocate his troops to the north and Louis VII then marched south and freed Bourges. At that point, not just Louis VII was wondering if Henry II's expansionism would ever end.</p>
<p>Henry II never treated his land as a coherent sovereign but much more as private possessions he planned to distribute his children. Henry the young was crowned King of England in 1170 but never actually ruled, in 1172 Richard the Lionheart became Duke of Aquitaine, in 1181 Geoffrey became Duke of Brittany, John became Lord of Ireland in 1185 while <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonora_of_England_5203.html" title="Leonora of England">Leonora</a> (born in 1161) was promised to Alfonso VII with Gascony as dowry during the campaign against Toulouse in 1170. This partition of the lands between his children made it much harder for him to control them, as several of them would then turn against him.</p>
<p>Following his coronation <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_the_Young_King_fe58.html" title="Henry the Young King">Henry the Young King</a> asked part of his inheritance, at least England or Normandy or Anjou and Henry II the Old King refused to hand down anything. Henry the Young then joined Louis VII at his court, Eleanor of Aquitaine herself joined the conflict and both Richard the Lionheart and Geoffrey of Brittany joined their brother at the court of the King. From then, states that Henry II had pressured joined the conflict against him. Another King to join Louis VII was William the Lion, King of Scotland. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip%2C_Count_of_Flanders_d026.html" title="Philip, Count of Flanders">Philip</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_of_Flanders_ddbb.html" title="Count of Flanders">Count of Flanders</a> also joined the conflict, as well as the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_of_Boulogne_1321.html" title="Count of Boulogne">Count of Boulogne</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theobald_V%2C_Count_of_Blois_3869.html" title="Theobald V, Count of Blois">Theobald</a> the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_of_Blois_295d.html" title="Count of Blois">Count of Blois</a>.

Henry II bought the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Marche_64d5.html" title="County of Marche">County of Marche</a>, then he asserted the French Vexin and Bourges should be given at once, but this time there was no invasion to back the claim.</p>

<p>Louis VII died and was buried in the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Denis_Basilica_538a.html" title="Saint Denis Basilica">Saint Denis Basilica</a> in 1180. His son, aged only 15, ascended of France and in 1183. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_France_c1b4.html" title="Philip II of France">Philip II of France</a>'s policy was to use Henry II's sons against him. Richard the Lionheart was administrating Aquitaine since 1175 but his policy of centralisation of the Aquitanian government has grown unpopular in the eastern part of the Duchy, notably <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perigord.html" title="Perigord">Perigord</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limousin_%28province%29.html" title="Limousin (province)">Limousin</a>. Richard the Lionheart was accused of many crimes there like murders and rapes.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[50]</a></sup> If Richard was not so popular in Aquitaine Philip II was not really liked either by contemporaries<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[51]</a></sup> with comments describing him as: <i>astute, manipulative, calculating, penurious and ungallant ruler.</i></p>
<p>In 1183, Henry the Young joined a revolt led by <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limoges.html" title="Limoges">Limoges</a> and Geoffrey of Lusignan against Richard in order to take Richard's place. They were joined by Philip II, Raymond V and by <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_III%2C_Duke_of_Burgundy_6670.html" title="Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy">Duke Hugh III of Burgundy</a>. Henry the Young died suddenly of a fatal illness in 1183, saving Richard's position. Henry the Young King was buried in <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen_Cathedral_7190.html" title="Rouen Cathedral">Notre Dame de Rouen</a>.</p>
<p>Richard was then Henry II's oldest son and inherited of Henry the Young's status. Henry II ordered him to hand down Aquitaine to John Lackland but Richard refused to comply. Henry II had too much to cope with at the time to take care of this, Welsh princes were now contesting his authority, William the Lion was asking for his castles to be given back and as Henry the Young was dead Philip II asked for the Norman Vexin to be given back. Henry II finally asked Richard I to surrender Aquitaine to Eleanor while Richard retained the control. Still in 1183, Raymond V had taken Cahors back and Henry II asked Richard to mount an expedition against Toulouse. Geoffrey of Brittany was quarrelling violently with his brother Richard and it was obvious Geoffrey could be used by the Capetians but his sudden death in 1186 in a tournament killed the plot. In 1187, Philip II and Richard were more that strong allies as Roger of Hodeven reported:<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1188 Raymond V attacked again joined by the Lusignans, it was rumoured that Henry II himself financed the revolts. By this time Philip II attacked Henry II in Normandy and captured strongholds in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berry_%28province%29.html" title="Berry (province)">Berry</a>. In 1188, Philip II and Henry II met to discuss peace again, Henry II refused to make Richard his heir, the story affirms Richard said: <i>Now at last, I must believe what I had always thought impossible</i>.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>This was the final collapse of all Henry's strategy, first Richard paid homage to the King of France for all the lands his father held. As Richard and Philip II attacked Henry II no one in Aquitaine stood for him and the Bretons seized the opportunity to attack him too. Even Henry's birthplace, Le Mans, was captured and Tours also soon fell. He was simply encircled in his castle of Chinon. Henry was finally compelled to surrender, he handed down a large tribute in money to Philip II and swore all his subjects in France and England would recognise Richard as their lord. Henry II died two days later, learning John had joined Richard and Philip, and the old king was buried in <a href="../../../f/o/n/Fontevraud_Abbey_b869.html" title="Fontevraud Abbey">Fontevraud Abbey</a>.</p>
<p>Eleanor, who was Henry's hostage, was then freed while Lord Rhys raised and began to reconquer the southern parts of Wales that Henry had annexed. Richard I was crowned King in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> in November 1189, while he was already installed Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine. Philip II asked for the Norman Vexin to be given back but the issue was settled when Richard I announced he would marry <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alys%2C_Countess_of_the_Vexin_a8d4.html" title="Alys, Countess of the Vexin">Alys</a>, Philip II's sister. Richard I also recognised Auvergne was meant to belong to the crown of France and not to the Duke of Aquitaine ending Henry's claim on the place. In Britain King William of Scotland opened negotiations with King Richard of England (the two lion kings) to revocate the Treaty of Falaise and an agreement was reached.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<p>Before leaving, Richard I had to make sure nothing went wrong while he was in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Land_6f3c.html" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a>. There was little doubt Raymond V would catch the opportunity to expand his lands in Aquitaine, to counter that threat he built an alliance with <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sancho_VI_of_Navarre_9c7c.html" title="Sancho VI of Navarre">Sancho VI the Wise</a> the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Navarrese_monarchs_334f.html" title="List of Navarrese monarchs">King of Navarre</a>.

<p>The administration left behind worked rather well as an attack from the Count of Toulouse was repelled with the help of Sancho VI. The Siege of Acre was merely over that struck by dysentery Philip II of France had to take the way back to his Kingdom, still upset at the way his sister Alys had been treated. Richard I had also upset <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_V%2C_Duke_of_Austria_4cce.html" title="Leopold V, Duke of Austria">Leopold V the Virtuous</a> by removing his banner from Acre. Much has been said about the reasons Philip II went back to France, it is often considered his dysentery was the principal reason. Other causes could have been the way his sister had been treated by Richard I or that he couldn't stand his subject showed more power and wealth than him or even that following the Count of Flanders's death - Philip- he came back to ask for his share of the land of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artois.html" title="Artois">Artois</a>.</p>
<p>Richard I left <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> in October 1192 and would have retrieved his lands intact had he reached home in time. But <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_V%2C_Duke_of_Austria_4cce.html" title="Leopold V, Duke of Austria">Leopold V</a> arrested him near <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, accusing him of the murder of his cousin Conrad, and then handed him down to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VI%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_de89.html" title="Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor Henry VI</a>. John Lackland was summoned to Philip II's court and accepted to marry Alys with no less than Artois has a dowry in return of what the entireNorman Vexin would be given to the King of France. After all, no one was sure if Richard I would be ever released. Yet, all of the forces John could gather were a bunch of mercenaries as even William the Lion didn't join his revolt and worse, sent money for Richard's ransom. Another revolt in Aquitaine was suppressed by Elias de la Celle, but in Normandy Philip II himself was leading the operations. By April 1193 he had reached <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen.html" title="Rouen">Rouen</a> and although the Ducal Capital couldn't be taken, he and his allies were then controlling all the ports from the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> to <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieppe%2C_Seine-Maritime_6a25.html" title="Dieppe, Seine-Maritime">Dieppe</a>. Confronted to the situation Richard's regents conceded the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Mantes_f61e.html" title="Treaty of Mantes">Treaty of Mantes</a> in July 1193, confirming Philip II's control on all the land he had taken including the entire Norman Vexin, the castles of Drincourt and <a href="../../../a/r/q/Arques%2C_Pas-de-Calais_5d87.html" title="Arques, Pas-de-Calais">Arques</a> in Normandy and the castles of <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loches.html" title="Loches">Loches</a> and Châtillon in Tourraine as well as adding a substantial payment once Richard is back.</p>
<p>In a new treaty in 1194, concessions to the King of France went much further when Tours with all the castles of Tourraine and all of Eastern Normandy except for Rouen were surrendered. The County of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angoul%C3%AAme.html" title="Angoulême">Angoulême</a> was declared independent of Aquitaine, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vend%C3%B4me.html" title="Vendôme">Vendôme</a> was given to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_I%2C_Count_of_Blois_81db.html" title="Louis I, Count of Blois">Louis of Blois</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counts_of_Perche_4dfe.html" title="List of counts of Perche">Rotrou III of Perche</a> acquired <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moulins.html" title="Moulins">Moulins</a> and Bonmoulins.

But by October the new Count of Toulouse, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_VI_of_Toulouse_e1bb.html" title="Raymond VI of Toulouse">Raymond VI</a>, left the Capetian side and joined Richard's. He was followed by <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Constantinople_a538.html" title="Baldwin I of Constantinople">Balwin IV of Flanders</a>, the future <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Empire_727e.html" title="Latin Empire">Latin Emperor</a>, as this one was contesting Artois to Philip II.

As if it was not enough <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaud_de_Dammartin_3898.html" title="Renaud de Dammartin">Renaud de Dammartin</a>, the Count of Boulogne and a skilled commander, also deserted Philip II.

<p>John wasn't king yet that he had to fight to keep his lands. Following the news of Richard's death, Philip II captured <a href="../../../e/v/r/Evreux.html" title="Evreux">Evreux</a> in a rush. John tried to take the Angevin treasure and the castle of Chinon to install his power. But in the local custom<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[58]</a></sup> the son of an older brother was preferred to a claimant. Henceforth they recognised <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_I%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_11eb.html" title="Arthur I, Duke of Brittany">Arthur</a> as their ruler, son of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_II%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_f1de.html" title="Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany">Geoffrey of Brittany</a>, depriving John of the Angevins' ancestral land. Only in Normandy and England he could install his rule. In Normandy he was made Duke in Rouen in April 1199 and he was crowned King of England in May at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. As for Aquitaine he left his mother, Eleanor, controlling the place.</p>
<p>His allies, Aimeri of Thouars and three Lusignan nobles led an attack on Tours in an attempt to capture Arthur and install John as count. Aimeri of Thouars was promised the title of seneschal had he captured Arthur. By this time John went to Normandy to negocy a truce with Philip II. He took profit of this truce to gather Richard's former allies, especially the Count of Boulogne, the Count of Flanders and the Holy Roman Emperor. In the end no less that 15 French counts swore allegiance to John which was now definitely in a way much stronger position than Philip II. A strong supporter of the King -<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_des_Roches_dfe6.html" title="William des Roches">William des Roches</a>- even switched side in front of so much power and handed down Arthur, whom he was supposed to protect, to John. Arthur managed to espace and join Philip II's court very soon though. It was also the moment the Count of Flanders and a lot of knights decided to join the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Crusade_1f82.html" title="Fourth Crusade">crusade</a> in 1199 and deserted John's court. John's dominant position was short-lived and then he had to accept the Treaty of Le Goulet in 1200. Philip II was confirmed over the lands he had taken in Normandy joined by further concessions in Auvergne and Berry. John was recognised at the head of Anjou in return of what he swore he wouldn't interfere if Baldwin IV or Otto IV attacked Philip II.</p>

<p><a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_IX_of_Lusignan_d4af.html" title="Hugh IX of Lusignan">Hugh IX of Lusignan</a> took Eleanor in hostage, John then recognised him as <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Marche_64d5.html" title="County of Marche">Count of Marche</a> thus expanding Lusignan power in the region. In August 1200 John had his first marriage annulled and married <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_of_Angoul%C3%AAme_a1ed.html" title="Isabella of Angoulême">Isabella</a> who was already betrothed to <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_X_of_Lusignan_fad8.html" title="Hugh X of Lusignan">Hugh X</a> and then John confiscated La Marche. The Lusignans themselves called for Philip II's intervention who summoned John to his court. John refused to meet his King causing Philip II to use his power of <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzerainty.html" title="Suzerainty">suzerainty</a> to confiscate all the lands John held in France and to accept Arthur's homage for Poitou, Anjou, Maine and Tours in 1202. <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_VI_of_Toulouse_e1bb.html" title="Raymond VI of Toulouse">Raymond VI</a>, the Count of Toulouse joined Philip II as well as Renaud de Dammartin while most of John's allies were either in the Holy Land or had left him. Only Sancho VII the Strong was remaining and he was more in need of help than in the situation to supply any.</p>
<p>Arthur launched an attack in Poitou with his Lusignan allies, while Philip II attacked Normandy and captured many castles on the frontier. John was in Le Mans when the attacks were launched and decided to move southward. He captured no less than Arthur and Hugh X with 200 knights this success was quickly followed by the capture of the Viscount of Limoges and his imprisonment in Chinon. 1202 was a year of triumph for John who had defeated many of his enemies like never Richard I nor Henry II did.</p>
<p>John had a major sin, "he could not resist the temptation to kick a man when he was down"<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[59]</a></sup> and he took pleasure in humiliating the knights he had captured. Arthur was murdered in jail, most certainly at John's request. A lot of his knights who had relatives on the other side were angered at this behaviour and deserted him.</p>
<p>John's allies handed down <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alen%C3%A7on.html" title="Alençon">Alençon</a> in Normandy to Philip II, while many of them were now fighting him. Vaudreuil was handed down to King of France without a fight and while John was trying to take Alençon back he had to withdraw when Philip II arrived. <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2teau-Gaillard_6b2e.html" title="Château-Gaillard">Château-Gaillard</a> itself had fallen in 1204 after a 6 months siege, this was a very symbolic loss for the Angevins. Philip II kept campaigning in Normandy and captured <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentan.html" title="Argentan">Argentan</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falaise.html" title="Falaise">Falaise</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caen.html" title="Caen">Caen</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayeux.html" title="Bayeux">Bayeux</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisieux.html" title="Lisieux">Lisieux</a> in merely 3 weeks while by the meantime a force of Breton knights captured the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mont_Saint-Michel_c5fc.html" title="Mont Saint-Michel">Mont Saint-Michel</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avranches.html" title="Avranches">Avranches</a>. Tours fell in 1204, Loches and even Chinon followed in 1205, only Rouen and Arques were still resisting and Rouen opened its gates to the King. The Ducal castle was destroyed and a bigger one was commissioned.</p>
<p>Eleanor died in 1204 and then most of the Poitevin nobles joined Philip II as they were loyal to Eleanor but not to John. Eleanor's death saw then Alfonso VIII at last asking for Gascony, which was part of the dowry Henry II had given his daughter, and he entered Gascony. Gascony was one of the only French part of the once powerful "Angevin Empire" that remained loyal to the Angevins as it resisted Alfonso and remained in John's hands.</p>
<p>Finally the two Kings agreed on a truce in 1206. The once mighty "Angevin Empire" was left with Gascony, Ireland and England.</p>

<p>John had to make his rule on the isles undisputed following the loss of Normandy and Anjou. He campaigned in South Wales in 1208, the Scottish border in 1209, Ireland in 1210 and North Wales in 1211 and these campaigns often met their successes. John used all resources he could muster to finance an upcoming campaign in France. Taxation of the Jews generated additional incomes while all land property of the church were seized, this had led to John's excommunication.</p>

<p>In 1212, John was ready to land and invade France, but a revolt in Wales forced him to delay his plans and then a baronnal revolt in England made it worse. Philip II was then also preparation an invasion of England but his fleet was destroyed while anchored at <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damme.html" title="Damme">Damme</a> by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Salisbury_e213.html" title="Earl of Salisbury">Earl of Salisbury</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_de_Longespee%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Salisbury_9d79.html" title="William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury">William de Longespee</a>. Hearing of the news, John ordered all the forces he had set to defend England to sail for Poitou. He landed in La Rochelle in 1214 and was then allied with Renaud de Dammartin, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infante_Fernando%2C_Count_of_Flanders_c350.html" title="Infante Fernando, Count of Flanders">Count Ferdinand of Flanders</a> and of course with Otto IV. His allies would attack in the north-east of France while he would attack from the south west. John went to Gascony and tried to install his garrison in Agens but it was expelled. Unlike Normandy, Philip II had never invaded Poitou, it just switched allegiance. In order to invade Paris it was much shorter to go through Normandy from England than the South west thus King Philip II concentrated his efforts there. The sword swung two ways as for Philip II it was easier to launch and invasion of England from Normandy. As a consequence Poitou was left without strong royal presence. John betrothed his daughter -Joan- to <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_IX_of_Lusignan_d4af.html" title="Hugh IX of Lusignan">Hugh IX of Lusignan</a>'s son <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_X_of_Lusignan_fad8.html" title="Hugh X of Lusignan">Hugh X</a>, in return of what the Lusignans would be granted Saintonge and the <a href="../../../o/l/%C3%A9/Ol%C3%A9ron.html" title="Oléron">Island of Oleron</a> as well as possibilities of further concessions in Touraine and Anjou. These were huge gains for the Lusignans, yet John called that <i>bringing them to submit</i>.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_I%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_1ba3.html" title="Peter I, Duke of Brittany">Peter</a> was the Duke of Brittany of the time, he was loyal to the King of France but his claim to the rule of Brittany was fairly loose. If anything <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor%2C_Fair_Maid_of_Brittany_af86.html" title="Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany">Eleanor</a> of Brittany had a stronger claim as she was the sister of the defunct Arthur.

<p>John entered <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angers.html" title="Angers">Angers</a> and captured a newly built castle at Roche-au-Moine but <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_VIII_of_France_62ce.html" title="Louis VIII of France">Prince Louis</a> rushed from Chinon with an army and took it back by pushing John back to retreat.

Historically both English and French historians had viewed the juxtaposition of England and French lands under Angevin control as something of an <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberration.html" title="Aberration">aberration</a> and an offence to national identity. To English historians the lands in France were an encumbrance, while French historians considered the union to be an English empire.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

The revenues of her great proprietors would have been spent in festivities and diversions on the banks of the Seine. The noble language of Milton and Burke would have remained a rustic dialect, without a literature, a fixed grammar, or a fixed orthography, and would have been contemptuously abandoned to the use of boors.
