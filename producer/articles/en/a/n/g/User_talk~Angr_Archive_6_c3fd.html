<p>Hello, Angr. I am beginning a series of edits to the various articles on Wikipedia that deal with Celtic languages. I am specifically inviting you to comment, if you wish, on my editing as you seem to share some of the same educational background and interest in those languages as I do. <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:P√°draic MacUidhir">P.MacUidhir</a> 22:42, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds good to me. I appreciate the oversight of the work, as it seems there are not that many of us working on Celtic language articles for Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am thinking of extracting the grammar sections of the current <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manx_language.html" title="Manx language">Manx language</a> article, transferring them to a new Manx grammar article, and then expanding it. Is there anything I should know before doing this, in terms of procedure or custom here at Wikipedia? I can easily copy-paste the sections to a new article, but I want to be certain that when I do so I do not step on unknown regulations or other peoples' toes here.&#160;;) For example, do we have templates for this action? I think I have seen one, but figured to ask first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>postscript #1- I found this template. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Language_Template_faf3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Language Template">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Language_Template</a>. That covers languages in general. Still looking for something that regulates crafting specific grammar articles, though. <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:P√°draic MacUidhir">P.MacUidhir</a> 21:55, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>postscript #2- Hmm. Looks like grammar articles are not particularly popular here. I shall just work on expanding what is already in place at the main article.</dd>

<p>Hai <b>Angr</b>, there are intresting articles about <b>Ayyavazhi</b>, a new religion on both mythology and religiosity. Wikipedia is rich with this topic in English, but poor in other languages. Since french is a leading language in Wikipedia it is better to translate the contents on this <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">AYYAVAZHI</a> family to french. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj">Paul Raj</a></p>

<p>Hi, i was wondering if you could help review the article <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesop.html" title="Aesop">Aesop</a>, recently edited by <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a>. i reverted his change because in my opinion, his wordings were POV (suggesting that Aesop did not exist) and his use of the words "tradition" and "guise" were really awkward. He seemed to disagree with me and reverted it back. i don't want to offend anyone or start an edit war so i'm seeking help from a third party, i.e. you.&#160;:) Let me know if you could mediate in this alright? Thanks a lot! --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 13:00, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page claims that the merger is "nonexistent". This surprised me: I'd understood that the merger was real (although almost extinct), and that what was mythical was the <i>reversal</i> of the sounds so that <i>coil</i> sounded like <i>curl</i> and vice versa. The page also needs converting X-SAMPA to IPA, but I'd like to check the facts first.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 18:05, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I've used some of your comments in an attempt to improve the article. I presume there is a reference for the Labov 1966 bit, in which case it should be added.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 19:04, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hi. someone removed Manx from the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extinct_language.html" title="Extinct language">extinct language</a> article. does Manx have any remaining speakers? i thought not. i imagine that this is a touchy subject? peace ‚Äì <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 22:26, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also on the subject of Manx, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manx_language.html" title="Manx language">Manx language</a> article discusses the orthography, but doesn't really make much of an effort at explaining what's going on. <a href="http://www.akerbeltz.org/beagangaidhlig/gramar/grammar_fastspeech2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.akerbeltz.org/beagangaidhlig/gramar/grammar_fastspeech2.htm" rel="nofollow">This page</a> seems to say that <i>tuittym</i> is pronounced [to í…ôm], which suggests there's more to it than just that it's English-based, as do some of the other examples I've seen.

<p>Hi Angr, I think we were too hasty in deleting <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>. I've nominated it for undeletion. Most of the votes for delete were done before the article was substantially deleted. I think someone among the admins should take some interest and investigate the editing history in more detail.... The last version removed all external links and references except for links to NY Times and other major media sources. At the same time, some of the external links remain on Wikipedia at other pages, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_DeAngelo_10f5.html" title="David DeAngelo">David DeAngelo</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Jeffries_4e44.html" title="Ross Jeffries">Ross Jeffries</a> are two of them. The <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> article is much more neutral and NPOV about the phenomenon as a whole.... Let me know. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 11:01, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can you please explain "I stand by my decision..."? Take consideration of my earlier reasoning. I believe the other articles listed above are POV, and badly written compared to this one, so it is good to have a clear and consistent policy in place... Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a></p>
<p>I thought it was the policy to require everyone to re-vote after substantial revision? This was the concern of fuddlemark after he spent considerable time revising and helping newcomers with knowledge of the subject (myself inluded) to create a decent entry. Each of the points raised by the "delete" voters was specifically handled and addressed, but no one was required to re-vote or re-consider. Anyway, let's avoid discussion of the AfD process, please look a little deeper at the article itself, in particular the revisions done AFTER the votes to delete. It would be useful to have your opinion on this. If it's a waste of time, say so. But I think a mistake was made in this case. Let me know. Thanks.... <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 14:05, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> was mentioned on CNN today.... We should work on cleaning and improving the article. But now that it's deleted and lost in admin process, how?</p>
<p>After speaking to people personally what I think has happened is that there is significant bias against an article that is primarily about picking up women. No matter how much major media attention the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> has gotten, people suspect it is some kind of a scam rather than a social trend. The NY Times says it is notable. WP says obsolete video games are more notable. Sock puppetry or not there is undeniable WP bias and communism against newer people going on. Some of the comments and edits have been sincere, look closely at my revision history and efforts to eliminate POV and promotion. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 02:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>At <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_names_in_various_languages.html" title="List of country names in various languages">List of country names in various languages</a>, there is no problem with Etsunan per se, but I can see two objections:</p>
<p>1. Unlike Ë±™Â∑û for Australia (for instance), which is still used by some people, <i>nobody</i> in Japan says Etsunan. It is dead except for expressions like Êó•Ë∂äÈñ¢‰øÇ (Japanese-Vietnamese relations).</p>
<p>2. You are opening the door to a large number of 'former usages', like ‰ªèËò≠Ë•ø (instead of „Éï„É©„É≥„Çπ) for France and similar kanji compounds for countries like Mexico, the Philippines, Germany, Russia, England, Spain, etc. These are all of 'historical interest' but they are not current. In the case of ‰ªèËò≠Ë•ø, of course, they survive in expressions like Êó•‰ªèÈñ¢‰øÇ (Japanese-French relations), but the full expression is not used except in some literary works (for atmosphere). And then there is the infamous ÊîØÈÇ£ <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shina.html" title="Shina">Shina</a> for China, no longer used except in fixed expressions (like the 'East China Sea'). This would have to be listed, too, by rights. You start with these 19th century kanji expressions and you logically have to go the whole hog! Vietnam also has a number of historical names for neighbouring countries like Myanmar and Cambodia. I'm just wondering where you draw the line. Surely it is better to draw the line at 'current usage' rather than try to include every historical usage. Just my thoughts on the matter. Give me the word and I can include as many old usages as you like&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBathrobe_e70b.html" title="User:Bathrobe">Bathrobe</a> 09:55, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You make an excellent suggestion. The article you propose should not be confined only to Japanese but should include Chinese as well. The reason is that many of these old usages have their roots in Chinese, not Japanese. ‰ªèËò≠Ë•ø, for instance, would be Futsuransei in Japanese and F√≥l√°nxƒ´ in Chinese, strongly suggesting that the pronunciation is based on Chinese, not Japanese. The interesting thing is that modern Chinese uses a slightly different word for France, which is Ê≥ïËò≠Ë•ø F«él√°nxƒ´, usually now reduced to Ê≥ïÂúã/Ê≥ïÂõΩ F«égu√≥ (the traditional pronunciation was the irregular F√†gu√≥, but this has been 'regularised' by the Mainland Chinese). This is also the case for a number of country names, including Italy and Germany, where Japanese and Chinese character usage differ. In fact, all this dates back to an era of interchange in the 19th century when educated Japanese were steeped in the Chinese tradition, something which young Japanese today are not. I believe that the Japanese actually took these names from China, through Chinese books imported at the time, although I'm not 100% sure of this.</p>
<p>Vietnamese should also be included in such an article because many Vietnamese country names are based on the Chinese. For example, 'France' in Vietnamese is Ph√°p, based on the Chinese character Ê≥ï -- see above. (Some information of this sort was included in the list of countries until I deleted it. I did so not because it wasn't interesting but because it goes beyond the scope of such a list. It's disruptive to such a list to have someone continually calling out, 'Hey, this word is related to this word!') But this information would be ideal for inclusion in the article you suggest. I don't know anything about Korean but I suspect it is the same. An article on place names in the 'Sinosphere' might be very interesting.</p>

<p>Hi Angr, and thanks for reading‚Äîand reacting to‚Äîmy article on the correlation between object shape and noun gender. You are perfectly right about one important thing: The article does not mention any reference, although I did try to find some on the internet. However, the correlation in question is certainly not my idea and I don't think the article can be labeled as original research. I have known about this correlation for maybe 10-15 years, from colleagues back in the uni days. The only thing that you can label as original is the choice of fruit and vegetables for the noun list, but then again the list itself and the calculation are just given as an illustration, to help readers understand the established fact. No excuse intended, but you know better than I do that not everything needs to be supported by a reference; we don't mention a book every time we say that German nouns have three genders.</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure how this is usually handled on Wikipedia. We can remove the article if it really does not belong here. Or we can just consider it a poorly written article until I‚Äîor anyone else‚Äîcan come up with a reference. This may take some time, because if googling continues to fail I will need to contact some people and ask for their help. If your vigilance is doubled by an interest in the subject you may even be in a better position to help‚Äîas you surely have noticed, I am not a linguist. I will comply with any reasonable decision. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdiJapan_10e9.html" title="User:AdiJapan">AdiJapan</a> 02:18, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>y. No, I think <b>you'</b>re funnier than me. Say, Tim and Bob are walking in the forest. Suddenly, Bob clutches his chest and falls to the ground. Tim panics, calls 911, and blurts "Help me, my friend just had a heart attack! I think he's dead!" The operator at the other end says "Calm down. First, let's make sure he's dead." He hears a gunshot, and then Tim's voice comes on the line: "Ok, so, what do I do now?"&#160;;-) <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake013_0fc9.html" title="User:Jake013">Jake013</a> 11:57, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for tidying this up; the page was in limbo and was a bit of a mess. There are a couple of things, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now two entries for the long-mid mergers on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_English_language_295e.html" title="History of the English language">History of the English language</a> page. There's the one that has just been moved from <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonemic_differentiation.html" title="Phonemic differentiation">Phonemic differentiation</a>, and there's another one earlier (the "loss of most remaining diphthongs" bit, which talks about these mergers. Unfortunately I don't fully understand the latter section (it mentions lots of Middle English phonemes, like distinct /ai/, /ei/ and /…õi/, without context) so I don't feel up to sorting this myself. (I mentioned this on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_the_English_language_a7c4.html#Long_mid_mergers" title="Talk:History of the English language">Talk:History_of_the_English_language#Long mid mergers</a> ages ago, but didn't get a response.)</li>
<li>Should things like the "line/loin merger", which only affects a few accents, really be on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_English_language_295e.html" title="History of the English language">History of the English language</a>, which is a very long page? I don't think it's a good idea for that page to be where every sound change that affects some English dialects ends up.</li>

<p>Thanks for your go-ahead on the redirects for deletion page. I have created a page that is rather half-article, half-disambiguation.

<p>If you are too busy to help me don't worry, I'll search another Wikipedian that knows German, and sorry for bothering you.</p>

<p>Hi Angr,</p>
<p>I wonder if you could help me out with something? I think I just met <a href="../../../8/7/2E/User%7E87.78.47.107.html" title="User:87.78.47.107">a German Wikipedian</a> who is interested to contribute here. I don't understand the entire story, but I think he or she created an article which they think is GFDL compliant material and correctly cited, but is currently being marked as a copyright violation. It has something to do with the article Iraqi Kurdistan Front, and I presume that it was written by <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/staff/pike.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/staff/pike.htm" rel="nofollow">John E. Pike</a>.</p>
<p>The user has posted on <a href="../../../j/j/a/User_talk%7EJJay_9299.html" title="User talk:JJay">JJay's talk page</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/p/User_talk%7EHappyCamper_0b20.html" title="User talk:HappyCamper">my talk page</a>. I've tried to put together as much of the information as I can for you below. Could you follow through with this Wikipedian's requests when you get a chance?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm going to give him or her a nice welcome to English Wikipedia, and I'll direct his inquiries to you for the moment. I hope you don't mind - when this came up, the first person here I thought to turn to for help was you.
