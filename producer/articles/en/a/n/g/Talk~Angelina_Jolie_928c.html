<dd>check if your age is right....it is based on public records not biographies off of fan sites. but it seems interesting...because that means her mom had her at 17...--<a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJujucabana_b98a.html" title="User:Jujucabana">Juju</a> 23:17, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My mom was married at 17. Chaplin's last wife was 17. That's certainly not a criteria. There is no logical reason for Angelina Jolie to claim she's 15 years younger than she is! If that's the case, then she must have been a really late bloomer because she would have been 20 when she made her first film back in 1982 and she looks like a little kid! Besides, note how many Angelina Jolies are actually listed. You only cite the first one -- forgetting that her legal name hasn't been Voight for about 5-6 years. There are several other Angelina Jolies -- including one in LA -- with the correct age. Ignore this source. It's wrong. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:30, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the reason why i mentioned the first one, is because it lists other aliases, as well as mentions relatives. yes there are several different people with the name 'angelina jolie' but there is only one who is related to marcheline. the first one mentions LA, and if i am correct she probably owns a variety properties within the US. so ofcourse she would have other cities listed. i dont think it could go on the wiki, without more substantial evidence, but it is an interesting tidbit of information. --<a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJujucabana_b98a.html" title="User:Jujucabana">Juju</a> 01:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No argument there. I'm curious to find out where 45 figure came from. Someone must have gotten a mix-up somewhere. The fact that you click on the name and the site provides zero information/sources is one of the reasons why I discount it. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Odd thing is, she IS considered beautiful by most people. Otherwise she wouldn't have her status as an actress today. Yeah, it's point of view as to what a person considers "beautiful" but it wouldn't POV violation at to say something like "She is considered by many possessing great beauty." 74.137.217.32 10:47, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reference to the moving "Looking to Get Out" and how she "did not" get the idea to be an actor from her father appears to cut a little close to what the website said.

<dd>While the bio doesn't name its sources, I'd say it's clear that it was written based on interviews and (reliable) articles. Most info can be cross-referenced with other articles listed in the reference section (especially the two Vogue articles). These Tiscali biographies seem to be an accepted source, e.g. it's mentioned as a reference on the featured article "Uma Thurman". If you on the other hand think that some info in the section is wrong and you have a reliable source for it, then just change it. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 15:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Angelina Jolie announced the founding of the Jolie/Pitt Foundation which gave initial donations to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders of $1 million each. [...]</dd>
<dd>Angelina Jolie is a goodwill ambassador for the UN High Commission for Refugees. During her years as Goodwill Ambassador Jolie concentrated her efforts on field missions, visiting refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) all around the world. Asked what she hopes to accomplish, she stated, “Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.” In her travels, Angelina Jolie visited Tham Hin refugee camp in Thailand and Colombian refugees in Ecuador, went to various UNHCR facilities in Kosovo and paid a visit to Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya with refugees mainly from Sudan. Angelina Jolie also visited Angolan refugees while she was filming Beyond Borders in Namibia. During a private stay in Jordan in December 2003 Angelina Jolie asked to visit Ruwaished camp in Jordan's remote eastern desert, 70 km from the Iraqi border. With the humanitarian situation in Sudan worsening, Angelina Jolie flew to Chad in June 2004, paying a visit to border sites and camps for refugees who had fled fighting in western Sudan's Darfur region. In 2004 Jolie visited Afghan refugees in Thailand and on a private stay to Lebanon during the Christmas holidays she visited UNHCR's regional office in Beirut as well as some young refugees and cancer patients in the Lebanese capital. Recently, Angelina Jolie became more involved in promoting humanitarian causes on a political level. Jolie pushed for a bill to aid 70 million vulnerable children in the Third World which was signed by President Bush in November 2005, but so far no funding has been granted. In September 2005 Angelina Jolie was named the new spokesperson for the clothing line St. John, and the deal includes the start-up of a charity headed by Jolie which will focus on children's issues and causes." <a href="http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.php/EntertainmentNews/2006092205pitt-jolie-money" class="external text" title="http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.php/EntertainmentNews/2006092205pitt-jolie-money" rel="nofollow">Jolie-Pitt Foundation Donates $2M to Children, Medical Charities</a></dd>

That is, if celebheights says People magazine on this date, it would be better to use People magazine itself as the citation rather than celebheights.

Anyway, I don't care too much either way, but I still prefer "Film career", because (a) the two short sentences at the beginning don't establish a modeling <i>career</i>, but they are basically a lead-in to her movie roles, (b) the remaining section deals with her acting work exclusively and (c) including 'film' makes it easier to distinguish it from other sections, especially humanitarian work.

<dd>I agree with your take on this, and I see nothing wrong with "film career". Discussion within that section doesn't have to be exclusively about the film career, but could include any relevant tangents especially events that paved the way for her acting career. Such as her modelling work from which her acting career seems to have evolved. She was not especially notable as a model, it was just something she did, so the article should not be tailored to fit around the one sentence that describes it. But as you said, it's not a big issue. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 06:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe they were once mentioned but the reference was removed under NPOV. Wikipedia is becoming rather strict regarding biographical articles of living persons. Considering Jolie is an Oscar winner, has been acclaimed for her humanitarian work, and is also widely regarded for her looks (something that, in itself, would be expected to include her lips), there would need to be some reputable sources added to back up why her lips should be singled out for attention as opposed to her tattoos or any other part of her often-exposed body. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because it seems you are designated as the authority in charge of the Angelina Jolie article, I hope you don’t mind if I direct these questions to you. In your above comments, you make the assertion that two of the sources I referred to in the contribution I originally made in the article about Angelina’ lips “are hardly acceptable per WP:RS.” I did some digging and I find this statement puzzling as the sources I used seem to be at least as reliable as <a href="http://fansites.hollywood.com/~ajolie/int34.html" class="external free" title="http://fansites.hollywood.com/~ajolie/int34.html" rel="nofollow">http://fansites.hollywood.com/~ajolie/int34.html</a>, <a href="http://www.joliecommunity.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.joliecommunity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joliecommunity.com/</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jolie_web/services.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/jolie_web/services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/jolie_web/services.htm</a>, <a href="http://www.pickbabynames.com/Celtic/M/Maddox.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pickbabynames.com/Celtic/M/Maddox.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pickbabynames.com/Celtic/M/Maddox.html</a>, and even two references to <a href="http://www.wutheringjolie.com" class="external free" title="http://www.wutheringjolie.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wutheringjolie.com</a> along with other questionable websites which you don’t mind being used as sources; and yet you disallowed my sources per WP:RS. Can you explain to me why you consider the sources that you let stay in this article as reliable and not the two of mine that you called unreliable? The reason I am interested in this is that I’m trying to learn as much as so can so I can make good contributions in the future. I thought I was beginning to grasp the concept of what comprises an acceptable source, but now you have me all confused. No offense please, but some of the websites you apparently approve of as reliable sources for this article about Angelina Jolie seem to just post recycled secondary source information, which makes them tertiary sources that I thought are to be avoided when possible. I should mention that these sites are also covered with a lot of spam ads and have sketchy copyright issues as well. I’m sincerely trying to understand and learn from your reasoning in allowing them to remain. Do you allow links to these websites to stand as sources because the particular information from the website cited by this article is reliable in spite of other things posted on the website in question? Does your reasoning have anything to do with the stuff the editors are debating in the External Links policy arbitration board concerning links to sites like youtube.com that have a mix of copyvio material and other legitimate non-copyvio material? Are these sources “grandfathered” in or something? Are these sources left to stand because they are the only place online where the information exists? Why does there seem to be a double standard? Help me out here please. I really want to learn.</p>
<p>I appreciate you generously allowing the re-adding of one of the sentences I put in the article about Angelina Jolie’s lips; I too think her lips significant and specific attention in the media is notable. However, I do have one suggestion. I think the statements about her lips that you put back in should be altered just a little. Maybe something like this could be said in the article:</p>
<p>“As one of her most distinctive physical features, Jolie's lips have attracted notable media attention. Her lips were mentioned among the "world's sexiest things" in a 2006 FHM poll (askmen.com citation). Despite speculation that her famous lips are the product of simple genetics or from some type of cosmetic enhancement (eyeballson.com citation), they top the list of body parts most wished for by plastic surgery patients. (USAToday citation)”</p>
<p>In interest of NPOV, I think the statement about the positive media perception about the appearance of her lips should be tempered with at least a mention of the speculation about her unique lips origins (genetic or artificial) and is discussed with dignity in the eyeballson.com article. I think this because of the extreme ramifications such speculation has in the world in which we live. I am especially motivated on this topic being mentioned because I read a current event article located at <a href="http://wcbstv.com/local/local_story_333184229.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wcbstv.com/local/local_story_333184229.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which I found interesting and troubling. You should check it out. It makes it perfectly clear to me why this addition to the Wikipedia article is timely and relevant. If you look at the topic of the article I read, and check out Angelina’s name smack in the middle of the second paragraph, maybe you’ll see why I think that the information in the eyeballson.com article is important enough to add or at least be linked to in this Wikipedia article. I think that there is a widely held media-driven perception that her lips are the model woman lips and are obviously “fake” and can be had easily by anyone for the right price and by those willing to take the risk. However, as the article about the girl who died says; “people need to do their homework” and have realistic expectations about plastic surgery. I think the eyeballson.com article handles the issue of the speculation about her lips with dignity and NPOV and serves as a “reality check” as mentioned by the doctor quoted in the article. It should be included in case people considering trying to get “Angelina Jolie lips” choose to “do their homework” here at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Plus I find it interesting that you and others wanted to include this information before. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Angelina_Jolie/Archive_1#The_Lips_Again" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Angelina_Jolie/Archive_1#The_Lips_Again" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. You just needed a valid reason to put it in then. Well here you go.</p>
<p>Now granted, maybe linking to the eyeballson.com site as a source isn’t sufficient for citation in the body of the article, (which still puzzles me because of the other sources you let stand), but maybe in lieu of a source citation, it could possibly be at least added to the External Links or References section? I know that Wikipedia is not intended to be a link-farm, but I also know that WP:EL policy does state that a small and select list of external links is appropriate when the links help expand a topic in ways not possible in the Wikipedia article. I think the article at eyeballson.com is highly relevant, informational, and certainly expands the topic. Also note, I tried to find this article or one like it at a more widely known website like Time, CNN or Newsweek, but couldn’t so I linked to it at eyeballson.com. I think it can be considered a reasonably reliable secondary source because it offers insight into the topic from an interview with a plastic surgeon that is in fact a primary source that can be easily verified. As a matter of fact, I called the office of the doctor quoted in the article and they verified that he indeed gave the interview (no original research, just source verification, right?). I looked and don’t think the topic is already sufficiently covered in any other of the external sources listed, so I think its addition to the External Links or References could be justified and useful if it’s not used as a citation within the article.</p>
<p>Also, if you can’t justify adding the additional reference to her lips speculation in the sentence and an accompanying external link because of article length concerns, maybe you could cut down the Tattoo section (as was suggested in the peer review) and then squeeze it in that way.</p>
<p>I just think that somehow it needs to be in there.</p>
<p>I look forward to your comments and hope you consider my input. BHFeller 07:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your criticism of some of the sources mentioned above might be valid, but they are not used to cite controversial statements, and therefore I feel it might be better to have a potentially weak source, than no source at all. You try to include a highly controversial statement though; mentioning mere speculation about plastic surgery will probably be interpreted as confirmation by some readers and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is very strict on that matter: <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Remove unsourced or poorly sourced controversial material</a>. It is my understanding that information about possible plastic surgery is generally left out entirely, unless the person has confirmed it him or herself. The media section only tries to document major topics of her public life and I don't think there is really an ongoing debate about the genuineness of her lips, certainly not in the main stream media. Also, the plastic surgeon on eyeballson.com seems to believe her lips are real himself, as he points out to take a look at her brother and father or childhood pictures, at least he is very indifferent about it, so the article is probably not an ideal source for this alleged speculation, anyhow. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 16:49, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>EnemyOfTheState: I added the word "unconfirmed" because you are right, that may have been misunderstood. Thanks for the help. Also, no big deal, but I re-read the article with the plastic surgeon and I think in fact he doesn't give an opinion at all. He's ambiguous. He says,“If you really wanted to know, you could look at a few basic things like her genetics and the looks of her parents and any siblings. You could also look at early pictures of her from when she was a child or teenager. You could also examine close-ups of the areas in question for scars and other obvious signs of work.” I think he is making a generic statement applicable to anybody, and not necessarily an opinion about Angelina; another case of unconfirmed speculation. Anyway, I've probably spent too much time on this, but I do still think it is a valid point that deserves mention. I agree with Pulsemeat in your discussion here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Angelina_Jolie/Archive_1#The_Lips_Again" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Angelina_Jolie/Archive_1#The_Lips_Again" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and people do probably come to Wikipedia to escape the crap of the blogospere. I know I did. I agree that it would be highly controversial to make a poorly-cited statement that her lips are either fake or real in Wikipedia. I would never want that. I think the statement in the form it is written now qualifies as non-controversial thanks to your suggestions. It now simply acknowledges that this is a question for which a lot of writers and companies frequently state their assumption of the answer as fact, but that has not actually been reliably settled in one way or the other. I think that point is benign, non-controversial, and notable.</p>
<p>Just a couple of interesting conflicting examples of it being alluded to as settled fact are once again<a href="http://wcbstv.com/local/local_story_333184229.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wcbstv.com/local/local_story_333184229.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> that infers that her lips are fake and easily duplicated by plastic surgery; a careless assumption. Also this one is just sad <a href="http://www.kidzworld.com/site/p2087.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kidzworld.com/site/p2087.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>; poor kid got the parent's non-Angelina-DNA and it gave them boring lips. Also check this confused lady out at <a href="http://experts.about.com/q/Makeup-Skincare-1434/lips-1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://experts.about.com/q/Makeup-Skincare-1434/lips-1.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>; if the lady followed the advice given in the answer I bet she had sore lips:) None of these are citable sources obviously, I just think they are interesting in regards to this topic. Thanks again for your help and insight. BHFeller 22:28, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>23skidoo:</p>
<p>In regards to your comments about the relevance of mentioning her lips in the article, please consider the following. To find a reputable (although admittedly non-citable) source for why her lips should be singled out, one needs to look no further than the topic <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_attractiveness.html" title="Physical attractiveness">Physical attractiveness</a> in Wikipedia, which has a picture of Jolie with a caption about her lips. The NPOV policy concern is why I added this information to the "Jolie in the media" section and not to her "Career" or "Humanitarian Work" sections. You can hardly read a report in the media about her humanitarian work, acting career, or anything else without seeing a mention of her lips. Her lips have been credited with carrying movies and blamed for distracting from her acting performances. Her lips are often used as the marketing bait for the multi-billion dollar lip augmentation industry. Her lips make headlines in the worldwide foreign press. Her lips are often the target of late-night comics and other satirists. Other actresses are ridiculed for trying to mimic her lips. Even the section in this very Wikipedia article titled "Breakthrough" makes reference to a Gone in Sixty Seconds movie review that mentions her lips...check this out in the last paragraph -"The role was small, and the Washington Post criticized that ‘all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.’ " Yes, she has done more important things than have notable lips, and her list of accomplishments is impressive -that's exactly why I think it noteworthy to point out that the media focuses on her lips so much in spite of all she's done.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is probably more press about her lips than her humanitarian work. To deny this fact violates NPOV, in my opinion, and I think the media section of this article was probably created to discuss topics like this. Besides the sources I referred to in the paragraph I submitted to the article (that you deleted and EnemyOfTheState amended), here are some other examples of her lips being singled out in the media:</p>

<p>...and I could list thousands more. No, none of these references are from scientific journals, or whatever else you think is a reputable source, but this section of the article is about the media. A huge section of the media industry devotes itself to allegedly frivolous topics like this. I think that a mention in the media section of this article about the disproportionate attention her lips receive, along with citations to back it up, is appropriate. No, I wouldn't devote a whole separate section to it, but to leave it out altogether would be ignoring a very obvious topic relevant in an informational article about Angelina Jolie. I agree with your point that a discussion about her lips pales in comparison to her UN work, her Oscar, etc, but it is very relevant in a discussion of her presence in the media. The reason her lips should be singled out as a topic is simply because the media singles them out very frequently. As far as I can tell they mention them far more often than her tattoos, the topic of which somehow merits a large section in this article. Her lips even seem to be mentioned even more than her beauty as a whole. A mention of the constant reference to her lips in the worldwide media just seems obvious to me, and from my reading of all the Wikipedia policies, is not even close to being considered controversial or potentially libelous...read the <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_Parton_7625.html" title="Dolly Parton">Dolly Parton</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> articles if you think frankly mentioning a celebrity's trademark body part is unprecedented.</p>
<p>I think an article written by a publicist would probably avoid reference to her lips and their obvious attention in the media, but I think a mention here in the Wikipedia is fair and, if anything, casts only a negative image on the media's sometimes strange priorities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I took seriously the invitation to “help improve this article” mentioned at the top of this discussion page. I think the information about her lip's coverage in the media: improves the article; is relevant and timely (see my comments to EnemyOfTheState for the reason); is completely NPOV when compared to other things mentioned in this and other Wikipedia articles; does not violate the policy of no original research WP:NOR simply by its inclusion in the article without citation of a source concerning the topics relevancy; and definitely merits inclusion. I hope you agree and don’t delete it back out again. I also hope that someone doesn't just read this and make a knee-jerk reaction by deleting all references to other interesting Angelina Jolie topics (i.e. tattoos, Brangelina...) not as important as her UN work and her Oscar. All of this stuff collectively is what makes her interesting and notable. BHFeller 07:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't need to provide a catalog of web listings to support your point. One or two will do, however as I have discovered on an unrelated issue, anything that smacks of being a blog is considered an unreliable source (rightly or wrongly) so if you are to add a citation (which should still be done if not done already), I would go with a reputable print source. There are one or two up there at first glance. Just remember this article is not just about Jolie's lips.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:38, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I didn't put it here to do any harm, I just thought it was funny to report it. The girls weren't hiding or anything so therefore I asume it's ok to say it&#160;?

<p>What I meant by funny was 'sweet'. As I said this is no secret to anyone who actually lives in Paris and happens to go to certain places. Jolie and Scott met on a TV set where they were both invited and became friends after that. The appartement Jolie and Pitt stayed in while last in Paris is owned by a close friend of Scott. There were photos in Voici Magazine and Closer Magazine of the girls together. First walking Jolie's kids in the Champ de Mars,then coming out of the Plaza Athenée where they had lunch or something like that,then there was one of them kissing in the car downstairs from the appartement. So..... Olaf750.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're saying "kids" plural so that means this would have happened around the time she hooked up with Brad Pitt ... so why then has all western media apparently ignored this? I just noted that you <i>have</i> added a URL and yet for some reason the Wikipedia system rejected it. I'll put it back since you have added a citation.

<li>I removed the citation. It doesn't actually lead to any article and it's not in English - English language links are required on English Wikipedia. If you can find a direct link to an article in English, then that should work. (I'm personally not that concerned if the article is in French, especially if it's mostly photos, but the link that was there simply went to a homepage for a magazine, so it wasn't very useful). As I mentioned on your talk page, you're on the right track and if an online source isn't available (presumably the article you tried to link to has been removed or is now behind a subscription firewall), a print reference is fine, too. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:16, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I removed the claim, because there seems to be no source at all. You having witnessed it is no enough and your alleged source was just a link to a homepage.

<p>Well to be honest with you, this is getting out of hand. I just wanted to add a line and it keeps being removed and or argued and really it's not worth it. If this information doesn't appeal to you guys, well then forget it, I can't spend days like you coming back and forth on this page, I'm not an Angelina Jolie fan to the point that I have to control everything that's being said about her.... No hard feelings. As for when this took place, yes it was during the time she hooked up with Brad Pitt when they stayed in Paris for quite a while, and no I don't know why the western media ignored it. May be because Ann Scott is a french person and is only wellknown in France, I don't know.</p>

<dd>I know it's tough, but the fact is Wikipedia has made it more difficult to add off-the-cuff information -- and even published information -- under their tightened <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy. Wikipedia has nearly been (and possibly has been) sued for libel on numerous occasions, so they are requiring people to be diligent. Whether the piece of information is notable or not isn't the issue here. It needs to be something that, if Angelina Jolie or Ann Scott took umbrage, they could confirm on their own as being a legitimate source. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> (the head of Wikipedia) has taken a stand that he'd rather see zero information on a subject than risk incorrect or libellous information. While I disagree with him in terms of having to provide citations for every little bit of detail in an article about a book or movie, for example, when it comes to biographies of living persons, he's quite correct. Especially when we're talking about rumored or alleged relationships. This is quite different than the debate we were having over Angie's lips earlier. There may be debate over whether it should be part of this article, but Jolie isn't likely to sue Wikipedia if we mention that people think she has sexy lips. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:38, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's been a few days since I put in the protection on this article. Should I unprotect the page again, or would folks be willing to leave it protected for the next while? I'll be offline from Wikipedia starting the 18th and gone till the second week of January, though of course any admin-level editor or sysop can remove the protection. Protection is generally considered a temporary measure, so we should get this article back "in the clear" as soon as possible, however if it's just going to attract those vandals again, it might be worth keeping it under "lock and key" for awhile yet until those folks get bored and move their attention to more worthwhile endeavors such as watching Teletubbies. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>London, Jun 8 (ANI): Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has financed a documentary titled 'A Moment in the World', which captures events as they occur all over the world during the same random three-minute time frame.</p>
<p>Jolie, who came up with the idea after realising how contrasting her travels have been in recent years, said: "I kept going between Mad's country and refugee camps or war zones to Hollywood and all these odd places and then seeing the world at all these different times." "Then it became this kind of crazy adventure of organising a lot of people and gathering over 30 crews of people and sending them across the world to all these places. On January 11th (05) we all opened up our cameras at the exact same time, coordinated across the world for three minutes," femalefirst quoted her as saying. (ANI)</p>
<p><br />
I think this should be added.</p>

<dd>The documentary was announced back in early 2005, but so far it has not been released and I'm not aware of any plans to release it in the foreseeable future.

<dd>Yes, it's time for discussion. I think to have two filmographies is redundant - we only need one and in choosing one it should be the one that is most complete. The shortened list is POV so I don't like it. Who decides what goes on the short list? I disagree that it looks "cool". I think it looks random and confusing. I prefer the full list that is not skewed by anyone's POV, and I also think the complete chronological listing is more logical and easier to refer to, than the abbreviated list. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 12:48, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a>, it's redundant and POV. Also, the template doesn't list the role names or any additional comments, so it's totally unnecessary.

<li>ok, fellows, let´s talk about it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It looks cool" is a big reason, a great reason, but it's not the one. Wikipedia was made to be upgraded including its layout. Is a mutant one. The standard filmography is visually atrocious and too long. Main filmography is easier to navigate, and isn't complete, for god's sake, it is MAIN. The films placed there are not POV, but common sense to people who watch films, not just angelina fans. The other ones are irrelevants. But if it bores you, what about add all films to the template? Two filmographies are redundant? Well, it isn't, is one main filmography to users who just want acess most popular films and one complete filmography. But, if it bores, let´s place all of it inside the template.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMachocarioca_6a66.html" title="User:Machocarioca">Machocarioca</a> 19:27, 21 December 2006 (UTC)Machocarioca</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Jolie has made 30+ films. The "Main" list contains 13. Who decided which films were selected for the list? You? If so, the list is a product of your POV, and no matter how many people might work on creating a short list, it would still be POV and would conflict with one of Wikipedia's key intents. Even your comments above suggest a POV that is out of step with Wikipedia's aims, when you talk about "common sense" and "irrelevants". These are inherently POV terms and you are applying them as a rationale for something that should be devoid of POV. Also, it is not appropriate to continue adding the navigation box while we are still discussing this. It's ok to be bold and add things that nobody objects to, but a few editors have now objected to this inclusion and the navigation box should not be added unless we reach a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">consensus</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 07:43, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A number of users have asked him to refrain, giving various reasons. I agree with the comments made here that a "main" filmography is by definition a judgment call, and is inappropriate in the context of Wikipedia.

<p>Mr. Grstain, I'm not you who reverts the templates using your username and your IP. I'm just Machocarioca, period. I'm not film addicteds or sometihng or IPs, ok? You're the vandal here. You didn't like the templates and i can't wonder why, (they are a big upgrade in the layout and shorts the size of the article) and only you didn't like it, until this discussion here about Angelina filmography. You tried impose me a WK policy that there isn't about theses templares, right? Those estandard ones are suggestions. Atrocious ones.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross, you're right. Then, my point is: i'm improving the layout and trying to ease the search. Templates are, by far, a more civilized way to search films here. The selected filmography is not a POV, but a common sense by who works in films, as i said. But, if it bores you, why not a selected filmography along with the complete one? Is it bad? I don't think so, we have to improve here over and over. All the particular informaion you say is in the complete filmography is in the articles. Having it in the standard box is a POV, right? Or a suggestion.... Let's discuss the whole thing? Everybody here wants to make a better wiki, the discussion is the better way to do that, ok? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMachocarioca_6a66.html" title="User:Machocarioca">Machocarioca</a> 20:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC)Machocarioca</p>

<dd>Machocarioca, I agree with your aim of trying to make a better Wiki. That's what I try to do and what I hope others will always try to do. I think improvement is a very good thing, and there is no problem with trying new things and seeing how other editors feel about it. It's just in this particular situation, I don't think the "main films" template is an improvement for the reasons I've stated above. I think it creates a problem rather than solves a problem - ie it creates POV. Even if it makes it easier to navigate, that's a secondary issue, because presenting a neutral point of view is one of the most fundamental principles of Wikipedia, and a shortened filmography, no matter how well reasoned or no matter how many experts contribute to the list, it provides a judgement and a point of view, which we should do everything possible to avoid. The use of a full filmography may not necessarily be policy, but I think it better complies with aspects of Wikipedia that are in fact policy, in relation to POV. I don't think it's perfect, I just think it's preferable. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 11:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a>, my intention in creating theses templates are: coolest layout improving the shape of the article, easing the navigation and the search to common users and short the articles. We don't need all these bytes. Also, the reason to the MAIN filmography is that in many full filmographies just a half have links, because there are many irrelevant films that stay red there for years. But in this special subject here, where all the films are in blue (except one) I think I could do a template with the full filmography (including this red one). If what bores you and the others are, mainly, the main filmography, do you agree with a template with the full one?

<dd>I also prefer the list - as stated above. I said I wouldn't disagree with the template on the basis of POV, as a full listing removes the POV problem, but Machocarioca, I think you have misunderstood my comments as agreement to change to the template. There is no consensus for changing and you have not addressed the comments made by other editors regarding the additional comments in the table being lost because of the template. I noticed that another user changed back to the table and was reverted again, so that makes another person who disagrees. I am going to change it back to the table. I think at this point, we've discussed it enough unless there are new arguments to put forward. It's ok to make a change such as this, but if other editors object to it, you should respect that there is no consensus to change and leave it as it was.

<p>Since Wikipedia is a great place to dispell rumors, I thought it would be good to add the information that the "1/4 Iroquois" rumor is in question.</p>
<p>The first thing that made me curious about this rumor that Jolie's (besides the fact that M. Bertrand does not look half aboriginal) is that you can't really be "fullblood Iroquois," as "<a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroquois.html" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>" isn't a tribe or ethnicity, but rather refers to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Nations_2b99.html" title="Six Nations">Six Nations</a> Confederacy. The fact that the press calls Jolie's mother Iroquois seems to show that they don't know her actual First Nations heritage as there is never any mention of whether <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcheline_Bertrand_7ca9.html" title="Marcheline Bertrand">Marcheline Bertrand</a>'s mother was specifically <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk.html" title="Mohawk">Mohawk</a> or <a href="../../../o/n/e/Oneida.html" title="Oneida">Oneida</a>, etc. I've never heard another Native person say "I'm Iroquois;" that's something one hears non-indigenous people say. Even if someone was mixed <a href="../../../o/n/e/Oneida.html" title="Oneida">Oneida</a>-<a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayuga.html" title="Cayuga">Cayuga</a>-<a href="../../../o/n/o/Onondoga.html" title="Onondoga">Onondoga</a>, you most likely wouldn't call yourself "Iroquois."</p>
<p>However, while the fansite's webmaster I've cited for the information about the rumor being overturned seems to be reputable, I realize it would be good to have the actual source of the <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Voight_026d.html" title="Jon Voight">Jon Voight</a> 2001 statement, so I'll try to track it down unless someone else can find it first.

<dl>
<dd>I would like to see the original source for this, because I never heard the rumor that her Native American background might be made up. On Inside the Actors Studio Jolie said herself that her mother is "part Iroquois Indian"; I don't know whether that means her grandmother was "fullblood Iroquois" as you described it, but she was definitely serious about it. Back in 2000 there was even a news story that Jolie was trying to "reclaim her native American roots" <a href="http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2000-04-25" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2000-04-25" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Would that suggest her parents left her in the dark as well about their little in-joke?

I hate to say it, but just because someone is "definitely serious" about trying to "reclaim her Native American roots" doesn't prove anything; many people hear from their parents lore about some Cherokee princess great-grandmother (i.e. doesn't exist--I hear this all the time) and then assume they are Cherokee. My point about the sketchiness of saying you're "part-Iroquois" isn't about the blood quantum of her grandmother, but that you really can't be "part-Iroquois" as Iroquois does not refer to an ethnicity. The 2001 Jon Voight quote I've read about twice didn't call it an "in-joke" as much as something they made up in fun--to make Marcheline's image seem more exotic for the media. That certainly doesn't sound improbable--lots of people love to do this--"part-Indian" is oh-so-chic. All I'm suggesting is that unless there's some proof other than someone's "serious" sweat-going in 2000, this seems to count as more rumor than fact. It may very well be true, but there has been no supporting evidence, and it's now 2007. Not only that, but the newsshort you've cited sounds totally Hollywood--I mean, "shamanic healing"? Ask most Native people--we don't do shamans. "Multi-ethnic" sweats are quite hip and abound everywhere, as do fake medicine people calling themselves shamans. And wow-- "I just felt so connected to those people but then, at the same time, I'm dark, you know." Huh? Hopefully I can find some better info that will be able to cut the main page.

<b>== Here is a link to that 10/2001 online interview with <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Voight_026d.html" title="Jon Voight">Jon Voight</a> with UK's Telegraph. ==</b></p>
<pre>
 This is where he mentions:
</pre>
<p>"Voight is reluctant to dampen any of her enthusiasms. She recently claimed that she is part Iroquois Indian and campaigned for the tribe to allow her to join them in their "sweat lodge". Voight is quick to say that Angelina is "not seriously Iroquois" and that this is just a little fancy he and Marcheline developed to enhance his ex-wife's exotic background. Still, he insists, "We always liked the idea of her as an Iroquois, and I love that my kids have picked up on that."</p>
<p>He has nothing but praise for her in this interview. His intent in the article is not to argue against her claim, it is just a passing sentence among praise for his children who he calls "the loves of my life" <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2001/10/02/fmjoli02.xml" class="external free" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2001/10/02/fmjoli02.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2001/10/02/fmjoli02.xml</a> <a href="../../../y/v/e/Yvette.html" title="Yvette">Yvette</a> 10:54 5 February 2007</p>

<dd>I'm not sure he tried to imply here that Jolie and her mother had no Native American ancestors at all. I would read it more like they are so minor (1/8, 1/16, ...) that she can't be considered "seriously Iroquois". On top of that, Jolie's mother was apparently working on a documentary about a Native American activist before her death <a href="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/02/06/native_american_activist_s_life_story_re" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/02/06/native_american_activist_s_life_story_re" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, which would also seem surprising, if her ancestry was indeed made up entirely. <a href="../../../j/a/q/User%7EJaqu_ae49.html" title="User:Jaqu">Jaqu</a> 02:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, this would not be "surprising." Why would someone need Native blood to be working on a documentary about a Native activist? (Why would it be surprising for someone without Cambodian blood to do a documentary on a Cambodian activist?) Lots of white people are interested in Native activists; lots of white people are interested in Native Americans, period. I also don't understand interpreting this statement by <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Voight_026d.html" title="Jon Voight">Jon Voight</a>--that she is not "seriously Iroquois"--as meaning she's just part-Native? Last I checked, "serious" is not a word used to describe blood quantum. If we used this word, how would that fit the sentence in the article? "and on her mother's side, she is French-Canadian and not seriously Iroquois." (I love it!) I feel that this interview is plenty of back up to remove the "Iroquois" part from the page completely. This article is supposed to be a model article, so why would we want info on here that is not proven fact? Wouldn't it make more sense to leave out something without proof till it's proved? As it is, this rumor continues to abound on the web; wikipedia should be the last place to endorse that. But because I'm sure people will freak out if this detail was completely removed, I propose that when this article reverts out of its protected status, we change the sentence to merely state:

<dd>This seems a bit excessive to me. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is referring to "controversial material" specifically; I'm not sure if much of the things you removed could be considered controversial. For instance, you removed the source for her pilot license, only to replace it with a citation needed tag - a potentially weak source is still better than no source at all IMHO. The IMDb sources refer to the site's news which are provided by <a href="http://www.wenn.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.wenn.com/" rel="nofollow">WENN</a>, an agency with editorial oversight just as reliable as any other source for celebrity news. Also, I think when evaluating a source the content needs to be considered. Wutheringjolie.com is certainly not a reliable source per se, but it was used as a reference for her various tattoos providing pictures of each of them; being able to look at pictures makes this source just as reliable as a NY Times article for me. <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 13:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to a few sites, Jolie is left-handed...has this ever been discussed/dismissed? IMDB states that she had to have guns specially made for her for the Tomb Raider movie because of this fact, and I also found <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/left.html" class="external free" title="http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/left.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/left.html</a> which has a long list of left-handed actors/actresses. There's quite a few other sources citeable although I'm not too sure about which ones are acceptable as citeable sources so haven't actually added this snippet :-) SmUX 12:25, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If a reputable source can be found regarding the Tomb Raider item (Wikipedia does not consider IMDb trivia to be reliable as it's not verified and is often incorrect), that's worth noting. The fact she's left-handed in and of itself is not particularly notable, but if special consideration needed to be taken as a result for one of her projects, then that is notable. I'm a little skeptical about it, though, since Lara Croft is depicted as shooting twin guns most of the time, and I've never really considered pistols to be "left-hand/right-hand" weapons; someone should be able to shoot the same weapon just as well with either hand. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Likunta on this one. Presumably the passport image originates from an online news source. So all we need to do is cite this source and the birthdate can go back into the article (obviously PhotoBucket isn't a reliable source). It's very possible such a source was originally noted but got lost in the edits. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was not suggesting that the image should be used as a source, I was merely pointing out where I picked up his birthday; I initially thought the BBC story already included his birthday. A reliable source for the date would be <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=255199" class="external text" title="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=255199" rel="nofollow">here</a> for instance.

<dd>I'll split the difference, including the November 2003 as the announced date (per a USA Today link I just found) and acknowledge that some media have a more exact date, citing the Australian link. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I'm from <i>People Magazine</i>. Can you please add a link in the external links section to our Celebrity Central Database at <a href="http://www.people.com" class="external text" title="http://www.people.com" rel="nofollow">People.com</a> ? It has a full biography of Jolie (including a professionally researched timeline), the photo archive from <i>People</i>, and full-text links to all the articles about her which have appeared in <i>People.</i> The link is <a href="http://www.people.com/people/angelina_jolie" class="external free" title="http://www.people.com/people/angelina_jolie" rel="nofollow">http://www.people.com/people/angelina_jolie</a>. Thank you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm opposed to this suggestion. There's nothing wrong with <i>People</i>, but Wikipedia should not be endorsing/advertising commercial sites, nor should Wikipedia be used in such a manner. How does Wikipedia benefit from this? If we link Angelina then we could link virtually any celebrity article (the same question is raised at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritney_Spears_13d7.html" title="Talk:Britney Spears">Talk:Britney Spears</a>) and before we know it Wikipedia becomes a vehicle by which <i>People</i> is advertised. Then, we'd have to fairly link to any other rival sites... I think it would be a huge mistake, and I also think it would contradict <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Links_to_be_avoided" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#Links to be avoided</a> - numbers 3 and 4, and also <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Advertising_and_conflicts_of_interest" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#Advertising and conflicts of interest</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 14:28, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In addition, we have no way of knowing whether or not the message posted above is actually from someone from People magazine. Personally I doubt it because People doesn't need to advertise in this way. In any event, I agree with Rossrs that such a link would go against WP:LINKS. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that an organization like <i>People</i>, who certainly know how to market their product professionally, would take a more direct approach if they wanted to get Wikipedia on board, rather than the haphazard approach of leaving messages on a couple of talk pages. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 21:40, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The article has been locked for several days now and I haven't seen too much additional discussion regarding the edit-war issues from previous. We're not supposed to leave articles locked for extensive periods of time, so what should we do -- unlock it or leave the lock in place awhile longer? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Keeping the page locked won't do much good, I suppose. I'd like to know whether Lilkunta plans to implement his/her changes again right after the protection ends though; apparently Lilkunta still hasn't recognized the length recommendation for the lead section for example. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 23:40, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll wait to see if anyone else chimes in on this. Incidentally it will only go back to semi-protection; for whatever reason this article is a vandalism magnet and as such it should remain locked to unregistered users. Everytime it's unprotected we immediately have to deal with IP vandalism. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:14, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
