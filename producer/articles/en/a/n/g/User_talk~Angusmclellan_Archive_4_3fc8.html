<p>There isn't a more "proper" way than what've you've mentioned. Just download the image from the Wikipedia, then upload it to Commons and lastly, I think you'll have to inform the sysops at the Wikipedia to delete their copy of the image so that the Commons one is shown there as well as other Wikipedias. Here we do it by slapping {{<a href="../../../n/o/w/Template%7ENowCommonsThis_046c.html" title="Template:NowCommonsThis">NowCommonsThis</a>}} on the local copy of the image, but I'm not sure how you'd do it elsewhere. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 14:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>we have a clear letter. If you want davidson to be removed you are the one who should come up with a proper document. not with doubts and suspicion. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 15:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>it is not a treat it is a discription of what you are doing. as you said we need a lot of inprovement in the article. what I dont get is although there are endless weasel words and Pov in this article why are you obsesively removing davidsons name despite the letter.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 13:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>thanks for the edit. I welcome it. just a remark.</p>
<p>about "Based on studies of the the Ottoman census by Justin McCarthy and others, it is said that far fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the relevant areas before the War."</p>
<p>it is not only ottoman census also = ludovic de costenson (1913)= 1.400.000, prof david magie (1914)= 1.479.000. English estimates=1.600.000, And in lousanne treaty Prof magies numbers were used. So it is not only ottoman figures. ottoman figure is 1.294.000. (also the article says in the beginning there were 2 mil. armenians which is beyond the unrecognised (by allies) 1.915.000 number of the patriach.) So i propose the line to be "Based on studies of the the Ottoman census and offically recognised estimates of the era by Justin McCarthy and others, it is said that (far deleted) fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the relevant areas before the War."<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 01:12, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Angus, I believe everyone there, with the obvious exception of Charles Martel, were either French naval or defense ministers. I would think Charles Martel is pretty straightforward.

<p>Hi, Angus. I saw you were involved on the Armenian Genocide page. As you may have noticed, <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">Fadix</a> is a key contributor to the article and has done much to maintain the accuracy and neutrality of the article. Following a dispute with an administrator named <a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInShaneee_cd66.html" title="User talk:InShaneee">InShaneee</a>, he is considering leaving Wikipedia. It involved a report of minor incivility against him, after which, from what I understand, he criticized <a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInShaneee_cd66.html" title="User talk:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> on his talk page and was blocked for 3 days. I think it was too harsh, but at any rate, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page will have a great loss with Fadix' departure. If he leaves permanently, it is necessary to find a replacement for the article--someone neutral and knowledgable who will be actively involved in the article. If you can help in that regard, it would be a major service to the article and to Wikipedia as a whole. Thank you.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 04:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! I intend to expand the existing account of the life of Edward Balliol (and to write a seperate article on the Second War of Scottish Independence). I note that you (and others I assume) have been referring to Donald of Mar as 'Domhnall'. I have never come across this Gaelic form of his name in any of the written sources-all English admittedly-and I would personally choose to follow the convention of using the English form, unless, of course, you can direct me to some contemporary reference? Donald's earldom may have been Gaelic but he was very anglicised in politics and outlook. A personal friend of Edward II, who lived for a considerable period in the English court, he was even suspected of treason by his fellow Scots. Is the Gaelic usage a modern form of linguistic/cultural/political correctness? Should we start referring to King Seamus instead of King James? I hope you do not consider this too trivial but I would like to get this point straight to avoid any confusion in editing and cross-referencing.<a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 05:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the offer on OOB, i might take you up on that.

<dd>In my opinion, the article should use <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingeborg.html" title="Ingeborg">Ingeborg</a> in its name. No reason to have different spellings for persons having essentially the same name. If I may criticize your past edits, it seems you are introducing inconsistent namings into English Wikipedia, and very odd variants of names (better suited in explanatory parts of the article itself), and too much non-English forms. This of course is kin with all diacritics-disputes and so forth.

<p>I reverted your edit for links not because I disagreed with you, but to give others a chance to raise their opinions before going forward. I agree with you the links include many rubbish websites which needs to be eliminated. But I don't think Dr Laciner's article is one of them.

<p>It seems to me that for such a list, the "dead hand of tertiary sources," as you put it, should be dominant. Perhaps a note should be added saying that she was never crowned, and might not be considered queen. But every list of Scottish monarchs I've ever seen includes her, and a list of monarchs should on wikipedia should base itself on the traditional list, not on whether she was actually queen. Note that on the English side of the list, we include a lot of people who <i>aren't</i> on the traditional list - Sweyn Forkbeard, Edgar the Atheling, Matilda, and Jane Grey, as well as someone like Edward V who was never actually crowned. The only questionable king of England not included is Louis VIII of France, who has recently been proposed for inclusion. On the Scottish side, we include Edward Balliol, Lulach, and the aforementioned Amlaig, who I've never heard of before. Why on earth should we include all these people and not include Margaret, who is included in every list I've ever seen? For consistency's sake she should be included. If you'd like to leave a note saying that whether she was actually queen is disputable, since she was never crowned (or whatever), feel free, but she should remain in the list unless we come to an agreement that all the questionable monarchs should go. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 20:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi ... Just a note about the opening paragraph of this article. I believe that the introduction to this article provides insufficient context for those unfamiliar with the subject matter. I am aware that the link goes to the correct place, but an "unfamiliar reader" should not really be expected to navigate away from the page, in order to find where Northumbria is. Please reply to my talk page and let me know what you think to my reasoning.

<dd>Thanks for responding so promptly, but I do think there is a precedence for ancient titles of countries ... see <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a> for example. The article about Britannia has the opening line <i>Britannia was originally the Latin name that the Roman Empire gave to the island of Great Britain and its possessions thereupon. It has since become a national personification of the United Kingdom.</i>, so maybe the Dál Riata articles are correct. I know that these are geography articles, but it seems to me to be the correct way of dealing with names of ancient countries. <span style="font-style:italic;font;color:green;font-weight:bold;">David</span><span style="font;-color:red;font-weight:bold;">Humphreys</span><small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Humphreys_92b8.html" title="User talk:David Humphreys">SPEAK TO ME</a></sup>ABOUT<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Humphreys_0492.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Humphreys">THE THINGS I MESSED UP</a></sub></small> 19:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Ultranet and Mega Foundation have far more in the way of press notifications, yet you label them as vanity-spam (offering no constructive feedback) and tell Triple Nine that if they come up with one additional source (to total 2), you will remove the AfD. I can see the sense of merging The Ultranet with Mega Foundation and it may have been moving in that direction.

<p>Thanks for your support of my position at the above FAC. When I first submitted it I wasn't too sure if I was making an issue out of nothing, but it is now clear that sources from so few authors all from the same background is a significant problem. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 13:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Angus. Despite a whopping victory for the name <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila.html" title="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> on the previous vote, the Polish users have got upset and called yet another vote. They want to get it moved back to the old unpopular name <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_0ac3.html" title="Władysław II Jagiełło">Władysław II Jagiełło</a>.

<dd>OK. Yeah, he and his son badly need bigger/better articles. I was thinking of doing it, but if you have plans, I'll just leave it. What is the article's general jist? I mean, I have the excellent Boardman book <i>Early Stewart Kings</i> which gives him some good coverage, but he was citing Grant alot, so it would probably be stupid to invest too much effort in the article without Grant's work.

<dd>Oh. Thanks. I figured that was a mistake or you were just being modest. BTW, does Duncan say anything about the eldest son of David. Oram writes that David had only one son, but Orderic Vitalis reports the death of an oldest son, s.a. 1124. The page for <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maud%2C_2nd_Countess_of_Huntingdon_643f.html" title="Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon">Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon</a> gives the name as Malcolm, but Orderic doesn't name him.

<p>Most of the stuff at the notice board (at least on the bottom half) is actually WikiProject material anyway, and the Talk page is really being used as a WikiProject talk already!

The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Portal%7EScotland_042a.html" title="Portal:Scotland">Scotland Portal</a> concept is fine (but currently mediocre/undynamic content), but in stasis: it needs a good kick up the jacksie.</p>

<p>Dear Angus; I'm touched that you would still consider asking for my advise. Sincerest apologiest if my **** YOU! post offended, but it WAS meant with delight, as I was so glad to see even one such bio up and running. Sadly, its worse I'm getting. Anyway ...</p>
<p>Regarding orthography; I stuck by that used in Volume 9 of "A New History of Ireland" when compiling lists such as <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Connacht_4f3b.html" title="Kings of Connacht">Kings of Connacht</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Leinster_9899.html" title="Kings of Leinster">Kings of Leinster</a>. Therefore if you can find reference to either candidate in any of these lists then use the form listed because, while differences occour wholesale, in vol. 9 they are at least given in a definitve version (I really better complete and source all such lists).</p>
<p>Both Frank and Daibhi's books are must-reads, but I agree with you in that there should be more. The G&amp;McM books are okay but better has since being written. Will you give me a few days to see what I can come up with? There are two very servicable bios of Brian Boru <i>and</i> Diarmiat MacMurrough in print, plus a host of really brilliant articles dealing partly with them. If you have an email you may wish to give me I will even be able to send you some of the smaller ones as attachements. Its good to know that there is someone like you working away at this.

<p>Would it be helpful if we concentrated on just a few especially significant kings? My own taste would lean towards the High Kings and aspirats from Mael Sechlainn II to Ruairi O Conchobhair. If we could agree upon a reasonable small list of such kings, especially ones who overlap, we may be able to get a great deal done. Can't find the Brian book. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 15:49, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for telling me this. I wasn't even aware of this book's existence. I must go and order it. Is the Scottish stuff of good quality btw? BTW, just got Brendan Smith (ed.), <i>Britain and Ireland, 900-1300: Insular Responses to Medieval European Change</i>; it has some really good articles by the likes of Alfred Smyth, Maire Herbert, Dauvit Broun, Robert Bartlett and others. I'd recommend it. They're conference papers, and so each article is easily digestable in short 1 hour readings, but they're still well referenced.
