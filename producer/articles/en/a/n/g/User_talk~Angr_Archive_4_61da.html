<p>Re: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_North_Wind_and_the_Sun_a0fb.html" title="The North Wind and the Sun">The North Wind and the Sun</a>, i don't quite get what you mean by "its use in phonetic descriptions of languages as an illustration of spoken language." It'd be good if you could give a little elaboration in the article. And by the way, you don't need to include the original text in the article. You could make a link to Wikisource, where the full text for Aesop's Fables (George F. Townsend version) is available.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 12:05, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, i'm sorry but i'd think that the choice of the fable for the use of phonetic illustration is rather hmm... coincidental and (no offense meant) trivial. i'd like to rewrite the article, placing more focus on the moral of the fable (and maybe other relevant info if there's any), mentioning its use to illustrate phonetics only as a side point. What do you think? --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 15:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hope you'd find it ok. Anyway i'd just like to check with you that the first lines of the broad and narrow transcriptions are correct as they are, 'cause the narrow transcription seems to read "The North Wind and <b>a</b> Sun". i'm not familiar with phonetics so forgive me if i'm being silly.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 19:22, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly let me say that I am sorry to have to bother you.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wish to let you know that a recent VFD that you took part in has closed. The result was that 32 people voted to keep all individual bible verses as seperate articles, and 34 voted that they shouldn't (2 abstensions, and 3 votes for both). This is considered by standard policy not to be a consensus decision (although the closing admin stated that it was a consensus to keep them).</p>
<p>Thirdly, the subject has now been put to a survey, so that it may remain open until there is a clear consensus for what appears to be a difficult issue to resolve. You may wish to take part in this survey, and record a similar vote to the one you made at the VFD there. The survey is available at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia%7EBible_verses_f874.html" title="Wikipedia:Bible verses">Wikipedia:Bible verses</a>.</p>

<p>I added another section for "verse-by-verse Biblical analysis should be transwikied to a WikiBible instead of left on Wikipedia with the possible exception of "notable" verses" as something that could take votes *in addition* to votes for other section, so if you support that idea go check it out.

<p>SimonP (the creator of the 100 or so gospel verse articles) has tried to claim that the votes for the "only notable verses" section would include most of the 30,000 verses of the bible because he sees them as notable. To avoid such a POV twisting of the votes, I have added a new section - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bible_verses#Roughly_how_many_verses_are_notable.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bible_verses#Roughly_how_many_verses_are_notable.3F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - for voting on whether the number of notable verses is more like 30,000, or more like 30.

<p>Hi. I probably did get a good taste of Wikipedia inadvertently. I'm still interested, believing basically in democracy. Thanks for welcoming me. It seemed to me we were all talking around in circles with no one answering what I had said. I'm going to bow out of this discussion for the moment. I've got a long list of publications to work through. From now on I will include all references. By the way, there is a confusion here. G&amp;I and the 4 dialects (sounds like a film) are totally unrelated. I espouse the kurgan theory myself, but they are major linguists and ought to get their views well published. We can't just ignore them. As for the dialects, it is not the work of G&amp;I. I got that from Watkins. I liked it, but you are right about it being a controversial subject. I still go with Watkins, however, as I also believe in trying to match archaeology with language, and the dialect scheme is more amenable to that. Watkins went with Gimbutas for a while (in the 4th edition of AHD) but then pulled back on linguistic grounds. He is careful to separate common this or that from any peoples supposed to have spoken it. There may or may not be such peoples. But as I read the articles some of this will be coming out in Wikipedia. I'm only an amateur linguist, you know. I was hoping Wikipedia would help me with it but as it turns out, mutual help seems to be warranted. I think I like that. It will take me a while to catch on to this complicated set of procedures.

<dd>Thanks for your comments; I've made some more changes based on them. About flapping, I think it does occur in quite a lot of British speech (I didn't know about Cockney specifically), but for me (mild Sheffield accent) it seems to be lexically restricted: e.g. a flap in <i>pretty</i> (adverb) seems normal enough, although informal, while a flap in <i>pretty</i> (adjective) feels "American". Something like this seems to be being described for Scouse in this article <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/dwp.linguistics/resources/DWPVOL8/DWP8Watson.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dur.ac.uk/dwp.linguistics/resources/DWPVOL8/DWP8Watson.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 15:06, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I am glad to see one active linguist here&#160;:) There are a lot of linguistic problems (not only related to ex-YU languages) and I am sure that I would ask for help in other cases, too (I think that it is necessary to have some kind of "linguistic consultants" on Meta for problems related to multilingualism).

<p>As I saw, you are very good introduced into Slavic languages (not only to Celtic&#160;:) ) and this can be very helpful. The main problem of articles related to so called "Serbo-Croatian linguistic area" is bad description of language terms with a lot of influence of politics (from 19th century up today for sure). If we forget stories about creating of national identities of Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks and Montenegrins; we still have completely other group of problems which are related to simplification of linguistic geography of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">millosh</a> (<a href="../../../../sr/%D0%BC/%D0%B8/%D0%BB/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80_%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%7E%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%88_e20c.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Разговор_са_корисником:Милош">talk (sr:)</a>) 16:59, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>During communist era in Yugoslavia (1945-1990), political mainstream strongly forced the idea of one "Serbo-Croatian language". Even all standard languages in the last 150 years are Shtokavian-based, "Serbo-Croatian language" included three completely different language systems: Chakavian, Kaykavian and Torlakian. This situation made a lot of mess in contemporary description of <i>spoken languages</i> -- Kaykavian, Chakavian, Shtokavian, Torlakian; as well as in description of <i>standard languages</i> -- Serbo-Croatian, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian (and, possibly Monenegrin in the future). There are a lot of logical errors such as constatations that "standard Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian belongs to standard Serbo-Croatian". --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">millosh</a> (<a href="../../../../sr/%D0%BC/%D0%B8/%D0%BB/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80_%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%7E%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%88_e20c.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Разговор_са_корисником:Милош">talk (sr:)</a>) 16:59, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Myself, I started to study English at the age of six (I think), and I consider myself as having English skills directly comparable to those of a native speaker. When I came across the Babel templates on Wikipedia, that was one possible criterion for User en-N (I see it has been changed since then). I know many other people who could easily pass as native speakers of English, and I believe that 'near-native' is not a sufficient description for their English skills. I think the wording should be changed to 'native' (it used to be like that at some point), <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_en-3_1753.html" title="Template:User en-3">Template:User en-3</a> being perhaps better for 'near-native' speakers), but since you are being cited as an authority on the matter, could you maybe comment on this? - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 19:46, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

In particular, there is a new "language" desk at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_Language_a10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/Language">Wikipedia:Reference desk/Language</a> (or use their shortcuts <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_L_9480.html" title="WP:RD/L">WP:RD/L</a> or <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_LANG_7d7a.html" title="WP:RD/LANG">WP:RD/LANG</a>). It used to be a "grammar desk" but was moved so that it would be a subpage under the reference desk. I'm hoping that it can become a good place for Wikipedians to ask general questions about languages, grammar, foreign languages, et cetera...Do you think you could put it on your watchlist and help out as you see fit? Thanks for your help! --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 15:05, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
