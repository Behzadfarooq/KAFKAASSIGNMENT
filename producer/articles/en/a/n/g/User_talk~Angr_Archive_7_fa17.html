<p>Thanks, Angr, but I already have an account. I am even an admin&#160;:) The only reason I do anonymous edits is because I want to keep my Gaeilge-related endeavors separate from my main personality (although, perhaps, it would be a good idea to create an account just for that). If possible, please delete the talk page with the welcome message after you are done reading it. This IP is not my private one. Thanks again for your willingness to answer my questions--you've been immensely helpful.--204.193.71.8 21:55, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, all right, but the advantages remain the same. You're easier to keep track of with a user name. I can't imagine why you want to keep your Irish-related endeavors separate. I assume you have your reasons, but it seems like you're somehow ashamed of being interested in Irish. Are you known for being a vehement Unionist under your usual name?&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 22:22, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, there is nothing policital to it&#160;:) Being a non-Irish person and having never visited that country, I also have nothing to be ashamed of. The reason is strictly personal; plus, the language fascinates me. If there is one thing I should be ashamed of, it's that less than three months ago I believed that Irish was a dialect of English; one that's different from English, but not much, really. That's the level of ignorance one should be shot for&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Anyway, if I could ask you for another favor. Would you be able to create a {{User ga-0}} template for me, please? While I am slowly learning Irish, my knowledge is definitely not enough to compile that template myself; nor, having studied the language only for a very short time, do I feel I deserve a ga-1 template.

<p>Well, Angr, you moved those injected remarks one notch down, but they still break the thread of the conversation I had had with you. It seems to me that thread should not be broken, because the back-and-forth between you and me is precisely where my reasons for a <b>keep</b> vote (and a <b>censure</b> vote -- not censorship, as the page's attacker erroneously understood) were developed. Those injected remarks are just flames and can be placed at the end of the thread of the discussion between you and me. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 22:46, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is nothing I can do about the fuzziness. The dust jacket pic is from the 60s and the statue of Hatshepsut happens to be toppless, as such I suspect gauze was stretched across the lense to hide her nipples (which are clearly visible on the statue in other pics <a href="http://www.rootgrafix.com/KMT/onions/hatshepsut.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootgrafix.com/KMT/onions/hatshepsut.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) I expect Carnhildo may object again, but I find his objections unreasonable for reasons pointed out by myself and others during the original nomination. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 06:33, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>that wasn't its original source. But that isn't needed because it is widely known. There are various articles without sources. You can go to that region and see the ruins for yourself, that's the best source one can get.&#160;;) Ppl use in here (Portugal/Spain) True Celts to diferenciate in relation to the older (proto-)Celtic origin tribes (there were various ones). It doesnt mean they were the only and true Celts, but among the various Celtic tribes in iberia, they had the Celtic culture variant than one usually attributes to Celts, that is why the Romans knew them as simply Celts while other Celtic tribes were known as Calaeci, for instance.

<p>I would be most grateful if you could express an opinion on the issue I have been discussing at <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic_language.html" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic language</a>.

<dd>Then allow me to clarify! When you delete an image (replacing 'you' with 'Marudubshinki') all pages that it's used on instead of showing you the picture, show you a blue link to the image, which you can't see. Image deletions are permanent in MediaWiki as it's a huge server overload to keep every image, whereas deleting text really just hides it from all non-admins (we admins can still read it, so it takes no less space on the server). I assume you'll still have the image on your computer though, and the only way to really restore it is to re-upload it, and to tell Maru to not do that again. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 10:28, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Angr. Thanks for the warm welcome over in my talk page. Actually, I do have a question: How the heck would I have made a normal reply to it? Looking in <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html#User_talk_pages" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">Wikipedia:Talk_page#User_talk_pages</a> gets me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>To leave a message for another user on their talk page, click the <i>discuss this page</i> link on your sidebar when you view the user page (which you can do by clicking on a user's nickname).</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, I can't find any link with the text "discuss this page" anywhere. Which means I can't find any sidebar. (I presume, then, that "sidebar" does <i>not</i> mean the nav bars that say "navigation" and "toolbox"?) As a long-time Internet user, web developer, etc., I can only think that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm having a total dumbass attack (always a possibility); or</li>
<li>The instructions on replying to user talk-page messages could stand to be a bit more clear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the links you sent me, I'd already seen. Others, I'm reading through now. I trust I haven't already done anything wrong, stupid, or impolite, and these references are just a way of saying "Hi", right?</p>

<p>Hi, thanks again for all your help with the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic_language.html" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic language</a> article. The troubles are currently moving south east, specifically some IP number has added very inaccurate tables of sounds to the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faroese_language.html" title="Faroese language">Faroese language</a> article. I removed it, but feel guilty about it as I am not in a position to produce a better table. I guess these languages are outside your main interest, but if you had the time and were able to find the resources to give good tables that would be great. The Faroese version of the article doesn't really bother to give the IPA values of the sounds and neither does the Danish version although that article is very detailed, and makes me feel I should do a lot more work on the Icelandic article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 14:15, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi. i am wondering if you can give your opinion at <a href="../../../a/b/l/Talk%7EAblaut_9526.html" title="Talk:Ablaut">Talk:Ablaut</a>. There is a difference of opinion between me and 2 other editors.</p>
<p>User:Doric Loon claims that the term <i>ablaut</i> refers to primarily only Indo-European langs and that the term <i>apophony</i> refers to base alternation generallly including non-IE langs.</p>
<p>I claim that <i>ablaut</i> is a more general term that refers to alternation in any language (not solely IE langs) and is therefore synonymous with <i>apophony</i> (for the most part).</p>
<p>Doric Loon wants <a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablaut.html" title="Ablaut">Ablaut</a> to redirect to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_ablaut_94da.html" title="Indo-European ablaut">Indo-European ablaut</a>.

<p>Doric Loon is unhappy that I moved the information in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_ablaut_94da.html" title="Indo-European ablaut">Indo-European ablaut</a> from its original location at <a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablaut.html" title="Ablaut">Ablaut</a> (which is now a redirect).

At <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#When_to_use_categories" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#When_to_use_categories</a> it says that "An article should not be in both a category and its subcategory" which is why I was using "Grammar" and not "Linguistics". Do you think that shouldn't apply in some cases? Thanks. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGailtb_f4c4.html" title="User:Gailtb">Gailtb</a> 07:55, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks! I'm likely to be wrong about some of the specific categorisations I made, but am happy as long as the general principle was ok. My knowledge of the possibilities across all languages is not broad enough to definitively assign many articles to either morphology or syntax so I tended to put them in grammar as a safe option. If productivity can also be used in phonology (my lack of knowledge), then for me it can be categorised as linguistics or as syntax, morphology &amp; phonology. My thinking is that it's ok to put articles in categories where they <i>should</i> be, even if the relevant text isn't yet written. (There may be a policy which says otherwise.)</p>
<p>It was me that added the specification of "grammar" to mean only syntax and morphology - but I was following the existing usage. I have wondered whether the category should be renamed to clarify - "Syntax and morphology" /"Morphology and syntax" /any better idea. What's your opinion?</p>
<p>I further question is about deleting categories. Category:Expletives seems redundant (cf <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProfanity_f11e.html" title="Category:Profanity">Category:Profanity</a>). Also Category:Traditional grammar isn't serving much purpose, although it might have a use in respect of the above discussion. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGailtb_f4c4.html" title="User:Gailtb">Gailtb</a> 17:30, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may well be the most common spelling in popularizations. At any rate it has made its way into some popular computer games which probably accounts for many of the Google hits. The Anglicizations "Nidhoggr" and "Nithhogg" are also reasonably represented on Google. John Lindow uses "Nídhögg", Dronke uses the Old Norse spelling (complete with o-ogonek as usual), Thorpe uses "Nidhögg", Brodeur uses "Nidhöggr", Bellows uses "Nithhogg". I still think "Nidhogg" is probably most common overall which is why I bolded it in the article lead. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur Þorgeirsson</a> 21:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been using the "Níðhöggr" spelling for quite some time in the article. The only reason I didn't move it earlier was that people asked me to refrain from page moves while a naming convention was under consideration. Before I started editing this article it was so inaccurate that in my opinion it would have been better to have no article at all. Thus I feel as if I created the article and the onus should be on other people to request a move on it. I know that's not strictly true, though, so I can understand the view that I'm the one who "wants to make a move".</dd>

<dd>This is just such a horrible waste of time, now I've spent more time trying to defend against people who have never edited the article moving it than I spent writing the article in the first place. If every single page location has to be debated it's very difficult to make progress. Some naming convention that people agree on the interpretaion of is needed. I could accept a lot of things but I have seen no coherent proposals other than my own. "Redirect to <a href="../../../u/e/_/WP%7EUE_8b64.html" title="WP:UE">WP:UE</a>" is absurd and solves nothing since that guideline is very vague (and disputed). I just don't know how to proceed. Maybe I should just fork the project. Maybe I need a break. Keep up the good work, anyhow. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur Þorgeirsson</a> 22:24, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The debate has grown very long by now (and I am most guilty there, having argued the matter at great length) and I could understand if you would like to avoid wading through it all. But if you will assume the task you could perhaps look into the contribution logs of the three most recent voters. Those have 25 edits between them in the last month and almost all of them have to do with voting. I don't think they are sockpuppets or bad faith users and I don't want to make any accusations. I just wonder if their votes should count as much as any other.</dd>

<dd>On a somewhat general note I think that the more general a work is the more likely it is to use ultra-Anglicized forms. Thus a general encyclopedia which only has a brief treatment of, in this example, Norse mythology, may tend towards more Anglicized forms (though Britannica is very inconsistent and sometimes uses even full-blown Old Norse forms). A work which goes into Norse mythology in more detail is more likely to use diacritics.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia already treats Norse mythology in much greater detail than one would expect in a general encyclopedia. This is one reason I feel that more accurate spellings should be used in its article titles. On the other hand I don't mind that Anglicized spellings are used in articles outside the main subject. For example I think that referring to <a href="../../../i/%C3%B0/u/I%C3%B0unn.html" title="Iðunn">Iðunn</a> as "Idunn" or "Ithunn" would be quite alright in the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">Apple</a> article. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur Þorgeirsson</a> 11:47, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yet another North-Germanic topic I'm pestering you with!&#160;:D No, okay, this time I'm not asking you to do anything. I just thought I'd draw your attention to the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Icelandic_9a76.html" title="High Icelandic">High Icelandic</a> article. I know you've participated in conlang-notability discussions in the past so I thought you might be interested. We're having a spot of trouble on how to classify this. It's not so much a conlang as it is a project to create neologisms for Icelandic. It has achieved some notoriety in Iceland and I'd vote to keep it if it were up for AfD (though I may have inclusionist tendencies).
