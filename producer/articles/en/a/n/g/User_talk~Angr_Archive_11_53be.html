<p>When you recorded the consensus to delete, you remarked "I don't know what Furrykef was talking about; this template was not modified after being nominated for deletion." That's true, it wasn't, but the template it was calling upon was. Many of the votes were based on "Not a sister project", referring to the box that was in the template before (which made it look like a sister project). There was only one "delete" vote, arguably two votes, that was/were relevant to a single-line version as opposed to a box. I'm not necessarily saying the deletion was wrongful, but just explaining what I meant. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 18:15, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm concerned about your diagram of the range of the caught-cot merger and northern California. I don't think the Labov et.al. evidence shows that any part of northern California has not participated in the merger except for a handful of speakers who are actually in the city of San Francisco itself. I haven't seen what they published in their printed phonological atlas, but from what I saw at <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1L.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1L.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, I don't think the single anomolous blue point in the City of San Francisco itself is sufficient to draw such a large transitional area in your map.</p>
<p>I can tell you from personal experience that I have never met anyone who was born and raised in the Bay Area who does not have the cot-caught merger. And my personal experience is not one of merely passively observing, but I actually ask people about it. All the time—somewhat to my friends' consternation. Anyway, I think the way your diagram makes a large swath of Northern California around the bay area as a transitional or incosistent area is a bit misleading, as comments on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalifornia_English_0437.html" title="Talk:California English">Talk:California English</a> show. As far as I can tell, everyone in the Bay Area who grew up here has the merger. Of course, I'm not discounting the possibility that there are exceptions—as obviously Labov et.al. have found—but I just think it's a bit misleading to characterize an area of thousands of square miles as being a "transitional or inconistent" area when I think the only evidence for people who don't have the merger is in the City itself, which is only about 50 square miles, and culturally completely unlike anything around it for thousands of miles. Looking at <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1L.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1L.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, I think it is odd that there are no red dots in the Bay Area, because I could personally send them at least 10-15 examples of such people, but I think the fact of the matter is that they have only 3–4 data points for the bay area, which represents around 7 million people, and not one of them is anywhere south or east of San Francisco, where most of the people live. San Jose has been the most populous city in the Bay Area for more than 15 years, but they have not a single data point from San Jose or anywhere near it? Anway, there are tons of people in the area who grew up elsewhere and who do not have the merger, but I'm actually honestly curious to find an example of an unmerged native, but I have had no luck. They must have stumbled upon some real anomolies in their data gathering. Anyway, I don't know exactly what you would do to fix the diagram given that I'm just unpublished anecdotal me, and they're published and presumably well-researched, but I just wanted to mention that I think it's misleading that there's something anomolous in the distribution of the cot-caught merger for that large a swath of Northern Californa. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 17:42, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your point, and the main reason it's such a large swath in the map I made is that I don't have very good graphics software, and it's hard to draw isoglosses by hand with a mouse in Microsoft Paint. As for the data, it's true that ANAE didn't interview subjects from anywhere in NoCal except SF, Sacramento, and Fresno (if that counts as NoCal), and the latter two are firmly within the merged territory. So I admit my map is misleading in suggesting that everywhere from Mendocino to San Luis Obispo and as far inland as Stockton are in the transitional area, when in fact ANAE is completely silent about everything in that area except SF itself. On the other hand, the caption does say, "Unenclosed areas are where speakers are transitional or inconsistent, <b>or for which there are insufficient data</b>", and the latter does apply to the region in question. I doubt that they hit six anomalies in their data-gathering, though, because they were so fussy about who could be a subject (they really looked hard for people who had not only born and bred in the town they were representing but whose parents and grandparents were born and bred there too, if possible). I do notice in the database, however, that the youngest S.F. informant was 39, two were 45 and the other three were between 66 and 72 at the time of the interview, so they might have gotten different results if they had happened to get younger informants. (Contrast this with Bakersfield where there were three subjects, aged 16, 20, and 21 -- that sort of puts the Bakerfield island of the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonological_history_of_the_high_front_vowels.html#pin-pen_merger" title="Phonological history of the high front vowels">pin-pen merger</a> into perspective.) Anyway, about the map, I could try to re-draw it, or if you or another editor you know has good map-drawing software, someone else could re-draw it, or we could remove it and just link to the map at <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1L.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1L.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 18:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Each colored dot represents 6 people? Huh. If I have some time, I'll try to redraw your drawing but making the exceptional area in California more locally confined to the city of San Francisco.

<dd>No, each dot represents one person, and all six were in S.F. itself, even though the map makes it look like there were people in Marin County, too. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 11:48, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Category:Northern Irish Formula One drivers was deleted in accordance with the decision at Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 September 9#Northern Irish. Please do not re-create it under that name. The problem is not with having a category for Formula One drivers from Northern Ireland, but rather with the adjective "Northern Irish", which consensus holds should not be used.

<dl>
<dd>Hi. I have no intention of re-creating the category, but thanks for the personal notification on its demise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On another, not unrelated note: I very much disagree with the lack of use of the adjective "Northern Irish". Its fair enough that consensus was reached. However, I was not part of the debate (which is my tough luck I suppose), and I notice that there were a grand total of three votes - two for and one against - for the renaming of all categories relating to Northern Irish people, places and things. I do not see what the problem is regarding the proper nomenclature and, being Northern Irish myself, I have never known of anyone to object to the adjective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not have a clue as to your personal preference. However, as an admin, I'd like your advice on how to go about creating a new debate and vote to rename all the categories. In such a vote, I will put forward my (logical) reasons for such a change and, as an attempt to remain reasonably objective and fair, I will attempt to make a list of alternatives (obviously including keeping the status quo). I do not think this matter has been given the fair hearing it deserves. To be quite honest, I'm perplexed as to why anyone would object to the term "Northern Irish" in the first place. I feel I have to tell you that I am sincere about this, and not simply trying to start any kind of 'war', or upset Wikipedia. I consider the categories "Northern Ireland" as opposed to "Northern Irish" akin to labelling me a "Northern Irelander", both of which are incorrect usage of the description, and defy Wiki guidelines. I know the guidelines mention exceptions, but I cannot understand why or how this has come about. Anyway - I'll stop blathering now, and look forward to your advice on the matter. Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 00:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I authored most of the Diablo III page, and I was just wondering, is there a way I could find a backup of the source in some kind of log of deleted articles? I promise not to ressurect the article, I just ended up putting more work than I expected into it (I have a passion for such things) and I hate losing information... so I'll keep it in a text doc on my hard drive or something, if possible.

<p>Hi, I see that OrphanBot's message includes the sentence "If you don't indicate the copyright status of the image on the image's description page, using an appropriate copyright tag, it may be deleted some time in the next seven days." That suggests the image will be deleted in no more than seven days' time, which isn't the case. The image will be deleted in no <i>less</i> than seven days' time.

<dd>OrphanBot doesn't always notify the user as soon as the image is tagged as "no source" or "no copyright".

<p>Hi, Angr! I rather hoped this day would never come, but it looks like I am stuck and all my usual research channels are failing me, so you are my last resort&#160;:) As I probably already mentioned a couple million times in the past, I'm learning Irish. My main "textbook" is the Irish People web-based course, but I am slowly (very slowly!) working with the Ó Siahdail's <i>Learning Irish</i>, and am now on Lesson Five. This is where I got stuck. I do not know why, but Lesson Five is where Ó Siahdail introduces future tense for the first time. You know, <i>beidh/ní bheidh/an mbeidh...</i>, <i>beifear/ní bheifear...</i>, etc. The concept is, of course, quite simple, but I am having helluva time trying to determine how these constructs are pronounced. Ó Siadhail does provide pronunciation, but having seen how significantly Cois Fhairrge's dialect can deviate from Standard Irish, I am rather skeptical. You mentioned in the past that you'd be willing to help me out should I have a question that relates to Irish, but not really to Wikipedia. I am wondering if the offer still stands. Pronunciation of the constructs above, as well as of <i>bhíothadh/ní rabhad</i> (past tense), is what I need. Thank you!--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 18:49, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As usual, there's no one single pronunciation used in all dialects, so your best bet is to just learn one acceptable pronunciation and use that. Ó Siadhail's pronunciations aren't used in all parts of Ireland, but they'll certainly be understood everywhere. If I were teaching Irish outside of Ireland, the pronunciations I would recommend are:</dd>

<p>I don't understand how it is that you fail to see anything wrong with the image "Image:MyTesticles.GIF". You stated in your edit summary "no criteria for speedy given," but I had already pointed out in the edit that you reverted that a Fake image source was given, and the image has a totally inappropriate name. You see, I find it hard to believe that these are the uploader's skinned testicles. And I somewhat doubt that he severed and skinned his testicles, removed the epididemis and vas deferens, then used a digital camera to take a photo of them, then uploaded the photo to Wikipedia to release the photo into the public domain.<br />

Cheers. <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 20:01, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know will probably not be able to join us, but all the same: after having collected some users willing to come, I created <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_Berlin_Meeting_504e.html" title="User:Lectonar/Berlin Meeting">this</a> subpage. Would you be so kind and add your ideas? <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 12:55, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angr, I am not sure how I feel about you prodding it. Especially now that I see the little userbox that says you have a doctorate in linguistics. Anyway, I feel the article should stay. This thing is in the IPA and has a symbol. Even though it's not used in any language per se, as I am sure you know, Doctor, blowing raspberries, along with intonation etc., is a... what do they call it... extra-linguistic communication device? In any event, it carries a message, and falls within the uh... broader definition of language, if you will. Besides, there are yet to be manufactured elements at the back of Mendeleev's table, that are theoretical, but not unnotable. Anyway, I am removing PROD. I'd love to hear what you have to say on the subject though. - <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">(T)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">(C)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">(E)</a></strong></font> 00:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angr. I know this was floated before and didn't rouse your enthusiasm, but have a look at<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Indo-European_roots_a3e7.html#Project_proposal" title="Talk:List of Indo-European roots">Talk:List of Indo-European roots#Project proposal</a> and tell us if you see any merit in what's being suggested there.
