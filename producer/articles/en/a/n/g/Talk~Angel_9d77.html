<p>No, no, no, no---no-----with all due respect, user with IP address 66.251.27.92, (and other users too), you cannot use references from possibly biased, angry authors who wrote a book, or an article in the internet. [Specially], since the references provided to you are the preeminent sources on the subject, namely the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a><a href="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=147&amp;letter=Z&amp;search=zoroaster" class="external autonumber" title="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=147&amp;letter=Z&amp;search=zoroaster" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, AND the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> <a href="http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/Z/ZOROASTRIANISM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/Z/ZOROASTRIANISM" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Both sources agree that while the idea of who introduced humanity to monotheism, Zoroastrianism or Judaism still is in debate, what according to them IS [clear], however, is the fact that angelology, demonology, introduction of the Prince of Darkness (the ultimate agent of evil, i.e., Satan) , apocalyptical, and many eschatological ideas were burrowed from Zoroastrianism via the Persian Empire, or at best such ideas [influenced] Judeo-Christian beliefs. Both encyclopedias, as well as, the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americana.html" title="Americana">Americana</a>, among numerous other sources agree on that. So, unless you have sources that are as valid as, or better yet, more valid than the Jewish Encyclopedia, AND the Christian Encyclopedia, you [should not] make edits. When and IF you have sources that supersede the opposing sources mentioned, then you can start an argument in the discussion section first, and wait to see what the consensus may be. In the mean time, I realize you may be frusterated, however, you should read Wikipedia`s policies before you threaten others, and before you may be blocked for possibly vandalism etc. You have to know that, just because you can edit in Wikipedia, it does not mean you can revert articles, so that they will sound more desirable to you. One of your sources--an angry author--states, “Note: Mr. Holding does a good job of debunking Acharya S. who makes a career out of trashing the Christian religion. But he himself is a devout Christian which will make him biased. I present him with no further comment to give the Christian side of the Zoroastrianism debate”. By Lewis Loflin.</p>

<p>There seems to be a bit of an edit war as to whether or not the following lines (or something equivalent to them) should be included in the introduction.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some scholars now believe that humanity was first introduced to angelology as well as demonology, by the Iranian (Persian) prophet Zoroaster, through the Persian Empire, that would later influence Judeo-Christian beliefs.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some scholars have wrongfully assumed that humanity was introduced to angelology as well as demonology through the Zoroastrianist religion. However, it is now clear that the opposite is true, as Zoroastrianism was greatly influenced by the Judeo-Christian faiths during the Persian rule in ancient Palestine, and angelology started appearing in Zoroastrian scripture centuries after the birth of Christ.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Both contain <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> and bias. Various sources have been used to back up these claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Zoroastrian influence: <a href="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=147&amp;letter=Z&amp;search=zoroaster" class="external autonumber" title="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=147&amp;letter=Z&amp;search=zoroaster" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/Z/ZOROASTRIANISM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/Z/ZOROASTRIANISM" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>We need to reach a consensus on what is included, what is not included, and where in the article it should be. My suggestion is to revert the introduction to:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>An angel is an ethereal being found in many religions, whose duties are to assist and serve God or the gods.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And move the section on Zoroastrianism and Judaism and Christianity to a subsection of the article (perhaps <b>Angelology</b>? <b>Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Judaism</b>?) where we can write a balanced, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> section that includes sources both for and against Zoroastrianism. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofjude_9d65.html" title="User:Bookofjude">Jude</a><small>(<a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBookofjude_2dd2.html" title="User talk:Bookofjude">talk</a>,<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bookofjude_5030.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bookofjude">contribs</a>)</small> 00:20, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don`t agree wih that. I feel like the origin of angelology should be mentioned right there in the intro, so that the reader gets a clear picture of its roots. Currently, many don`t know where it came from. I do hope though that we [can] reach a consensus; I really do. I also hope no one was offended by the pro-Zoroastrian statement. As far as I researched they are factually correct. However, I don’t mind changing some words around, but I have a hard time not putting the info itself there, specially, since the sources are a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a>, and an international standard <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a>. I have numerous other sources as well, like authors and some religious books written by scholars such as the Orthodox Christian Francis Bishop, but I figured the encyclopedias were the more authoritative sources. I have to tell you though, it is hard to argue with those sources, don’t you think? I hope we can at least agree on that.

<dd>Hi. Here are some more sources written by Western scholars about the influence of Zoroastrianism on angelology, however, they don’t come nearly close to the references from the encyclopedias previously mentioned. This site has quotes and statements from Western historians <a href="http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/influenc.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/influenc.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>; this second one is from a book written by Kaufmann Kohler A. V. W. Jackson<a href="http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/zor6.htm#1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/zor6.htm#1" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Finally, this last one (for now) is from a book written by the historian Mark Willey<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6315/religion/zorobig.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6315/religion/zorobig.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd><i>I have to tell you though, it is hard to argue with those sources, don’t you think?</i> When there are a hundred sources against it, and a hundred sources for it, it is extremely easy to argue with sources. That is why it's best to just accept that there are multiple view points on the matter and write the article as such, with a balanced section the contains arguments for Zoroastrian influence, and arguments against it. Either way, the introduction of the article is not the place for it. I am very much for moving it to a subsection. Thanks for the sources.

<dd>Yeah but, how many authoritative sources are against it? Cite some of them first please. I am not sure if the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a>, and an international standard <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a>, and <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Americana_2749.html" title="Encyclopedia Americana">Encyclopedia Americana</a> can, or should be disregarded. How many encyclopedias do you know of that are being against these ideas? Democracy sometimes is not a good thing, just because it [may] drown some facts. As far as I can tell the encyclopedias mentioned are the foremost respected ones in the field, and are all written by Jewish and Christian scholars. That makes it immensly credible. <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 01:12, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't researched the topic so besides the sources cited above and a quick google, I'm not going to provide any negative sources. I don't think any sources should be disregarded, even though with extreme bias. From the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources page</a>, <i>However, that a source has strong views is not necessarily a reason not to use it, although editors should avoid using political groups with widely acknowledged extremist views</i>. Credible or not, we still want to have a balanced, well-represented article. I'll write up a subsection and put it up in my userspace so that we can make a decision and reach a consensus about whether or not to have the information in the intro, or the subsection, and what information to include. (PS: Can you please indent your comments? Use&#160;: multiple times. For example, I used it four times on this comment, so your comment, you would use it five times, and my next comment, I would use it six times.) <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofjude_9d65.html" title="User:Bookofjude">Jude</a><small>(<a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBookofjude_2dd2.html" title="User talk:Bookofjude">talk</a>,<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bookofjude_5030.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bookofjude">contribs</a>)</small> 08:44, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly we can move it from the intro section, however, I do believe such a mention should not be burried somewhere in the bottom, we should make a new section perhaps titled origins or roots. And, we should get a consensus to see which point of view to use, thus we can avoid an edit war in that section. We should rephrase the sentence, yet, as I stated we cannot nor should ignore refrences such as the Jewish and Bible Encyclopedias, as well as, many other Encyclopedias that support the pro-Zoroastrian version/influence.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 20:53, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>a) I thought perhaps an <i>Angelology</i> section after the <i>Etymology</i> section.</dd>
<dd>b) In regards to the actual content, we want to be neutral, and using a specific point of view would not be neutral. Having a section which talks about the Zoroastrian influences is a good idea, with sources, but also in that section would be (not necessarily long, and definitely in neutral language) criticisms of Zoroastrian influence, along with sources (I've noted several negative sources down).</dd>
<dd>c) We should not, also, ignore the fact that there has been criticism (though not that the criticism is correct or incorrect); but yes, definitely not ignoring or disregarding the Jewish/Bible Encylopedias.</dd>

<dd>After a quick survey of the article and this conversation, I think that the portion talking about the origins of the philosophy doesn't really belong right in the lead paragraph. As per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> - <i>The lead should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it could stand on its own as a concise version of the article.</i> It seems to me that the precise origin info presented doesn't belong here, but should be moved to a section immediately after the TOC (or after Etymology) about the origins of the philosophy, and that the lead needs rewritten to provide an overview of the entire article. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 08:48, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jude couple of points; first it had nothing to do with Mazdakism, it is only Zoroastrianism. Secondly, we must mention it is believed that the exiled Jews who were freed from Babylon by <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_bb5e.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a> came in contact with the Persian Empire and this may had profound influences on them. Thirdly, if you read the Jewish and BIBLE Encyclopedias they state that the ideas that may have influenced the Jews were one ultimate Good and an ultimate bad, the forces of light vs. the forces of darkness, and the ultimate agent of evil who was dubbed `Prince of Darkness`, known as Ahriman who later bacame Satan. Also, about angelology they were called Yazadas, they were God`s helpers and guardians of `Man`, and they had an hierarchial system. We need to mention that it is according to the Jewish and BIBLE Encyclopedias. Finally, if, and only IF we need to mention that Zoroastrians were the ones who were influence, we should point out that the oldest known Zoroastrian texts date back to before Christianity, because otherwise it would really seems as a kind of off-the-wall allegation.

<dd>Mazdaism actually is Zoroastrianism; Ahura Mazda is the principle deity of that religion, whereas Zoroaster is merely the most prominent prophet.

<dd>No Jude Mazdaism is wrong, and it may be confused with a sub-branch of Zoroastrianism that came about centuries later called Mazdakism. You may study Avesta related articles if you wish.

<p>The article still does not eloborate on the fact that Angels for the first time appeared in Zoroastrianism as God`s helpers, and they had a system of hierarchy that translates into today` angelology. Also, Satan was dubbed the Prince of Darkness, since the religion thought there was a fight between the forces of light and darkness. Finally, please mention that this is according to the Jewish and Bibel Encyclopedias, and when you write that it was the other way around, IF you think this should be written, then in parenthesis we should write; although the oldest Zoroastrian text discovered so far dates back to five centuries before the birth of Christ. In fact Jude, the `Three Wise Men from the East` that appear in our Christmass cards are Zoroastrian priests from Persia.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 21:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><small>Hm, I'm having a quick look at sources, and I've found some timelines wherein the general consensus is the founding of Zoroastrianism at about 1500 BCE. However, in reading the actual section, I'm not sure that it clearly states its purpose:</small></dd>

Hi, actually the era in which it shows Zoroaster possibly lived, and definitely wrote the texts about Angelology dates back not to 1400 BC, rather 500-600 BC. Now, keep in mind, this is the earliest date that texts were found, that mention refrences to angels and demons.

<dd>I've read through that source several times tonight and can find no mention of angelological literature written by Zoroaster dating to 500-600 BC. Either I'm blind, or I'm not looking for the right thing. As it's actually a section <i>on</i> Angelology, I suddenly realised that it would probably be a good idea to include a little about what Angelology actually is, before writing about Zoroastrian influence, so I've added a few sentences and sources to it. I'm quite happy with it so far, and if I can actually find the source about the dating of Angelological literature, I'll add that in; either way, do you think it is suitable enough to go into the article, and for the sentence in the lead paragraph to be removed?<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofjude_9d65.html" title="User:Bookofjude">Jud</a><font color="green">e</font> <small>(<a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBookofjude_2dd2.html" title="User talk:Bookofjude">talk</a>,<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bookofjude_5030.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bookofjude">contribs</a>,<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Bookofjude_1c88.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Bookofjude">email</a>)</small> 12:28, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whether or not Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism (and I think it clearly did) what you cannot claim is that Judaism was the one to influence Zoroastrianism. This is totally unsubstantiated Judeo-Christian apologetic. And the idea that even Christianity influenced Zoroastrian beliefs about Zoroaster is so outrageous, so baseless, we may as well say that the Buddha is based on Jesus too. The paragraph in the article that makes these claim does not even give a citation. I feel that paragraph should be removed immediately.-unsigned 12:43, December 12th, 2006</p>

<p>Ignoring the arguements about Mormons being Christian, I think the section on LDS beliefs should go under Christianity as a sub-section. My arguement is that much of the discussion and examples of Angels in the Christian theology are also believed and taught in the Mormon faith. All of the Biblical refrences are as significant to Mormons as they are to other Christian faiths. The way the article is structured now, it looks like Mormons don't believe or use the Bible as a record of faith, which simply isn't true. 66.151.81.244 22:35, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No angel in the bible has wings or flies, nor are they supernatural beings who are the "medium of God's power". Messenger is a title, much like your mail man is a messenger. Every kind of messenger in the bible was called that, even Elijah. Angels are not tall white males with flowing blonde hair and big wings. This entire article is a practice in copying traditional thought and putting it on paper(electronic in this case). I consider this article wholly incorrect.</p>

<p>Good point... Even Malachi the prophet name meant "My Messenger".</p>
<p>Though I would suggest angles were big... And to be feared... As well it seams the Biblically angels do seam masculine, and never feminine.</p>
<p>The one aspect I love the most is "Hark the Harold Angles Sing, Glory"</p>
<p>Where the Bible says "Luk 2:13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and <b>saying</b>, Luk 2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."</p>

<p>I have changed this slightly, as the wording could sound like Islam has "Allah" instead of "God". This is false and I believe is considered offensive by Muslims. "Allah" means "God". I left wording that keeps the relevent link to the word "Allah". Sukkoth 08:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's incorrect, and that's why I was pointing it out. "God" is used in English by Muslims and Christians to describe God, and "Allah" is used in Arabic by Muslims and Christians to describe God. Muslims claim that the same God that inspired the Bible also inspired the Qur'an, and acknowledge Christianity as a valid religion. Christians however want to believe that Islam is not inspired by God, and pretend that they worship a different God. This is the basis for ignorant prejudice, and that's why I brought it up. I'll get off my soapbox now, because we're not talking about page content anymore. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#AF7817"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahai_star.svg_673a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a2/Bahai_star.svg/20px-Bahai_star.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahai_star.svg_673a.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 00:22, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This paragraph doesn't seem POV to me, but I don't have a great enough understanding to rewrite it:</p>
<p><i>In early Hebrew thought, God appears and speaks directly to individuals (Gn. 3:8, Ex. 12:1). He also intervenes in human affairs, often acting violently and punitively (Gn. 22:ff.; Ex. 4:24, 14:4; 2Sm. 24:1: Ps.78&#160;:31ff.) God's savage nature reflects the mores of a nomadic, conquering tribe whose morality was based on ritual and taboo. Under the influence the prophets and postexilic writers under influence of Zoroastrianism, these earlier conceptions were revised to reflect an ethic based on social justice. A new theodicy explained evil without directly implicating God. As the result, God became both more distant and more merciful. Angels and demons replaced him in his encounters with men, and Satan assumed his destructive powers (cf. 2 Sm. 24:1 with 1 Chr. 21:1)[3].</i></p>

<dd>I looked through the first few Bible references on the page, all of which were correct. After realizing that would be terribly inefficient, I began diffing edits. Thus far, (I've gotten through March) the only edit related to a Bible reference was a clear case of vandalism "2 Samuel" became "Angel", which is not even a book in the Bible. <a href="../../../c/k/n/User%7ECKnapp_d979.html" title="User:CKnapp">CKnapp</a> 01:37, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
