<dd>Oh, I see. Then just add the condition to the "provided that" part. What I do besides tagging an image with a license is include the text of permission on the image descrition page.

<dd>I don't have experience with such discussions as I started, and I expected more editors will join and that we'll actually solve something. So far, there were good points raised, but nothing was solved. Since I'll have to take a longer holiday from regular Wikipedia editing, I'd like to ask you to try to watch this discussion for me and get something solved, if possible. I summarized all the problems I see in the proposal and you may gain more context by reading the links I listed there. Hope you'll do that for me, thanks. ~~<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelix84_a51c.html" title="User:Helix84">helix84</a> 01:24, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, as a member of the foundation, I thank you for all the good work that wikipedia does - it's a great tool. I wondered if you could glance at my user page, <a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonig_Mig_e44a.html" title="User talk:Leonig Mig">User talk:Leonig Mig</a>, and note down your opinion about what has gone on in the last 24 hours.

<p>I know this is probably written down somewhere, but I don't have much time to look for it. An given, your reputation as a walking encyclopedia on wikipedia policy have a question for you. Is it acceptable to use a foreign language as the primary language on a public space on wikipedia? I know its alright on user talk, but what about the Wikipedia space? I am currently under the impression that English should be used as the primary language in all public spaces here. Thanks, in advace.

<ol>
<li>Is it possible or acceptable to upload scans of back covers for CDs, vinyl’s, DVDs, VHS, etc? I have found scans of album covers that have been lost for more than 20 years and I thought that I could upload some back covers of 250 pixels wide in JPEG format. I’m not saying to put these images on the article, but linked it on the description page of the front cover image.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases, back covers have interesting graphics that could be helpful to complement the information provided. I’m not saying that I would upload images for each release I write about. So far I have in mind only two: <i><a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunaire.html" title="Lunaire">Lunaire</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/o/k/Rokk_%C3%AD_Reykjav%C3%ADk_af2a.html" title="Rokk í Reykjavík">Rokk í Reykjavík</a></i>, what do you say?</p>
<ol>
<li>I would also like to know how to categorized EPs. Some websites consider some EPs as singles. But here there are no categories for EPs. We have a category for singles, another for albums, etc. How should I consider them, just as singles? Once I know this, I would be able to link some articles.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Take at look at <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancer_in_the_Dark_ac3d.html" title="Dancer in the Dark">Dancer in the Dark</a></i>. At the bottom of this article you can see a box with the movies by <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_von_Trier_d20e.html" title="Lars von Trier">Lars von Trier</a>. I need to have this kind of box for an Icelandic director named Friðrik Þór Friðriksson, so I thought that I could easily copy the format of that box, but I was wrong. It reads {{Footer_Movies_Lars_von_Trier}}, and I don’t know how to build one for Friðriksson with all his movies. I would be grateful if you could point me on the right direction.</li>

<p>Hi Angela, I know you made Volkan bureaucrat for Turkish Wikipedia but I cannot get in touch w/ him (he didn't get on the site for 3 overmonths now). I PM/emailed other admins and half didn't reply. I'd like you to review the admins for Turkish site and choose another bureaucrat (I suggest Özgür (User:Dbl2010)).</p>
<p>I also would like to be an admin, if you see fit as.</p>

<p>Dear Angela!</p>
<p>An administrator, <a href="../../../../hu/n/y/e/User%7ENyenyec_b0aa.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Nyenyec">Nyenyec</a> blocked me for 24h on 20 jun 13h, now it is 22 jun and he doen't show any purpose to aboish that. I would like to initiate his relay. The detailed facts are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm an editor there with over three hundred own articles, an award what is equivalent with the Wikipedia Barnstar, and as you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaHU.htm" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaHU.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I'm working like a bot. So I can't be a vandal or like this.</li>
<li>Nyenyec says that on his userpage his a deletionist and he has got a dream of Wikipedia, the most reliable lexikon. I'm an inclusionist, and have a lot of argument with him, and I was in his way for many times.</li>
<li>Nyenyec blocked me because of injuring 3revert rule. As I could see in the page history and in the "What links here" page, this rule hadn'd been voted by anyone in hungarian Wikipedia, but it's so disputed (by User:Math). And I must remark this rule is a mania and an old desire of Nyenyec. He din't consult me (I think he injured the rules for administrators, because there is that "a pretious editor can be banned only after consulting and with woting"). I haven't got the slightest idea how the hell he thought that I directly injured 3revert. As I see, he is bossy. Three hungarian editor (<a href="../../../../hu/c/i/m/User%7ECimbalom_1f94.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Cimbalom">hu:User:Cimbalom</a>, <a href="../../../../hu/m/e/s/User%7EMes%C3%BCge_f1be.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Mesüge">hu:User:Mesüge</a>, <a href="../../../../hu/a/n/t/User%7EAnt_c68a.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Ant">hu:User:Ant</a>) left hungarian Wikipedia saying that operations of Nyenyec are awful. There is an active editor (<a href="../../../../hu/m/a/t/User%7EMath_562a.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Math">hu:User:Math</a>) who says the same. And there are two other editors (but they are commonly not "liked" users, someone say they are quasi-trolls: <a href="../../../../hu/a/n/t/User%7EAntifinnugor_9c28.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Antifinnugor">hu:User:Antifinnugor</a> and <a href="../../../../hu/i/g/e/User%7EIGe_ca07.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:IGe">hu:User:IGe</a>).</li>
<li>I ask you to
<ul>
<li>End blocking</li>
<li>To tell me how can I start relaying Nyenyec (I looked for the pages here, but did't find them)</li>
<li>Please tell me if I neeed to start a woting about relaying, or if an administrator was bossing, burocrats here (after discussing that) can put him down (I can't start a voting because of being blocked)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PS. I wrote to Grin, the other administrator but he is busy in general and nowadays come rarely to Wikipedia. So if I waited for him it's possible I will be blocked for days further days, so If you can end blocking, please do that. PS II. I reverted some edits of a quasi-troll and militant anti-religionist, User:Ige on the page <a href="../../../../hu/k/e/r/Kereszt%C3%A9ny_tud%C3%B3sok_n%C3%A9vsora.html" class="extiw" title="hu:Keresztény_tudósok_névsora">hu:Keresztény tudósok névsora</a> (list of christian scientists). But I tried to talk with him on the talk page <a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vita%3AKereszt%C3%A9ny_tud%C3%B3sok_n%C3%A9vsora&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=134609" class="external text" title="http://hu.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vita%3AKereszt%C3%A9ny_tud%C3%B3sok_n%C3%A9vsora&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=134609" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Hello Angela, I was wondering if you have any comment on that fact that Ed Poor has serreptitiously removed you as someone to go to to resolve disputes? Is he trying to disassociate a connection with you for some reason? Anyway here is the same question as I asked it to Ed (he has since removed it from his talk page):</p>
<p>[To Ed Poor]</p>

<dd><i>I became very curious because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ed_Poor&amp;diff=15691701&amp;oldid=15646852" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ed_Poor&amp;diff=15691701&amp;oldid=15646852" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit you made to your user page. So you no longer consider Angela a friend and/or people should no longer go to Angela if they have a dispute with you? If Angela tells you to stop will you keep going now? Why the misleading/misdirecting checkin comment (you removed Angela from the list rather than merely edited Anthere's entry)? Are you trying to remove a connection between you and Angela for some reason? just wondering. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:16, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>No, it's not.

<p>Dear Angela,<br />
I contact you in your quality as a developer re a problem that we experience at the lb-wiki since the first tests with MediaWiki 1.5. started: Whatever language preference one indicates for the user interface, the user interface randomly swaps from that preferred language to English and back. Except the fact that of course the lb-users do not feel very comfortable with these random language swaps, some of our links not situated in the main namespace do no longer work and all our bots are currently down as they can not handle random window title changes.<br />
Can you please help to get this bug fixed or have the present request forwarded to another competent developer? Thanks. --<a href="../../../o/t/e/User%7EOtets_e2e5.html" title="User:Otets">Otets</a> 6 July 2005 20:39 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela,</p>
<p>I am new to Wikipedia, enormously impressed and at the same time disturbed. I don’t suppose I am raising anything new for you but would appreciate your comments.</p>
<p>After reading around and noticing the way that Wikipedia is structured and what is happening in the hierarchy and all the changes since May 04, [when a major new software infrastructure was introduced] it seems to me likely that Wikipedia is being used by western ‘intelligence’ not only to provide a way of keeping under surveillance those who might be troublesome but also of ensuring that in the most important fields of human knowledge and endeavour not only does Wikipedia provide a simple way of staying in touch with developments but, even more insidiously, a way of ensuring that these developments may even, to an extent, be ‘managed’ in a way that is as compatible as possible with western values and interests. NPOV seems as close to a definition of this as anyone is likely to be able to imagine.</p>
<p>I accept that I have no hard 'evidence' whatsoever for this surmise. At the very least, however, it would be a dereliction of duty were CIA, Homeland Security, MI6 and whoever else, not to infiltrate as far as possible and set up whatever mechanisms were possible to be able to track people, groups and movements over 200 languages and involved in discussions on every possible topic of human interest.</p>
<p>But I suggest that it is very unlikely that their involvement is limited in that way. It is more likely that they are supporting the development of Wikipedia and its community in order to be able to keep track of people and developments and foster what they consider to be positive change.</p>
<p>I would be very interested in your comments. I am sending this also to a few others whom I think would have something to add.</p>

<dd>How can you talk about "all the changes since May 04" and at the same time claim to be new to Wikipedia? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> July 9, 2005 02:39 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both are true. I found myself deeply drawn in and read a lot. Who it was who spoke of the software changes I don't remember (I think I could possibly trace if necessary) but whoever it was put a lot of emphasis on that. However the issues I have raised are entirely mine. I have not seen them directly raised in Wikipedia, though they may have been. Fred Bauder has commented on my talk page, but I think he underestimates both the resources now available to the security services and the importance of Wikipedia. Of course, the issue is - even were it to be true, what could/should one do? I suppose I should send this to Daniel Mayer who will know most about the finance (and yes - I am new and such information is open and immediately accessible, which is why I think that trained intelligence people could have a major impact.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thank you for taking the trouble to give me even a brief reply. I will think further.</p>
<p>PS Why does 'Fred Bauder' come up in 'red' not 'blue'? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_Newman_fbec.html" title="User:Jeffrey Newman">Jeffrey Newman</a> 9 July 2005 12:35 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela,</p>
<p>Just to give you a heads-up: The <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> article has been dealing with a persistant vandal/nuisance who wants his original research on the subject to be mentioned one way or another on that page. I have taken the lead in the fight against him, and he considers me to be the vandal because of the regular removal of his material from that article.</p>
<p>I have just told him to report me as the vandal if he really feels that way, and he well may. See <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGravity_bb2a.html" title="Talk:Gravity">talk:gravity</a>. The relevant thread is at the top since I just archived all of the previous material, but it is a long one and you may be best off starting at the bottom of it, where I summarize my case against this individual. (His name is Nigel Cook, but he always edits Wikipedia anonymously.)</p>
<p>So be aware that this issue may be "kicked upstairs" by him, and that it will not be your usual vandalism report. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 8 July 2005 19:18 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela! There is a user in Hungarian Wikipedia, <a href="../../../../hu/i/p/-/User%7Eip-number.com.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:ip-number.com">hu:User:ip-number.com</a> who states that his IP adress is 80.98.42.42. I don't think that, because this is my IP-number at the same time. He wrote some personal articles <a href="../../../../hu/b/%C3%B6/k/b%C3%B6kvers_5b20.html" class="extiw" title="hu:bökvers">hu:bökvers</a> about <a href="../../../../hu/n/y/e/User%7ENyenyec_b0aa.html" class="extiw" title="hu:User:Nyenyec">hu:User:Nyenyec</a> and I don't want to be mixed with him. If I have troubles with someone, I used to tell it to him directly and not to write about him in articles. Is there a possibility for some administrator to check this user and telling me his IP? Thank you. You can write answer to this page. I wrote these anonymously, because I don't want anyone to know my IP. 80.98.42.42 06:52, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be possible for a developer to look up the IP number, but it sounds very much like the person is being purposefully disruptive, so it may be easier to deal with via your normal policies. Has there been any discussion on whether to block this user? Are they making any good edits at all? Would checking their IP actually help if you're sure that's not their IP in the first place? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:58, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Angela,</p>
<p>There is a problem with the interwiki link to the csb wiki. The language name is displayed incorrectly, instead of "Kaszëbscziej", it should be <b>"Kaszëbsczi"</b>. I corrected the php file at:</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/LanguageBn.php" class="external free" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/LanguageBn.php" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/LanguageBn.php</a>,</p>
<p>as well as several other instances of the wrong name on META, but this has had no effect at all. Maybe somebody should just upload the updated file? Yes, I did clean up my browser's cache before asking this&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Could you possibly help me with that, please? Sorry to bother you, but I got no response on META, and after all, this is a "global issue", since it affects all wikipedias that link to csb.

<p>First, congratulations on your election victory!</p>
<p>Second, I'm strongly considering changing my username per <a href="../../../c/h/a/Wikipedia%7EChanging_username_3d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Changing username">Wikipedia:Changing username</a>. My primary reason for doing so is for privacy concerns. However, if there would remain a link of some sort between my (now current but future) old username to the new username, it would be rather pointless. My first question is; would the old username have anything remaining associated with it that would show any link to the username? My second question is; would signed edits I have made to various talk pages using "--~~~~" be changed to the new username as well? Or, would I have to go back and manually change those?</p>

<dd>hallo Angela, well congratulations first, i partake that you won the election? that´s good, because I voted for you (honestly&#160;:-)</dd>

<p>i have a slight problem, maybe you could help me. i am being mobbed and harassed by some anonymous user and it´s really becoming impossible, because there is nothing i can do about it. i was thinking about actually deleting my old profile, and then maybe register as a new user, to shake him off. now since i am relatively new to wikipedia, i am not too familiar with the rules? creating sockpuppets or something like that is an offence, right? so how can i delete my old profile and then register myself with a new one, without breaking any rules? does this work? simply renaming my profile won´t help i think, because that would leave my track as well... dankeschön. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 17:26, 20 July 2005 (UTC) hallo Angela, I send you an email considering my issue, however so far I have not received any response, did it arrive at all? thank you.. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 14:35, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, I nearly didn't notice this message since it wasn't at the end of the page. Secondly, your mail got filtered into the wrong folder since it was German, so I didn't read it straight away. If you don't want there to be any link between your current account and the new one, you'll need to make a new account, otherwise it is trivial for this user to find what your new name is, both by seeing the change in the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" title="Special:Log">logs</a>, and from seeing the name change in the page histories of the pages you edit. If you want to be renamed, with a link between the two names, please request that at <a href="../../../c/u/_/WP%7ECU_027e.html" title="WP:CU">WP:CU</a>. If this user is stalking you, as you suggest, then perhaps you should file a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">request for arbitration</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 18:32, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not terribly surprised that Antares would like to leave behind the track Antares has collected this far. Copy-and-paste moves of articles, creation of deliberate duplicate articles at places Antares (but usually no one else) wants to have as their headings... However, I am confident that if the person behind Antares continues (even without track) similar things, we will detect such, all too easily again. After all, it was rather easy to find (on basis of behavior) that Antares apparently has had at least two other usernames: User:at33 and User:Bhinneka. My intention is not to make this any sort of RfC or request for banning, as I believe the community will keep Antares' extremer schemes in check (though with a lot of work necessitated to that, sadly). Perhaps it is however good to understand why some ones would like to leave their track behind. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 18:15, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your advice. Since you've been voted into the Wikimedia Foundation, I'd like to ask how I can discuss about measures against vandalism. I've personally been the target of vandalism vendettas because I spoke out against them, and I found this a problem with Wikipedia that needs to be solved. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:41, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i noticed that you blocked "134.161.244.89" for violating 3rr, but failed to block the following, who also violated 3rr on the very same article:Texture, Canderson7,Gamaliel,Billroy88,Rhobite,Gabrielsimon. If you are an admin, you should fairly and evenly enforce all rules.</p>

<p>Take a look at their edits that day. They did EXACTLY the same thing "134.161.244.89" did, namely remove comentary that they did not agree with. If you say what they did was not vandalism, then "134.161.244.89" is exonerated too, as all he did was remove the biased revisions of others, who violated the 3rr as well. By blocking the one and not the other, you are being very biased, and bias has NO place on wikipedia.</p>

<p>I'm <a href="../../../../es/e/c/e/Usuario%7Eecelan.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:ecelan">es:Usuario:ecelan</a>, from the Wikipedia, the one who is blocked on the <a href="http://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/Usuario_Discusi%C3%B3n:Ecelan" class="external text" title="http://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/Usuario_Discusi%C3%B3n:Ecelan" rel="nofollow">Wikcionario</a>. I can log on the Spanish Wikipedia without problems so I don't think it has to do with proxys.</p>
<p>At the begining I thought it was because my user was ecelan, so I told a <i>bibliotecario</i> to change it to Ecelan. But it didn't work.</p>
<p>When I try to log on I get following message: <i>No existe ningún usuario llamado "Ecelan". Asegúrate de que lo has escrito correctamente, o usa el formulario de abajo para crear una nueva cuenta de usuario.</i></p>
<p>Free translation: There is no user called Ecelan. Make sure that you have written it correctly or use the form lower down to create a new account. But my user does exist: <a href="http://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/Usuario:ecelan" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/Usuario:ecelan" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>And it's not a question of a wrong password. I have the same password for all wikis and it works on all the other. I get the same message when I try to get my password on the mail.</p>
<p>Well hope you can help me. Thanks for your time. <a href="../../../../es/e/c/e/Usuario%7Eecelan.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:ecelan">es:Usuario:ecelan</a></p>

<p>Do you either advise about or take care of matters of the folloing sort: I think that <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">User:Deb</a> has misused sysop privileges by <b>protecting</b> the page <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Catherine_Grey_f9b2.html" title="Lady Catherine Grey">Lady Catherine Grey</a> after herself twice moving the article from its original location "Catherine Grey" to her this new location. She admits having done the protection, after her own second move (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJtdirl&amp;diff=19381941&amp;oldid=19331143" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJtdirl&amp;diff=19381941&amp;oldid=19331143" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJtdirl&amp;diff=19381941&amp;oldid=19331143</a>). The renaming history is recent and is available easily at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Catherine_Grey&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Catherine_Grey&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Catherine_Grey&amp;action=history</a><br />
My impression is that Deb deliberately and knowingly uses the admin power in this "content dispute" to push her own opinion onto others. The article had been in its old location for long time, apparently years. Its (first) renaming came only very recently, made by Deb. Rather disturbingly, Deb had not bothered to discuss her intention to move at the discussion <a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECatherine_Grey_93d9.html" title="Talk:Catherine Grey">Talk:Catherine Grey</a> before her first renaming (there was e.g no vote), and she did not properly discuss it even before her second move. (Relevant naming conventions are saying things that "Catherine Grey" is acceptable and the heading needs not necessarily be "Lady Catherine Grey": there are two conditions in naming convention for putting "lady", both requirements should be fulfilled. There is thus content dispute, and its <b>outcome</b> is actually not relevant to decide whether Deb abused the admin powers. I am for the old heading, and I believe it to be the more correct one.) One small point is that apparently Deb had not made any contribution to the article before her renaming - this speaks of an editor who is focused on, not <b>content</b> of this article, but making her own version of <b>form</b> to prevail.<br />
I have also earlier came to see Deb's actions and style of comments. She shows a pattern of not being capable of presenting reasons, and she seems to read policies and conventions in a loose manner, not fully grasping what such guideline actually says. Deb appears to not want to answer properly, substantively, to questions or to presented arguments, rather she gives sort of platitudes. An example is "...were agreed before you arrived" which implies an attempt to prevail by some sort of seniority (though, figuratively speaking, seniority could also be e.g senility).<br />
Anyway, Deb's said action in protecting a page she had herself been warring over seems to be such a misuse that deserves some work. May I leave this matter to the capable hands in higher administration of WP. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 10:26, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you think it's a problem, you could try mentioning it at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, but if the real problem is that the page isn't where you want it to be rather than the fact it's protected against moves, then discussing this on the talk page or at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> <i>before</i> moving it would be better. I see no harm in protecting the page until this is resolved, and though I'd rather Deb hadn't protected it herself, I'd be likely to protect it now if she hadn't, as would any other admin wanting to prevent a harmful move war. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 21:50, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In categories. Did you decide on how you'd like things there? According to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theorem.html" title="Theorem">theorem</a> article, those two are different/distinct things. One argues from axioms, the other makes models and attempts to predict things. Yeah, they both should probably be cross-linked because most people (myself included) are probably not likely to always be aware of the difference (I hope to be from now on...). Anyways you changed some things, then reverted some of them back - did you come to a conclusion?<br />

<p>Angela, I am under attack by a group of editors here in the US. One, <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> has agreed to mediation. As I seek an unbiased mediator I find very few choices. I would like a person with no ties to the issue and a positive attitude. Your profile indicates these qualities. If Wikipedia is to be a success it needs to have input by all. I have had to seek protection for the page twice. Please help resolve this issue. Sincere thanks. The page is "Ted Kennedy". The issue is the validity of a website link. I am the "anon", Perhaps we could all resolve this in an AOL chat room? I will understand if you do not have time for this.

Hi Angela, Thanks for your help. I did request and was assisted by <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>. She provided much wisdom and made some terrific suggestions. However, the group of editors which forces their opinion on others will not negociate. Even if I was to request mediation it would not help as each editor demands to be considered as a seperate entity, except when it helps them to claim they are a group. I can see that the Wiki concept is doomed to fail. The system of checks and balances is missing critical elements. It reminds me of Nazi Germany. (I don't mean to offend you, I see you are in Berlin now) I have read military history at lenght. It is quite possible that the will of a few can be forced upon others, with horrible results. That I am the only person who seeks your help in these matters in no way shows I am the only person affected. To the contrary, it is often a single person who reflects the views of many. Best to you with Wiki, I have not given up on it...perhaps some day it will be better organized and have a chance to achieve its goals.</p>

It is my suspicion that <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">User:Wyss</a> and his alter ego <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">User:Ted Wilkes</a> are identical with <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">User:DW</a> and his many accounts which have all been hard banned in the past. As Wyss so strongly urges that a sockpuppet test be run as soon as possible on his account and that of Ted Wilkes, you may know that it's easy to disguise one's IP address by using an anonymizer. It's also possible to come in from different IP addresses and post something different at nearly the same time. You only need to use two different personal computers sharing the Internet connection through different Internet service providers. If I am right that users Wyss and Ted Wilkes are identical with <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">User:DW</a> and his many aliases who in the past had repeatedly been hard banned, then he certainly would have made arrangements to easily withstand such a sockpuppet test. What makes me so certain that these users are identical?</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../j/i/l/User%7EJillandJack_8cdc.html" title="User:JillandJack">User:JillandJack</a>, an alias of DW, whose account was banned by Adam Bishop and you in February 2005, has created the biased article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bret_1acb.html" title="David Bret">David Bret</a>, which in its first version, I am sure, was only written in order to cast aspersions on this biographer, who, in his book on Elvis Presley, had stated that Elvis may have been gay. See also <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDavid_Bret_e926.html" title="Talk:David Bret">Talk:David Bret</a>. Significantly, Ted Wilkes was the only user who repeatedly reverted all my contributions, which made the article more neutral, to the biased edit by JillandJack. See history of the said page. Ted Wilkes even ignored what administrator <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">User:DropDeadGorgias</a> said on the discussion page, namely, that my version of the page is far less POV than the one by JillandJack he stubbornly preferred.</li>
<li>User Wyss used similar arguments as Ted Wilkes presented some weeks ago to suppress my contributions to the articles on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Adams_3506.html" title="Nick Adams">Nick Adams</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Wood_6dd2.html" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a>. He repeatedly deleted these contributions.</li>
<li>Ted Wilkes frequently accused me of being a vandal, a troll, etc. Significantly, the following sentence can be found on <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">User:Wyss</a>'s page: "I think the Internet trolls inhabiting Wikipedia are its biggest weakness since they stir up unhelpful vandalism and sabotage throughout helpful anarchy."</li>
<li>On the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENatalie_Wood_ef63.html" title="Talk:Natalie Wood">Talk:Natalie Wood</a> page user Wyss even accuses me of an alleged "standard tactic of trying to wear me down with repetition of mostly factual but slightly distorted material." This is remarkably similar to what Ted Wilkes says on the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENick_Adams_3fe6.html" title="Talk:Nick Adams">Talk:Nick Adams</a> page: "This is the 'wear them down' tactic that they have successfully used over and over with others who objected to false and unfounded claims on the Presley page, doing it so many times that the other users eventually gave up."</li>
<li>As a reply to administrator <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a>'s comment on the <a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis">User talk:Mel Etitis</a> page, Wyss has written: "You clearly haven't read that link yourself. Why didn't you bother to check it? Maybe because you're so busy as a new Wikipedia:Admin?" This sounds very similar to flamings by Ted Wilkes. I only mention his reply to administrator Mel Etitis: "Yet again I have to request that you <b>read</b> facts and know what you are talking about before commenting. I suggest, since this matter is in the hands of Wikipedia:Mediator Ed Poor, that it might be best for you to refrain from further comments and not interfere in the process." For the stubbornness of user Ted Wilkes, see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#David_Bret" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#David_Bret" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
<li>User Wyss called administrator Mel Etitis "dearest troll". On the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENatalie_Wood_ef63.html" title="Talk:Natalie Wood">Talk:Natalie Wood</a> page, administrator Mel Etitis said: "it does seem to me that the anon is right in thinking that there's a good deal of circumstantial evidence that suggests a strong link between you [i.e. Wyss] and Ted Wilkes (talk • contribs) — similar styles, even to your user pages, similar aggressive and short-tempered approach to other users, etc., not to mention the very similar comments and editing interests. We could settle it by asking for a sock-puppet check, but so far as I can tell, if you are using both accounts, you haven't used them for nefarious purposes, so I have no desire to bother a developer. ... The suggestion that you have a second account isn't an accusation, as it wouldn't be against Wikipedia policy for you to have one — there's only be a problem if you used the two in certain ways. Intriguing though it is that you've brought this irrelevant debate here rather than discussing the article, I must decline to be distracted by it. ... With regard to the relevant issues – the anon. editor's addition – I held (and still hold) that Wyss's deletion of a large chunk of text was unjustified. ... The material seems to be adequately sourced; Wyss's only reason for deleting it all is aesthetic; that isn't adequate grounds for his behaviour according to Wikipedia policy."</li>
</ol>
<p>To my mind, Ted Wilkes seems to have many further accounts, for example, <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightCrawler_eab6.html" title="User:NightCrawler">User:NightCrawler</a>, or <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Schalike_f2d6.html" title="User:Karl Schalike">User:Karl Schalike</a>, and also posted anonymously as User:66.61.69.65, User:24.165.212.202 and User:82.40.81.132, etc. 80.141.237.77 03:16, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see no reason to think <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> is <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">DW</a>, and I've had a lot of experience with DW, having blocked Nightcrawler, Angelique, JillandJack, and maybe others I've forgotten about. I also have no reason to believe Wyss is <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">Ted Wilkes</a>. I've not looked into whether Ted is DW, but since <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._Lafontaine_9929.html" title="User:A. Lafontaine">A. Lafontaine</a> is <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Bishop_archive4_7729.html#User:A._Lafontaine" title="User talk:Adam Bishop/archive4">suspected</a> as being DW, I doubt Ted Wilkes is him as well. If Ted was 66.61.69.65, isn't he talking to himself on <a href="../../../e/l/v/Talk%7EElvis_Presley_f65c.html" title="Talk:Elvis Presley">Talk:Elvis Presley</a>? Seems unlikely. I can't see why you'd think those IPs were the same user. 82.40.81.132 is Telewest in Scotland and 24.165.212.202 is a Roadrunner IP in Virginia. Neither of those seem to be an open proxy. Also, DW didn't use proxies as far as I remember. Whenever IP checks were done on him, it showed he was in Elliot Lake. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:52, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you very much. Maybe my claims are ungrounded that Ted Wilkes and Wyss are identical, though there is a fair amount of suspicion because of the similar aggressive approach to me, the similar comments and editing interests, etc. (see above). Is this mere accident? OK, it may also be possible that there are two (or more?) Elvis fans knowing each other and therefore working together in reverting what I have written. On the other hand, it could well be that Ted was talking to himself on the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Talk%7EElvis_Presley_f65c.html" title="Talk:Elvis Presley">Talk:Elvis Presley</a> page. The three IPs I have mentioned were all deleting my contributions to the same discussion page, as administrator <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> pointed out in April. He said,

<dd>To my mind, at least Ted Wilkes may be JillandJack, as he repeatedly reverted all my contributions to the biased text written by JillandJack.

<p>Angela, congratulations on your board election. Although I am new and could not vote, you seem to have the passion, drive and appear to have made quite a contribution to the Wikimedia projects. I have been watching the Wikimedia project for some time and am now starting to contribute in the area of business (we're working on a new Economics, Business and Finance Portal). The reason I'm leaving a message is to see if I could start a dialogue with you or another board member about a couple of topics. First, I would like to talk about fund raising and development. I would like to learn about sustaining membership, so I might personally be able to contribute financial support. Second, I would like to learn about starting a chapter in Ann Arbor, MI (it may just be supporting the US chapter if that gets off the ground). Lastly, I wouldl like to know if any member of the Wikimedia board has spent any time with Proquest. I believe I may be able to learn if Proquest could somehow contribute. In general, my skill is raising money and I would like to see if I can help the Wikimedia projects. Unfortunately, I have some meetings planned or I would try to attend the conference in Frankfurt. I look forward to hearing from you. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonreed_1f27.html" title="User:Ronreed">Ronreed</a> 15:55, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela. Do you know anything about the Wikimedia portal, <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">wikimedia.org</a>? Is it possible for mere mortals to edit that page? Perhaps the code there is generated by some wiki-template somewhere? I'd like to fix the logo links, but I don't know how.

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>could you check why my IP of 62.238.255.224 (proxy IP of my ISP) has been blocked? This doesn't seem to be a block against me, but some generalized block against IP addresses in some range for other reasons. I can still log in using another ISP under my own username. I can't log in using the ISP I normally use, also not if I don't use the proxy server. My computer IP is close to 62.238.255.224, so I guess that some range of IP's has been blocked. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 16:52, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

The problem seems to have been solved now. I couldn't visit wikipedia for a period of about 24 hours using my regular ISP.</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Remember me&#160;?</p>
<p>Could I ask your advice?</p>
<p>This may or may not refer to wikipedia but your metaphorical home as well.</p>
<p>Let us say a kid wants to play in sandbox but is polite and does not break any rules. I expect the kid to grow up eventually in the mean time, he spends his time in almost entirely in the Sandbox.</p>
<p>However he went to far and accidentally destroyed part of it. He doesn't contribute anything though and so the anti-fun bullies (trolls) totally ban him forever from the premises. Is this Ok? Could I ask your comment?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I have received a personal e-mail from <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">User:Plautus satire</a>, complaining that <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">User:Raul654</a> has banned him and protected his talk page. He's written to me asking for Raul's decision to be reversed.</p>
<p>I have never heard from this user before and know nothing about his/her history, and I hesitate to countermand a decision of a fellow-admin when I don't know what's going on. I know you're busy, so I hope you'll forgive me for referring the problem (if it is one) to you. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 04:33, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think what defines "encyclopedic" is a little vague, but I'm not arguing that it necessarily should be on Wikipedia, just on one of the projects; I think this is the point of what I've been saying: most people are for moving it to some other project, they believe it belongs on Wikimedia somewhere, just not on _____. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 04:38, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</span></p>

<dd>Rq. temp de-adminship. Per comments on my talk. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 18:27, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like clarification on this de-adminship. This request is due to administrative misconduct (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Stevertigo_2aed.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Stevertigo">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Stevertigo</a>) and not a bureaucratic reason (away for extended period of time, etc.). Therefore, it seems sensible than in order to regain adminship, it would be necssary to reapply through Request for Adminship. Since adminship is based on the trust of the community, it should be the community that would return admin rights (in this particular case). I'm especially concerned that a bureaucrat would seek to grant admin status to Stevertigo in the near future despite the community lacking trust (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;diff=20546068&amp;oldid=20540347" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;diff=20546068&amp;oldid=20540347" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 22:03, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with Carbonite. While several users have expressed distrust of Steve, many of that is in the heat of the moment, and there is no obvious consensus that he should be deadminned. I find it commendable that he voluntarily asks for a temporary deadminning, and since it's voluntarily it can be reinstated once things cool down. Unless, of course, ArbCom decides otherwise. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 07:59, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main issue is that I don't believe Steve really thinks he did anything wrong. His response on the RfC was sarcastic and dismissive. There has never been an apology or acknowledgment of misconduct. I don't find it commendable that he asked for temp de-adminship. Temporary removal of admin rights is something you might request when you're going on an extended vacation and want to lessen the security risk (in case someone hacked your account). When we support a user for RfA, it is on the assumption that they will not abuse their admin rights. Steve has violated multiple policies with multiple users and doesn't seem to believe it's really his fault.</dd>

<dd>To put it bluntly: This is the most blatant and clear case of admin abuse I've ever seen. If Steve's actions aren't grounds for reapplication, what sort of abuse would be necessary? I'm sorry if I seem so worked up about this, but admin abuse can not be tolerated. Perhaps it is unclear whether there's a true consensus to de-admin. That's why a reapplication should be necessary. If Steve has 80% support of the community, I'll let this matter rest. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 10:26, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't been figure out quite where to put an announcement about WP. The Wikipedia has been named Best Community Site as an Editors' Choice in the August '05 issue of Linux Journal.</p>

<p>A,</p>
<p>As far as I know, Linux Journal puts non current issues on line, but I don't know the delay time for the current issue. I think the award is significant since the Journal is a very technical one, and not prone to PR gratuitousness (sp?).</p>
<p>I've also been seeing mention of WP, as an authoritative reference, in various places including the New York Times. We are making PROGRESS!</p>
