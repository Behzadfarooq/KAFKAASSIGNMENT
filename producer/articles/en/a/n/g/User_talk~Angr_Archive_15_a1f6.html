<p>You appear to have a character in your signature that displays as "?" on my computer. Unfortunately, this means that whenever I edit a Talk page with your signature in it, your weird character is replaced with a question mark. I have gone through and laboriously copied your signature from the old version to the new version in an attempt to maintain the integrity of your signature, but this is an extraordinary amount of work just to maintain a nonstandard character in someone's signature on a Talk page, and I probably won't do it again. I am open to suggestions on how to leave your signature intact without it taking 20 minutes of my time to do so. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/b/l/User_talk%7EBblackmoor_cd2b.html" title="User talk:Bblackmoor">(talk)</a></small></sup> 02:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess you're referring to the phonetic character I used to have in my signature. Don't worry about keeping it intact; the link to my talk page will still work even if it displays as "(t?k)". Anyway, I don't use that signature anymore. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 07:20, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay. I mainly wanted you to know that I at least <i>tried</i> to keep your signature intact, in case I was unsuccessful and you noticed it later.

<p>Hello Angr, I realize now why you were inclined to swap this image out. I've properly sourced the image and provided a link on the image.

<dd>Well, the editors of Wikipedia. If you want to use the {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}} template, though, you <i>have</i> to provide a detailed fair use rationale, which in this case will have to include why the public domain image isn't good enough. And as I said on the talk page, arguing that the FU image is better just because it shows her in parliament really isn't good enough. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 15:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Angr,</p>
<p>Is there a particular reason why you deleted Chris Tucker's picture from his page? If there is, do you have another one to replace it? Dinobrya</p>
<dl>
<dd>The image did not have a copyright tag, and had been marked as lacking a copyright tag for more than a week. When you upload images, you need to include copyright information, including a fair use rationale if the image isn't free. Also, it's a good idea to keep images you upload on your watchlist so you can see if they get tagged for any reason. I'm afraid I don't have another image of him. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 07:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nothing personal, it would be a good idea next time to simply make it known on the discussion page instead of removing the picture without notice and without being prepared to offer another picture. How about the courtesy of looking for the tag information? It took a lot of work to find that picture. User:Dinobrya</p>
<dl>
<dd>The thing is, there are hundreds of such images to be removed every day. When admins go through the various categories of images that are improperly tagged and/or sourced, we really don't have time to discuss it on the talk page and find another image, nor is that our responsibility. It's the responsibility of the uploader to follow the rules, which are clearly written in a big colorful box when you go to upload an image. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 06:07, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on your comments on various talk pages, you seem to know a reasonable amount about English vowels, so I'm wondering whether you have any comments about the fact that in Australian English, the word <i>gone</i> is the only morpheme in the entire vocabulary that contains a long ɔː rather than a short ɔ (as in <i>gondalier</i>). Is this curious fact mentioned anywhere on Wikipedia, and if not, do you think it should be? (There are no minimal pairs, although I personally am in the habit of using gɔn for <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonne.html" title="Gonne">gonne</a>, which means there is sort of a minimal pair in my idiolect). It has always struck me as interesting that there can be arguably-phonological splits for which only one example exists in the lexicon, which many amateur linguists find counterintuitive. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerrakhi_27f4.html" title="User:Zerrakhi">Zerrakhi</a> 06:57, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The only word in the entire vocabulary? What about words belonging to Wells's lexical sets THOUGHT, NORTH, and FORCE? At any rate, it can certainly be included if it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by means of published, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, not if the only evidence for it is that a number of Australian Wikipedians confirm it to be true. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 07:09, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only word other than derivatives ("goner"), yes: the phonemes in <i>thought</i>, <i>north</i> and <i>force</i> are all /oː/ rather than /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɔː</span>/. I've found some statements on Wikipedia that give support to the observation without explicitely confirming it:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonological_history_of_the_low_back_vowels.html#Lot-cloth_split" title="Phonological history of the low back vowels">Phonological_history_of_the_low_back_vowels#Lot-cloth_split</a> states that "The lot-cloth split is the result of a late seventeenth-century sound change that lengthened /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɒ</span>/ to [<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɒː</span>] before voiceless fricatives, and also before /n/ in the word gone".</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_phonology_5bbd.html" title="Australian English phonology">Australian_English_phonology</a> states that, "Historically Australian English also had the same lengthening of /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɔ</span>/ before unvoiced fricatives, but, like the English accents, this has since been reversed".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Putting these two statements together, the explanation would appear to be that only the unvoiced fricatives were affected by the reversal, while the word <i>gone</i> was not. Which is certainly very interesting, and makes me wonder why <i>gone</i> was affected by the seventeenth-century development if it otherwise only affected the position before unvoiced fricatives. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerrakhi_27f4.html" title="User:Zerrakhi">Zerrakhi</a> 08:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't know, but it's true that in non-COT-CAUGHT-merging American accents, <i>gone</i> has the THOUGHT vowel (it rhymes with <i>dawn</i>), making it a member of Wells's CLOTH set (words that have the LOT vowel in RP but the THOUGHT vowel in General American). Most CLOTH words have historical short o followed by a voiceless fricative or in some cases (<i>dog</i>, <i>log</i>, <i>hog</i>) /g/. <i>Gone</i> is the only CLOTH word where the consonant after the short o is /n/, except that some American accents also have the THOUGHT vowel in stressed pronunciations of <i>on</i>. The "on line" is a fairly famous isogloss in American dialectology; accents north of the line rhyme <i>gone</i> with <i>John</i>, accents south of the line rhyme <i>gone</i> with <i>dawn</i>. But it's becoming less and less important as the <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cot-caught_merger.html" title="Cot-caught merger">cot-caught merger</a> advances; for about 40% (and growing) of American English speakers <i>John</i> and <i>dawn</i> rhyme with each other anyway, so <i>gone</i> clearly rhymes with both. At any rate, <i>gone</i> is an unusual CLOTH word in American English, and it's probably not a coincidence that it's weird in Australian English as well. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 08:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for sorting out the picture on my homepage. I would like to change the caption but don't know how! If you want, could you please change it to something like 'Temple at Manjushri Centre, England, NKT Spring Festival, May 2006'.

<p>Thank you very much for your guidance on the copyright issue. I seriously consider this problem and I inquired the website editors -- my fellow Falun Gong practitioners. They said they are not clear about copyright but it is free to use on wikipedia by practitioners including me and a credit to the website is requested. But I did not get an official reply in writing yet. And since all website contributors are volunteers, I am not sure when I can get a reply.</p>
<p>Here is the English version of photo.minghui.org --: <a href="http://photo.minghui.org/photo/Eindex.htm" class="external free" title="http://photo.minghui.org/photo/Eindex.htm" rel="nofollow">http://photo.minghui.org/photo/Eindex.htm</a> These websites are collections of photos from www.minghui.org whose English website is www.clearwisdom.net</p>
<p>www.clearwisdom.net (www.minghui.org) is one of the websites maintained by volunteers consisting of Falun Gong practitioners. All the cost of the websites are covered by the volunteers and all the editors are the volunteers. One of the lefthand sidebar menu item is <b>Photo archive</b>.

<p>The photo I uploaded was a photo of a drawing drawn by a Falun Gong practitioner in Mainland China. The name of the author is not given since</p>
<ol>
<li>Practitioners are taught not to pursue fame according to Falun Gong teachings.</li>
<li>Releasing the name is not safe to that practitioner since s/he is in Mainland China. The website is public so police may arrest the practitioner after knowing the name.</li>

<p>I am sorry that this same photo is not translated to the English version of minghui.org yet.</p>
<p>I wonder if this photo could be labeled as fairuse instead if I am not very sure about the copyright. But this photo is currently only used in my user page, not an article page. So I don't know if this belongs to fairuse category?</p>
<p>I have seen a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Falun_Gong_Australian_Practitioners_Dancing_big.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Falun_Gong_Australian_Practitioners_Dancing_big.jpg" rel="nofollow">photo</a> from another Falun Gong website [www.faluninfo.net] is uploaded to wikipedia.

Actually there is no connexion apart fromthe fact that they sound a little alike. The user points to their partial phonetic coincidence as 'proof' that they must be linked, and then quotes Matthew 6.30 from the <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshitta.html" title="Peshitta">Peshitta</a> as documented evidence for this. All that Bible verse says is 'You of litte faith'. Naturally, the Peshitta uses the word <i>haimānuthā</i> for 'faith'. This does not prove anything. I have quoted to the user dictionary entries on both words that disprove a link, but the user continues, and has started to get offensive. Can you please look into this?

<p>You're an admin? Take care you don't lose that status through asocial behaviour. Deleting other people's comments is just not done. Some go so far as to not even delete their own texts when they change their minds, but strike them through in stead. I think that is a bit over the top (depending on the situation). But deleting other people's comments is a big no-no. If you diasagree with what I say, comment on it. I've got a pretty tough skin, I can take it. But don't censor me.

<p>Hi, Angr! Sorry to bother you again; I am wondering if you could answer a few more questions of mine.</p>
<p>I've been working on Ó Siahdail's Lesson 7 (yup, my progress is not very impressive, I'm afraid) during the past week, and, of course, this is where he once again surprised me by unloading the whole bunch of verb tenses of <i>bí</i> on me. Anyway, I've been trying to make sure all forms were standard and not dialect-specific, and <a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" rel="nofollow">An Foclóir Beag</a> was of great help to me here. Then I tried to match the pronunciation guidelines from your <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_Archive_11_53be.html#Please.2C_help" title="User talk:Angr/Archive 11">previous response</a> with what Ó Siahdail says in Lesson 7 and with what <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a> says. I am kind of stuck in a few places:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both <i>An Foclóir Beag</i> and my little <i>Collins Irish Dictionary</i> (Standard Irish through and through) give <i>bhíothas</i> as the Standard form of <i>bí</i> for "one was". Ó Siahdail gives <i>bhíothadh</i>, and you also recommended me this form last time, albeit with pronunciation different from Ó Siahdail's (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːhəv]</span>). Same goes for the dependent forms (Ó Siahdail's <i>ní rabhadh</i> vs. An Foclóir Beag's <i>ní rabhthar</i> vs. Collins Gem's <i>ní rabhthas</i>). I didn't give it much thought last time, but now when I'm trying to piece everything together, it is rather confusing.</li>
<li>In Imperfect, how are analytical forms (<i>bhíodh sé</i>, <i>bhíodh sí</i>...) pronounced? From what I gather, it should be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːt]</span>, but I really want to make sure I got it right. Ó Siahdail says that <i>dh</i> is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t]</span> before a slender <i>s</i>; <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>--only before <u>pronouns</u> beginning with an <i>s</i>. Which one is standard?</li>
<li>Ó Siahdail uses a dot under <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t]</span> in the transcription on page 27, but I couldn't find this symbol in Appendix I. What is the meaning of that dot?</li>
<li>Again, in Imperfect, would <i>bhíodh</i> be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span> when followed by anything but a slender <i>s</i>? According to <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>, it should be.</li>
<li>Pronunciation of <i>dh</i> in Conditional--same questions as for Imperfect. I figured this much out: <i>bheinn</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːnʲ]</span>; <i>bheifea</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲefʲa:]</span>; <i>bheadh sé</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲat ʃe:]</span>; <i>bheadh sí</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲat 'ʃi:]</span>; <i>bheimis</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲimʲʃ]</span>; <i>bheadh sibh</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲat 'ʃivʲ]</span>; <i>bheidís</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲedʲi:ʃ]</span>; <i>bheifí</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲefʲi:]</span>. Is this correct?</li>
<li>Pronunciation of <i>dh</i> in Future (<i>beidh mé</i>, <i>beidh sí</i>...). Last time you told me <i>beidh</i> is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bʲej]</span>. Now I can't figure out why. Why not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bai]</span>? Not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bei]</span>? Does it matter which letter/sound it is followed by? Aaaaa!</li>
</ol>
<p>I am sorry for so many questions--hopefully I am not bugging you too much with this stuff--but I am kind of desperate to figure all this out on my own; not when all my sources contradict one another. I would certainly appreciate your answers when you get a moment. Thanks!--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 20:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>An Foclóir Beag</i> and Collins are quite right: past tense autonomous is <i>bhíothas</i>, not <i>bhíothadh</i> in the standard language. Sorry about confusing you before. Pronounce it <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːhəs]</span>.</li>
<li><i>bhíodh sé</i> doesn't really have a "standard" pronunciation. In Connacht in general, it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːt ʃe:]</span>, but in Ulster it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːu ʃə]</span> and in Munster it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx ʃe:]</span>. To the best of my knowledge, the Connacht pronunciation is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːt]</span> only before <i>sé, sí, siad</i> (<u>pronouns</u> beginning with slender s), and otherwise <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span>, so that <i>bhíodh Seán</i> is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx ʃa:n]</span>.</li>
<li>The dot under the t is supposed to mean the place of articulation is alveolar or postalveolar rather than dental. I didn't bother indicating this because it's a completely phonetic assimilation to the following <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span> and therefore IMO not worth mentioning in a broad transcription.</li>
<li>Yes, imperfect <i>bhíodh</i> is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span> except before <i>sé, sí, siad</i>. (And in Munster, it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span> even before <i>sé, sí, siad</i>, so if you want to adopt Munster pronunciation for these forms, it'll be one less thing to remember.)</li>
<li>I think <i>bheimis</i> is actually <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲemʲəʃ]</span> (i.e. it's an exception to the rule that <i>ei</i> is [i] before nasals). <i>Beidh</i> is also an exception to the spelling rules; <i>eidh</i> doesn't represent [ai] here but is broken down into <i>ei</i> [e] + slender <i>dh</i> [j].</li>

<dd>Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll probably print your answers out and frame them--yes, they are <i>that</i> useful to me! The only thing you missed was my sub-question about the dependent forms in #1 (Ó Siahdail's <i>ní rabhadh</i> vs. An Foclóir Beag's <i>ní rabhthar</i> vs. Collins Gem's <i>ní rabhthas</i>). There are three forms to chose from. By analogy, I would guess that <i>ní rabhthas</i> is the standard one, but I am curious as to where <i>ní rabhthar</i> came from. It was my impression that <i>An Foclóir Beag</i> used Standard Irish as well.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your suggestions, I much prefer to stick with Standard Irish, or with Connacht when it's impossible, as it was the case with <i>bhíodh sé</i>. Munster and Ulster are interesting, too, but I'd rather limit the variations at this point as much as possible.</dd>

<dd>Since you seem to be the type who's not intimidated by technical grammar terms, you might look into buying the Christian Brothers' <i>New Irish Grammar</i>, which is very dry but the absolute standard reference grammar. Using them now as a tie-breaker for the dependent form of the past tense autonomous, the answer is... (drumroll please)... <i>rabhthar</i>. I guess <i>rabhthas</i> is either an analogical form or a typo in Collins Gem. (A typo is quite possible, as they get <i>rabhthar</i> right in the present subjunctive at the bottom of the column.) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I made it a little more surface-phonetic rather than abstract-phonemic.

<p>I would like to point out that contrary to your statement ("A mediator has offered his help, but no one has taken the offer up."), I was the one who requested (and obviously accepted) this mediation 5 days ago, on Improv's talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Improv#Request_for_Mediation_Cabal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Improv#Request_for_Mediation_Cabal" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), after the article talk page's debate was ignored.</p>
<p>After 5 days of more edit-warring or vandalism, the other party rejected the mediation this morning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dontworry&amp;diff=64448651&amp;oldid=63680698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dontworry&amp;diff=64448651&amp;oldid=63680698" rel="nofollow">(diff)</a>.</p>

<p>Hi! I'd like to request your participation in a debate that's currently ongoing between me and an anonymous user on my talk page (the very last thread). Since it's about which German spelling to use on the English Wikipedia, I thought your opinion might be a valuable addition, especially so as I'm insecure as to whether I'm missing something or whether my viewpoint is right.

<p>Hi Angr! I have question for you...do you have any creative ideas for improvments to linguistic articles on Wikipedia involving Vietnamese languages? We have a Wikipedian here who might be willing to record some sounds for Wikipedia, so I'm wondering what might be a good collection of recordings to make. Any ideas? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 02:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angr! I noticed on your page that it mentioned that you had obtained your PhD, so I thought you might be able to answer a few questions I have. I'm an entering freshman in college.</p>
<p>Throughout high school I took Latin. Ever since, I've been interested in ancient dead languages like Latin, Greek, Old English, all the Indo-European stuff. I have few people to talk to about it because it's such an esoteric interest. My Latin Teacher knew Old High German, Old Norse, Old English, Latin, Modern German and a little Greek. He was a big fan of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family, and admired Germanic culture. He even did his own translation of Beowulf. Anyway, because of him, I've developed a keen interest in linguistics; why and how languages work, their idiosyncrasies, their differences and similarities, etc.</p>
<p>As a freshman in college, I’m not really sure what I want to do with my life, but linguistics is definitely one of my major interests. I was wondering what a typical day at work is like for you and, if you weren’t working as a translator, what job opportunities you would have? I know lexicographers write dictionaries, but that sounds like a rather bland job. I’ve always been fascinated with tracing the etymology of a word. It’s interesting to see how it traveled though several different languages finally back to PIE, so what’s something I could do with that?</p>
<p>Finally, Just out of curiosity, how did you get interested in the field and why the focus on Old Irish? Thanks for your time. - <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherWillis_fb02.html" title="User:ChristopherWillis">User:ChristopherWillis</a></p>

<dd>Well, a typical day at work for me involves doing technical translations from German into English, for which a Ph.D. in linguistics is completely unnecessary. What a Ph.D. in linguistics really prepares you for is to become a linguistics professor. If you decide to go to grad school and focus on Indo-European linguistics there, you could go on to be an Indo-Europeanist, doing research and writing articles on the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European. But there aren't a whole lot of jobs available; universities are cutting back wherever they can, and Indo-European linguistics just is a little esoteric for most university boards. If you want to study linguistics and still have a chance at actually getting a job afterward, your best bets are computer linguistics and applied linguistics. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 08:14, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm looking for some advice from an experience admin, and I hope that you can provide this advice to me. Today I noticed you deleted an image of a US postage stamp. I am curious about the reason for your deletion (besides the fact it had been deleted a month earlier.) Are there special laws/rules controlling the images of US postage stamps that differ from other images produced by the US Federal govenment? (I searched for advice on this issue within Wikipedia, but didn't seem to have any luck finding an answer. Any advice on how to improve such a search would be helpful as well.)

<dd>As I understand it, US postage stamps made after 1978 are copyrighted, because the United States Postal Service hasn't been part of the Federal Government since then. Prior to that date, the USPS was part of the government and stamps were public domain. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 07:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're the photographer, then please upload higher-resolution versions of these images (at least 1000 px on the longest side).

Or, upload photographs that haven't appeared on the web yet, but of the same subjects.
