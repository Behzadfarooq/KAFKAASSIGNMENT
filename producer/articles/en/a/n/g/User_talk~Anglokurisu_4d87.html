	    <p>Then explain to me why other people are able to do it, with NON significant commercial groups, and a geniune organisation such as UKSPI is not able to? I'm sorry, I am dissappointed with the lack of professionalism, and how ungenuine Wikipedia has shown to be. We are not commerical, we make no-money, we are NON-PROFIT!! It a benefit to everyone as it offers an insight into ideas and theories and research into paranormal activity. It is of more significance than all of the other links you have.</p>
<p>Dear Anglokurisu, Please stop adding links to UKSPI, this is seen as spamming by the Wikipedia community and could result in you being blocked from editing. Your page on UKSPI has also been nominated for deletion see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_UKSPI_e814.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/UKSPI">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/UKSPI</a>. Please consider taking a more positive role in the community here and add articles with benefit to everyone not for vanity or commercial interests, thanks - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 10:53, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is seconded. You have no maintained a positive role in developing content, solely promoting one organization. You have been blocked for 1 week. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 15:29, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That was my brother, Wireless LAN that is. So block me. I'm trying to help the content of wikipedia. Why do you have to treat us like this? You even has an MSN Community on your links, but not a genuine recognised paranormal site such as UKSPI? How can you justify that? You can't can you? We don't need advertising! We are not allowing members to join UKSPI. However, Torro are, and they are allowed to 'promote' themselves on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I have, and I refer you to the second point. So since I have requested that we be deleted, maybe you should do that and go about following your own protocol, and remove all the other external links on that paranormal page. I think you have to realise, that there is no real reason to why our link should be deleted, in fact my arguement was, I quote:</p>
<p>'I believe UKSPI to be of interest to the paranormal field due to it being the only recognised paranormal organisation committed to paranormal research.'</p>
<p>You're simply ignoring the comments I have written and trying to pass me off as someone who is only arguing the points outlined by this so called 'Strawmen' policy, agreed I have said those comments, but also justified why they should be allowed on there, and UKSPI is included in this argeumenmt. You are not looking at my main arguements whatsoever. You have only posted the same comments to be over and over again, none of which being of any significance, I know this is a debate you can't win, however, you're going to delete our page anyway.</p>
<p>I have told you, I'm not going to risk the professionalism and status of UKSPI by argueing with a website which has been slated by most academics. As an academic, I believe Wikipedia to be of some use, however, I feel that the professionalism of Wikipedia lacks somewhat, and has shown to be biased towards something it has no understanding into.</p>

<dd>Let me explain, going through Wikipedia adding external links to your own organisation is spamming, pure and simple. No argument you may offer is acceptable as an excuse, it is simply considered abuse, especially from a user with no other contributions in his/her edit history. So the relevancy of your link or article is not the point, it is nullified by your own spamming. You are not being treated unfairly it is normal that someone adding external links in this way will be blocked or the page they create deleted. As far as your comments about Wikipedia I am not going to engage with childish slurs. As far as bias I spend much of my time on Wikipedia depending <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> and the work of academics like Cornell University's psychology professor <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryl_Bem_675c.html" title="Daryl Bem">Daryl Bem</a> and also <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Radin_6479.html" title="Dean Radin">Dean Radin</a>. I am also based in the UK and well aware of the issues relating to this subject area. In my personal opinion spamming only degrades the organisation and its subject, which makes my work defending it as valid science harder. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 12:18, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have told you that I also am not got to argue with wikipeida. However, you still lack the justification I have asked for. Spamming would be if I added my link to more than 10 pages, I didn't I added it at the bottom of 3 pages, along with a lot of other links, I personally felt there was no issue with this, there are 15 to 20 other links there, I felt that UKSPI belonged there, as did a number of other people. However, you felt otherwise. That is your choice, I disagree, yet you have the upper hand and will delete it anyway. We did not spam! There is no way adding one link to 3 relevant articles on Wikipedia is spamming! Spamming would be if I removed all the links on Wikipedia, and added UKSPI 10 times. That's spamming!</p>
<p>The reason I haven't had any other edits because I have spent the rest of my time trying to argue my point. We've all got to start somewhere on Wikipedia. And that fact that you work with other parapsychologist just further enhances the idea that you are biased towards us.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you continue to plug the same comments over and over again to me. I asked you delete it all didn't I? So can we end this now please? Because it's no man's land on here, you can never convince me, or any of my peers, or infact any of the other people I have contacted regarding this issue that you are in the right, because you simply are not. Plane and simple. Also you are so contracted by your own Strawmen policy, is simply amusing.</p>
