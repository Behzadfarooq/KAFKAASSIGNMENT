<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Lauro_7769.html" title="Edit section: M.S. Oranje">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>M.S. Oranje</i></span></h3>
<p><i>Oranje</i> was commissioned by the Nederlandsche Stoomvaart Maatschapij (Nederland Line / <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherland_Line_912c.html" title="Netherland Line">Netherland Line</a>), and was built in <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> in 1938-1939 by the Netherlands Shipbuilding Company. She was launched by <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Wilhelmina_1018.html" title="Queen Wilhelmina">Queen Wilhelmina</a> and named <i>Oranje</i> in honour of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Orange-Nassau_d8f9.html" title="House of Orange-Nassau">Royal House of Orange</a> on 8 September 1938. She undertook its trials in June 1939 and attained a speed of 26 knots, making her the world's fastest motor liner at the time. She was built to carry passengers to the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_East_Indies_f394.html" title="Dutch East Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>.</p>
<p>As built, <i>M.S. Oranje'</i>s specifications were: tonnage/displacement: 20,117 GRT (gross registered tons); length: 199.9 metres (656 ft); width: 25.5 metres (83 ft); draft: 8.8 metres (29 ft); engines: 3 x 12 cylinder Sulzer diesels 27,500 BHP; screws: triple; service speed: 21 knots; passengers: 283 First, 283 Second, 92 Third and 82 Fourth Class (total = 740); passenger decks: 8.</p>
<p><i>Oranje's</i> first scheduled voyage was from <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> to <a href="../../../d/j/a/Djakarta.html" title="Djakarta">Djakarta</a> in <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java.html" title="Java">Java</a>, via the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_of_Good_Hope_c5d8.html" title="Cape of Good Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. Leaving on 4 September 1939, by the time <i>Oranje</i> arrived in Java, to find that <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> had begun and Germany had invaded the Netherlands. <i>Oranje</i> was laid up at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourabaya.html" title="Sourabaya">Sourabaya</a> in Java from December 1939 until February 1941, at which point the ship's Captain was ordered to sail for Sydney and place his vessel at the disposal of the Australian military. At the same time, the Dutch Government informed the Australian Government that they would bear the cost of <i>Oranje's</i> conversion to a hospital ship. Although sailing under Australian command, <i>Oranje</i> remained crewed by Dutch crew, and continued to sail under the Dutch flag. <i>Oranje</i> was the largest hospital ship operated from Australia, serving for five years throughout multiple theatres of World War II, including the Middle East, Indian and Pacific Campaigns. During this time, <i>Oranje</i> made 41 voyages, carrying Australian and New Zealander soldiers. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the war ended, <i>Oranje</i> returned to her life as a passenger ship. In 1947, she recommenced the Amsterdam to Batavia service, sailing via <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton.html" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. This service ended in 1957. The next year, in 1958, she made her first liner voyage from Amsterdam to Australia, sailing via Southampton, <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez.html" title="Suez">Suez</a> in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. She underwent a refit and a minor facelift in Amsterdam in 1959. Upon completion the tonnage was then listed as 20,565 GRT ,and the ship was able to accommodate 323 First Class and 626 Tourist Class passengers.</p>
<p>On 7 September 1960, she departed on her first round-the-world voyage from Amsterdam via Southampton, Suez, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama.html" title="Panama">Panama</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Everglades_c619.html" title="Port Everglades">Port Everglades</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, Southampton, and Amsterdam. <i>Oranje</i> and two other Dutch ships serviced Australia and New Zealand; the two other ships being the Netherland Line <i>Johan van Oldenbarnevelt</i> and the Royal Rotterdam Lloyd <i><a href="../../../a/c/h/Achille_Lauro_4870.html" title="Achille Lauro">M.S. Willem Ruys</a></i>. The three ships sailed under the banner of <i>Dutch Mails</i>. On 26 February 1961 <i>Oranje</i> sailed in the opposite direction, visiting the same ports.</p>
<p>At this time, passenger and cargo shipping industries were suffering from the growth that the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Airline">airline</a> industry. The increasing popularity of air travel, in particular with the advent of <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">aviation</a>'s <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet</a> era, led to the sharp decline in ship passenger and cargo numbers. As a result, the Netherland Line decided to end its passenger services in 1964. <i>Oranje</i> commenced its last voyage around the world as a Dutch liner on 4 May 1964.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Lauro_7769.html" title="Edit section: M.S. Angelina Lauro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>M.S. Angelina Lauro</i></span></h3>
<p>The Netherland Line sold their flagship, <i>M.S. Oranje</i>, together with its Royal Rotterdam Lloyd running mate <i><a href="../../../a/c/h/Achille_Lauro_4870.html" title="Achille Lauro">M.S. Willem Ruys</a></i> to the Italian company Flotta Lauro Line later in 1964. The ships were rebuilt and renamed <i>M.S. Angelina Lauro</i> and <i>M.S. Achille Lauro</i> respectively.</p>
<p><i>M.S. Oranje</i> was sent to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa.html" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> to be extensively rebuilt at the Cant del Tirreno shipyards. On 24 August whilst she was being rebuilt a fire broke out in which six people died. The rebuild extended the promenade deck and it was fully glazed in. The ship was also given a sharply raked bow which extended its length by 16 feet. The other outstanding feature was the tall louvered funnel topped by a large smoke deflector wing. The interiors were also transformed.</p>
<p>After the rebuild <i>M.S Angelina Lauro</i> was then listed as 24,377 GRT (gross registered tons), 205.5 metres (672.4 ft) long and 25.5 metres (83.6 ft) wide. The new passenger configuration allowed for interchange cabins between first and tourist class. First Class could accommodate between 180 and 377 passengers and Tourist Class between 946 to 1050 passengers, making a total of 1230 passengers.</p>
<p>On 6 March 1966 the ship departed on its maiden voyage from <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bremerhaven.html" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> sailing via the Suez Canal to Australia. It continued on the Australian service until 1972, when Flotta Lauro discontinued the service due to low passenger numbers as experienced by all shipping companies at the time.</p>
<p>In 1972 <i>Angelina Lauro</i> received an extensive refit to ready it for a new role as a full time cruise ship. After the refit it accommodated 800 passengers in a one class configuration. It was relocated to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan_c777.html" title="San Juan">San Juan</a> for regular cruises of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, but was managed by another Italian shipping company, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costa_Cruises_3013.html" title="Costa Cruises">Costa Lines</a>.</p>
<p>In 1977 <i>Angelina Lauro</i> was chartered to Costa Lines for three years. The company took delivery on 1O October. The ship was based at Port Everglades for cruise duties in the Caribbean. Although the ship retained its name, Costa Lines according to their custom of using Christian (first or given) names, marketed the <i>M.S Angelina Lauro</i> simply as <i>Angelina</i>. After this time, occasionally <i>M.S. Angelina Lauro</i> would operate a line voyage across the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> to Italy. For these line voyages it reverted to its original two class configuration.</p>
<p><i>Angelina Lauro</i> was a popular cruise ship in the Caribbean until 30 March 1979 when tragedy struck. It suffered a devastating fire (<a href="http://www.chesterh.com/angelina_lauro.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chesterh.com/angelina_lauro.htm" rel="nofollow">eyewitness account</a>) whilst on a cruise and berthed at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Amalie_df52.html" title="Charlotte Amalie">Charlotte Amalie</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Thomas%2C_U.S._Virgin_Islands_6ebe.html" title="Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Virgin_Islands_5a31.html" title="United States Virgin Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>.</p>
<p>The fire broke out in the aft crew galley, and rapidly spread forward through the restaurants and passenger accommodations. Even though the well-trained crew did everything possible to contain the fire, the task was too great and soon flames had reached the top decks. Most of the passengers and crew were ashore when the fire broke out, and all those onboard were evacuated safely. It took four days for port firefighters to put the fire out, during which time in-land firefighters joined the battle. A number of attempts were made to tow the ship away from the wharf; however this failed due to the weight of the water that had been pumped into it. Slowly it ended up sitting on the shallow bottom with a list to port. It was very fortunate that no-one was killed during this incident.</p>
<p>Neil Whitmore, the <i>maitre d'hotel</i> on <i><a href="../../../m/s/_/MS_Sun_Princess_%281972%29_c7c7.html" title="MS Sun Princess (1972)">M.S. Sun Princess</a></i> described the efforts to aid the passengers in the aftermath of the fire:</p>
<p>"Most of the ships in port that day were on the final day of their seven day Caribbean cruise having commenced from San Juan. As a result, passengers from the <i>Angelina Lauro</i> were divided into groups between the various ships in port taken and aboard for an overnight voyage back to San Juan."</p>
<p>"Most of <i>Angelina</i>’s passengers had been ashore in shorts and tops and had lost all their belongings in the fire thus, some of our passengers gave them items of clothing. Sun Princess took 400 of <i>Angelina</i>’s passengers and provided them with a substantial self service buffet dinner and a continental breakfast the next morning before they disembarked in San Juan where they were flown home to the mainland of the USA. It certainly stretched our catering facilities."</p>
<p><i>Angelina Lauro</i> was declared to be a total loss and remained dockside for some three months. Eventually the German salvage company, Eckhardt &amp; Company of Hamburg was awarded the contract to raise it from the bottom and have it refloated. This was achieved on 2 July 1979. Lauro Cruises decided to sell the ship for scrap to Taiwanese ship breakers, and it departed under tow for <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> on 30 July.</p>
<p>The <i>Angelina Lauro</i> successfully navigated the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_Canal_ac67.html" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a> and was headed across the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific.html" title="Pacific">Pacific</a> towards <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. However, on 21 September, in the mid Pacific, <i>M.S. Angelina Lauro</i>’s fire-affected warped hull plates began to take on water, and it began to list slowly. The ship remained afloat for three days, but by the evening of 23 September it was fully on her side. It was not until early the next morning, just before sunrise, that it slowly sank. It was twenty days after the ship's 40 year milestone.</p>
<p>The <i>Angelina Lauro'</i>s previous running mate <i>M.S. Achille Lauro</i> (ex <i>M.S. Willem Ruys</i>), which became well-known for the terrorist attack in Egypt, continued cruising until November 1994, when she caught fire and sank on 2 December 1994.</p>
