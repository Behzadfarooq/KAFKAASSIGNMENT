<p>Yeah, I know - I didn't have time to write more than a stub when I came across the fact that the article here (now at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelus_%28vampire%29.html" title="Angelus (vampire)">Angelus (vampire)</a>, with some changes), was essentially an article on Angelus that had been moved to this page, and didn't talk about the main stuff about Angel at all. So I basically moved that back over to Angelus, and started a stub here. But you should definitely expand it if you get the chance. I may try to, as well, although I don't normally write wikipedia articles on Buffy-related topics. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:10, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whoever wrote the article seems to have never heard of the paragraph.</p>
<p>I changed the sentence which originally said, "Due to the gypsy curse, sex also poses a risk to Angel, since the "moment of perfect happiness" nearly always occurs for him as a result of orgasm." This is false, it was made quite clear in Angel (the show) that Angel can have sex without losing his soul, it was only making love that brought him perfect happiness. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 14:41, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, when he had sex with Darla, notably, he did not lose his soul. He also later had sex with Eve, didn't he? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:34, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's right. It's also shown in one episode where Angel and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Ash_3f8a.html" title="Nina Ash">Nina Ash</a> were in bed together. One would assume they were intimate since she asked him if he received "perfect happiness" or something along those words. <a href="../../../t/k/i/User%7ETking624_c780.html" title="User:Tking624">Tking624</a> 13:17, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure about the difference between having sex and making love, but I think perfect happiness is the condition for Angel losing his soul. One may then infer that while having sex with anyone but Buffy, Angel is still unhappy on some level. She is his one true love, though they probably won't end up together. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 04:49, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sex is recreational, for enjoyment. In the Buffyverse, at least between Angel and Buffy, they made love which was supposed to be the ultimate expression of intimacy and love for them. The act of sharing that with Buffy made him perfectly happy and thus he lost his soul. Just because he can have sex and not lose his soul doesn't mean on some level he is unhappy, it just means he isn't basically in paradise. What he had with Eve for example was most likely pure lust. What he had with Darla was a need to be with someone and not be so alone and 'cold'.</p>

<p>The line at the end of the article "Since the television series ended, we've learned more about the fate of Angel and his comrades. We now know that Angel, Spike and Gunn survived the fight." i assume refers to comic books or something, but are these considered canon? I still think the tv series should be considered relatively open ended and maybe this line should be removed or rewritten?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nah, it's non-canon. It was left for us to wonder how it ended. Joss Whedon said "Angel lost an arm, Spike got Shanshu and Gunn died" or something along those words in a magazine article but it was considered him joking around since he also mentioned that Xander lost another eye and he wasn't even in the show. The only way that can be canon is if Whedon himself confirms it. I say remove it. --<a href="../../../d/b/g/User%7EDBGFrost_3f31.html" title="User:DBGFrost">DBGFrost</a> 14:47, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, in a somewhat-related topic, I'm moving the bit that says that it is established that Angel survived to be below the canon warning, as the only real sources for this are the comics and some interviews about stuff that hasn't been made. Also, changing his status to 'Unknown' as the ending is indeed unclear, and the comics aren't canon and things like the Spike movie hat might establish that Angel survived have not been made yet.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayunderscorezero_eee9.html" title="User:Jayunderscorezero">Jayunderscorezero</a> 09:26, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>While Angel has lost to both Buffy and Spike at one time it does not take away from the fact that he is generally equal to Buffy and that he is generally better than Spike. In the two fights between Buffy and Angel, Angel controlled much of the fights but lost due to excessive talking and getting re-ensouled and sent to the hell realm. In his fight with Spike, the match was equal until the end, this was due to the fact that Angel was not sure of himself and Spike was. If Angel had been as confident as he usually was in fights he might have won. For Angel to fight at his very best, he needs to be confident and in the right frame of mind. If he is lacking in one he will probably lose. When he has both he can beat almost anybody. Angel's fighting ability is greater than Spike's, and possibly Buffy's, but he is less ruthless in battle which can play in Spike's, and Buffy's, favour. He is also far more patient than Spike and plans things out whereas Spike will just rush in. This can be a disadvantage and could possibly give his opponent chance to counter. Finally, Angel's great weakness is his love of talking, a weakness which he shared with Angelus. Spike on the other hand does no talking at all when he is angry - he merely roars into battle without pause or compunction.</i></p>
<p>This entire section is poorly written, and reads like a mixture of fannish theorizing without evidence, for the sole purpose of exaggerrating the character's combat skills. Is there any reason it should stay in? Surely it's enough to know that Angel is an extremely good fighter, without trying to claim that he's better than two characters who have beaten him?</p>

<p>I've removed Spike from the list of Angel's romantic interests, unless anyone can cite a canon source for retaining him.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How about the Angel episode "Power Play" where Spike CLEARLY states that he has never been initmate with Angel "expect for that one time". That's canon. Not to mention the interviews with Joss Whedon and the discussions with him on Whedonesque (google it) confirming at least a one night stand between the two. It's canon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While that quote can be interpreted in a fannish sense to indicate that they had a "one night stand," it most certainly does not "confirm" anything of the sort. As I understand it, the quote merely said that "that one time" he and Angel were close. There is no specific indication that they were romantically or sexually involved, it might have been merely an emotional connection of some sort. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 06:21, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For me, Spike/Angel count and should be included, just like Willow's long-time crush on Giles revealed in one episode and her crush on Dracula should be included. 06:41, 10 March 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchofhope_7be2.html" title="User:Pinchofhope">Pinchofhope</a></dd>

<p>There was a debate that Liam's last name was O'Connor, due to him caling his son Connor. But this was just a rumour. As far as I know, a last name was never mentioned <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Moira_f302.html" title="User:Big Moira">Big Moira</a> 01:02, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The powers and abilities section on this page is becoming a bit of a mess, similar to how the Spike page's section was until it got pruned back. As soon as the question of who's the super-awesomest is raised, it quickly becomes a pro vs. anti edit squabble, with Spike and Angel fans adding caveats to anything that suggests their boy isn't top vamp, until the article seems to be arguing with itself. Spike beat Angel in "Destiny"! But Angel wasn't trying his best! Angel beat up Spike as a puppet! But that was silly and doesn't count! Angel never beat Buffy! But he totally could have! Spike was tougher! Angel! Spike! Angel! Ngeh. Here's my feeling: Unless there's something completely verifiable that demonstrates strength level one way or the other, (maybe, for instance, Angel's "you're a little bit stronger than I am" comment to Buffy in "Sanctuary"), then we don't really need a scorecard. It's simply not clear cut enough to be helpful.--<a href="../../../n/a/l/User%7ENalvage_7b8a.html" title="User:Nalvage">Nalvage</a> 23:53, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There seems to be evidence that Angel is stringer when he puts on his 'game face' too, which might make a difference in any of those circumstances. This is directly alluded to in the adventures in Pylea, where Angel is afraid to vamp out, and sees his inability to safely do so as a weakness (of course, on Pylea his vamping out was a lot more extreme).67.169.63.116 21:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Angel is left-handed. I never paid attention to the hand he would write or draw with, but I noticed when he held up the drawing of Cordi in 'Inside Out' the spiral binding was on the right side of the paper, where it would usually be if drawn by a lefty (because otherwise the metal is annoying under the left hand).</p>
<p>Can anyone with the DVDs verify or deny this with other evidence? If he is left-handed, it might be mentioned in the article as this would be a detail deliberately put in, possibly to play on deliberate associations to older ideas about left-handedness (sinister, evil hand, etc).</p>
<p>If possible it should also be figured out whether Angelus is the same handedness as Angel.67.169.63.116 21:53, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"(Episode 4.07 "Apocalypse, Nowish" Note: Since the above was said by the entity that would become known as Jasmine while posing as Cordelia, this specific example of Angel being just a different aspect of Angelus comes from a questionable source to say the least.)"</i> Someone missed the point. Angel clearly *accepts* Cordelia/Jasmine's assessment, and uses the personal pronoun. Why can't people just accept that half way through Season 4, the writers threw continuity to **** and made Angel and Angelus two seperate consciousnesses when they *never* had been previously. A soul is a conscience, that's all - the rest is Watcher propaganda. The demon that inhabits the corpse is mindless, not sentient. It's the human's conciousness that remains and is swayed by the demonic urges. You think Giles would have been so pissed off at Angel for killing Jenny and torturing him if he wasn't actually responsible? You think Angel would quest so hard for 'redemption' if he didn't commit the crimes himself? Season 4 was a pile of tosh, and they realised their mistake and switched back for Season 5. Angelus is simply Angel without the constraints of humanity to hold back his demonic urges. (128.243.220.42 21:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Whilst many of the characters including Angel come to believe that TPTB are responsible for both Angel's return and the magic snow, I'm not convinced that there is a definitive answer, and many powerful entities have an interest in Angel being on Earth including Jasmine, &amp; Wolfram and Hart. - <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 14:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Everyone has their opinions about what power was most likely responsible, but they're just that, opinions. The shows never gave a definitive answer. Angel, Doyle, Cordelia, Wesley.. believe Angel was returned by TPTB to fight evil. They maybe right but...</li>
<li>Jasmine does seem to have been one of the powers that decided to get more involved than the others. In the episode "<a href="../../../i/n/s/Inside_Out_%28Angel_episode%29_61e4.html" title="Inside Out (Angel episode)">Inside Out</a>", Skip suggests that Jasmine &amp;/or any of her worshippers/followers have been using Angel and those surrounding him as pawns in a wider aim of bringing about the coming of Jasmine onto Earth. He says that many events have been controlled so that Angel has a miracle son - Connor, who can father Jasmine. If Angel had been in Hell all that time, it might have proved a significant flaw in Jasmine's plan, it's possible Jasmine is behind Angel's return.</li>
<li>It's possible that the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Evil_d659.html" title="First Evil">First Evil</a> was telling the truth in "Amends" and some how returned Angel.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfram_%26_Hart_4e9e.html" title="Wolfram &amp; Hart">Wolfram &amp; Hart</a> have prophecies that suggest Angel will play a significant role in the apocalypse but does not reveal which side he's on.
