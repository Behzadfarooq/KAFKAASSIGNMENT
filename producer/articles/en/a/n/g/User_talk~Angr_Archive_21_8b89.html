<p>No. I did not take the photogrpah myself. If claimed authorship due to the fact that i cut the picture. Perhaps it has been mislabeled.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 21:14, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was an image of T. Kaczynski whose rights belong to AP, but it was taken out because it was considered to be a violation. I don't know if there is any picture available that we can put. For sometime there was the mugshot picture but it was considered in the discussion page to be undignified, and therefore unaproprited, to be put in the top of the article. Now the picture is put in the section where it is discussed the prisoner's arrest.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 11:50, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to restore that AP photo. It was deleted because Counterexample 8 at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:FU">WP:FU#Counterexamples</a> says "A photo from a press agency (e.g. Reuters, AP), not so famous as to be iconic, to illustrate an article on the subject of the photo" is not allowed, but I think that is intended to refer to living people for whom a freely licensed photo could be made. Since Ted Kaczynski is likely to be in prison for the rest of his life, it's not really reasonable to expect that a free photo of him could be made. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:42, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I just received your message about the <b>Image:SMScontroller.jpg</b> used in the <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Master_System_e380.html" title="Sega Master System">Sega Master System</a> page. This image is unreplacable. There are countless pics of similar controllers, but there are none quite like this one. The wires showing up at the top and side make this pic one of a kind.</p>
<p>Now when I submitted the photo a year ago, I believe I was adhering to the fair use standards since the original website was specified and the admin of the site does not mind. I am willing to change the license. But if it has to be deleted, I am certain I won't be able to find a replacement. Please let me know what is the next logical step.

<dd>Yes, policy and in particular how the policy is enforced has changed over the last year.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Picture deletion (Shana Haji)</span></h2>
<p>Hello Angr,</p>
<p>I hope you can help me understand something better:</p>
<p>I helped Hamid123 with the article on Shana Haji, from which you have deleted the photos. I have read the discussion on deletion of fair-use images, and assume that is the reason for the deletion. In order to use the photos, do we need the permission of Shana Haji, or the newspapers the photos were from, or both? If we are able to obtain permission, how should the photos then be labeled?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. Emma-trobairitz 15:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both images were deleted as replaceable fair-use images. In general, fair-use images of living people aren't allowed on Wikipedia, because it's possible to make freely licensed images; see Counterexample 8 at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. In order to use these images, you'd have to get the copyright holder to release them under a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyleft.html" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a> license like <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> or one of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_Licenses_4308.html" title="Creative Commons Licenses">Creative Commons Licenses</a> CC-BY or CC-BY-SA. Take a look at <a href="../../../e/r/p/WP%7EERP_691c.html" title="WP:ERP">WP:ERP</a> for some examples of how to word your request--the important thing is that "permission to use on Wikipedia" is <i>not</i> good enough. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you delete them? I explicitly indicated that I had permission from Brandeis for their use and was awaiting a Wikipedia confirm number?</p>

<p>Hi! I couldn't help but notice that you again <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Granholm_43a0.html" title="Jennifer Granholm">made a Wikipedia article worse</a>. Please stop that. It's really kinda' annoying. And, uh, counter productive?</p>
<p>Since this is a bigger picture kind of thing, I just feel like I've tried common sense. I've tried rationality. I've tried just about everything to get you to stop making Wikipedia articles worse... and it hasn't worked. So, instead of edit warring, which just ends up with someone counting to three or something, I'm going to go ahead and <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> on that article, and that image, because, you know, you're being really, really unreasonable about it. And if this is the image .. if this is the one that you feel so strongly about, you want to take it to whatever the next level of dispute resolution is, then great! But please stop making Wikipedia articles worse.</p>
<p>Also, I kind of feel like you're deliberately going through every contribution I've made to Wikipedia, and, you know, eliminating it. Which, of course, would be a violation of <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>. So, you know, I'm asking you nicely to please stop that.</p>

<dd>Nope, <i>you</i> were the one who made a Wikipedia article worse, by replacing a free image with a fair use image. Doing so repeatedly after being warned is grounds for blocking, so consider this your first warning. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, as an admin, you're supposed to uphold the policies of Wikipedia... except, apparently, the ones you don't like. I made a case for that edit -- <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> CLEARLY states that if the rules are getting in the way of making an article better, ignore them. They were. I did. The current image is NOT as good as the official state portrait of Governor Granholm, and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who thinks it is. While I admire your adherence to a rigid and unflexible set of beliefs, at some point, common sense must enter in to the picture, which is exactly why <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is OFFICIAL POLICY. Not a guideline, like <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> ... OFFICIAL POLICY. When you became an admin, you promised to uphold it. You broke that promise. And that wasn't just a promise to me... it was a promise to all Wikipedians. If you ask me, you owe them an apology for the level of disrespect you've shown me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But you know best, right? You - not the community, not the vaunted <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> that's supposedly the backbone of this place... you and you alone will determine these matters? It would be funny if it weren't kinda sad... And really, at the very least, you should recuse yourself from acting as judge, jury, and image executioner in this case -- have someone else take a look at it. You can hardly be said to be an impartial participant in this matter.</dd>

<dd>One other note -- I've never been "warned" before. Is there some kind of scoreboard somewhere, where I can see what level of warning I'm at? How many warnings do I get before I'm in "trouble"? When is it upgraded to "serious trouble"?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am very serious about <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> - it's just so, so uncool, and it kind of seems like you're in danger of becoming the vindictive admin who uses his powers to pick on certain editors. I really want you to think about that before you continue on your current course... You really, really need to cool it with the Wikistalking. And I don't think it's at all wrong for me to say to you, you should consider this YOUR first warning.</dd>

<dd>But you didn't. You ignored the rules to make an article <i>worse</i>, and no amount of good faith can persuade me you didn't know you were violating policy when you did it, and did it on purpose to see what reaction it would get, meaning you're violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as well as <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> (which incidentally <i>is</i> also official policy). <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> means you can pay more attention to the spirit than to the letter of the policies, it doesn't mean go around intentionally violating policy to get a reaction. If you started POV pushing in articles, and edit-warring to restore your preferred POV, do you honestly think saying "<a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is policy!" would keep you from getting blocked? This is no different. As for the warning, there is no magic number of warnings you get before you get blocked. People get blocked when an admin decides they're being disruptive and it becomes apparent that blocking is the only way to stop them for a while. If you do continue to replace free images with fair-use ones, you <i>will</i> evenutally be blocked -- and probably not even by me.

<p>You contribute a lot to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Languages_a9a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Languages">Wikipedia:WikiProject Languages</a> and related pages.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Usage of Burma/Myanmar as name of a Wikiproject</span></h2>
<p>Since I know you're very experienced in Wikipedia, I want to ask you a question. I was wondering whether usage of Burma/Myanmar does not follow neutral point of view conventions. A user recently proposed a name change to exclusively "Myanmar" (a name change made in 1989), but most English-language speakers recognize only Burma or use Burma in preference of Myanmar. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Controversial_names" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Naming convention policies</a> seem to indicate that usage of both is preferred, but that user writes that using Burma is not neutral, because it shows support for Burmese opposition groups. So, my question is, "Which name should be used for the Wikiproject, 'Burma/Myanmar', 'Burma', or 'Myanmar'?" The lengthy discussion can be found <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Burma_Myanmar_8eaf.html#Project_name" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Burma/Myanmar">here</a>.

Second: you didn't remove its link on the page <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow.html" title="Snow">Snow</a>. Third, did you mark this page for deletion, or did you just delete it?

That <i>is</i> a speedy deletion tag.

<dd>Well, i'm absent minded and multi-tasking - I didn't realize it had a replaceable fair use tag on it. And if I did, I didn't realize that is a deletion tag.

If someone is virtually in hiding, has no website, no contact info how are we to obtain permission to use his image? I grabbed a screenshot from a tv show on which he appeared and thought I'd put the correct fair use reasoning on the description page. Should I upload it again? <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeedybob2_3794.html" title="User:Seedybob2">Seedybob2</a> 12:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If he's really reclusive, you're probably right that the image isn't replaceable by a free image. Nevertheless, the text of {{<a href="../../../t/v/-/Template%7ETv-screenshot_6e4d.html" title="Template:Tv-screenshot">Tv-screenshot</a>}} makes it clear that TV screenshots are only to be used when discussing the TV show, not just to identify the person. If you can find a promotional image of him that was released when he was competing, that could be used, with a detailed fair use rationale explaining (among other things) that a free image couldn't be made because he's a recluse. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:09, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Here's a copy of his message:</p>
<p>Hallo IsarSteve, in letzter Zeit gibt es wieder Probleme mit einer kommerziellen Internetseite, die ihren Link dort hinterlässt. Ich habe mal den Abschnitt "External links" aufgeräumt und Einträge von nicht mehr aufrufbare Seiten gelöscht und die Zulassungslisten durch die deutschen Wikipedia-Pendants ersetzt. Es gibt für mich keinen Grund mehr, warum "germanplate.net" und Co sich unter den "Ext. links" verewigen müssen. Auf der Diskussionseite scheinen die auch nicht den Sinn der Links zu verstehen. Wie denkst du von den Ereignissen der letzten Tage? Könntest du ebenso einen Blick auf den Artikel German car number plates haben (-&gt;Beobachtungsliste)? Ich komme mir etwas "verlassen" vor. Danke und Grüße -Toshi 19:51, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I've encountered blacklisted links on other Wikimedia projects, where the page won't save if it includes a link to a blacklisted site, but I've never encountered it at en-wiki. All I can think of is to watchlist the page, keep removing it, and block whoever keeps adding it (or semiprotect the page if the link is continually added from different IP addresses). —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I know that there are already Wikipedias in other dialects without established written standards (including many German dialects, as well as Asturian Spanish and Walloon French), and if anyone nominated them for deletion I would support. The fact that this particular dialect Wikipedia seems to have been started for political/ideological reasons (much like the variant Belarusian Wikipedia, which is still in testing at Incubator) is an even stronger reason for me to support its deletion. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 23:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The image had already been tagged for deletion for 11 days when the "disputed" tag was added (not counting the one you added and then quickly removed yourself), and was still around for 3 more days after the tag was added. If anyone had wanted to discuss it, they had ample time. The comment left in the "disputed" tag said simply, "The only way to find a freely-liscenced image of JK Rowling would be to personally ask her permission. As yet no one seems prepared to do this", which is not an argument for the image being non-replaceable. A free image <i>could</i> be made, therefore the image is replaceable.

I had another glance at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Angr" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Angr" rel="nofollow">your deletion log</a>, and was appalled to see that you are continuing to delete images without lifting a finger to remove red links to images from articles.</p>
<p>Even if there is a back log, it is far more time-consuming trying to find and delete such image red links after the media have been deleted than to do it at the time, as you go. If you don't have time to do the job properly, you shouldn't do it at all, unless you can get someone to finish the job for you.</p>
<p>I went through your last 200 deletions, checking each one for remaining red links. Out of those 200 deletions, you created image red links on the following 95 pages:</p>

<p>Please <b>stop</b> deleting replaceable fair use images for a while, as you go back over your past deletions, checking each image page for file links and deleting any red links.

<dd>Sorry. Getting rid of improper images is far more important than removing red links from articles. I can't believe you went to the time and trouble to find all these cases of me not removing red links and didn't just remove them yourself. There are a very limited number of people who can delete images, and extremely few people actively engaged in doing so, but anyone can remove red links. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Response copied from Image talk page:</b></p>
<p><b>Response:</b> Wiki is a complicated maze of different links and pages to provide info. The info was provided here (by Guarini's representative), copied onto my discussion page where the first notice of deletion was posted, and provided on the Image description page I can no longer locate. I am not tech savvy enough or have time enough to study Wiki's overly complicated system, and no amatuer contributor should be expected to when what has already been provided clearly shows the image meets the guideline "anyone can use it for any legal purpose, including commercial uses and derivative works". I think it ridiculous to once again bother his rep with something like this. This relentless cycle of changing demands for documentation feels like faux legal nit-picking, if not harrassment. I can either bother Guarini's rep again or replace the image, I haven't decided. However, I might want to discuss my concerns with someone in a position of authority over you.</p>
<p>Please tell me who else I can discuss my concerns with, if I feel inclined to do so. Bkstone 19:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angr, could you perhaps look at the <a href="../../../i/m/b/Imbolc.html" title="Imbolc">Imbolc</a> article? We have a user going through some of the articles with Irish (Gaelic fests in general, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigid.html" title="Brigid">Brigid</a>) and either changing the IPA to phonetics or adding new phonetics and translations. We could use some input from someone with better grasp of translations and IPA.

<dd>I don't know how "Imbolc" is pronounced, but the suggested etymology looks more like folk etymology to me, so I removed it. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:10, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is scholarly debate about the meaning of all the festival names. I have only a miniscule bit of Gaeilge, but AFAIK the pronunciation is "IM-uhlk" or "IM-olk". But, yeah, I need to learn how to do that in IPA&#160;:-) <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 20:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There's probably at least three pronunciations: (1) the Old Irish pronunciation, (2) the Modern Irish pronunciation, (3) the pronunciation used by English-speaking Wiccans who know nothing of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology</a>. Odds are all three are quite different. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. IMHO, the former two are worth including, the latter not. I'll try to do some work on standardizing these when I get a chance. IIRC, the articles are currently under the most commonly-used name, which is generally Old or Middle Irish (but it varies... some are incorrect, but common, semi-Anglicizations). Then somewhere in the article is usually the etymology and some discussion of the various forms. The amount of etymological material in the articles varies widely, and I've had to trim it a bit in some of the articles because earlier forms of those sections were unweildy and off-putting to non-linguists, imho. <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 20:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think all three are worth including, if all three can be found. In fact, I can't find any evidence for a modern Irish word for <i>Imbolc</i>, so in this case #2 doesn't seem to exist. It's an Old Irish word borrowed wholesale by modern-day English-speaking Wiccans, so only versions 1 and 3 exist. AFAICT the word died out in Irish. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doesn't quite qualify; it wasn't recreated after deletion, it was a duplicate that should have been deleted under CSD I1.
