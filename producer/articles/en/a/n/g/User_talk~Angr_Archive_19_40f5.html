<p>Hi, sorry if this is not the currect place to ask this but some time ago you helped me by giving me the, at the time, recently deleted Azure Sheep article (saved under the snewerl user). Could you do the same for the also recently deleted Point of View (HL Mod) article? Or point me to the currect place so I can ask it there? Also could you give me the last version and the version before the page was remade (that contains more text). Thanks Snewerl 15:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't. Talking about allowing the "old Adam" to die so that the "new Adam" may be born is a common metaphor in Christian theology.

<p>Browsing Google Books it does seem that the tension you mentioned between Ulster Irish and the other dialects is sometimes referred to: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0631215816&amp;id=2PiAUygVGTcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22munster+irish%22&amp;sig=pzpR1uA3rq8J9Xa7VdukeZ0rzOA" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0631215816&amp;id=2PiAUygVGTcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22munster+irish%22&amp;sig=pzpR1uA3rq8J9Xa7VdukeZ0rzOA" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Of course this kind of information doesn't really belong in the phonology article except insofar as social status / prestige can be linked to particular phonological characteristics - dialectical differences in morphology and vocabulary being irrelevant here. Using examples from English I was thinking about things like glottalized plosives having low prestige while [ʍ] pronunciation of 'wh' having (in some contexts) high prestige. Of course if Irish doesn't actually have anything like that then I can't very well fault you for not writing about it&#160;:) <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 11:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not registered with Google Books so I can't see that page, but I suspect that has more to do with morphology and lexicon than phonology anyway. Offhand I can't think of anything phonological that's really stigmatized or really elevated in Irish. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 11:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's easy enough to register with Google Books and it has often helped me find reliable sources since I don't have easy access to a university library where I currently live. Here's a quote from that book: "The resulting class-to-class mixture from teachers of both spoken and written Irish led to confusion on the part of learners, and within Gaeltacht areas to a perception by native speakers that what was described as 'Dublin Irish' was being foisted upon them. ... learners from outside the Gaeltacht accomodated their pronunciations towards norms representing a common core for each of the three Gaeltacht areas in which they had acquired their Irish" <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 12:10, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As you probably realized, what I was getting at is that it might be simpler to view the (using broad transcriptions) /b/ + /h/ &gt; /p/ rule as a /p/ + /h/ &gt; /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">pʰ</span>/ "rule". But of course I don't want you to add original research to the article - this was just idle speculation from an amateur unfamiliar with the language&#160;:) <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 12:49, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, but the aspiration is really quite weak in word-internal position like <i>scuabfaidh</i>. [skuəp<sup>h</sup>i:] just isn't a reasonable transcription of it. I don't have actual phonetic studies on the question, but I suspect the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_onset_time.html" title="Voice onset time">VOT</a> of the [p] of <i>scuabfaidh</i> (and other similar words) is positive, but rather small. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 12:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I've seen it. I referred to it often when writing my dissertation. No isoglosses in it, though. Just a bunch of dots with the pronunciations of individual words. No analysis, just raw data. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 15:42, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, reality seems to have shot down just about everything I've suggested adding to the article&#160;:) The main thing remaining is that I'd be interested in a synchronic comparison with the phonology of related languages. The article says stuff like: "The most interesting aspects of Irish phonotactics revolve around the behavior of consonant clusters." What I'd like to know is whether this is unique to Irish or whether it's present in some form in related languages.</p>
<p>I'd also be interested in what influence Irish phonology has had on the phonology of Irish English. Even if there actually is very little influence (I have no idea) that in itself would be interesting to know. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 16:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and one thing of very little consequence - should the article be converted to use Irish English spelling (behavior &gt; behaviour etc.)? <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, if someone else wants to do it, I won't revert, but since I wrote virtually the entire text of the article myself and I use American spelling, I don't feel any great need to change it. I'll see what I can find in the way of comparison with Scots Gaelic and Manx (I may have to break down and use my own dissertation as a source, something I was diligently avoiding doing up till now). Irish <i>has</i> had an effect on Hiberno-English phonology (Irish substrate effects are the reason Hiberno-English has <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t̪ d̪]</span> for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[θ ð]</span>, for example); I'll see what I can find about that too. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 17:38, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice to see the expansions you're working on. One more thing - if you want to get the article featured (which I'm not sure you do, I seem to remember you not being overly fond of the FA system) you're probably going to have to add some images. Even though no really relevant or illustrative images can logically be found people will still want to have something to break up the text. Here are some ideas if you want to go down that path:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we can't have isoglosses then we can at least show the Gaeltacht and mark the place names mentioned in the article. In contrast with the ideas below this would even be useful - or at least I think it would make the article slightly easier to follow for readers like me who aren't familiar with Irish geography. It's easier to make sense of which dialects are close if you can link them to places on a map which are close.</li>
<li>A beauty shot of the Aran Islands with some vapid caption like: "The dialect of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aran_Islands_e885.html" title="Aran Islands">Aran Islands</a> is characterized by lengthened vowels and foo and bar."</li>
<li>A picture of John Q. Scholar with a caption about how he was an important early field worker or something.</li>
<li>A scan of a page of some important text (I see you've got Finck already scanned in).</li>

<dd>No, indeed I am philosophically opposed to FAs, but of course I'm not opposed to making articles as good and as interesting as they can be. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Gaeltacht.svg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Gaeltacht.svg">Commons:Image:Gaeltacht.svg</a> exists already. It doesn't have labels, but they'd be easy enough to add. I don't think I'd have the heart to add a beautiful shot of Irish landscape with a phonology-related caption. A page from Finck is a possibility when I get around to writing the "history of the field" section. And I only wish I <i>had</i> a photo of a relevant scholar, but Irish phonologists seem to be an awfully camera-shy lot. (Well, there is one person listed in the references of whom <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Angr.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Angr.jpg">a free image</a> is available at Commons, but modesty forbids.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Irish phonology peer review</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Angr! While I am incredibly flattered that you considered me as someone who might have useful input in this peer review, I doubt I can add anything of value. After all, I am just a learner, and one without any academic goals at that. At this time, the article answers all my questions, even those I didn't know I had, and those that I won't even think of asking for quite a while. That said, I assure you that if I find any issues with this article, you'll be the first to know.

<dd>Well, it depends on how much slack you are prepared to cut to a said non-linguist. I, on one hand, while not a linguist, having studied the Irish series now know more about linguistics than your average Joe who wants (and can!) learn a language without ever bothering to find out what IPA stands for, let alone try figure out the details. I don't mind it, because I like linguistics in general, enjoy the learning process, and don't have much of a choice of learning materials anyway, but for someone who just wants to learn a language a set of instructions on how to open one's mouth, where to put the tongue, and how to pass air through the throat, all written in layman's terms, could be of a lot more practical use (incidentally, and I kid you not, that's how I learned English--our family simply could not afford a tape recorder, so I was using a lot of library books, most of which were written in that manner). Of course, re-working <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology</a> on such terms would make for a lousy encyclopedic article. I am thus wondering what kind of balance you are looking for in this article and what kind of background you expect from an interested learner such as myself. I might then be able to tailor my comments so as to filter out the most trivial remarks which would not be possible to comply with without making major sacrifices of the article's quality.

<dd>I haven't even read the books, but calling them "humorous" (which incidentally is the correct spelling even in British English) is expressing an opinion, which is not encyclopedic. The claim that the books are humorous doesn't need to be cited; it needs to be removed. And is not common Wikipedia practice to inform other users when one has reverted them. Most people keep the pages they're interested in on their watchlists, and discussion about content is best held on the article's own talk page so that other editors can also participate. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 18:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Irish phonology peer review, part two</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Angr! I hope you'll forgive me for posting my feedback here on your talk page instead of on the peer review page. The reasons for this are, first, that I don't want to make a complete ass of myself in public with my ridiculously primitive "insights" (especially considering the quality of the feedback you received so far), and second, more importantly, that I am going to cleverly intermingle my feedback with some questions of, ehh, personal nature (meaning that I have another barrage of learner's questions coming your way).</p>
<p>I devoted a full hour to carefully reading the newly updated article on Irish phonology. I can honestly say that it is an incredibly dense read, but it is very rewarding in that it makes the reader think and pay attention instead of leasurely cruising from start to end and remembering very little afterwards. That said, some of the portions were very hard for me to comprehend, and the meaning of others escaped me altogether. Below is the list of questions/comments that I had as I was reading the article. As I warned before, the answers some of the questions may be of very little benefit to the article, but they would be of big help to me as a learner.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Consonants#Allophones</b>
<ol>
<li>Why is the first vowel in the IPA transcription of <i>fómhar</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/uː/</span> and not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span>? In general, do you think it would be beneficial to synchronize Irish phonology with <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>? I realize the latter is just a collection of tendencies, and I found most of the ways around that limitation, but full synchronization (which, admittedly, is a <i>lot</i> of work) would be of immense benefit to new learners/readers.</li>
<li>This section states that <i>the labiodental fricatives <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/fˠ, fʲ, vʲ/</span>... have bilabial allophones in many dialects</i>, yet there are no examples. I, for one, am not even 100% sure what "bilabial allophones" are. Also, what are the dialects in which this phenomenon is the most developed? De Bhaldraithe's statement is that the distribution is dependent partly on environment, partly on the individual speaker's preferences. Is it possible to elaborate on this? How would one know the exact factor for any given observed substitution?</li>
<li><i>The palatal stops... may be articulated as true palatals... or as palatovelars...</i> What are the factors for the choice between the two? Is this also dependent on environment and/or individual preferences?</li>
<li>Why is the <i>an</i> combination in <i>scanradh</i> transcribed as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/au/</span>, as is <i>a</i> in <i>is cam</i>? I don't recall this phenomenon discussed further down in the vowels section. There is a footnote for <i>scanradh</i>, but I don't understand the logic behind the pronunciation of the words listed in the footnotes. Are these exceptions? If so, it might be helpful to mark them as such.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Consonants#Fortis and lenis sonorants</b>
<ol>
<li>The section goes to great length explaining the fortis and lenis types, but what it misses is a description of how these types are different in real speech. I suppose a sound file would illustrate that the best, but meanwhile may be the difference should be briefly mentioned in the text? By using analogies, perhaps?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Vowels</b> (overall)
<ol>
<li>One of the peer reviewers mentioned that pictures would need to be added if this article is ever to become featured. While having a shot of Irish scenery would be a feast to a tired eye, you are, of course, right that the benefit of such picture is very questionable. A labeled map of Gaeltachts would be great to have, though. I also have another idea for you, although I don't know if it's feasible. When I was learning English, many of my textbooks included a phonetics section. In it, each sound was often illustrated with a picture of a human head, showing the exact location of the tongue and outlined of the tongue and throat movements. <a href="http://www.ling.udel.edu/colin/courses/ling101/lecture13.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.udel.edu/colin/courses/ling101/lecture13.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an example of what I mean; I am sure you've seen something like this before. I found those pictures to be the next best thing to being able to hear what the sound sounds like, and even with the sound files they would make a great addition (and would take care of all picture needs!).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Vowels#Vowel backness</b>
<ol>
<li><i>Unless otherwise noted, however, they largely hold for other Munster and Connacht accents as well.</i> The word "largely" makes my heart sink, because from this point onward it's impossible to say whether the spellings are the same for all variants, or the variations were deemed by you to be too insignificant to be mentioned. Sorry, but I am <i>that</i> nitpicky. Any way to fix this?</li>

<li>Why is <i>sh</i> in <i>a Sheáin</i> transcribed as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ç/</span>? When is <i>sh</i> pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ç/</span>, and when--as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span>?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Vowels#Nasalized vowels</b>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible to give other examples instead of <i>an tsneachta</i> and <i>sa tsnámh</i>? I see that this phenomenon is expained further down in the Phonotactics section, but at this point of the article it was rather sudden and confusing.

<dd>Hi, thanks for your comments, they will definitely be helpful in getting the article to a point where it's appropriate for more general audiences and not just trained linguists. To answer some of your specific questions:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>fómhar</i> has [u:] in some dialects because the rule that mid vowels are raised to high vowels before nasals (including the formerly nasal <i>mh</i>) applies to <i>ó</i> in many dialects. This reminds me that I didn't discuss that raising in the article at all, so I'll add a new section about it presently.</li>
<li><i>F</i> and <i>bh/mh/v</i> are often pronounced with the bilabial fricatives <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɸ, β]</span> instead of the labiodental [f, v]. Unfortunately, the published sources <i>aren't</i> very specific about when which versions are used. The same is true for palatal vs. palatovelar (not that there's a huge difference between the two in the first place -- any individual speaker probably uses both interchangeably without even hearing a difference)</li>
<li>Sometimes the standard orthography does a very poor job of representing a particular dialect's pronunciation of a word. In the dialect I got the info from, <i>scanradh</i> happens to be pronounced as if spelled <i>scamhradh</i>. The pronunciation of <i>cam</i> is /kaum/ per the discussion of lengthening/diphthongization before fortis sonorants.</li>
<li>Exactly how the fortis and lenis sonorants differ changes from dialect to dialect, as I tried to show in the chart. There isn't one unified pronunciation of the two types.</li>
<li>Images of the vocal tract like the one you link to are fine for consonants, but not much use for vowels as the differences between nearby vowels are too slight to be easily seen in them. Also, they belong more on the pages about the sound in question than in this article.</li>
<li>I'm sorry if your heart sinks at the word "largely", but this page really isn't intended to help you get from spelling to pronunciation. (That's what <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a> is for.) This page is for describing how Irish is pronounced by native speakers, regardless of the spelling. The realizations of <i>sh</i> are also discussed at <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>, though some discussion of the alternations between [h] and [ç] would probably not be amiss here.</li>
<li>I'll see what I can find about <i>stríoc</i>. There's no epenthesis when <i>cn gn</i> is pronounced <i>cr gr</i>, because epenthesis is found only in Munster, and <i>cr gr</i> for <i>cn gn</i> is found only outside Munster.</li>
<li>"...[at abstract level] vowel-initial words... all begin with either a front or back glide that triggers either palatalization or velarization... Is there a way to determine what is being triggered in each particular case?" Well, from the orthography, yes (if it starts with <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, palatalization is triggered; if it it starts with <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, or <i>u</i>, velarization is triggered), but from a purely phonological point of view, no. It has to be included as part of the lexical information of the word.</li>
<li>"Alternation" in the table refers to the fact that some forms of a word (e.g. the nominative case) have one sound (e.g. a long vowel) with other related forms (e.g. the genitive) have another sound (e.g. a short vowel).</li>

<dd>Thanks for your explanations, Angr. I <i>largely</i> find them to be helpful and to the point&#160;:) At least I am glad all that long rant above wasn't for naught--I see it prompted you to add two items to the to-do list. Me happy--it can now be justified that <a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">User:Ag Foghlaim</a> isn't just a selfish parasitic account used solely for personal gain--he can contribute something too&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Just a few follow-up comments, however:</dd>
<dd>3. Would it be feasible to explicitly mark pronunciations, so the reader would know exactly which dialect they come from?</dd>
<dd>4. Is there at least one commmon trait for the way fortis and lenis sonorants are pronounced in various dialects? Either way, do you think this deserves mentioning in this section?</dd>
<dd>5. I understand what you mean. Still, I think that having a picture for each consonant would be helpful. Having those pictures in articles about sounds is great, but since those articles aren't exactly Irish-specific, I see no harm in duplicating them here as well. Plus, you do need pictures, right? These would make for far more useful illustrations than the pictures of beautiful scenery.</dd>
<dd>6. I cannot believe that I missed something in Irish orthography--I all but pray on that thing! The way my copy of that article printed out, there is a page break right through the second portion of the <i>sh</i> section--one dealing with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span> vs. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ç/</span>, so I always glanced over it. My fault.</dd>
<dd>7. Could you add that epenthesis is only found in Munster to Irish orthography? Before I read the phonology article and your comment above, I was under impression that it is common for all dialects.</dd>

<dd>Epenthesis in words like <i>gorm</i> is common to all dialects.

<dd>Oh, and I don't know what the Irish People are talking about when they say the <i>s</i> in <i>str</i> (as in <i>stríoc</i>) is always broad. They're probably drunk.

<dd>They might well be--they are Irish, after all&#160;:) All in all, the whole course is pretty pathetic. I find it very convenient in a sense that it provides direction better than anything else available out there, but I have to re-check virtually every claim they make. This could have been a wonderful course had it not been so horribly implemented in practice. They give very simple and easy-to-understand explanations to everything, but the downside is that their explanations are often incorrect and typo-ridden (I am especially fond of their explanation of present habitual via English examples such as "I be sick" in <a href="http://www.leyline.org/cra/languages/IrishPeople/Lesson46.html" class="external text" title="http://www.leyline.org/cra/languages/IrishPeople/Lesson46.html" rel="nofollow">Lesson 46</a>). Well, that's the fate of a student of Irish, I guess.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's funny about "I be sick", and they almost got it right. In Hiberno-English, there is a contrast between "I am sick" and "I do be sick", while in <a href="../../../a/a/v/AAVE_1b6c.html" title="AAVE">AAVE</a> there is a contrast between "I sick" and "I be sick"; in both cases the first refers to the current state of affairs, and the second to something habitual. But I don't know of any modern dialect that contrasts "I am sick" with "I be sick". (Old English would have made the contrast as <i>Ic eom sēoc</i> vs. <i>Ic bēo sēoc</i>.) —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:20, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>looking over your page here I am willing to believe that your edits are not the simple vandalism I originaly mistook them for; for they are performed by an experienced editor and I don't believe someone who had contributed possitivly for so long would start vandalising now. However, the fact remains that this is a suitable article for the project. Mass murder, and war-related acts (e.g. a strike because of threats of invasion) in general are considered to be disasters (See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wars_and_disasters_by_death_toll.html" title="List of wars and disasters by death toll">List of wars and disasters by death toll</a>, it includes a "Genocide and democide" section, with a sub-section inluding among others, "Individual massacres". Thus it is proved that the article counts as a disaster, and if you see the project page you will see that the scope of our project includes "individual disasters". Therefore, I am again replacing the tag.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps if your WikiProject were called "WikiProject Disasters" I could believe it. But it's called "WikiProject Disaster <i>Management</i>"; <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_management.html" title="Disaster management">disaster management</a> is a concept developed in the 20th century and it's completely anachronistic to describe an 11th-century massacre in terms of disaster management. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 09:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alow me to quote directly from the section marked "scope" on the project page. "It also include individual disastrous events, e.g. hurricane Katrina and the Ethiopian famine in the 1980s." Therefore, I maintain this to be a suitable article for the project since, regardless of it's main focus, the project deals with individual disasters. Also, even if the concept was only developed in the 20th century, it still did happen even in the 11th. They just didn't have a name for it.

<dd>I'm not saying individual disasters like Katrina and the 1980s Ethiopian famine are outside your scope. They both involved a certain amount of disaster management during and after. But the St Brice's Day massacre certainly didn't -- not because the <i>term</i> "disaster management" hadn't been invented yet, but because the entire mindset that leads to disaster management didn't exist.

<dd>Hmmmm... thats certainly a tough one to decide - do non-human events count? (they do in my opinion, but in others...) I'll ask the project about this one. However, in general the answer to "why isn't this tagged?" is simply because no-one has gotten round to a major tagging of things in the category of disasters yet. I don't have time, but I do tag anything I happen to come across. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 18:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><tt>There are times when you have to ignore policy and do what you think is best. You and I both know that this is a sensitive and frequently targetted article, which was why I semi-protected the page. If 100% of the IP or newly registered user edits are vandalism, what's the point in keeping the page protected? People will have to constantly watchlist and monitor the page if it is left out in the open. If you semi-protect, even for just a week or two, at least it will deter IP vandalism in the future and also allow people to have some free time to work on other articles instead of patrolling for vandalism. I factored all these things and I concluded that semi-protection would be particularly useful in this type of situation. Half the vandalism on the page is crude, offensive and has potential libel concerns. Protecting seemed like the solution to me, but apparently others disagree. Ideally, you would agree with me, but since this is not the Nishkidistheboss type of world, I'd like to hear your input in this issue, and see if you have a possible re-recommendation regarding the article's protection. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 20:47, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</tt>

<dd><tt>I did do what I think was best; my decision to unprotect came from my convictions about page protection and not from policy. I know malicious vandalism is annoying (I used to have <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">Obesity</a> on my watchlist and witnessed several occurrences a day there too), but if it's really only one or two a day on most days, it can be kept on top of.

<li><tt>FWIW, with respect to such discussion, I should say that the <i>quite wrong</i> locution I employ as regards the removal of non-image speedy tags probably sounds a bit less decorous that it ought; to be sure, I meant not to malign your submission but only to suggest that your sense of how contested speedy deletions ought to be disposed is quite different from mine and that the mandating of the use of {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} where one thinks a speedy tag to have been wrongly placed (as against the permitting of the removal of the speedy tag) is not, at present, counseled by <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">policy</a>.

<p>Hi, I unprotected <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> earlier today because it's linked from the Main Page. In general, pages linked from the Main Page shouldn't be semiprotected unless the vandalism is getting so bad we can't keep on top of it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WikiProject Germany</span></h2>
<p>Sorry to see you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Germany/Members&amp;curid=7929720&amp;diff=89799928&amp;oldid=89527023" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Germany/Members&amp;curid=7929720&amp;diff=89799928&amp;oldid=89527023" rel="nofollow">leave</a> (not that "membership" actually means anything). I'd like to know what parts you find overly bureaucratic, since I don't think there is need for much bureaucracy and most things are going to be as anarcho-democra-dictatorial as always. If you dislike the assessment process (which is pretty random at the moment and certainly not bureaucratic unless you count my personal semi-dictatorial tendencies as bureaucratic) and the silly switches in the template (some of which I added mostly so I can provide a better Todo list) you could just ignore them. Of course, the major shortcoming of the project is that we have had zero impact on actual article writing so far, probably because most of the people working on the project's structure are too busy setting up "bureaucracy" to do something directly useful. I'm pretty confident it won't stay like that, though, and hope to keep things as informal as possible for a project covering so many articles. If I ever start voting for a WikiProject Germany Advisory Council or a WikiProject Germany Charter instead of being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> like a normal Wikipedian, just <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Kusma_6ba5.html" title="Special:Blockip/Kusma">shoot</a> me.

<dd>Well, the article assessment article is part of it; in general I'm opposed to article assessment since I think <i>all</i> articles could stand improvement and it's just silly instruction creep to start assigning levels of goodness to them. And the number of subpages available on the sidebar template is just getting larger than I can keep track of, and just in general the whole WikiProject seems to be overly organized and controlled and formalized. I much prefer WikiProjects like WP Languages and WP Phonetics, which function more like informal noticeboards for people interested in the topic. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 15:08, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see. I agree that <i>all</i> articles should be improved, but I like the GA and FA badges as nice pats on the back for editors (so for a mostly social reason). What I like about the assessment process is the "comments" field that is shown in the overview pages like <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Germany_articles_by_quality_1_cfd7.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Germany articles by quality/1">Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Germany articles by quality/1</a>. And there is of course the silly hope that somebody comes and actually improves one of our stubs rated as "important" on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Germany_articles_by_quality_2_1fa8.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Germany articles by quality/2">Page 2</a>. It is quite possible that this rating system is about as useful as stub sorting (i.e. not very much). Anyway, I have no evil plans of integrating or abolishing the old <a href="../../../g/s/w/WP%7EGSWN_4bd6.html" title="WP:GSWN">noticeboard</a> (and would oppose them), so there will always be a place for completely informal discussion without silly banners or membership lists, and smaller subprojects (like my pet <a href="../../../g/e/r/WP%7EGER_MZ_7c37.html" title="WP:GER/MZ">Mainz</a> "task force") will also be less bureaucratic (and potentially more useful). Okay, I have wasted enough of your time now, but I'll always listen if you have suggestions what can be improved or what is so terribly flawed that it should be deleted.
