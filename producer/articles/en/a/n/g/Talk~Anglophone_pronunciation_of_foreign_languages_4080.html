<p>The fact of the matter is that English dialects are different enough that different dialects of English will approach other languages differently and have different problems with phonemes. Should we limit our discussion to one particular dialect or a specific set of dialects or should we limit our discussion to features that occur only among most speakers of English. So most speakers may pronounce a language's rhotic as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɹ]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɻ]</span> while only speakers in a few dialects (like <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_English_132a.html" title="California English">California English</a>) will have difficulty with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔ]</span> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> is one of the few dialects that would have no difficulty with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʉ]</span>. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 08:00, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have got to remeber that foreign languages have dialects as well such as Parisian French, Québécois French, Alsantian French and Vaudois French. <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159753.html" title="User:159753">159753</a> 09:30, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but most students learn the "standard" form with very little regard to dialectal features until much later (if at all). Although I do recall an east-coast friend of mine learned Continental Spanish while I learned New World Spanish; so she speaks it with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/θ/</span> and I do not. I link that to the fact that my teacher was of Mexican descent. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 09:45, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Likewise, most foreign students learn one of the two "standard" varieties of English, i.e. either Midwestern <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> or Southeastern <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a>. Less common dialects like <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_American_English_54c1.html" title="Southern American English">Southern American English</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> are largely ignored in ESL classes. 161.24.19.82 19:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe all comparisons regarding pronunciation should be based on the language standards that are most often taught to foreign learners. In the case of Spanish, that would be Castilian Spanish (as opposed to <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rioplatense_Spanish_ad37.html" title="Rioplatense Spanish">Rioplatense</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_Spanish_c9c5.html" title="Mexican Spanish">Mexican Spanish</a>). In the case of French, the natural choice would be Parisian French, as opposed e.g. to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_French_50f7.html" title="Quebec French">Quebec French</a>. English poses an additional difficulty though in the sense that two different pronunciation standards are actually used in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_as_a_Foreign_Language_000b.html" title="English as a Foreign Language">EFL</a> classes, namely <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American English</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> (RP) British English. Likewise, in the case of Portuguese, foreign learners may be taught to speak either with a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Brazilian Portuguese">Brazilian</a> or an <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Portuguese_2388.html" title="European Portuguese">European Portuguese</a> accent (which, like General American and RP, may differ considerably from each other). Whenever the distinction between different standards/dialects is relevant to the argument, an explicit reference should be added to clarify which variety of the language has been considered.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you're getting at. The only difference that I made in the pronunciations from what you put was that I decided not to split up the geminated /l/ with a stress mark. But since we're talking about Finnish, the phrases <i>hyvää päivää, nimeni on Jaakko</i> and <i>terve, nime on Jaakko</i> should be translated in the article. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 09:45, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In Finnish, you generally don't pronounce double consonants, except when it is a suffix like -ssa/-ssä (in) or -lla/-llä (on). Thus each consonant is pronounced separately, kuka (how) is pronounced ku-ka, but kukka (flower) is pronounced kuk-ka. <i>Hyvää päivää, nimeni on Jaakko</i> means “hello, my name is Jaakko" (the Finnish version of James). <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159753.html" title="User:159753">159753</a> 10:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish_phonology.html" title="Finnish phonology">Finnish phonology</a> page, nearly every consonant has some sort of doubled form.

<p>I don't know how many of these are appropriate, since I don't know how many English speakers have the same Spanish problems that I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is already on the page, but I suffer from gender mix-ups sometimes. (For reasons unknown to me I like to think I tend to err towards the feminine.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My Spanish class has generally remembered to pronounce final /e/, but who knows?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've heard the tap "r" mispronounced as a [d]. I think this is because the former is an allophone of the latter in English.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I personally suffer from a hypercorrection of the first two problems where I don't pronounce [x], but it tend to be word-initially.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The rare word-final [x] (the only example I can think of right now is <i>reloj</i> meaning "clock" or "watch") tends to either not be pronounced or indicated by what I think is an aspiration of the preceding vowel. (I think I suffer from both of them about equally.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When learning, I've heard of orthography mix-ups where [x] is pronounced as an English /j/. For me this tended to happen with Spanish soft /g/, but now it tends to be rare for either one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We Anglophones have a bad habit (so bad that I think it's already on the page) of varying the Spanish vowels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Spanish /ñ/ isn't pronounced exactly correct. It tends to be either [nj] or palatal &lt;n&gt;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As Aeusoes1 mentioned earlier on the page, we may be taught to use [s] instead of [θ].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We might make /b/ and /v/ distinct when it's actually the same sound in Spanish, which depending on the English dialect is [β] (I think), which doesn't exist in English; [b]; or [v].</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to comment or add to the list. 18:46, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, /b/ and /v/ are equal as far as pronunciation goes, but that does not mean that there's only one way to pronounce them; depending on where they stand in a word, they can be pronounced as [β] or as [b] (not sure whether the latter symbol is the correct one, my IPA knowledge is limited). —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Elections_and_Referenda_04e7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Elections and Referenda"><i>Seen this already?</i></a></sup> 07:40, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two additions I made were removed rather than edited, which in this context seems inappropriate. The first deals with the problem English speakers have of reducing vowels in unstressed syllables to [ə] or, less commonly, to [ɪ]. I think this should be included as should the examples to clarify this phenemenon. The other is addition ws to include the IPA symbols for the fricative allophones of /b/ /d/ /g/ in syllable-final (rather than word-final) and intervocalic position.s These are, respectively, [β], [ð], and either [γ] or [ɰ]. I do not think these IPA symbols should be removed since many people won't automatically know, for example, what a frivative allophone of /b/ would be. The total removal was justified by the comment "this is not an instructional guide." While that might justify the removal of some of the advice on how to practice removing a non-native accent, it is not germane to the above-mentioned material all of which, I believe, should remain in the article.<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 23:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I removed them because I associated all the information with the instructional tone of your additions. Although it may be a little redundant, you are right that the information is appropriate. For future reference, though, &lt;γ&gt; is not the same thing as &lt;<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɣ</span>&gt;. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 00:45, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's right. Thanks, I was sloppy. I knew the &lt;γ&gt; didn't look right and wanted to be sure not to confuse it with &lt;<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɤ</span>&gt; but ended up not choosing the correct symbol, &lt;<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɣ</span>&gt;. A question or two, AEuSoes1. Aren't these allophones fricatives, rather than approximants? The only approximant is [ɰ], which in many dialect is, along with [ɣ], an allphone for /g/. I think you've removed the approximant [ɰ] several times from this article, but isn't that one of the ways /g/ us pronounced intervocally? Second, we've both reverted several times on whether the fricativazation happens in word-final or syllable-final positions. It actually seems we've both been wrong. It would be better to say that /b/, /d/, and /g/ are always realized as fricatives [β], [ð] and [ɣ], respecively, EXCEPT after a nasal (/m/ /n/) or in utterance-initial (not just word-initial) position. And for /d/ there is the additional rule that it is not realized as [ð] after laterals /l/. This is the explanation given in Barrutia, Richard and Armin Schwegler. <i>Fonética y fonologia españoles.</i> John Wiley, 2nd Edition, , 1994, pp. 116-121.<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 18:01, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>According to what I've read, the allophones are approximants. What makes things confusing is that the symbols for fricatives are used for approximants, often sans diacritics. I have heard native speakers use fricatives, and this may have to do with careful speech. Although a velar approximant is technically represented with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">&lt;ɰ&gt;</span>, my understanding of the convention is to use &lt;<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɣ</span>&gt; with a lowering diacritic; this is more for consistancy's sake since the two represent the exact same phone.</dd>
<dd>As for the distribution, your source backs up the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_phonology.html" title="Spanish phonology">Spanish phonology</a> page's explanation. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 01:00, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On this side of the world, Western and Southwestern US, in the Spanish that we encounter and try to use [x] is generally pronounced as an English /j/ as is g before e or i. That is to say, since my knowledge of IPA is so limited as to be non-existant, The x in Mexico; the g in gentes, Angel and Rangel; and the j in juntos and Javier are all pronounced as an Englsh h.</p>
<p>Also, just to make matters more confused than they already are, there is no [θ]. Final d is either a stop or nothing (a cessation of sound) depending on the context and the speaker. Even people from countries that claim to speak Castilian rather than Spanish have no [θ].</p>

<dd>It's true that the symbols can be daunting, especially at the start. This is true both for the symbols for sounds (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ə, θ, ŋ, æ, ʘ, ɤ, ɛ, ʍ</span>) and also the various framing marks which are used to show just what the inside text is supposed to mean: &lt; &gt;, / /, [ ], | |. AEuSoes1 has been especially careful in the use of these symbols, and that's a good thing. Briefly, the different framing marks are used for three purpose. Wikipedia has a good summary of these conventions in the aritcle on <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonetic_transcription.html" title="Phonetic transcription">phonetic transription</a>.

<dd>Yeah, it would create mergers. I never noticed it myself, but it makes a bit of sense.

<p>I removed the statement that " <i>final 'e' is always silent in Portuguese</i> " because that is obviously not true. Final 'e' is pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span> in Brazilian Portuguese and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɨ/</span> in European Portuguese. I also added a reference to the difficulty Anglophones have with Portuguese nasal vowels. 201.52.32.9 00:16, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the gender/number/case agreement example "the green flowers" (Sp. <i>las flores verdes</i>, Port. <i>as flores verdes</i>, German <i>die grüne Blumen/ den grünen Blumen</i>, French <i>les fleurs vertes</i>) to "the red flowers" ((Sp. <i>las flores rojas</i>, Port. <i>as flores vermelhas</i>, German <i>die roten Blumen/ den roten Blumen</i>, French <i>les fleurs rouges</i>).

<p>I removed these from the Spanish section because they are <b>grammar</b> issues and the article's title distinctly says <b>pronunciation</b>:</p>

(Snipped for brevity as I have now put the information back.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anglophone_pronunciation_of_foreign_languages&amp;diff=68909765&amp;oldid=68909433" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anglophone_pronunciation_of_foreign_languages&amp;diff=68909765&amp;oldid=68909433" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)

<p>These deserve mention somewhere, but they are grammatical, not pronuncation. –<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyluciano_4d5d.html" title="User:Andyluciano">Andyluciano</a> 22:49, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nevermind, I see now that other languages contain such information. My mistake. Maybe, though, this article should be renamed or split then? –<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyluciano_4d5d.html" title="User:Andyluciano">Andyluciano</a> 22:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't mind a rename. An article split would be unwarranted since both the phonology and the other aspects of grammar fit into the same general phenomenon of second language transfer.</dd>
<dd>Also, If we rename this page then that might lead us to also rename <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English_8a44.html" title="Non-native pronunciations of English">non-native pronunciations of English</a> in a similar fashion.

<p>I removed the following points from the section on French as they all relate to questions of grammar or usage and not specifically to pronunciation:</p>
<p><i>Quote &gt;</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers may uniformly use <i>dans</i> and <i>en</i> or mix them up, because both translate as "in" in English.</li>
<li>The word <i>de</i> means both the partitive, (some/any) and the preposition, (from/to); however, it inflects differently depends on which one. <i>Du</i>, <i>de la</i>, <i>de l'</i> and <i>des</i> for the partitve and <i>du/de</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>d'</i> and <i>des</i> for the preposition.</li>
<li>Although <i>nous</i> is the second person plural pronoun in Standard French, its use may come off as too formal since colloquial varieties are more likely to use <i>on.</i> See <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_personal_pronouns.html" title="French personal pronouns">French personal pronouns</a>.</li>
<li>Speakers may not include determiners like <i>le</i> or <i>la</i> as often as is appropriate, such as when showing the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_%28grammar%29.html" title="Object (grammar)">object</a> of a sentence.</li>
<li>English has very little <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_gender.html" title="Grammatical gender">grammatical gender</a>. As a result, mistakes may arise with the French gender system:
<ul>
<li><i>mon</i> and <i>ton</i> (possessive adjectives "my" and "your" respectively) apply to feminine nouns if they start with a vowel, English speakers may forget and say <i>ma</i> and <i>ta</i>, which are the feminine forms before words beginning in consonants.</li>
<li>Feminine and masculine articles, especially for inanimate objects, have to be memorized and speakers may mix them up. e.g. "<i>le</i> main" instead of "<i>la</i> main" (the hand), "<i>la</i> pont" instead of "<i>le</i> pont", "<i>le</i> douleur" instead of "<i>la</i> douleur" (the pain), etc.</li>
<li>Speakers may have difficulty with gender and number agreement in adjectives. e.g. "la maison blanc" instead of "la maison blan<i>che</i>" (the white house), "les fleurs rouge" instead of "les fleurs roug<i>es</i>" (the red flowers), etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beginning speakers may transfer usage of English auxiliary "be" and use "être" to reflect a continuous aspect, as in "Je <i>suis aller</i> au magasin" instead of "Je <i>vais</i> au magasin" (I am going to the shop). In this example, <i>je vais</i> can mean one of three things: I am going, I go, and I do go.</li>

<dd>I think if you look at the comments on this talk page and at <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English_8a44.html" title="Non-native pronunciations of English">Non-native pronunciations of English</a> you'll find that the general agreement is that grammar is under the scope of these articles. The problem is the article titles are not quite accurate. I'll reinclude the grammar points and you're more than welcome to suggest alternate titles to the article. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span></dd>

<p>Well, the "general agreement" in that case is wrong-headed, in my view. "Anglophone pronunciation of foreign languages" is a sufficiently interesting and worthwhile topic to merit an undiluted article in its own right.</p>
<p>A reading of the previous comments suggests that you have been happy enough, yourself, to leave the article inaccurately and misleadingly entitled for nearly eight months, so I wonder why you now graciously invite me to "suggest alternate <i>[do you mean "alternative?]</i> titles". Since you recognize the blatant inaccuracy, why have you not not moved the article yourself, or at least proposed doing so?</p>
<p>The fact that the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English_8a44.html" title="Non-native pronunciations of English">Non-native pronunciations of English</a> article has been similarly corrupted (thanks for the pointer, by the way) is as plain a case I have seen in a long time of attempting to argue that two wrongs make a right! -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 18:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"I wouldn't mind a rename" was pretty euphamistic. I'm actually not happy with the titles (I even mention this on my userpage as well as in the first section of the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Talk%7ENon-native_pronunciations_of_English_cc0d.html" title="Talk:Non-native pronunciations of English">other page</a>) but I can't think of better ones. You'll notice the section above I ask others what they think will be a good title and I've participated in earlier discussions to the same but people don't really make suggestions.</dd>
<dd>While you are entitled to your opinion, you shouldn't steamroll over years of consensus just because you don't find non-pronunciation negative transfer interesting enough.</dd>
<dd>I'm reverting your edits and suggest that you don't restore them until there is agreement to do so. For future reference, please don't remove things without getting a consensus especially when you think that there is opposition to such edits.</dd>
<dd>And yes, I guess I did mean <i>alternative</i>. I'm still open to ideas for more fitting titles. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 05:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>&gt;&gt;you shouldn't steamroll over years of consensus just because you don't find non-pronunciation negative transfer interesting enough.&lt;&lt;</i></p>
<p>What have I ever written in this discussion to lead you to suppose, Aeusoes1, that I don't find "non-pronunciation negative transfer" interesting enough? If you are relying upon mind-reading powers, then you need to know that they have failed you on this occasion.</p>
<p>To repeat what I wrote earlier: I removed [...] points from the section on French as they all relate to questions of grammar or usage and not specifically to pronunciation. I made no reference at all to the interestingness or otherwise of the points concerned. I can, however, let you know now (I didn't need to earlier, because the fact was irrelevant to my argument) that, as both a teacher and a student of languages myself, I happen to find them highly interesting. They just don't belong under the rubric <i>Anglophone pronunciation of foreign languages</i> – any more than would fascinating points concerning apples, pears, and bananas in an article on the cultivation of root vegetables.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out, given the age of the article, that the "years of consensus" can amount to no more than the best part of 13 months and a bit! But since you seem to be fully aware yourself of the mismatch between title and content, I cannot understand why you appear to be so unbold as to do nothing about it because "people don't really make suggestions". It <i>is</i> sometimes necessary, in my view, to get out the old, bold steamroller when the potholes reach a size at which they can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is that here we have an article purporting to be about the phonological and prosodical aspects of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_interference.html" title="Linguistic interference">linguistic interference</a> as realized by mother-tongue English-speakers but in fact encompassing such other matters as syntax ("Speakers [of Spanish] may place adjectives before a noun rather than after") and style ("Speakers may speak [Finnish]] too formally").</p>
<p>Three possible solutions are:</p>
<p>1. to rename the article</p>
<p>2.1 to split the article by topic (phonology, syntax, etc.)</p>
<p>2.2 to split the article by "target" language (German, Russian, etc.)</p>
<p>I am against solution 1 as the article risks becoming, if it has not already done so, over diffuse.</p>
<p>The articles created by either of the splitting options would be subdivided in terms of the other (for example, under 2.1, Phonology: German, Russian, etc. / under 2.2, German: phonology, syntax, etc.) and the new articles would, of course, be interlinked to each other as well as to the general articles on such matters as <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_interference.html" title="Linguistic interference">linguistic interference</a>.</p>
<p>Of the latter two solutions, I would support 2.2, as being of potentially greater interest to language teachers and learners.</p>
<p>Could we now have a formal discussion of these options here? -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 20:22, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we're getting off on a negative footing. I'm excited that there's someone else interested in this and the other article and I look forward to working with you. I apologize if I've seemed dismissive or overly harsh.</dd>
<dd>I agree that there is a mismatch with the titles and the content. Because both the phonology and grammar issues come from second language transfer, I don't think that this warrants separate articles. I'm not so much unbold as I am lacking in an idea for a better title. Anything we say about this article should also apply to the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English_8a44.html" title="Non-native pronunciations of English">other</a>, so although this article is only a year old the other has been around for almost three.</dd>
<dd>On a side note, something that I had been thinking about (although not actually done since I'm on a poorly executed wikibreak) is organizing the languages by family rather than alphabetically (like in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_phrases_in_various_languages.html" title="List of common phrases in various languages">List of common phrases in various languages</a>). This would help reduce the size of the articles because there are many instances of all the languages in a family having a common feature. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 22:01, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
