<p><i>Is "Anglican Church" <b>just</b> another name for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>? If not, please don't just create a redirect. Even if it is just another name, it would be useful to explain a little about the phrase "Anglican Church" and its (semantic) relation to "Church of England." --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></i></p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what is most appropriate here. The original article was essentially about the history of the Church of England. I created a new entry called 'Anglicanism' discussing people and churches that follow the traditions of the Church of England and also explaining the use of 'Anglican' and 'Episcopalian' to describe such churches. Would it be better to rename that page to 'Anglican'?</p>
<p>The Anglican communion includes 60 million members outside the UK and is not the same as the Church of England (with a few million members in England). ----<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 10:04, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is important that Anglicanism as a set of doctrines and practices has its own entry, as should the Church of England which is the historical origin of these doctrines. However, 'Anglican church' in some contexts is part of the formal name of an institution (the Anglican Church of Australia, the Anglican Church of Canada etc) and in other contexts is used informally to describe, eg the Church of England. This suggests to me that 'Anglican' would be a more useful name, but I'll think about this a little more. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudine.html" title="Claudine">Claudine</a></p>

<hr />
<p>"The ultimate head of any Anglican church is the Primate, head of the church at the national level" - this is wrong. The Archbishop of York is Primate of England but not "head of the church at the national level". Even on the assumption that it was only ever intended to refer to clerical positions, that is reserved for the Archbishop of Canterbury as Primate of All England (these are technical terms). PML.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As you said, "Primate of England" and "Primate of All England" are technical terms. The Archbishop of Canterbury is still the "Primate of the Church of England", the highest clerical position within the national church. (Although the article should mention that the Queen is the "Supreme Governor of the Church of England"). - <a href="../../../e/f/g/User%7EEfghij_b06c.html" title="User:Efghij">Efghij</a> 04:19, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me get this straight, more than half of what is to be said about the Anglican church is a minor news item from the last few weeks?

<p>I have deleted the word Protestant. Please see discussions elsewhere. Although the Roman Catholic church sometimes describes the Church of England as Protestant it does not declare itself to be Protestant on its official website or anywhere. It does contain many Protestants but that is not the same thing. There are official websites declaring it to be Catholic and ones explaining why it is not Protestant (the latter are a bit scarse) but since on religions we abide by the principle that organisations can say what they are, I have deleted the word Protestant. I have not included the word Catholic since I do not want to start repeated reruns of the arguments on the Catholicism page. Historically it is a Catholic Schism from the time of Elizabeth the First. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 10:02, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I also disagree with "The Archbishop of Canterbury is regarded as a symbolic leadership figure among many Anglican denominations, but does not hold formal authority and cannot be accurately compared to other religious leaders such as the pope." I think the position of the ABC wrt the AC (outside the CoE) is exactly the same as the pope wrt non Roman Catholic churches in communion with Rome? Albeit there is no belief in the infallibility ex cathedra and stuff--<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 10:06, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>You said something about efforts for reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church. I think it would be good if there was either a link to a page directly adressing this or further discussion of the efforts on this page.</p>

<p>Whilst I agree this article needs work, I fele to say it needs a complete re-write is unfair. Are you sayin you feel that the entire article needs a change in writing style? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">Tompw</a> 19:46, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No; but the bulk of the article is undigested 1911 Britannica; those portions need a complete rewrite. Furthermore, they are far too long; this makes the article unreadable. Finally, the article is rather short on current information. I don't interpret "complete rewrite" as meaning that every bit needs to be re-wrtiten -- but every bit needs to be examined. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 20:02, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have removed the tag, as our recent efforts have given us a page free of 1911 text, which was the original reason for the notice. There are still things imperfect about the page — the vagueness at the end of the history section, the rather "tacked-on"-feeling little sections at the end about current controversies &amp; RC relations — but it's a lot clearer now without all that gobbledygook. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 21:54, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the first sentence of the final paragraph of "What holds the communion together?" appears <i>...for certain liberal steps they have taken unilaterally.</i></p>
<p>The words "liberal" and "unilaterally" are both strongly biased towards a certain (for wont of a better word) conservative viewpoint. In particular, the idea whether the steps taken by the American and Canadian churches could be properly defined as "unilateral" is hotly debated.</p>
<p>I would suggest replacing these with more factual and non-biased descriptions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, you see, lemme explain: I am a liberal and I wrote that sentence originally. You can chalk it up partially to an earnest desire to be fair to the other side; but there's another reason too: those two words are convenient shorthand. In attempting to respond to your request today (with two different versions successively -- check the edit history), I rediscovered the fact that attempts to use scrupulously NPOV language make that bit considerably longer. There are two downsides to that: firstly, it gives the conservatives a bigger and more prominent stage; and moreover that § ("what holds the commmunion together?") should be about structures, not issues. Anyway, do you like my revised version? <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 16:53, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the explanation, and yes - I think the revised version reads in a much more neutral, well-balanced manner.</dd>

<p>Under "Recent Controversies", it referred to the controversies being over "biblical authority", which is POV. The debate is not over the authority of scripture, but its interpretation. No church in Communion disagrees that the Bible is the inspired word of God, but not all agree that it condemns homosexuality. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 13:30, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if the Queen ever attends the Scottish Episcopal Church. I don't think there is a legal impediment from her doing so. I am fairly certain that a member of the C of E would have to formally convert if they wanted to become a member of the Church of Scotland, but I don't know what that process would be. A member of the Church of Scotland who wanted to convert to C of E (or SEC in Scotland) would have to be confirmed by an Anglican bishop.<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockhopper10r_ae97.html" title="User:Rockhopper10r">Rockhopper10r</a> 19:18, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rockhopper is wrong. You do not need to convert to join the Church of Scotland. The Church recognises baptism of all Christian denominations, and will admit any Christian into full membership. Normally, if someone has been a member otr 'confirmed' in another denomination, the local Kirk Session will be willing to admit them to the role of the congregation without any further vows or rites. Member of the Church of Scotland do not have to be presbyterians (elders do), they only have to be Christians. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 10:52, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine, but that's an Anglican POV. Actually it is a lot less formal that 'going before a Kirk Sesson', mostly (and it happens all the time) folk jusy 'I'd like to be a member' and the minister says OK (with the Session rubberstamping at the next meeting). If that's converting, I'm not sure what it is converting to or from? I even know of one Church of Scotland minister who is also an ordained Anglican priest - that's more unusual, but not problematic. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 15:03, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cheers. Still seems to leave QEII in a somewhat special position, by which the Church of Scotland gets some guarantee/protection of its status as the <i>national church</i>.

<dd>It does leave the Church in a special position with regards to the law, but not the Queen in regard to the church. (The Kirk gets the best of both worlds, recognised and protected, but not answerable).

<p>My current understanding re QEII and the Church of Scotland is as follows:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The monarch is recognised as a member of the Church of Scotland, but whether she is listed on the role of any particular congregation (like any other member) is unclear.<br /></dd>
<dd>The monarch has no position in the Church equivalent to that of Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Which means, for example, that she has no role in appointments to office within the Church of Scotland.<br /></dd>
<dd>The monarch is sworn to protect the Church of Scotland, and the Church is recognised as the "National Church".<br /></dd>
<dd>The monarch or her representative is routinely invited to speak at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, an invitation not routinely extended to a simple member of the Church or member of the general public.<br /></dd>
<dd>There is a widespread but questionable belief that the monarch is a simple or ordinary member of the Church of Scotland. The monarch is not the Supreme Governor, anything like it, but she does appear to have a special position, representing or symbolising the relationship between Church and State or the status of the Church with respect to the State.<br /></dd>

<p><i>Efforts have been underway at least since 1966 to effect a reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church, focusing on theological issues [2] and ways "to further the convergence on authority in the Church. Without agreement in this area we shall not reach the full visible unity to which we are both committed." [3] Since that time, two major developments in the Anglican Communion have rendered such reconciliation virtually impossible, at least in the near future, namely, the ordination of women and the ordination of (and approval of) practicing homosexuals.</i></p>
<p>The term "practicing homosexual" can be construed as very offensive and patronizing to GLBT persons. I'm not quite sure to word this without using it. "Noncelibate" doesn't sound much better and, honestly, "homosexual" in and of itself can be problematic.

<dd>Refusing to ordain "noncelibate people" (whether homo- or heterosexual) would seem to be an impediment for the Roman Church in its quest to be reconciled with its Anglican counterpart. Rome does not ordain "practicing heterosexuals" either.--<a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuck_37fe.html" title="User:Bhuck">Bhuck</a> 06:46, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not entirely correct. In some circumstances, the RCC will ordain married males if it is understood that no furture marriage is possible. For example, there is a program to ordain clergy who leave the member churches of the anglican Communion to join the RCC. The RCC also ordains married deacons. I think that non-celibate is the best term as long as it is understood that celibacy is sexual bahavior consistant with one's state of marriage. An alternative is chaste.

What is the problem here? You seem he!! bent on covering up this information on main articles as if this were something that wasn't happening? Perhaps you are ashamed of homosexual ordination or something. But, it is an essential element for understanding the Anglican Communion today. This material in now way can be removed from this article! This is not single-interest and not US only. If TEC splits, the Church in Canada will likely follow as well as New Zealand. The CofE is poised for a split which has already been threatened by the Evangelicals. Read up on the Covenant for the Church of England which was delivered to the ABC on Dec. 17, the same day the Virginia parishes voted to separate. That was a threat of schism.</p>
<p>Before you go about editing willy-nilly on these topics, you really need to educate yourself on them!129.74.165.42 03:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Wassupwestcoast, and think your response to his comments was rather disrespectful. I also think your edit changing the heading is a good example of sensationalism.
