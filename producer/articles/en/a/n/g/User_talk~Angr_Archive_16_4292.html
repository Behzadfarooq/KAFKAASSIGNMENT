<h2><span class="mw-headline">question about Image:Wiki top 10 built-50%.jpg</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I put the PUIdisputed tag on Image:Wiki top 10 built-50%.jpg because it was incorrectly marked as {{<a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb-screenshot_7324.html" title="Template:Web-screenshot">web-screenshot</a>}} and there didn't seem to be a fair use rationale, especially when the watermark indicated that the site's operators didn't want people using the image without their permission.</p>
<p>I'm not out to get the image deleted but can you explain why the PUI dispute was considered resolved? Thanks. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 16:34, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess because no one had discussed it any more since July 17. I didn't see that the discussion indicated the image should be deleted, nor did I see any evidence the discussion was ongoing. Anyway, I've moved the PUI discussion to Image talk:Wiki top 10 built-50%.jpg. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 07:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You originally tagged these images I think, I asked Tyrenius however he pointed you out as a more likely avenue and I do think this is your call as you have already attempted to deal with him. This is basically the same as the message I left with Tyrenius (i appologise for the minor non-specific nature of the request)</p>
<p>He has also uploaded images of all the victims, these are however, small and probably fair use, and will be correctly tagged by me.

<dd>He hasn't been removing tags from images, though, and that's all that really matters. Once he's read the warning on his talk page that the image will be deleted if he doesn't act, he's free to remove the warning. (It's not a warning about his conduct, after all.) However, the point of keeping images up at PUI for 2 weeks is to allow the uploader time to fix them, and by removing the warnings from his talk page he's saying he doesn't intend to. So I'll go ahead and delete them now. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 08:24, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there. I noticed you took the liberty to delete an article on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Szlaszewski_ac58.html" title="Stefan Szlaszewski">Stefan Szlaszewski</a> without any voting nor discussion (not to mention notification of the author), claiming the guy was non-notable. Could you possibly restore it? Just in case you wondered, a high-ranking officer of the armed forces (a Colonel) and a person awarded with the country's highest military award (Virtuti Militari) is certainly notable enough to merit separate article. Besides, this particular guy is notable as the CO of only one of six units of the Podhale Rifles. There were circa 300 or more regiments in the Polish Army altogether, but only six prestigious Podhale Rifles regiments - and the guy was a CO of one of them, which makes him even more notable. Thanks in advance. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 20:22, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Speedy deletion is customarily done without a vote or notification of the author. Nothing in the article asserted that he was in any way more notable than any of the hundreds of thousands of colonels in armies around the world. Being a commanding officer of a military unit is hardly unusual for a colonel. The article didn't even mention that he was awarded the Virtuti Militari, though again, there must be hundreds of people awarded their country's highest military award every year, so even that isn't particularly notable. I don't see any way that speedy deletion under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">criterion A7</a> was unjustified. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:37, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I already mentioned, there were not thousands, but exactly six of people of that class at that time. Six. Also, the highest military award is the highest specifically because it's not awarded to <i>just anyone</i>. To give you a hint, for the entire World War II, fought by the Polish forces on all fronts and at home, there were some 5000 <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuti_Militari_a9ad.html" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> recipients altogether. Compare that to millions of Poles to take part in the war. Anyway, you could have asked me to expand the article if you were unsure of the notability - and apparently this was the case. Anyway, I'm restoring the stub and will do some work on it in the future. And I must admit that I'd appreciate it if you were less trigger-happy in the future.

<p>Hi Angr, yesterday I received a notification from Fritz Saalfeld (see my talk page) that the above image is listed under possibly unfree. Unfortunately I had not the chance to do anything about that as the image was deleted within 1 day by you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Image:Debian-package-cycle.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Image:Debian-package-cycle.png" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The image is surely under the artistic license (if I am not mistaken this was noted on the page) and I am pretty sure I have a permission (by email) to use it under GFDL. Therefore, I ask you to restore the image / page for a few days in order to give me the chance to prove the we rightly can use the image.</p>

<dd>Okay. Mostly it was deleted because it was tagged as a screenshot, which it pretty clearly wasn't. Please forward a copy of the e-mail giving permission to use it under the GFDL to permissions@wikimedia.org. From reading the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_License_a06a.html" title="Artistic License">Artistic License</a> article, I don't think that license by itself is free enough. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 13:55, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi. Discussion, illustration and attempted enforcement of wikiphilosophies belong on the respective pages associated <i>with</i> that philosophy, not in individual FACs. Your objections to several FACs on the basis of subjective fair use criteria are inappropriate and inconsiderate of the work that's been conducted on those pages. It looks like you copy-pasted the same response to every FAC, only to change it to add the respective kb and image count associated.</p>
<p>This is disrespectful to your fellow editors and the dedication they have poured into developing their articles. FAC is a place to judge articles based on their own merits, not a playground for enforcing personal interpretations of subjective concepts. If you'd like to see such a concept enforced in FACs, first discuss the matter where it belongs and get it to become policy that we can't use images. Until then, discussion of the matter doesn't belong in FAC. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 14:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Attempting to enforce the single most widely flouted Wikipedia policy, at the very least in those articles that some would have us believe reflect Wikipedia's best work, is entirely appropriate. When my fellow editors' "dedication" consists of stealing other peoples' images and putting them into articles, I feel entirely justified in refusing to stand by and let them get rewarded for it. Why on earth should any article be called "Wikipedia's best" and possibly be featured on the front page when it's full of images that someone unaffiliated with Wikipedia worked hard and/or paid lots of money to produce? It's disgusting that there are already so many FAs that violate fair-use policy, and I will continue to object to future FACs that do. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 14:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You do realize that <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> is codified in copyright law, right? Whatever your personal moral standing on the matter is, that has no place in Wikipedia. Nor does mine. In the capacity of being editors, we have to check our personal feelings at the door and recognize policies and legal codes — even if we don't agree with them — as they apply. If we can't do that, then we can't be productive editors <i>here</i>. If we're going to be, we have to agree to recognize how Wikipdia operates. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 18:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You do realize that, no it isn't, right? Fair use is a defense against claims of copyright violation, but it's never defined. As the article <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> makes clear, there are only some guidelines to consider when deciding whether or not something is fair use, but it doesn't tell you how to interpret those guidelines. Legal precedents give some guide as to how courts have interpreted in the past, but only a lawsuit against Wikipedia will determine whether the images you stole for your article can be defended as "fair use" or not. I'd rather there not be such a lawsuit in the first place. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 18:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um... it either is or it isn't, and given that it exists, it is. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. And again, we check our personal ideas of morality at the door when we come to work on Wikipedia and we do things according to Wikipedia's design. As Wikipedia allows for fair use images and encourages their use, we can use them. Until policy has been altered such that we can't, we can and will do so. And please stop slinging around the word "steal". Your accusation is horrid, disrespectful, inaccurate and extremely unappreciated. Drop it. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 19:56, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It exists, but it isn't <i>codified</i>, as you claimed. And where you get the idea that Wikipedia editors have to leave their morality at the door, I truly don't understand. Wikipedia <i>tolerates</i> fair use images when they are absolutely indispensable; it by no means encourages their use. And if you have a suggestion for another word meaning "to take someone else's property without their permission" besides "steal", I'd be glad to hear it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's not codified with black and white specifics, no, but it's been included <i>within</i> the law. As for where I get the idea that Wikipdia editors have to leave their morality at the door is from the policies. Examples: neutral point of view and no censorship. If we have a personal moral opinion of something, we can't put that in an article or try forcing Wikipedia to operate according to that opinion. If we feel that it's wrong for relevant images of pornography to be viewable, we can't get rid of them just because we feel that way. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and, as such, doesn't care about such things.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for encouraging or not encouraging, of course images that don't have to be qualified under fair use are preferred, but the fact that the encyclopedia recognizes the exception that is fair use, informs us of it, and explains to us how to implement it is encouraging when a free alternative isn't available. The Wikimedia Foundation could have easily said that images that aren't altogether free of copyright holders are not allowed. They didn't, however.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, how are we "taking someone else's property"? We're not claiming it as our own. Stealing something is to take it for yourself, to give and use and claim as you see fit. We're not doing that. We're trying to <i>better describe <b>their</b> work</i> in a respectable manner, all the while giving them full credit for the illustration, and readily willing to remove the images if they should ask that it be so. Do you know how many screenshots video game websites like IGN and GameSpot have? Do you think the developers see that as stealing their work? How many years have they had by now to demand that it be taken down?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>They understand that those images are being used to show people what the work is about, which in turn equals more people having an interest in the work, which in turn equals more people buying the work, which in turn equals more profit for the developers. This isn't like copying someone's book and posting it on the internet. You can't fully get the experience of a game out of looking at a handful of screenshots that attempt to succintly describe the game. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 20:18, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>NPOV and no censorship apply to article content only. I'm perfectly entitled to hold my POV that fair-use images have no business in an encyclopedia touting itself as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_content.html" title="Free content">free content</a>, and to reflect that view when voting against FACs. Your last two paragraphs above make me think you interpret your encyclopedia article as a form of advertising for the game, which is even more worrisome than your instance on using "fair use" images in it. If an encyclopedia article results in more people buying the game and increasing the developers' profits, then there is something fundamentally wrong with the encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:42, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In any event, you are perfectly entitled to have your POV. You're not perfectly entitled to push it as fact and policy when it isn't. The standard for FACs isn't the Gospel According to Angr. If it becomes <i>official</i> policy that we don't use fair use images, then the presence of fair use images will become grounds for objection. Not before. Please try to understand this. If you want your opinion of fair use images to be grounds for objection in FACs, then make an effort to have Wikipedia policy changed — and succeed. Until then, you're just disrespecting people and cluttering FACs based on your own personal opinion which can't be supported by anything but itself. That's really what this boils down to and I don't see what more there is to be said about the matter until policy has changed. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 20:52, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Existing policy allows for fair use images and doesn't mean "zero" when it says "as little as possible". That clearly doesn't mean "as little as is technically possible". It means "as little as is possible in terms of contributing significantly" and "as little as is possible where free alternatives may be available". So, no, you haven't been. Really, if you want to get this policy changed, work to get it changed. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 10:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my vote, I didn't say the article should have zero images, I said it should have one or two. If I were voting on the basis of my personal wikiphilosophy, I would vote against every single FAC simply on the grounds that having any "featured articles" at all is a profoundly stupid idea. But opposing an FAC on the grounds that it uses more "fair use" images than it needs is sticking to existing policy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 10:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr, I just noticed you removed a URL that i added to the Yiddish Language site with the remark it contains popup adds. I am not entirely sure about Wikimedia policy regarding adding URL's but my site (a non-commercial one intended to point scholars in the direction of archives etc) has no popup windows or any form of advertising on it (it is a Virtual Library site and such a thing is also contrary to VL standards). So i wonder what the problem was, perhaps something is going on i am not aware of. Best, Gerben</p>

Susbstantial action was taken to accomodate the issues you and AMIB brought up with the images, so I'd appreciate some feedback on that. I made a list of all the changes I made, which you can read in the FAC. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 01:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey. Thanks for coming back to comment. I've clarified what is meant in the images' fair-use rationale by "distinctive art style" for each image and added additional fair-use rationale where necessary.

<dd>Hey, Angr. Any chance of getting some additional feedback from you soon? I hope that my elaborations in the fair-use rationale have brushed away your concerns. While I haven't thought every objection you've ever made was a good one (though, in this FAC, I have; that's why I've been making an effort to address your and AMIB's image concerns; they were well-grounded; at the very least, I've understood your concerns and made an effort to explain why such-and-such image was notable/necessary/representative of the game's art style). Come back as soon as you get a chance, please. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 03:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that you unilaterally deleted <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Hassan Nasrallah Hezbollah.jpeg">Image:Hassan Nasrallah Hezbollah.jpeg</a>, both on Commons on here. On Commons there had been some debate about the pic...However, here, on English Wikipedia there has not been any objections to the picture as qualifying to the fair use license, which states that reproduction of billboards - even if they have copyright - is fair use according to US copyright (which applies since the Wikipedia servers are located in the US). An anon user has however continued to tag the image, but as they refused to argue the case, the image ended up being semi-protected. I tried several times, without any succes, to persuade the anon user to argue their case on the talk page...So I am indeed surprised that someone (even with admin status I assume) unilatarely deletes an image to which the debate demonstrated consensus on its fair use. Did you not even have a look at the talk page before deleting??? <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 14:18, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I read the talk page. And I read the text of {{<a href="../../../p/o/l/Template%7EPoliticalposter_ad97.html" title="Template:Politicalposter">Politicalposter</a>}}, which says "for identification and critical commentary on the poster itself or the political movement it represents", which is not how the image was being used in the article.

<dd>For another time I wish you will care to express your views on the talk page before deleting, especially when the consensus is the in disacord with you opinion. I have no idea how the use of the image can be interpreted as not being "for identification and critical commentary on the poster itself or the political movement it represents".

<dd>I have no opinion on the image one way or the other. I read the discussion and saw no valid fair-use arguments being made, let alone consensus on the matter. If you care to write up a fair-use rationale for the image and show that its use in the article is consistent with the {{<a href="../../../p/o/l/Template%7EPoliticalposter_ad97.html" title="Template:Politicalposter">Politicalposter</a>}} tag, I will be glad to undelete it for you. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 14:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please explain to me why you removed my entry for English keywords</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I want you to know that there is a reason that I put those there. The reason is first and foremost because they need to be found somewhere. Moreover, I did a search for nearly one hour, using google, to find a webpage that contained a simple list of english keywords and their functions. Yet, I did not find a single web page. Therefore, I found it absolutely necessary to compile a list of these essential words in the english language. In my opinion, while they are used for rhetoric, they are also used in a striclty grammatical sense for structural composition, reasoning, and understanding. Since you are a Ph.D. in linguistics (i saw on your home page), I would like to request that you either accept these as part of the english language entry (which in my opinion it should be) or somehow characterize them into a sub-entry or rhetoric or compositional entry. Its funny how you mention that they are part of rhetoric, yet there is no rhetoric wiki page for english. In any case, the existence of these functional english keywords on wiki is absolutely necessary, wherever it may be. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ericdz33 (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricdz33_0fff.html" title="User talk:Ericdz33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ericdz33_8eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ericdz33">contribs</a>) 19:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I deleted it primarily because it's not really about the English language per se, it's about the usage of individual words in writing. The same comments could be made about the equivalent words in any other language, so there's nothing specifically about English in the section. There are also more policy-oriented reasons to delete the section: it does not <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, making it <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>; it seems to be mostly <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> on your part. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:02, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I think that you should undelete it and find somewhere to put. Otherwise, I will continue to post it because, while you state citability and verifiability as policy, there is no full-fledged enforced policy that wikipedia users must abide by. The keyword here is "must". That is a word that brings to light the actual policy of wikipedia as one of "should" and not "must". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ericdz33 (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricdz33_0fff.html" title="User talk:Ericdz33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ericdz33_8eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ericdz33">contribs</a>) 21:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC).</small>

Fair enough, although there is of course no reasonable way the creator (I) could have known that this same context was previousy deleted.

<dd>Actually, most of the discussion there is about the coat of arms image, not the flag image. For the flag, at the very least you need to give the URL of the page you got it from (it isn't on <a href="http://www.capetown.gov.za/" class="external free" title="http://www.capetown.gov.za/" rel="nofollow">http://www.capetown.gov.za/</a>, the page listed on the image description page). Also, the {{<a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">Logo</a>}} tag shouldn't be used, as a flag isn't the same thing as a logo. The {{<a href="../../../i/n/s/Template%7EInsignia_c623.html" title="Template:Insignia">Insignia</a>}} tag should be used, but it has to be <i>in addition</i> to the copyright tag, it isn't a copyright tag itself. Now, for some reason I don't understand, flags are treated like coats-of-arms here, in that whoever draws a particular rendering of a flag gets to license that particular version of it. (<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_South_Africa.svg_d2cb.html" title="Image:Flag of South Africa.svg">Image:Flag of South Africa.svg</a> is apparently in the public domain simply because <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESKopp_e772.html" title="User:SKopp">User:SKopp</a> drew that version of it and put it into the public domain.) I'd say the best way to keep the image of the Cape Town flag is to draw a version of it yourself, or ask some other Wikipedian to do so if you're not much of an artist. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 04:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Restoration_of_the_ICB2_page." id="Restoration_of_the_ICB2_page."></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Restoration of the ICB2 page.</span></h2>
<p>I would like to request that you unlock the "ICB2" Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>According to the history of the page, it has been locked since late March, and I believe that the deletion and locking of the page was an unnecessary and unproductive action; the page referenced a unique, active community that has roots in and connections with the "Insider Community Board" mentioned on the "IGN" page, and removing it not only serves as a way to morally undermine the foundation of the community, but also deprives new members of the community of customs, inside jokes, and other niceties that may not be readily apparent. From things I've read, there are several different (though unstated) reasons for having taken down the page, varying from the importance of the website as dictated by a web traffic counter to the fact that "some facts were unverifiable" to "the user base of this site is too small to justify a page".</p>
<p>Seeing as how Wikipedia is a user-maintained community (and the fact that the ICB2ers did maintain the page when it was still active), it certainly did no harm or served no ill purpose when the page existed; it was not sloppily constructed and poorly maintained like many Wikipedia pages that still float unnoticed, and the integrity of the page and its information (facts included) had been maintained by the community of the ICB2.</p>
<p>Though many may not expressly view it as an extension of IGN, the Insider Community Board at IGN was the basis for the creation of the ICB2, employing very much of the same user base as the ICB (with more users than the ICB, explained further down), but with more emoticons, markup, and other qualities than what IGN employs, and more freedom on how users can post (and thus the ability to openly express viewpoints and criticims) with little fear of punishment or retribution from a biased moderator or authority figure. Best of all, the ICB2 is completely FREE (as opposed to access to IGN's ICB, which requires an "Insider" subscription that costs $19.95 a year just to access), and thus these people do not have to pay just to stay in contact with friends in an open forum. However, the ability of new users to adjust to the board system and current users to maintain a record of its customs, jokes, etc. is severely diminished by the inability to put a page on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Many people (myself included) would not be able to find information and sites like the ICB2's if each one was quashed so swiftly and with little research. Some people (myself included) use Wikipedia to confirm things they don't know exist, or know very little about. Stopping the re-creation of that page is akin to preventing people from finding it on Wikipedia, just to see if it's there. After all, since both the ICB and the ICB2 employ much of the same userbase, wouldn't it be fair to say that the ICB does not deserve mention on the IGN page since it employs the same users, but with less freedom?</p>
<p>Please take this into consideration; please do not ruin this opportunity to foster debate and free thought.</p>

That status doesn't imply that an article is finished (look at <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VI_262d.html" title="Final Fantasy VI">Final Fantasy VI</a> for instance; one of the sections is about an upcoming rerelease; as such, the section is labeled with a "future game" template). The FA template placed on FAs' talk pages even says "If you see a way this page can be updated or improved without compromising previous work, please feel free to contribute". The status only implies that it's of a certain quality. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 01:59, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Officially it isn't supposed to imply that an article is finished, but de facto it does. All too often I have attempted to make improvements or additions to a featured article, only to have them reverted by the page's "protector" with the argument "this is the version the article was featured with". So it seems to me that FA status stagnates the page and hinders growth. If any page I've contributed a lot to were nominated, I would certainly oppose on the grounds of incompleteness. If I were feeling especially sarcastic, I might also oppose on the grounds that the writing is too good. Almost every time I read "Today's featured article" from the main page, I shake my head in dismay at the poor writing that the majority of FAs display. So if I were in a particularly bitchy mood, I might oppose the promotion of an article I've contributed to on the grounds that the writing would have to be worsened to bring the article down to FA status. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 05:51, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think I understand where you're coming from. Once an article reaches FA status, it often gets protected extensively. To be honest, I've been guilty of that myself, though once an article reaches FA, there's sometimes not a lot of really obvious improvements that can be made (which isn't to say that there aren't sensible changes that can be implemented; <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a>'s quality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Final_Fantasy_X#Significant_deficiencies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Final_Fantasy_X#Significant_deficiencies" rel="nofollow">improved drastically</a> a couple of months after it became a featured article, just before its stint on the front page; this was due to those changes mentioned in the link and a few others I don't believe were brought up there). Though I acknowledge it could be argued that it's not so much that an article can't be improved as it is that its regular editors are overlooking something, which often happens too.</dd>

<dd>Some FACs do have inadequate prose at times, but the FAC process usually cleans it up through the advice of dedicated copyeditors. Personally, I strongly encourage trying to get articles to the status of FA. Not only does it guarantee the article better exposure and recognize it for its [presumably high] quality, but the nomination process more often than not results in an analysis that thoroughly ensures it deserves FA status if it gets there. Perhaps your bad experiences with editing have soured you to the prospect, but I have always found it to be a beneficial and rewarding process, both for the article I was working on and myself. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 16:37, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not just talking about poor writing in FACs, I'm talking about poor writing in FAs that are on the front page -- these are articles that have already gone through the FAC process, and whose editors have known for a week or two that the article is about to be on the front page, and <i>still</i> the writing is crap. And on top of everything else, I think it would just be arrogant of me to nominate my own work to be declared "Wikipedia's best". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:28, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as the humility issue, if those are your feelings on the matter, I guess you should do what's best for you. Personally, if I feel like my work's good enough, I'm going to make every attempt to get it recognized as being among the best articles on Wikipedia. I know it won't be perfect, and theoretically can never be finished, but I count on contributors from Peer Review and FAC to help ensure that its quality is enhanced to the point that it meets FA criteria.

<p>Hi, I think Juro won't allow to write this article. Every Hungarian editor will give up work under these circumstances. The Slovakization article is becoming a second article about <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magyarization.html" title="Magyarization">Magyarization</a> with only the grievances of Slovaks before 1918 and the gloriousity of Czechoslovakian minority policy.

<dd>But I've addressed everything you brought up. The only thing you said last time was that you don't understand how the game has a distinctive art style or why representations of certain aspects of the game are important enough to be portrayed. I've expanded the fair-use rationale for each to explain all that. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 19:56, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not quite all I said. I said "I'm still not convinced that most of these images are showing important aspects of the game <i>in a way a text description would be unable to</i>, but I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on that" (emphasis added). I'm not saying the article violates fair-use policy, but I still don't see why a text description isn't sufficient. For comparison, I recently read <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_%28video_game%29.html" title="Fahrenheit (video game)">Fahrenheit (video game)</a>, because it's a game my husband is particularly fond of; the only image in that article is the box cover and still I didn't feel anything was missing from that article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:15, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's not exactly a comparable item. <i>Fahrenheit</i> is not nearly as well known, nor as old (it isn't even a year old), nor nearly so relevant to the history of gaming. It's not what you'd call a cornerstone in the industry, unlike <i>VII</i>. Really, <i>VII</i>'s effects are being realized even more now than they already were. They've not even finished the <i>Compilation of Final Fantasy VII</i> project that began a couple of years ago. This title really has to be approached differently from <i>Fahrenheit</i>. They're in completely different classes.</dd>

<dd>Where this relates to how a text description wouldn't be able to explain certain things is that it wouldn't be able to describe the appearances of the game's [very] notable characters (not without a lot of side-tracking anyway). They're icons of the RPG genre in and of themselves, really. It's arguable that battles could be described in text or that Midgar is already described well enough (personally, though, I don't think the prose does this one justice), but the field map representation is needed, I think. I say this because this is <i>the</i> first console RPG to have that kind of field map system. Describing how navigation is performed in this game is really not all that different from describing it for a 2D game, but it's still a different breed of beast because this was the first to do this in 3D.</dd>

<dd>As for the image of Aeris and Sephiroth, while the text conveys the idea well enough (Sephiroth stabs Aerith), we don't have an image of Sephiroth anywhere else, and he's the main villain (and one of the most popular video game characters). Not only does this image allow him to be represented, but it's also being used to depict what is the most notable in-game event in gaming history. I can understand if you're not convinced with the battle image (though I think depicting battles is important because of how important it is to the game's progression) or the image of Midgar, but with the others, consider them in light of what I've mentioned, even if you don't change your mind. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 20:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know my standards for inclusion of fair-use images are much higher than most people's. To me, it's already a compromise to say fair-use images are acceptable only if the article would be incomprehensible without them. I do think our fair-use policy is far too lenient, and that your article does not violate that very lenient policy. But if a comparison with <i>Fahrenheit</i> is inapt, how about a comparison with <a href="../../../../de/f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_%28Spiel%29_6083.html" class="extiw" title="de:Final_Fantasy_(Spiel)">de:Final Fantasy (Spiel)</a>? German Wikipedia has just one article dedicated to the entire series, with no pictures at all. I won't pretend their coverage is as comprehensive as yours, but the section on FF7 is perfectly adequate. It discusses the story (but without revealing that Sephiroth kills Aerith), the characters and their abilities, the reasons why it's a Playstation game and not a Nintendo game, and the fact that it's available for Windows too. I don't think a German reader would come away from that article confused because it has no pictures. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 21:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that they would necessarily walk away with a thorough understanding of the subject either, though. As you've said, for one thing, the article over there isn't nearly as comprehensive. (I've briefly spoken with one of the German editors before, and they expressed dissatisfaction with the <i>Final Fantasy</i> article over there because of how everything's lumped together and not comprehensive.) While I won't say that a reader would necessarily be <i>confused</i> if there weren't any images, they wouldn't be as well informed either.</dd>

If anything, it has improved the quality of image use.</dd>

<dd>There's a sourced statement that messages were communicated in Welsh in the Balkan war, but not one that Welsh has been used in the same as Navajo was (a coded message that, once decoded, was still in a language the enemy was unlikely to understand). At least, that's what it sounds like; since I don't have access to the Independent article referenced, I don't know whether or not it says the messages were in coded Welsh. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 07:44, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the Wiki claim isn't that Welsh was used in the *same* manner as Navajo; it's that it was used in a *similar* manner. The relevant text from the reference is <i>"When tension in Bosnia was close to breaking point, the Royal Welch Fusiliers communicated in Welsh over the radio, thwarting eavesdroppers from the warring factions."</i>. The *purpose* is the same; the *technique* is not, which is why the Navajo and Welsh can be said to have used their languages in ways that are similar, but not the same. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 07:48, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Yes I admit it, there are a large number of photos which I uploaded thinking they were free, but on closer inspection, and possibly because of legislative changes, probably aren't.(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeith_Edkins_AFPCopyVio_3415.html" title="User:Keith Edkins/AFPCopyVio">Full list here</a>). There was some discussion back in February and others thought these might prove to be works of the UK government and hence free, but I thought it was unlikely and I was certainly in no position to prove it. My feeling is that the safest procedure is if I go through the en wikipedia articles removing references to these images and then flag them all for deletion. What think you?--<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeith_Edkins_bd11.html" title="User:Keith Edkins">Keith Edkins</a> <small>( <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeith_Edkins_82cc.html" title="User talk:Keith Edkins">Talk</a> )</small> 08:28, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That sounds like a good idea. I came across them because of their copies at Commons, which I am in the process of deleting. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 08:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr. I saw that you have a degree in linguistics, and that you are a veteran of sorts around the linguistic articles here, so perhaps you can aid me. Do you know any reliable linguistic resources on the internet which can help me cite a lot of unreferenced facts in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> (such as "All consonants in Indo European languages are Pulmonic")? I've been using google books in order to find books like this, but they only show a few pages of each book. Is there a reliable internet site which indexes linguistic facts/IPA facts? Thanks. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 16:07, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the Internet, probably not. The linguistics community just isn't that Internet-friendly yet. I'm afraid you'll have to go down to the library and look at some dead trees!&#160;;-) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 16:11, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL.

<p>Given your magnificent addition to the list of three-word-or-more compounds, I feel you are the right person to turn to—I beg the favor of your examining my work on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_plural.html#Plurals_.28and_singulars.29_of_headless_nouns" title="English plural">English plural#Plurals (and singulars) of headless nouns</a> and adjusting as you see fit. I am an amateur; you, I trust, can bring something more than love and devotion to the matter. (PS: The article used to describe <i>blues</i> only as a mass noun; as I've explicated in the newly created <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_plural.html#Nouns_with_identical_singular_and_plural" title="English plural">English plural#Nouns with identical singular and plural</a> subsection, a "blues" is also an individual song in the style, of which there can be one--like "St. Louis Blues"--or many.) (PPS: If you check out the article's History page, you will note my near-innumerable revisions. Forgive me—I'm a copyeditor by both habit and profession.)

<p>Hi Angr. I know you listed this user's images on <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a>, and I just wanted to let you know that he's re-uploaded them again with {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}}, which they obviously aren't. However, that's not the main issue. He contines to revert the <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawab_Akbar_Bugti_71b0.html" title="Nawab Akbar Bugti">Nawab Akbar Bugti</a> to a much earlier version, thus erasing everyone else's contributions. Additionally, the version that he keeps reverting to is <i>before</i> he died, and it seems that I'm the only one that notices this. I've tried to contact this user repeatedly but to no avail. When he reverts again, can you please do something about it? Meanwhile, another user, Neville123 also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Neville123&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Neville123&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">uploaded</a> the same images with false copyright tags. At this point I'm not sure what to do.
