<p>This article was not written with a NPOV. Slight modification was made to assert that, while members of the ACN believe that it will succeed ECUSA after Lambeth 2008, that this is not necessarily so. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Brkarekinm (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brkarekinm_c11b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brkarekinm">contribs</a>) 03:32, September 7, 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The role and the perception of the ACN seem to be changing rapidly, so I added a 'current events' banner.</dd>
<dd>Due to the rapid change and strong opinions, this article needs good fact-checking (<a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>) and references (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) even more than most. I added the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">Template:Not verified</a> banner, to alert those who have added facts to go back and check them. The phrases that concern me most are:
<ul>
<li><i>Most of these diocese and parishes are in the process of leaving</i></li>
<li><i>embryonic autonomous province</i></li>
<li><i>recognised as such by a signiicant majority</i></li>
<li><i>have de facto left ECUSA</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>However, other phrases will concern other readers and editors. --<a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_e9d7.html" title="User:Hroðulf">Hroðulf</a> (or Hrothulf) (<a href="../../../h/r/o/User_talk%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_0e3a.html" title="User talk:Hroðulf">Talk</a>) 09:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article "Following the Money", by Jim Naughton is a source not affiliated with the Anglican Communion Network that comments on it and other groups sympathetic to the Network. Here is the link: <a href="http://www.edow.org/follow/" class="external free" title="http://www.edow.org/follow/" rel="nofollow">http://www.edow.org/follow/</a>&#160;; see part II especially. Athough it is not NPOV, it does have sources and would be a starting point for someone editing this article who wanted to represent fairly both the views of the Anglican Communion Network and its critics.</dd>

<p>Good idea, JoanR.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <s>before the following edits are added back</s>whoever chooses to restore the following edits into the article in a neutral manner, please provide specific citations for them:</p>

<dd><i>Most of these diocese and parishes are in the process of leaving the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopal Church in the United States of America</a> (ECUSA)</i></dd>
<dd><i>the network is an embryonic autonomous province of the Anglican Communion, and is recognised as such by a signiicant majority of Anglicans worldwide (although, technically a minority of provinces, and not yet by the formal institutions of the communion).</i></dd>
<dd><i>, and as such, have de facto left ECUSA.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Fourteen Anglican primates from the developing world, representing over half of the world's Anglicans, have officially endorsed the creation of the ACN. Many of these primates have expressed concern over the recent actions of ECUSA, and most have broken communion with ECUSA and recognised the Network in its place.</i></dd>
<dd><i>members of the ACN hope and work actively to ensure that it's organization will replace ECUSA after the next Lambeth conference in 2008, following on from full recognition by the Global South Primates conference in 2006.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I suspect most of these are true, and they seem to be widely believed. However it is important to make clear to readers the distinction between</p>
<ul>
<li>the hopes and intentions of individual leaders and</li>
<li>the actions and stated purposes of an organisation.</li>

<dd>Another piece that doesn't sound neutral and is not verifiable,
<dl>
<dd><i>Network membership and decision-making is not open and democratic.

<p><a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmeetsWest_0eb8.html" title="User:EastmeetsWest">EastmeetsWest</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/s/User_talk%7EEastmeetsWest_c027.html" title="User talk:EastmeetsWest">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EastmeetsWest_8e09.html" title="Special:Contributions/EastmeetsWest">contribs</a>) has created a separate article <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_realignment.html" title="Anglican realignment">Anglican realignment</a> listing ten dioceses that "all belong to the Anglican Communion Network." It is not clear why that info should be in a separate article. I thus propose merging it to here.</p>
<p>In my view, a separate article "Anglican realignment" would only be justified as a history of the <i>term</i>, (1) citing neutral sources to describe where it was first used (by X in a speech or memo to Y, as reported by Z, etc.) and who subsequently adopted the wording, etc. And then (2) referring the reader to the separate articles on the groupings to whom the term applies—this article about the ACN, the article on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Anglican_Council_1d7b.html" title="American Anglican Council">American Anglican Council</a>, plus other groups if there are such.</p>
<p>There is also no need to be coy about the fact that the core issue is homosexuality. Saying "... place themselves under the jurisdiction of Anglican Primates of other countries with whom they are closer in theology and practice" and leaving it at that seems oddly vague about what the conflict is all about. -- <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslandGyrl_7708.html" title="User:IslandGyrl">IslandGyrl</a> 03:53, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Islandgyrl, I am not trying to be coy on this topic. In fact, I dont have a horse in this race. I am a sideline and fascinated observer. As a former parishioner of Truro who was and is a Ukrainian Catholic, I am trying to be objective. It is clear to me that the fissures in the Anglican Communion predate the Gene Robinson case. Truro Church, for example, is very evangelical with a strong fundamentalist strain and has led a 25 year campaign to change the ECUSA's teaching on abortion. Yes, the Robinson affair is the proximate cause of the break, but it was only the last straw in a long series of issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for realignment and the ACN, they are closely related, but not the same thing as I see it. The realignment article needs a lot of work but ought to identify the various layers of dissent among Anglicans over the past 100+ years (in order to include REC which has now become a player in the movement). As I see it, realignment is an umbrella topic of which the ACN is a player. While the term realignment is of recent popularity, it describes a century and a half of currents and undercurrents and now includes Anglicans not presently in the Anglican Communion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I am being fuzzy-headed about any of this, please let me know. I am not trying to offend or muddy any issues but rather address some major movements which have not been given coherent treatment thus far on WP in my opinion.</dd>
