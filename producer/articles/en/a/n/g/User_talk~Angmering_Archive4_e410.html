<p>Hi, Paul. I'd be happy to give the article a once-over, but I'm afraid I probably won't be able to get to it until Tuesday at the earliest; I'm in a show this weekend (matinee and evening), and then I'll be out of town for a few days. I hope that the FAC decision can wait until my return. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:30, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Original post <a href="../../../m/l/d/User_talk%7EMLD_aa63.html#Wimbledon_history" title="User talk:MLD">here</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Hi! Firstly good luck in your endeavours to find out more about your family history. My first suggestion would have been the <a href="http://www.historicaldons.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.historicaldons.com/" rel="nofollow">Historical Dons</a> website but, as you have found, there is no mention of a Gordon Campbell Emslie - although the <a href="http://historicaldons.com/1922_res.htm" class="external text" title="http://historicaldons.com/1922_res.htm" rel="nofollow">results section</a> does list the outcome of the two games you mention, which were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>14/10/1922, Amateur Cup (2nd Round) vs Dorking: a 7 - 0 victory.</li>
<li>9/12/1922, Amateur Cup (5th Round) vs Northampton Nomads: a 2 - 0 defeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best historical reference book is the <i>Wimbledon FC: 1889 - 1989: Centenary Book</i> (the source for much of the <a href="http://www.historicaldons.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.historicaldons.com/" rel="nofollow">Historical Dons</a>info, I understand) however it was published as a limited edition publication in 1989 so may be difficult to get hold of a copy. I'm told they do come up on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.ebay.co.uk" rel="nofollow">eBay</a> from time to time but otherwise somewhere like Morden library <i>should</i> have a copy.</p>
<p>I'll try and dig out mine when I'm at home and double check for you, however I've asked people on the <a href="http://www.afcwgb.co.uk/gb.php" class="external text" title="http://www.afcwgb.co.uk/gb.php" rel="nofollow">Wimbledon fans chat site</a> and I am told that, although Emslie isn't mentioned in the text and there are no pictures from those years, Emslie <b>is</b> mentioned in the appearances section. For the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921-22_in_English_football_21c7.html" title="1921-22 in English football">1921/22</a> season they show him playing in 35 games scoring 2 goals. There are no appearance stats for the previous two seasons.</p>
<p>Also, <i>"Old Isthmian"</i>, a contributor to the historical Dons site, is apparently working on putting the stats from the Centenary book into an online database at his <a href="http://afcw.foto.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://afcw.foto.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">AFC Wimbledon Statistics site</a>. He's only done six seasons so far but by chance the 1922/23 season is one of them! Under the <i>"History"</i> / <i>"Players"</i> / <i>"E"</i>, it lists not only the appearance stats for your great-grandfather for the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922-23_in_English_football_be33.html" title="1922-23 in English football">1922/23</a>, but also lists the games he played in and goals scored - <a href="http://afcw.foto.co.uk/players?ID=Gordon%20Emslie&amp;uid=0&amp;season=1922/3&amp;team=FIRST" class="external text" title="http://afcw.foto.co.uk/players?ID=Gordon%20Emslie&amp;uid=0&amp;season=1922/3&amp;team=FIRST" rel="nofollow">Gordon Emslie</a>, shows that Emslie played 20 games in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922-23_in_English_football_be33.html" title="1922-23 in English football">1922/23</a> season, scoring 3 goals - against Clapton (league), Dorking (FA Amatuer Cup) &amp; Leytonstone (league).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i>"OI"</i> also recommended that ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Morden Library has Wimbledon News archives back to that period</li>
<li>North Kingston Centre has a Local History resource room with the Surrey Comet back to the mid 19th century.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of which may be worth a visit if you are in the area and want to research further. I hope this helps - do get back to me if there's anything else I can do.</p>
<p>Finally, a thank you to you by way of thanking your great-grandfather for his service to the club! Your great-grandfather played for us in our first ever season in the <a href="../../../i/s/t/Isthmian_League_1d48.html" title="Isthmian League">Isthmian League</a> where <a href="../../../w/i/m/Wimbledon_F.C._43b4.html" title="Wimbledon F.C.">Wimbledon</a> (now <a href="../../../a/f/c/AFC_Wimbledon_302f.html" title="AFC Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a>) currenly play once again! Do come down to the club to experience a Wimbledon game if you haven't already - it's a special club.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea to me.</p>
<p>And yes, sadly I am woefully ignorant about the world of pop music, and completely missed the Ian Levine connection. Perhaps that's why he was invited to the <i>Torchwood</i> press premiere — they borrowed the title from a song he produced! (I know you heard about the <a href="http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/blog/2006/10/youre-not-journalist-so-fuck-off.html" class="external text" title="http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/blog/2006/10/youre-not-journalist-so-fuck-off.html" rel="nofollow">reported exchange between Levine and RTD</a>.

<p>That's amazing! I love it thank you! I never knew it was in such wide use (even just in media circles is better than just me and my mates). I have never seen it anywhere but the Partridge episode. Probably could have done some digging myself really...</p>

<p>Aye, me computer was bust for about 8 months and I've only just re-appeared in the big old online world. Not <i>entirely</i> sure how much time I'll be on Wikipedia. I've spent the last few computer broken months reading <i>actual paper books</i>.... I think there's a lot to be said for breaking your computer for at least 4 months of the year. I'll be around to some extent though, I think. --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 03:21, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Some folks there have suggested that the article could use a copyedit.

<p>Hello Paul, thanks for your note. Although the article <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> agrees with you, I think it's out of date. I'm pretty sure I have read the word mini-series in UK TV guides, and I suspect that it will become more used here even if it did originate in America (wouldn't be the first time). As for the category <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_television_miniseries_090d.html" title="Category:British television miniseries">Category:British television miniseries</a>, I was wondering about adding a definition, at least on the British page, namely series consisting of 3 to 12 programmes. If there's only 2, it's a "two-parter". I just checked Google <b>UK</b>: there are 319,000 hits for "(tv,television) serial" and 123,000 for "(tv,television) mini-series", so it's certainly used here, even if it is mostly used for TV imports and exports.</p>
<p>Also, even if it's not used much <b>in</b> the UK, it <b>is</b> used <b>about</b> our productions, so I think it's a valid category. Evidence: over a dozen British shows were already in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_miniseries_d5bc.html" title="Category:Television miniseries">Category:Television miniseries</a> before I moved them down. I considered renaming the new one as "British television serials", but that would emcompass longer-running series. So, I'm inclined to keep it.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I copy our discussions onto the category discussion page <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_television_miniseries_16db.html" title="Category talk:British television miniseries">Category_talk:British_television_miniseries</a>, and we could continue there? <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayenatic_london_2a35.html" title="User:Fayenatic london">Fayenatic london</a> 07:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah I was referring to those two articles, and BBC television drama which could do with more cites. If you need me to cast my eyes over any, give me a bell. Just keep me informed really of your intentions as concerns these articles, as I wouldn't wish to see them on FAR if that could be avoided. It's much easier to brush up an article without FAR than when FAR comes along, or so I've found.

<p>Glad to be of service, Paul. Here's the actual quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to the BBC's archives and managed to dig out some episodes of <i>The Quatermass Experiment</i> (the writer, Nigel Kneale, was my neighbour at the time!). We screened them, and the production was so appalling that we found them hysterically funny. We rolled about laughing! But what the producers had been trying to do — and what ultimately they achieved in <i>Quatermass and the Pit</i> — was to get some reality into it. So I said that this was the solution: that what we had to do with <i>Doctor Who</i> was to forget wobbly jellies in outer space and create some reason for bringing the stories down to Earth.</p>

<p>I will certainly do my best to copy edit, but give me a day or two. FAR is procedure heavy but informal at the same—if people are actively working, it shouldn't get closed. This one has received some attention and should receive more. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's very true - it's usually inactive FARs that get closed, though when editors make a good faith to improve their FAs, it's all cool. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 17:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A quick look at <i>Quatermass and the Pit</i> suggests the cites are fine - perhaps you can ping someone at FAR about the prose? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:19, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good - if you wait awhile and are bored, you could always try citing up BBC television drama and getting that removed from the list also. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool - that's warming to hear. It's easier if the FAR page isn't so clogged. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, sorry for not replying sooner, I missed the message above another. I've been thinking about your question, and I know exactly the quote you mean, but unfortunately can't remember exactly which episode it's in either. I seem to recall it <i>might</i> be in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_One_Foot_in_the_Grave_episodes_bae2.html#Series_Five_.281995.29" title="List of One Foot in the Grave episodes">Hole in the Sky</a>" in relation to Victor's seafood cooking, but I may be entirely wrong, so probably best not to take my word for it. Sorry. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 21:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
