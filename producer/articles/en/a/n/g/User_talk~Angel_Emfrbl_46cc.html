<p>I would prefer you not revert my reworking of trivia in the One Piece character articles. I won't edit war with you over it, but I would like to discuss it. See <a href="../../../s/a/n/Talk%7ESanji_dbc8.html" title="Talk:Sanji">Talk:Sanji</a> for my reasoning. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 09:49, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have the same problem with you in the Monkey D Luffy page, as Tjstrf said, no reason to start an edit war, but you have to at least reply in the discussion page if you want to make a major edit like this. The attacks and abilities page is limited to attack names, not abilities the characters possess. Gear 2 is not an attack, it is a state of being, just like becoming Super Saiyan (again not an attack), or the Kyuubi powers <a href="../../../u/z/u/Uzumaki_Naruto_0443.html" title="Uzumaki Naruto">Uzumaki_Naruto</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/k/Goku.html" title="Goku">Goku</a>. Look at their pages, these states are posted on the main page because they are NOT ATTACKS they are transformations, you can't consider them attacks. They are a part of the characters design and makeup to include them under attacks means his gomu gomu ability should also be under attacks. Please revert it to the way it was. Tinibash</p>
<dl>
<dd>The page isn't 'one piece attacks'... Its 'One piece abilities'... Gears are abilities AND upgrades related to attacks anyway, end of discussion. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 08:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd consider Gears to be an ability, more precisely, an attack form. For an example, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hiten_Mitsurugi_a5a6.html" title="Hiten Mitsurugi">Hiten Mitsurugi</a> (I can't believe I spelled that from memory) is a style of attack, but is still considered an ability because it is a skill unique (or nearly unique) to the character. The same with the gears. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 21:52, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yeah part of it was for someone to change that ablities page to attack page. Which may happen now (finally). I did it partly to prove a point. Its okay now, someone redid the information into bite-size form. I'm not gonna crib on it now and I've made my point on the abilities page clear. &#160;:D <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 22:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, it looks like you're freaking out a vandal bot! &#160;:) Are you trying to break up an article or something? Looks like you need some assistance.

<dd>And no, you need to be an administrator to delete pages in Wikipedia. Otherwise, you can <i>request</i> that the page be deleted by placing a speedy deletion request tag at the top.

<dd>Not a problem. That bot that left all the warnings here is simply a program that freaks out when someone blanks an entire page - so it thought you were vandalizing. For any <i>people</i> that left comments here, you might want to discuss your changes with them since they appear to be pretty wide-scale changes.

<p>Thanks for the message on my talk page. Please take a look at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_One_Piece_Games_74f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece Games">AfD nomination</a> that covers a number of articles in the One Piece template: I've proposed that those specific articles (and potentially others besides) be deleted, on the bases that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> - as I assert on the AfD page, those specific articles are collections of unnecessary information. If you disagree, please place a comment in the format '''Keep''' [reason] on the AfD page, and remember to sign your name there too.</p>
<p>Please also remember that Wikipedia, as an open project, actively invites its users to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> in updating pages and participating in maintenance projects, such as the AfD process. No offense is intended in placing AfD tags on pages that I believe should be intended. Please also remember that I have not deleted any of those pages, and <i>will not</i> - I'm not an administrator. Instead, I've proposed that they be deleted, so that if a sufficient number of other users believe that they should be deleted and/or merged with articles, they will be. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<span style="font-size: smaller;"><sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>raves</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_RandyWang_2_3c38.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/RandyWang 2"><b>review me!</b></a></sub></span>) 12:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am keeping that in mind... REALLY I just wasn't impressed since I and others have spent the last few weeks bringing ALL the One Piece pages up to Wikipedia standards and you randomly come in while this is going on. I'm not the only one doing these pages but I set up a lot of the information and spend a lot of time watching the series and reading the manga to compare the information and make sure things are correct. I found it encouraged others to bring the pages up to standards which is why I'm doing it. I haven't the reaction of everyone else since most peeps working on those pages are stranges to me. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 12:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I never said there wasn't an original version; I said I'm not basing any of my edits around it. It's the English manga. I know that there are no English sources, but that <i>doesn't</i> mean it doesn't need to get translated. It's article consistancy. Having Luffy's attacks being called "Gum Gum" whatever in one part of the article and then "Gomu Gomu" whatever in another will just confuse the reader.

<dd>I need to look up some more stuff on wikipedia on table building. The dub name resfuses to go onto one line.

<p>Thank you for the compliment. This was the best way I could think of preserving Franky's attacks. He's one of my favorite characters and I don't want all that info to be lost. Also, I think some of the other attack lists I think could be handled like that. For characters like Zoro, his attacks could be placed in a page thats mostly about his style of fighting. It wouldn't be something that looks like listcruft because the page's main topic would be about Zoro's fighting style and not the attacks themselves. Just make an article that's not centered around a list of attacks and I doubt there will be any crufty grounds for deletion. This I think could be used effectively for the main characters since they're the ones with most techniques. Of course it may not work for the minor characters since there's not much to go around but there's probably a loophole that could be exploited. However, all of that needs alot of work that I don't think I can do alone so... Anyway, thanks for the complement.<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicoD.Sparrow_cf91.html" title="User:CalicoD.Sparrow">CalicoD.Sparrow</a> 07:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We can't say that *anything* is canon or non-canon. It isn't up to Wikipedia to make judgments like that. The most we can do is say that some particular source (like the author) says the filler isn't canon. But if we do that we still need a quote from the author saying that he doesn't consider filler to be canon. Filler doesn't become non-canon just by existing. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 20:31, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes but its not real facts, its something else. Argue with me all day. I don't care on this matter. I am simply not in the mood today (even the most reasonible and usually patient wiki editors have bad days)... Non-Canon stuff has its place. But not when used for proof of facts. As I said, there are WAYS of writing it out into a article, if you can't learn how to do it using any of the methods I suggested then don't add the non-canon stuff at all. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 20:43, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erm... 1) Filler is filler. We don't decide yes, thats the animation company. But its STILL filler whatever you say and its no good as evidence to use whatever on a wikipedia page. Look, I don't want to argue, maybe another day, as I said on your discussion page... I'm in a bad mood today, otherwise I'd go into this a lot deeper and give you a full explanation. Give me a day or two. Bottom line - Oda (the AUTHOR) did not write it, Toei did, Toei makes mistakes, therefore the information is untrusty worthy sometimes.

<dd>Well, we cannot be sure for things like the Ocean's Dream arc, but Oda <i>did</i> say that the filler for the Loguetown arc would have been in the manga if not for time constraints. So it would be safe to move, say, Daddy the Father, from the filler characters page, to the minor characters page because of what Oda said on the matter.

<dd>Filler is just that - a lot of filler made up to bump up existing storylines, sometimes it is just that it isn't sound enough to make a good strong wikipedia statement. Toei does mistakes, which is why we can't use the filler (pay attention here please) <b>Without backing it with evidence from the canon storyline</b>. As I said, there are ways of getting it on a page, but filler standing alone as evidence isn't good enough. Please accept that there are ways to get info on a page, and ways not to. If you can't accept this, don't put filler infomation on a page, its as simple as that.</dd>

<dd>Take for instance the One Piece timeline... You can put filler on that so long as you write <i>Anime only</i>, same with Devil Fruits. As I said, Chopper + rumble balls... This was written on to the page to, adding that its different in the manga as to the anime. This is fine too.</dd>

<dd>And as someone stating, the Logue Town stuff was left out things Oda didn't have time to puyt in. This I can confirm can stand, I believe it was something like chapter 100 was meant to be the end of Logue town, Oda says it in a SBS somewhere... So some aspects of the fillers can stand alone (but again you need to reference statments by Oda where he says its okay) which rarely happens in One Piece. On another note, Oda does design the bad guys for characters in movies and things, so even though the movies are filler they are Oda's creatations.</dd>

<p>No, no, that misses my point. Which is deciding that some episodes are part of the canon storyline and others are not is a decision which *we are not permitted to make*. We can't say "this is filler, so it doesn't count as part of the canon storyline unless Oda says so". <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 02:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I'm saying there is a difference whether we like it or not. The One Piece pages are not set up as One Piece (anime), One Piece (manga) and so forth which means we're catering for both. There is a clash between anime and manga on our pages therefore, you need to define which came from where. So while I agree we can't make these choices, we have to because otherise we get information problems. But REALLY is it that much fo a biggy to do what I've suggested? Come on, a small little note something is not filler or is from the anime only isn't much and won't effect the quality of the page. And plus, we've been doing this since before I joined wikipedia, its a tradition now. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 05:48, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you like the concept and all but lately I've been having some real trouble with making the page better looking. I can't seem to find the time to fill in the words and look for the pictures to post for the page. Also I think with my present mood and affairs, I need a long wiki-vacation from all this editing. Could you and some other people work on it while I am gone. You made the great Devil Fruit chart so I know you can do it. For safety measures so that it won't get deleted, you can move the entire contents of the article to my userpage and use it as a workshop or something. I think that's possible. I really need the rest to do other things. I may drop in once in awhile to do stuff but nothing too major until I get back in the mood.</p>
<p>On a sidenote in case you didn't know, I believe Justyn's also doing a similar concept with Zoro's attack page. He could sure use the help.<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicoD.Sparrow_cf91.html" title="User:CalicoD.Sparrow">CalicoD.Sparrow</a> 15:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading your user page, I'm guessing that you are not that good at writing in 3rd century Mandarin, too. Does it really matter? Everyone has writing problems; it's your thoughts that matter not your ability to put them in one or another communication form. Before posting, try running whatever you write through Microsoft Word spelling and grammar checker. In fact, most clean-up editors copy an entire Wikipedia article into their Microsoft Word program, run the spelling and grammar checker, and then use the results to clean up the Wikipedia article. Also, by using Microsoft Word spelling and grammar checker, you will see yourself making the same mistakes and thus learn to correct one mistake at a time.-- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 14:16, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know what's up with that vandal, but some of the stuff he writes is true, and some isn't. I reverted some of his stuff yesterday. I believe Geg and I have fixed all the mistakes he made, and the info in the OP article is now all correct. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 22:41, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quite bored.Need to talk to someone-On the One Piece media release information page,theres a link to One Piece manga online in English (V3),but the pictures mostly dont show like nothing else then colorless squares witha red "x",but not at all.Most importlantly,Ive read volumes from this page before and nothing like that happened before-once,after a longer time but then it got fixed again and now its like that.Any idea's what could be wrong? New Babylon</p>
<p>Not all MSN pages,I can read the chapters elswhere on V2 (only theyd dint have chapter 426 till recently-I read it,but I was searching for a picture for my Buster Call article and......),and not all on V3 does not show (the newest albums do show).I juts hope it will work (ps:tried to refresh,tried "show picture" and the results the same)</p>

<p>Um,I think its <i>the link</i> beneath the article One Piece media and release information.Go to "One Piece",then click on "44 volumes,4xx chapters" right at the top and youll get po the page.Go to links and youll find "One Piece Manga Online (English" and THATS it. To version of chap 439-if youd know what I read on V3-some pages were actualy GREEN!Yet I didnt mind,so long as I could read One Piece. PS:You've said to eb a fan of One Piece as well-id like to know for how long (since when) and how you actualy got to One Piece.Ive got my own boring story (seen in TV,fell in love with it and the rest is history). New Babylon (sorry about this,but I dont got the "dont know what theyre calle,dwhat you toald me to include at end" copied right now and dont know if this keabord can generate it.</p>

<p>Well,yes its quite interesting,especialy to see characters that are kind of encrypte din your mind as old characters (the Sensej at Zoro's Dojo) talk (think) about "Enies Lobby".A weird feeling for my part.But a good one.New Babylon</p>

<p>Okay, sorry about not talking about it. I didn't even think about it. Here's my ideas. The Templates look like this: <a href="../../../o/n/e/Template%7EOne_Piece_eba6.html" title="Template:One Piece">Story Arcs</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/Template%7EOne_Piece_Related_Articles_c603.html" title="Template:One Piece Related Articles">Related Articles</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/Template%7EOne_Piece_Factions_19f2.html" title="Template:One Piece Factions">Factions</a> , <a href="../../../o/n/e/Template%7EOne_Piece_characters_88d4.html" title="Template:One Piece characters">Characters</a>. As you can see "general" has been split into five separate templates, each to be placed on the pages featured in the template. Each Navi Template has a link to the other Templates, and as you can see, are smaller and neater but still allow easy movement through the articles. I also wrote this down <a href="../../../o/n/e/Template%7EOne_Piece_general_1cc5.html" title="Template:One Piece general">HERE</a> on the discussion page.</p>
<p>Also the change to the General will look like this; <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecklessFire_5442.html" title="User:RecklessFire">RecklessFire</a> 21:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not that hard. There are three systems to delete articles. The first is speedy deletion of articles that mean any one of the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion criteria</a>. Speedy deletion is only reserved for an article doesn't falls into one of the speedy deletion criteria. If it doesn't one of the other two methods must be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The next method is the propose an article for deletion with the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag. This should be used on articles were the deletion of the article is unlikely to be contested by another editor. However, if there is already contention about deleting the article or an editor removes the prod tag, then it goes to the last method.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The third method is <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, which allows the community to discussion the deletion of the article. There are instructions there about how to list an article for AfD. Also, an articles doesn't have to go through the previous two methods before it gets listed on AfD. However, they are encouraged to keep AfD from being more overwhelmed with articles. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 12:23, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I thought with the amounts of vandalising that adress has done, one of the other editors would have done the right stuff and it would be at that level by now. I left a note for everyone on that page to don't just revert only when they deal with him. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 08:08, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, regarding your removal of the "Navy or Marine?" section in the Navu (One piece) article, I'm happy to see somebody remove it, but just be careful what you mark as a minor edit. See <a href="../../../m/i/n/Help%7EMinor_edit_e212.html" title="Help:Minor edit">Help:Minor_edit</a></p>
<p>"A check to the minor edit box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the current and previous version: typo corrections, formatting and presentational changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, etc. A minor edit is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute.</p>
<p>By contrast, a major edit is a version that should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors. Therefore, any change that affects the meaning of an article is not minor, even if the edit is a single word." <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 10:15, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good grief! Things sure have become so strict here on wikipedia in the last 6 months since I joined. Its gotten to the point of complete amazment. Everything is happening so fast these days new articles are just being leapt on before you can react...

<dd>I would HIGHLY SUGGEST that you set up a "sandbox" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_page#How_do_I_create_a_user_subpage.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_page#How_do_I_create_a_user_subpage.3F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> where you can do this preliminary work, and let the users from the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Piece_aa17.html" title="One Piece">One Piece</a> area look at it before it's posted as an actual article. That can save lots of problems down the line - and things in sandboxes are not subject to the normal article criteria. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 21:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well reguardless, the page is now up to snuff and no longer liable for S.Delete anyway... I'm gonna remember all this for the next time. What a mess... This is what several months of sitting on your butt just vandal patroling does to you.
