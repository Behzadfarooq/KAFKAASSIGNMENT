<p>The article spends a great deal of time poking antimatter balloons and hopefully may get around to things an encyclopedic article about a book sometimes covers, such as: idea of how long author spent writing it, inspiration, difficulty getting it accepted/published, naming the publisher, brief publishing history (hard vs. soft), approx. volumes in print, media type availability, in/out of print, how the book was critically received, impact on culture of the time, etc. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPoppafuze_2b8b.html" title="User:Poppafuze">Poppafuze</a> 07:22, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on factual innacuracies (previously) criticised Dan Brown for claiming that Copernicus was "muderdered by the church for revealing scientific truths." I've deleted that point after looking in my book and finding that Brown never mentions Copernicus. He talks about Giordano Bruno, who was executed for being heretical.</p>
<p>But I have reason to believe that various editions differ on this. The book I am refering to is the omnibus edition which includes the Da Vinci Code. It would be great if someone could verify if other editions mention Copernicus. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Consigliere_d1a3.html" title="User:The Consigliere">[Kaan]</a> Friday, May, 13, 2005 - 00:03:42 (UTC)</p>

The correct terms are vaporised and vaporisation (with a z for us english but I an Canadian so I use british). I am not sure if those are the only two errors so if other people want to do a more extensive spellcheck it might be a good idea. Also I searched the page DannyScL had and it didn't appear so he is not in need of correction.</dd>

<pre>
Do not understand above point about the difference between English and British spelling of Vaporisation. As far as I know "American English" spells it with a z and "British English" spells it with a s.

<p>Just so you are aware... It is IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCELERATE SOMETHING PAST TERMINAL VELOCITY... acceleration terminates at terminal velocity... not life. Please take a physics course before critiquing physics so you don't come off looking ignorant. I'll correct it for you. -SteveB</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ehmm, ofcourse you can accelarate something past terminal velocity. Terminal velocity is just the point where atmospheric drag is equal to gravity so gravity wont accelarate you anymore. But if you strap a rocketpac to your back and dives towards the earth and fire, you are sure as hell gonna accelerate past terminal velocity for humans. Maybe you are thinking of the speed of light, which you cannot go faster than. Also, please don't be rude and use personal attacks, we don't do that here at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">Gkhan</a> 13:44, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am so very sorry, but you do use that kind of rhetoric, at least against me. Last time you got me so upset by this that I threatened (figuratively) to kill the other party, wytch was interpreted as a DEATH THREAT and I was, off corrs, blocked from editing for a while. To clear the matter (not antimatter) or in other words purify the situation (situation refers to space refers to air) I will try to cite my opponents and my own words. He was telling I am a vandal, moron and insane person. I told him bullies like him ought to be shot in the head, as talking to them will not help. It was an insult. Call? Draw? Pass? Yes, it was an insult. I was insulting back - just like we have matter and antimatter so there is some way to get at that energy stored in that goo we are build of. Supposedly, so not very bright people can grasp the whole relativity idea by such a machness of levels of indirection, that they brains refuse to fail comprehending under duress of annihilation of reason. No, it's not a reason there is antimatter. You, people, are being unreasonable and I am not stupid to waste time on this diatrybe for I enjoy it and would like to say that the final sentence of the article made me laugh my pants off&#160;:-) 16:54, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the accelerating force is removed you will be going faster then terminal velocity. You're the ignorant one.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually I wasn't being rude in calling you ignorant and reaffirming your ignorance just makes you come off as petty and incapable of taking criticism. I was just calling a spade a spade. The following is the dictionary definition of Terminal Velocity.</p>
<p>(a) The velocity acquired at the end of a body's motion. (b) The limit toward which the velocity of a body approaches, as of a body falling through the air.</p>
<p>It's just the maximum velocity any object can achieve, where the force driving acceleration is equal to the drag forces applied to the object by the fluid it's moving through. Normally this is the point at which acceleration due to gravity in a free fall is balanced but it's true of any object accelerating through any fluid for any reason... not just due to gravity and air drag.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it is not. If you take a physics class you would understand. If I am falling and a large rocket collides with me and pushes me in the same direction as the way I was falling and then, I don't know how but, dissapears the force is no longer equalised. I am now travelling faster than terminal velocity as there is an unbalanced net force. I would start slowing down and then achieve a balance once again (assuming that I am falling for long enough of course), that balance is called... TERMINAL VELOCITY! It was mentioned that the explosion would push him past terminal velocity, the impulse provided by the explosion would then dissapear and he would then have the net force slowing him. That is it, plain and simple. If you don't believe me then I think you should go back to school, I am after all 1 year short of graduating a mechanical engineer and physics is my first love.</dd>
<dd>Also your definition b fits very well with my explaination, the limit towards which the velocity approaches. It does not say from which way, acceleration or deceleration. I hope that clears it up for you. I don't mean to be rude either I am completly sure of this.</dd>
<dd>One last thing, I noticed that you refer to a gas as a fluid, yes it is a fluid.. the thing is that I didn't come upon a fluid as a gas until I took fluid mechanics. If you have had the education I am sure that you can find an old physics text somewhere. High school or lower undergrad level should go over it quite well.</dd>

Whoever is doing it does not seem to have read it, or is just too conceited to post a reply. I challenge you to give me an explaination why you do this. I hope that we can sort it out.</p>

<p><i>It is impossible to create and sustain the densities of antimatter described in the book.</i></p>

<p>Is this a fundamental truth, or only with current technology? It was presented as a significant scientific breakthrough in the book. <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUbermonkey_888a.html" title="User:Ubermonkey">Ubermonkey</a> 19:18, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe with current technology. Also it would be extremly foolish to do so in a team of two people. This kind of procedure is unethical, and extremly dangerous. For one thing it is quite probable that large masses, possibly even galaxies, formed of anti-matter exist in other parts of our universe, just quite far from us. So it is not a fundemental truth. It has to be based on our current level of technology. Unless someone can find a reputable source stating that we can't do it I suggest that we remove that statement, or alter it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Related to this, there is currently an item in the inaccuracies list that the containment system would require refrigeration. If the antihydrogen is a liquid, then that it true -- but if it is a liquid, then it would not have the metallic appearance described in the book. Liquid antihydrogen would look exactly like liquid hydrogen, i.e. a clear liquid. There is a state of hydrogen which is metallic, but it is solid and exists only at extremely high pressure. As another inaccuracy, there is no way magnetic containment can work for liquid hydrogen. Magnetic containment can work for a plasma, but in that case the density would be much lower, and instead of looking metallic, it would be glowing brightly, since it would be quite hot. So I suppose the author needed some way to contain his chunk of antimatter, found that nobody had an idea that could work, so he went ahead with an idea that couldn't work. Besides all this, then are no end of things about this container that are patently ridiculous, but that's not the same as a factual inaccuracy, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Ubermonkey is right, the creation and storage of anti-matter is described as a breakthrough and should be regarded as science fiction. Generally, ridiculous or illogical technologies in sci-fi are not regarded as inaccuracies,.

<i>"It is impossible to create and sustain the densities of antimatter described in the book. Similarly, antimatter could never be used as a source of power. Antimatter has to be created since it is found nowhere on Earth naturally. The amount of energy required to operate the particle accelerator would be far greater than (or, ideally, equal to) the energy the antimatter-matter reaction would produce. Of course, it could well be that Leonardo Vetra's supposed breakthroughs in antimatter technology have transcended these boundaries."</i></p>
<p>According to the E=mc2 equation, it is in fact impossible to have a net gain of energy when you are creating the source of energy itself. In order for antimatter to be used as an energy source, it would have to be naturally harvested from the universe.</p>

<p>Do we really need a section explaining that Brown's two books have similarities? All we are really saying is that he found a winning formula for a book and then used it again.

<dd>He has four books, and if you have read all of them you would realise that it goes beyond just simple similarities. They are extremely formulaic, they have the same basic climaxes at the same times. This includes a slow revelation of "facts" and lots of pseudo-science. The seeming enemy and the plans that seemed evident through the book always turn out to be wrong. The villain always turns out to be a character that is close to the main character and is portrayed in a way that would make him out to be the most trustworthy person in the book. This character is always unveiled very close to the end of the book and the true intentions are finally known and usually there is an apology or expression of regret that the main character found out the plans and must be killed for the greater good. I can't read his books anymore as they make me angry, he takes a painful amount of time to reveal simple answers to problems and since the stories are so similar I know exactly what is going to happen.</dd>

<p>I don't know if this is too much POV to include in the inaccuracy list, but throughout the book are scenes that imply that the majority of scientists are still mad at the Catholic Church for e.g. what happened to Galileo. For instance, there's the scene where the grad students at CERN are cheering because the pope had been shot. I don't have any hard facts to lean on here, but I'm a physicist, so I know a lot of physicists, and I can say that from what I've seen scientists have no different view of the Catholic Church or religion in general than anyone else. And I don't know any scientist who's all hung up on the suppression of science by the Church hundreds of years ago. I think it would be fair to say in the inaccuracy list that there is no evidence of the sort of antipathy toward the Catholic Church by scientists that Brown claims in the book.</p>

<p>At several points in the book Brown references cell phones having dial tones (or rather, characters are unable to use their cell phones because they can't get a dial tone due to being underground and other reasons). No cell phone I have encountered has a dial tone when working properly, but all the instances in the book occur in Europe. Do European cell phones have dial tones? If not, is this an error worth pointing out in the article?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, we in Europe don't have as advanced technology as you Americans, idiot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No. Cell phones do not have dial tones. However, this seems more a simple display of ignorance than a factual error.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I live in Germany, have a Sony Ericcson 610 with an O2-Account, and the default setting sure has dialing Tone.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's cool: it's the very first time I hear about a mobile phone with a dial tone. Are you sure you aren't talking about the tones made by the keys? Here they're talking about the line tone, the one you hear on fixed phones when you pick them up. And no, cell phones have NO dial tone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly what the previous writer meant, so he or she is wrong. German cell phone lines do not produce dial tones, and neither do Italian ones (at least not when you're roaming).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The phone has dial tone" is an English expression that indicates phone can grant communication. It is also used for mobile phones as well, regardless the fact the service status of a cell phone devices is usually determined by a visual indicator. Likewise, you may say "Turn the computer on" while you well know that computers power switch is not a turn knob.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In Europe the most prevailing mobile phone standard is GSM. The time, place and context of the book lead to the assumption that GSM is being used. There is no dial tone in any GSM system, as far as I know. Therefore I think that the mention of a dial tone in the book is a gross inaccuracy.</p>

<p>The section is headed "Factual Inaccuracies" not "Inaccuracies that are claimed to be factual by DB". IMHO the broad range of inaccuracies are relevant not because they show sloppy research by DB but as context for the fact/fiction furore surrounding the DaVinci Code. The extent of inaccuracies in even simply checkable facts in this book together with the implausibility of the denouement underlines that the DVC should also be treated as nothing more than a work of fiction.

<li>I think the bottom line is that most of the factual errors bring nothing to the intrigue but are harmful to the enjoyment of the reading of the book and the research. They are unintentional but show an extreme carelessness/lazyness in the redaction of the book. This lazyness is also illustrated by the use of nearly the same intrigue for the two consecutive books.<a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 00:59, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think he is lazy. He is an author, and as an author he has two primary goals - to write a book that sells, and to make it engaging for the reader. Anything else, including factual accuracy, is secondary. While factual errors can be off-putting for those who know otherwise, it could be argued that the storyline of the book benefits from Brown making creative decisions rather than explain something that is inherently more clumsy, and somewhat unnecessary in a work of fiction.

<li>I would tend to agree with the paragraph above. However in this book the amount of unaccuracies seems to be too much and the sheer amount of them harms the full enjoyment of the otherwise robust plot.</li>

<li>Furthermore, even when the extra accuracy wouldn't have harmed the story, I still don't see it as laziness. He's a fiction writer. His author's craft does not include high factual accuracy, nor should it. He is better off focusing on other things. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 21:55, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>...and that is where the arguments circle around. There is no definition that a fiction writer is obliged to follow reality, but neither is there a rule to the contrary which you suggest that there is. A writer can chose their own rules, and DB chose a set of rules which were to claim a basis in fact. Whether the book works is down to the treatment, not a set of fiction rules.</dd>

<dd>If I wrote a book about the British Prime Minister Arthur Treacher, the reader is given the signal that the environment is fictional, and any liberties can be taken, though making him live at Buckingham Palace would typically require some justification by the conventions of fiction, and what works would in part depend on whether we were writing satire, comedy, thriller or historical fiction. It is even in the author's remit to bend the rules of convention, it does not guarantee that the work will be acceptable.</dd>

<dd>If I use Margaret Thatcher, then the rules have changed. That does not stop me making things up - but if I start stating things differently than is common knowledge, the reader will need to understand what the intent is. If this is not justfied by some clear signalling that the book is set in an alternate history, then it will simply come across as implausible. Implausible rarely is accepted as good fiction, the reader does not buy it, it does not work. Of course, to see the implausibilities may depend on your knowledge.</dd>

<dd>For example, in the original listings that circulated, having been told specifically that the locations in Rome were real, and having been to the locations, certain events simply were implausible.

<dd>That statments made in the book are wrong is not POV, that is fact. What gets missed is that the people who are offended by the inaccuracies are offended because of their experiences. Put another way, people don't like the suggestion that if they enjoyed the book that there is a suggestion that they are ignorant. Put yet another way, there is no contradiction in stating that this is a heap of garbage that many people have found very enjoyable, and it should not be a problem to be able to state that many of the pseudo-factual statements in the book do not bear close examination, but this should not stand in the way of a good read. Attempting to surpress information on the problems in the writing is simply censorship, and hiding under the guise of POV is still censorship. In the end, this book is exceptional and there should be no problem in the Wiki coverage reflecting this. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanMSpencer_fd52.html" title="User:IanMSpencer">Spenny</a> 20:05, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since you are in fact storing an abundant mass of energy, it would seem practical to devise an antimatter containment trap in which the storing mechanism is powered by the contained antimatter itself; especially for storage of a large volume of antimatter rather than creating a time bomb with the blast power of an atomic warhead.

<p>Is it factual when Dan Brown wrote that people have been trying to forge a perfect symmetrical ambigram of "Illuminati" for a very long time, to no avail? How is it that me, a twelve-year-old, was able to make one in less than ten minutes? It may not be as intricate as the one in the book, but it's still symmetrical. I even made one for Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and the Illuminati Diamond. So is it really fact when he wrote that? --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThrashmeister_c5d7.html" title="User:Thrashmeister">Thrashmeister</a> 19:02, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it is another subject where Dan Brown has invented a folk-lore around it based on his own perceptions and impressionability. Kids have been doodling stuff like that for years, and then some artist DB comes across gives it a name and has made it his speciality (and which he does very well). Do a search on the net and you can find computer programs that can do it, though not very elegantly. The real nonsense is to think that there might be learned people that would worry about such things: the word is clearly nearly symetrical before we start, it must be one of the easiest to do.</dd>

<p>I don't know if this is relevant enough to be pointed out on the main page, but though I would point it out. In some places, Brown uses "Hassassin" as a singular noun. Two examples: "The Hassassin strode quickly now, his black eyes filling with anticipation." (Page 34 of the paperback English.) And in the next paragraph: "The Hassassin smirked. He had been awake all night, but sleep was the last thing on his mind." (Page 35 of the paperback English.) The problem is that the "in" ending is the oblique <i>plural</i> ending for certain Arabic words. Hassassin/Assassin is derived from "ḥaššāš" (one who uses hashish), the plural of which is "ḥaššāšūn." The oblique plural (used when in the accusative or genitive tenses) is "ḥaššāšīn." Sometimes, Arabs colloquially use only the oblique plural, hence why people who heard Arabs talk about the Assassins retained the "in" ending when rendering the name of the group into English. Brown should have rendered the word, if singular, as "Hassass" or, better yet, "Hashash." Or he should have stuck with the English word "assassin." <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitabparast_98b3.html" title="User:Kitabparast">Kitabparast</a> 01:38, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, Langdon's description of a "Great Elector" is false. Such a position does not exist. The conclave is presided over by the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_of_the_College_of_Cardinals_3281.html" title="Dean of the College of Cardinals">Dean of the College of Cardinals</a>. Unlike the fictional "Great Elector," the Dean <i>is</i> elegible for election (<a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> was the Dean of the College of Cardinals presiding over the conclave that ultimately elected him Pope).</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">Devil's advocate</a> has nothing to do with the conclave. This office was for candidates for sainthood and was abolished in 1983.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the book claims <i><a href="../../../r/o/m/Romano_Pontifici_Eligendo_892f.html" title="Romano Pontifici Eligendo">Romano Pontifici Eligendo</a></i> is a set of "ancient forgotten laws." In reality, <i>Romano Pontifici Eligendo</i> was promulgated by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_VI_4529.html" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a> in 1975. Also, the document has nothing to do with the methods of papal election, as the book claims.</li>
<li>Fourthly, the book also seems to depict the "Preferiti" as officially denoted as such. Perhaps Brown was thinking of the term <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papabile.html" title="Papabile">Papabili</a>, but the Papabili are never of a specific number, nor are they officially recognized, and their identities are simply based on public debate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure some of these may have been oversights, while some may have been literary license, but they are inaccuracies nonetheless and should be addressed in the article. --<a href="../../../t/s/k/User%7ETsk070_6fbf.html" title="User:Tsk070">Tsk070</a> 21:14, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whislt this section is valid, to keep the critics at bay it was severely trimmed as it was felt that the sheer list of errors, whilst all valid, somehow made the article inappropriate. I left a comment in the section but the section is expanding again. I'll probably trim it down again with my personal list of arbitrary decisions on which errors are of importance (ambigrams will go for example). Anything deleted will migrate to the WikiBooks if not already there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added ambigrams because it was one of the more <i>innacurate</i> notions in the book. Ambigrams <i>are not</i> difficult to create, and the was a recurring and <i>important</i> theme in the book, a theme which at times actaully carried the plot. Saying its unimportant relative to other innacuraccies seems wrong.</dd>

I think the idea at one point was to select the real facts that were wrong as opposed to ludicrous plot devices. How do you get a balanced list? Go back a couple of months of reversions and you will find a mega-list.

<dd>I see what your saying. But I think the ambigram thing is a bit more of a "factual innacuracy" than the undetectable bomb. The undectable bomb was a soft-sci fi thing. It was just implausible technology, without a good explanation--i.e. left to the reader's imagination. He didn't imply that it was existing technology (which would have made it a "factual innacuracy"). Ambigrams on the other hand, are <i>in fact</i> not a difficult esoteric art, as was implied in the plot--it was a prominent <i>factual innacuracy</i> in the book. Hence it would belong in any list...top 10, probably top 5, since it was such an important part of the book. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 17:27, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I certainly understand your points - but I don't necessarily think it's all about Dan Brown bashing. Even fans of any fictional novel can start to wonder where fact meets fiction. In this case, where its a novel with a fairly scientific theme (the main character is supposed to be a professor), there's an even greater desire to cross-check. I loved Brown's novels, but sometimes like to go back and see what parts of it were really true, to keep my own historical knowledge in check. Sure, some things are obvious, like dinosaurs spouting from flies, but others are more subtle, and can be interesting to learn the differences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, I think it makes sense to have very detailed repository of fact-checks... but I just wonder if this deserves its own page. This is supposed to be an encylopedic article - not a database of facts. In my mind, when things get too detailed, the section should be replaced with a higher level summary, including a reference to other places for further research (such as a seperate "Dan brown fact check" webpage). <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarthog32_10e5.html" title="User:Warthog32">Warthog32</a> 22:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It may be a fictional novel, but it purports to use real information as its background. Rarely have I read a book littered with so many cock-ups, factual inaccuracies and patent absurdities. The <i>twist</i> at the end have got to be one of the stupidest ever written. Anyone with 5 minutes knowledge of the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church would know that one of the main characters wouldn't have reacted that way to revelations about his parents. I burst out laughing at the sheer stupidity, and then got annoyed having read a book so bad that even its "twist" was bullshit. If Brown did his own research then he is incompetent.

<p>Since I cannot find anyone else who seems to have noticed: The BBC camerawoman Chinita Macri appears to be related to Mario Macri, one of the real-world leaders of CERN's PS210 experiment in 1995 in which a few atoms of antihydrogen were created. --JustinTerested 08:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dan Brown could well have taken the name from there he has previously used names of people who have influenced the books, such as Langdon from the guy who drew the Ambigrams and the authors of Holy Blood, Hloy Grail in Da Vince CodeJameskeates 11:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC) ps The physics factual innacuracies seem to be hardly mentioned, there are plenty and not of the technical ability kind, but I think the CERN site probably deals with them</dd>

<p>There are no bishops or cardinals in Frankfurt - eventhough it has a cathedral. The biggest part of Frankfurt belongs to the Diocese of Mainz. Or does Dan Brown mean his birthplace. IMHO it is rather uncommon to mention a bishop's birthplace rather than his "workplace". Is it a mistake of Brown then. --84.58.50.170 17:45, 14 September 2006 (UTC) Linne</p>

<p>Dan Brown probably used an internet translator or translated word for word English to Italian to get his translations, which is a totally unreliable method. -- MySpirit September 16, 2006</p>

<p>I think it would be helpful to include a map showing all 4 Altars of Science with other major points of interest such as the Castle, Vatican and Tiberina Island. I have done this using google map, it shows clearly that the monuments do not line up like a cross as revealed. The cross alignment is a major component of cracking the puzzle and the author has clearly cited the description of the artworks and exact location as accurate. My edition (Pocket Books premium edition April 2006) contains a highly schematic map of Rome which shows the monuments lining up as described or as the author intended. I just think it would be interesting to include a real-world map of Rome for comparison. Unfortunately google maps and modification thereof are not for free use, or is it. --<a href="../../../k/v/a/User%7EKvasir_a94b.html" title="User:Kvasir">Kvasir</a> 07:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
