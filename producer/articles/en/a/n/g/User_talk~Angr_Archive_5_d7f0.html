<p>Hi Angr. I'm not completely content with your edit at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attalus_I_0ff7.html" title="Attalus I">Attalus I</a>, I think it interrupts the flow there, and I'm not sure what information it is trying to convey. Is it trying to imply that calling the Galatians "Gauls" is a misnomer? My understanding is that the Galatians were Celtic speaking immigrant Gauls from <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a>, who were part of the great Celtic/Gualish Eastward migration. Am I wrong about this? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:07, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Angr: Thanks for your cogent explanation. I now think I understand and agree with the point you are making. I think the best way to handle this might be, as you suggest, to remove the explanation of the distinction from the lead and into the section "Defeat of the Gauls" (renaming it the "Defeat of the Galatians"). I would propose replacing the first sentence there with something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pausanias_%28geographer%29.html" title="Pausanias (geographer)">Pausanias</a> "the greatest of his achievements" was the defeat of the "<a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a>". Pausanias was referring to the Galatians, immigrant Celts from <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a>, who had recently settled in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galatia.html" title="Galatia">Galatia</a> in central <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and whom the Romans and Greeks called <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a>, associating them with the Celts of what is now <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and northern <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What do you think? I think that the slight confusion that might be created by the mention of the "Dying Gaul" in the lead, doesn't really warrant an explanation there. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:53, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmmm. Having been prompted by your mention, to look at the original Greek, I'm now wondering if the translation of "Galatas" as "Gauls" is really correct in the first place? And what does it really mean to say that the Greeks called the Galatians Gauls? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 20:34, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok I will go ahead and make the above changes, adding in the Greek word, as you suggested. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 21:01, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Why was the mountain goat page moved? There is no need to have every word in the title in upper case, and "Mountain goat" appears to be the more common name. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 20:45, 2005 September 4 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you look at "what links here" on that article, "Mountain goat" is most common by quite a bit. There is no rule that I know of that the common name of an animal is in upper case. That would violate ordinary English usage as well as the common practice on Wikipedia article titles. I think the article should be at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_goat.html" title="Mountain goat">Mountain goat</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 20:55, 2005 September 4 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the naming conventions link. Per that guideline, "Some claim the name of an individual bird or mammal species is usually capitalised, but this is disputed.

<p>Hi Angr. I'll be happy to assist.</p>
<p>I think the first thing that needs to happen is that the content from <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Celtic (disambiguation)">Celtic (disambiguation)</a> needs moving to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a>. <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> should be the actual dab page and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Celtic (disambiguation)">Celtic (disambiguation)</a> should be a redirect to it. Links that <b>do</b> need to go to the dab page then should be pointed to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Celtic (disambiguation)">Celtic (disambiguation)</a> (so they end up at the correct page but do not look accidental). That's the normal pattern I believe, and it would tie in with the fact that there are only a couple of pages that link to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Celtic (disambiguation)">Celtic (disambiguation)</a> right now, while 460-odd link to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a>.</p>
<p>Once that's done, it's happy dab'ing! I'm at work right now and I haven't checked the available dabs... are you happy with the current list? I usually end up adding two or three entries to a dab when I first attack a page that hasn't been touched in a while.</p>
<p>I'll have a more detailed look at home later!

<p>Hi Angr,</p>
<p>I have a hunch you may be responsible for a great deal of what's on this excellent page, although, who knows, I may be wrong, as I didn't bother to check its history all the way back. Anyway, my question for you is this: What is the wisdom of indicating the outcome of PIE *p as Proto-Celtic *φ? Since the change of PIE *p to zero is Common Celtic, it is only logical to set it up as Proto-Celtic. Last time I checked, that is standard procedure in Historical Linguistics. While *φ may have been an intermediate stage BETWEEN Proto-Indo-European AND Proto-Celtic (and even that is not required), it makes no sense to assign that phoneme to the Celtic proto-language. If the only evidence is Latin <i>silva Hercynia</i>, then that's no evidence at all. The ancient Romans frequently placed an orthographic h before vowel-initial foreign names. The examples are in the dozens, if not the hundreds (Heruli, Hermunduri, Helvetii, Histri, etc.). But even if some of these actually had an /h/ sound at the beginning of the word, how does that warrant Proto-Celtic *φ? At most, one can set up a Proto-Celtic *h/0, or *(h) with a big question mark next to it. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 19:15, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angr,</p>
<p>Thanks for your exhaustive reply. Yes, it all rings a bell, as I actually studied all that stuff. I actually even studied Welsh at some point. Well, yes, in the main, that whole reasoning is quite persuasive. Here are a few points of detail that don't really affect the overall argument: (1) the initial *sφ- reflected by the Insular Celtic outcomes may actually even be *sf-; (2) the Celtic clusters [xt] and [xs] may be from earlier [φt] and [φs], but also from [ft] and [fs], and -- I don't see why not -- from [ht] and [hs] (I think they are all legitimate intermediate stages, with parallels from other languages); (3) if <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusitanian_language.html" title="Lusitanian language">Lusitanian</a> PORCOM had represented [φorkom], it would probably have been written **FORCOM (I'm confident you can find other examples of F being used to represent [φ], but not P); (4) personally, I am favorably inclined to consider Lusitanian as an Indo-European language close but different from Celtic, since I am convinced there existed a large group of Indo-European languages in Western Europe -- ranging from Portugal to Austria and from Denmark to Central Italy -- that preceded Celtic (e.g. Ligurian, etc.); (5) personally, I don't believe in the existence of a Proto-Insular Celtic, but that does not affect your argument. In any case, I don't question the substance of your explanation. But here's another question: What is the evidence for PIE *g<sup>wh</sup> still being *g<sup>w</sup> in Proto-Celtic? <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 20:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Angr,</p>
<p>Thanks again. Yes, of course, PORCOM need not mean <i>porkom</i>, since we obviously know next to nothing about Lusitanian. Furthermore, I really couldn't say what options the Iberian syllabary had to offer a Celtic or, in any case, Indo-European language of the Iberian peninsula. Thanks also for clarifying Proto-Celtic *g<sup>w</sup>. I have one more question for you. Since you explained so clearly the Insular Celtic outcomes of the PIE cluster *sp, can you tell me what the outcomes of that cluster are in Gaulish, word-initially and medially? I can't think of any examples off hand. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 00:56, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Angr,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I did suspect there was no evidence of *<i>sp-</i> in Gaulish. Personally -- since I do not believe your Insular vs. Continental Celtic split is anything but the result of late convergence and shared innovations -- I would expect in Gaulish something similar to the Brythonic outcomes. Interestingly, there are a few instances of initial <i>f-</i> in Gaulish, but they are usually interpreted as *<i>w-</i>. Pokorny, for example, analyzes the Gaulish place name Fernodubrum as 'Erlenwasser' (i.e. "alder-water") from the lemma *<i>wer-(e)na:</i> 'alder, poplar'. Another such instance I have come across is the Vindelician tribal name Focunates, which some have compared to Vocontii. Perhaps one might want to look instead for a possible *<i>sp-</i> in these.</p>
<p>Your quote from McCone makes little sense to me and further erodes whatever respect I might have had for McCone's opinions. If the initial cluster *<i>sp-</i> had been reanalyzed as phonemically /s/ + /b/, then its outcome should have been that of <i>-s</i>#<i>b-</i>, not of <i>-s</i>#<i>p-</i>&#160;! I am familiar with the Aspiration Mutation (in fact, I have some ideas of my own about it), but clearly it applies to word-initial fortis phonemes only (which were most probably not just voiceless but voiceless aspirated in Insular Celtic) and certainly not to word-initial lenis phonemes (even if they were phonetically voiceless). So, I submit McCone is simply wrong (once again) and you have to go back to positing Proto-Celtic *<i>sp-</i> &gt; *<i>φ-</i> or *<i>f-</i> to explain the known outcomes, i.e. (to quote from your first reply to my inquiry about Proto-Celtic *φ): "in Brythonic as [f] (Welsh <i>ffêr</i> "ankle" &lt; *speret-) and in Old Irish as [s] in unlenited and [f] in lenited position (<i>seir</i> "heel" vs. <i>dí pheirid</i> "two heels")."</p>
<p>Your point that "the PC reflex of PIE *p must have been labial (not [h]) because it went to [w] between a back vowel and <i>n</i> in OIr. <i>súan</i>, MW <i>hun</i> "sleep" &lt; *sōnos &lt; *suwnos &lt; *suφnos &lt; *supnos and OIr. <i>cúan</i> "harbor" &lt; *kōnos &lt; *kawnos &lt; *kaφnos &lt; *kapnos" is very well taken. This point surely lends stronger support for positing Proto-Celtic *φ or *f (rather than *h) than any other consideration. (In particular, there would be no a priori reason to think that a [φ] can more easily turn to [x] than an [h] in clusters such as *pt and *ps. For an example of [h] &gt; [x] in clusters, simply consider your own example, Welsh <i>chwaer</i> &lt; *swesor- 'sister', where [s] most likely went through [h] before becoming [x].)</p>
<p>Finally, a small argument in favor of the primacy of a Q-Celtic vs. P-Celtic (rather than Insular vs. Continental) dialect split. Since PIE *<i>g<sup>wh</sup>-</i> shows up as <i>w-</i> in Gaulish, and since both PIE *<i>g<sup>wh</sup>-</i> and PIE *<i>w-</i> show up as <i>gw-</i> in Brythonic, you should conclude that PIE *<i>g<sup>wh</sup>-</i> became *<i>w-</i> in Brythonic as well as Gaulish (i.e. P-Celtic) and only later did *<i>w-</i> become <i>gw-</i> in Brythonic (more or less at the same time as the very same <i>w-</i> &gt; <i>gw-</i> sound change took place in most -- though not all -- Romance dialects, most of the examples of course being provided by Germanic loanwords in Romance). It is the Irish reflex (<i>g-</i> + vowel rounding) that is divergent. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 18:49, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Angr,</p>
<p>For some reason, I only now noticed your reply of 12 September 2005. You point out that the fact that PC *g<sup>w</sup> and *w stay distinct in word-internal intervocalic position in Brythonic (PC *w remains [w], but PC *g<sup>w</sup> becomes [v] in Welsh <i>deifio</i> "burn" &lt; PC *deg<sup>w</sup>- &lt; PIE *d<sup>h</sup>eg<sup>wh</sup>- and <i>nyf</i> "snow" &lt; PC *snig<sup>w</sup>- &lt; PIE *snig<sup>wh</sup>-) presents a problem with positing a "Gallo-Brittonic" sound change *g<sup>w</sup> &gt; *w followed by a Brythonic *w &gt; *gw in word-intial position.</p>
<p>But let's see. As far as Welsh <i>deifio</i> is concerned, Pokorny says it shows [v] from *w before semivocalic i (citing Thurneysen KZ. 61, 253, Loth RC. 42, 58; see Pokorny, root *da:u- 317, but cross-referenced under *d<sup>h</sup>eg<sup>wh</sup>- 380). And the same may be true for <i>nyf</i> "snow", cf. <i>nyfio</i> "to snow". So, the evidence for the assertion that PC *g<sup>w</sup> and *w were still distinct, at least word-internally, in Proto-Brythonic is not very strong.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assuming for a moment that we can accept this evidence as good, do you know what the word-internal reflex of PC *g<sup>w</sup> is in Gaulish? If Welsh indeed has [v], that would point to a labialized word-internal *-b- &lt; *-g<sup>w</sup>-. Now, do we know that Gaulish had **dew- and **niw- in these roots, as opposed to **deb- and **nib-? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe any of these are attested. Or is there other evidence?</p>
<p>Given how meager the evidence for different word-internal treatments of PC *g<sup>w</sup> between Gaulish and Brythonic is, I would stick to my analysis for word-initial PIE *g<sup>wh</sup>- &gt; PC *g<sup>w</sup> &gt; P-Celtic *w- &gt; Later Brythonic gw- as the most probable sequence of sound changes. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 17:52, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again Angr and gratz on a unanimous promotion&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I want your opinion on how to dab sentences such as <i>A Fuath (pronounced foo-ah) (Fuathan pl.)is a malignate, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> water <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirit</a>.</i>, or phrases like <i><a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a></i> (from <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeorin.html" title="Feeorin">Feeorin</a>)</p>
<p>Obviously they are referring to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_mythology.html" title="Celtic mythology">Celtic mythology</a> but in neither case does the Celtic mythology article touch on the subject, and a reader would probably find it less confusing to be directed to the more general information at <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celt.html" title="Celt">Celts</a>. I dab'd Feeorin to myth. but I'm leaving Fuath alone for now.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support on my RfA... from admin to admin&#160;;)...I'll try to be good...btw, have you ever been to one of the monthly Berlin meetings of the German wikipedians&#160;? <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 11:04, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven't been there either, so I dont know.. I was just interested...and: I had my little problems with the German Wikipedia, as they are, let's say mildly, even more biased.... (or whats the word for <i>hochnäsig</i>?) <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 11:12, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I was positive that biased wasn't the word for <i>hochnäsig</i> (but I thought it caught the gist of my meaning better than arrogant, and as always with German words, I think there are more implications to the word <i>hochnäsig</i> than a mere arrogant...as for the meeting, how many are they (the only other active user I know of (besides you) is <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>) that you know of? <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 07:06, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Once interest in this topic dies down, I'll quietly trim and merge this information into the appropriate general-topic articles.

<p>Hi Angr. Would you mind doing me a favour by deleting article Nunzilla and related Image:Nunzillalg.jpg for me? It was the first experiment created by my boyfriend on wikipedia (unsupervised by me at the time!) and it's not exactly encyclopedic. I've shown him how to tag it with a CSD, so by the time you read this it <i>may</i> already have gone, but if not I'd rather it was deleted on the sly by a friendly soul who won't lecture him on the article or on not using copyrighted images&#160;:-) Cheers, ~ <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeledan_b55e.html" title="User:Veledan">Veledan</a> • <a href="../../../v/e/l/User_talk%7EVeledan_2b8b.html" title="User talk:Veledan">Talk</a> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Veledan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Veledan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+ new</a></sup> 23:01, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>you are right to be somehow confused and surely these categories do need attention but I realy dont think one of them have to be deleted.</p>
<p>The problem: we usually want by "greek language" to mean "modern greek language" <i>and</i> "ancient greek language". as every live hellenic language is derived from ancient greek language you are right to be confused. (the difference between ancient and modern is lesser than the difference between latin and italian but there are wikipedias that are recognized as different languages in spite of the fact that they have even smaller difference). As I see people put in category Hellenic languages and dialects the articles that have to do direct with the hellenic languages and dialects while the category for greek language is generally associated whith greek language. a better deffinition has to be made but I see that delete is not the right choise. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucinos_1d37.html" title="User:Lucinos">Lucinos</a> 09:13, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angr, my deepfelt admiration for your willingness to grace the <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a> article with your likeness.

<p>Angr, please do not be so defensive. As a relative newbie, I tend to approach things from a newbie point of view, and prefer to see a slightly more user-friendly response.

<dd>Thanks for clearing all that up. And yes, I am serious about the 'had had's. Pluperfect tense is indeed an important part of the English language (as well as all the others), but when it is used to have two identically spelled words in sequence (such as 'had had'), there isn't a single sentence in the English language that cannot be rewritten to avoid this ugly occurance. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 09:40, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason I changed "late-November" to "mid-November" is that, because Thanksgiving in the US is in late November, people might read this to assume that the example discusses a birthday that actually falls on Thanksgiving.
