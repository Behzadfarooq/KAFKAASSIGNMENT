<p>Dear Angelique, i remove your question from the Village Pump to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflicts_between_users_62dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflicts between users">Wikipedia:Conflicts between users</a>. I dont like dead people&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel Victoria</a> 16:06, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding an opinion... I dont know what the Quebec thing is about,, neither do i want to get involved. But, if you accept a friendly advice, try to contribute in other topics too and not get too involved about this one in particular. And <b>trust the mediation of other wikipedians</b>. And have fun, like Alex suggested above: thats the most important thing here. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel Victoria</a>
<ul>
<li>I'm glad to know that are not actually *dead* people&#160;:). Yes, i'm sysop but that does not mean that me or my opinion matter more than yours. I moved to conflicts because its the place you go when you want to avoid a perpetual reverting between users, or where you ask for a third party mediation. That is what i think you wanted... <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel</a>
<ul>
<li>I started the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_France_family_tree_d95b.html" title="Kings of France family tree">Kings of France family tree</a> where my reference started. If you want to complete it / correct it / change it and improve it go ahead! Thats the beauty of wiki! If you like history, then there is a lot you can do around here. I'm more into acient history but i know that some section in medieval are hopeless. There are loads of contributions to be made! <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel</a></li>

<p>Angelique, I think you, Mathieu, and Tremblay need to take a break from the History of Quebec article, but especially you most of all. If you want, I will try to make some sense out of what is there, hopefully to everyone's satisfaction, but I think you should stop editing it for a few days. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 17:16, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See, you can't even respond to me without the same sort of polemic you are writing on History of Quebec. I'll wait to see how Mathieu responds to what I've said, but my advice remains the same - stay away from the Quebec article for a few days, at least. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 17:29, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, regardless of whether or not your edits are all factual, you are quite obviously pushing your own POV and that certainly is not in accordance with Wikipedia policy, no matter how much you claim it is. Mathieu and Tremblay and whoever else may also be doing this from the opposite perspective (and I'm pretty sure they are), which is why I'm suggesting that all of you take a break. I also don't understand why you are claiming they're the ones going on and on about racism? It's fairly easy to see you're the one doing that, at least on the History of Quebec talk page. BUt I don't really want to get into accusations and all of that, all I am trying to do is get the three of you to stop editing the page for awhile. 17:41, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Angelique - Mathieugp and Tremblay have both agreed to stop editing the article for a week (that was a few days ago, so I suppose it's down to 5 days now), and I still think it would be in everyone's best interest if you did the same. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 16:52, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I highlighted a sentence above for you. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel Victoria</a> 16:54, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> stated: "<i>you are quite obviously pushing your own POV</i>". My reply (again) is that you have not read a single thing. Your remarks are unfounded, ignorant, and in violation of Wikipedia policy on several levels. Please stop. Thank you. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 16:58, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>How have I violated policy in any way? And why are you completely unwilling to work with anyone, even to the point of moving the entire article? This is ridiculous. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 18:01, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You "win," I suppose - I'm going to avoid this article entirely now, because it's impossible to work out what should be there and what shouldn't. I am also no longer neutral as I find it difficult not to take sides against you&#160;:) So, have fun with the article, hopefully someone gets tired of it eventually. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 19:31, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know if you saw my question on the History of Quebec talk page, so I'll ask here...what specifically is the problem with the "though every dog in Quebec will bark" quote? Is it apocryphal? Or are you just trying to make Macdonald look better? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 20:21, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Unless you know of a better source, we'll have to make do with personal pages which various users have decided are reasonably accurate to suffice for the time being. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>eventually, any information at that site will be assimilated. Until it is, we should retain the link. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>

<p>The information at the external link, which u removed, will eventually be added to the wikipedia; and there will be no need for that link. Until then, keep the linl. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>

<p>The Wikipedia endorses no links; do you object to any of the information on the page in question? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Hi again, I was thinking I may have been a little too jumpy lately, especially as there is a policy of "don't bite the newbies," so I'd like to apologize. I'm sure you'll get used to Wikipedia once you're here longer, and hopefully we can work together on articles instead of accusing each other of various things&#160;:) I want New France and the other articles to be accurate too, of course! I hope this is acceptable, and I look forward to working with you. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 05:14, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't particularily care if it's racism or not - the reader can decide that for his or herself. We can't accuse people of racism in an article. Even just providing the quote is a little suspect, if you have included it simply to bash the BQ (while apparently wanting to remove a quote that denigrates Macdonald's character). I think you have misunderstood the POV policy on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 04:00, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angelique. Can you use Talk: pages more often before making controversial changes to various articles? I'm not only referring to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Quebec_history_5e3f.html" title="Timeline of Quebec history">Timeline of Quebec history</a> but also <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a>. You seemed to be open to discussion at one point.. but then you returned to reverting everything while ignoring everyone's concerns. It's gotten so ridiculously petty. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> 04:11, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Unless you're prepared to add every controversial statement ever made by a Canadian politician to the appropriate party page, this particular incident doesn't belong on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a>. It's no more worthy of note than many other similar incidents that are <i>not</i> listed on their party's page, such as the numerous <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> statements against gays, "Tequila Sheila", "Sambo", anti-francophone statements, etc. It's all or none. The Suzanne Tremblay incident is not special. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:18, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to do an article specifically on <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanne_Tremblay_448c.html" title="Suzanne Tremblay">Suzanne Tremblay</a> which makes note of this incident, great. I'd support that. But <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">mathieugp</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> are correct that the incident does not belong in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:58, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Angelique, may I request that you do not add quotes from me on your user page. I feel that displaying them out of context in this way gives a false impression of what I actually meant at the time I wrote these. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 14:48, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well then try <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForgiveAndForget" class="extiw" title="meatball:ForgiveAndForget">forgiving and forgetting</a>. If Mathieugp is no longer making personal attacks, I don't see why he should need to be reminded of them via your user page. If he is, then you need to address that in the normal way, not by using your user page to make a statement. As I have said before, I object to adding messages to or from me on your user page. Please refrain from doing this. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 15:19, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is a link to the interview of Robert Libman at the Voir weekly paper. This time, it is not a copy of it on <a href="http://www.vigile.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.vigile.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vigile.net/</a>, rather it is on <a href="http://www.voir.ca/" class="external free" title="http://www.voir.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.voir.ca/</a>, the actual online edition of Voir, which any Montréalais can grab for free in the métro or in cafés and various other public places. The Voir also has many other editions for other cities in Québec City, Gatineau, Saguenay etc. Being free, there are literally millions of people who read it every week.

I mean, these are important public figures here. One is a war hero of Israel, the other one is a France and Quebec tv and movie star.
