<p>Hello Angus. If you look at the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Irish_history_0c15.html" title="Timeline of Irish history">Timeline of Irish history</a> you will see that I have made a start on that era, though only up to about <a href="../../../5/4/6/546.html" title="546">546</a>. What I am doing is trying to add in as many stubs on poets, kings and saints as I can one at the moment being <a href="../../../c/e/n/Cenn_F%C3%A1elad_mac_Aillila_4ecc.html" title="Cenn Fáelad mac Aillila">Cenn Fáelad mac Aillila</a> - which I hope to finish within the next few minutes. However, my health is not good enough to do anything more than these small stubs, so I'm afraid all I will be able to do is comment and make minor revisons to your work. Do you think any of my latest contributions will be of any help? Cheers, <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 14:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you have anything on Fland Fina, aka Aldfrid son of Osuiu, King of Northumbria? <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 14:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aengus, a mac! Ta bron orm, I meant to get back to you about your wonderful new article <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_Early_Christian_Ireland_af23.html" title="User:Angusmclellan/Early Christian Ireland">User:Angusmclellan/Early Christian Ireland</a> quicker than this. A breif note about my illness; its bi-polar and depression, and has knocked sheer hell out of me these past several years, especially for the last four. Can't work, can't travel, or do much of anything so Wiki and our mutual interests are a great way of doing <i>something,</i> little as they may be. Heck, nowadays I DO read Playboy for the articles! Help!</p>
<p>Also would like feedback on the above, just finished.</p>
<p>Okay, your article:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 - You might want to look up <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attacotti.html" title="Attacotti">Attacotti</a>, and if you can, Rance's article (cited by myself at the bottom) as it throws a whole new light on Romano-Irish contacts in the mid-to-late 4th century.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 - Any chance of a translation of the Latin at the end of "Setting the scene"? Who is it by?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3 - <i>"The evidence of the Irish annals and genealogies for this period is at best unreliable and at worst the victim of later manipulations."</i> Very true, but not unrecoverable. It would seem that it was not until as late as 516 that the Connachta (not to be known as the Ui Neill for another generation or two!) seized Mide. And in the north they do not seem to have become a true power till as late as the mid-7th century! See The Kingship and Landscape of Tara, ed. Edel Bhreathnach, 2005; <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1851829547</a> (if you can afford it!) or best yet, the section "Recent Theories" that I wrote based on it in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airg%C3%ADalla.html" title="Airgíalla">Airgíalla</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4 - The graphics are fantastic, especially those showing the various kingdoms. For my money, it would be great if you could divide them up into three: one showing Ptolomy's map, one showing Ireland around the time of Patrick, and one for the 7th century - you already have this in "Peoples and princes", though I think they could be far better defined by use of mountions, rivers and a colour scheme. Or is this a bit too much work?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>5 - The photo of the Ardagh Chalice is superb!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>6 - The latest issue of Archaeology Ireland has a great, indepth peice on the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_bog_psalter.html" title="Irish bog psalter">Irish bog psalter</a> - which is now called Faddan Mor Psalter. I hope to add information in the next couple of days, all of which I hope will be of use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>7 - Is there anyway I can fax you articles on this era? I do have quite a few, just don't have much enegry to tackle a large article like this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any other areas of concern, please let me know as I love to help. Is mise, <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 22:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no more information on this atm. I can get access to it though. What does LVED stand for? BTW, browsing through some of the charters in RRS, vol. 1, and found that Godred of Man appears as a witness on a charter to Kelso Abbey issued by Máel Coluim IV at Roxburgh; he's first on the lay witness list as "Godredo rege insularum". Just found it curious that he was given this title in this context. I don't know if you've ever browsed through the RRS volumes, but they are amazing. Ignoring the charters, the introductions are unbeatable sources for the king's they cover. E.g. the one on Máel Coluim IV's reign (v. I) is 128 pages long, and is definitely worth copying and using for wiki. Have a good one. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 02:08, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The addition of Henri V to the list of Kings of France was NOT vandalism, If you allow Napolean II and Louis XIX (fifteen minutes, according to the Guiness book of world records), and Louis XVII (NEVER) you have to admit that the future Comte de Chambourd, who was proclaimed king on July 30, 1830, and had a regent proclaimed by the general assembly (The duke of Orleans later usurped the throne and became king himself but he was officially regent) should be allowed a place on the list.</p>
<p>He was really king of France. I don't know what you guys have against him.</p>

<dd>Sorry, lost my notes from the Woolf lecture. He did explain him, but I can't remember precisely what it was. It was something along the lines of, when the guy compiling it was putting it together he confused one story with another. That's all I remember.

<p>Is the fact that no other encyclopedia calls the guy Jogaila a reason enough? I also wonder whether the fact that Jogaila changed his name and did not use the pagan name for most of his life is a reason enough.. Finally, I believe it is a bad precedent.

<dd>Sorry if my comment above sounded a tad rude, that was not my intention. As to your arguments:
<ul>
<li>You write that he was Lithuanian and thus should have a Lithuanian name. Sure, but then we should apply the very same rule to all monarchs. Move <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a> to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karol_Wojty%C5%82a_1bf2.html" title="Karol Wojtyła">Karol Wojtyła</a>, move <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_II_of_Great_Britain_0274.html" title="George II of Great Britain">George II of Great Britain</a> to Georg August von Brunswick-Lüneburg, move <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom_9851.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII of the United Kingdom</a> to Eduard von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and so on, and so forth. However, I get an impression that this would be the only such article to be moved to the less popular and less obvious title. Double standards anyone?</li>
<li>As to the rules being disputed, I know that and I took part in the discussion there myself. And that's precisely why we dropped the title of <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladislaus_II_of_Poland_b6fe.html" title="Vladislaus II of Poland">Vladislaus II of Poland</a>, which would be the title suggested by the rules. "of Poland" would only make our fellow Lithuanians angry, which is why we dropped it.</li>
<li>As to the complains you write about, do I get you right that you plan to hold the article on that particular Polish king hostage to your campaign of renegotiating the guidelines? "We won't change the name so that more people complained and so that we could change the rules one day"?</li>
<li>Finally, you didn't comment on the fact that the article should not have been moved to Jogaila in the first place. Does it mean that if this WP:RM would end in a stalemate, any admin would have the liberty to interpret it the way he likes? The last time we had a poll (not even a voting), the result was 16:16, yet it was moved. So, this time the article could also be moved back under the same conditions, right?</li>

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it all prove that Jogaila is a solitary exception in wiki? Anyway, the Harald example shows that the best thing to do if the move procedure fails would be to move the article back where it was and then hold the WP:RM to move it to Jogaila, as apparently there are lots of people willing to defend the status quo regardless of what it is. So, if moving the article against the consensus is ok, then moving it back would be ok as well.</dd>
<dd>As to the proposal, I was the one to defend the "of Poland", which however seems to be a tad problematic as far as our fellow Lithuanians are concerned. So, to please them we'd have to include not only the royal title, but also the titles - in the case of kings of Poland the title would then be several lines long. Just imagine Władysław II (King of Poland, lands of Kraków, Sandomierz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Cuyavia, Grand Duke of Lithuania, hereditary master of Pomerania and Ruthenia, overlord of Prussia). Nice one, isn't it. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 13:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Angus! You mentioned you're not averse to two names just not the ones I've proposed, that is, some combination of the Polish and Lithuanian in native syntax: Jogaila, Władysław II Jagiełło, and perhaps "Poland-Lithuania" (again, "of Lithuania" or "of Poland" alone is not historically appropriate). What would you like to see reflected in the Jogaila/Jagiełło title? Thanks!<br />
<i>Just a P.S.</i>, if you are of the "Władysław" is "not English" camp (gathering from the above), I've attempted to engage in a discussion in naming conventions and use of diacriticals (mentioned in the Jogaila talk page).<br />

<p>Hi Angus, you mentioned in an edit summary that the article <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Fraser_%28patriot%29_86af.html" title="Simon Fraser (patriot)">Simon Fraser (patriot)</a> had a not-so-great article title. What would you say would be a more apt title? He was the 2nd Chief of Clan Fraser, but that's not usually a social standing referred to by article titles. Pater, possibly, as he is seen as the father of the Clan Fraser. I wouldn't say of Lovat yet, because he wasn't. I didn't create the article, and I'm usually somewhat hesitent to move articles if I've little business doing so, but I've cringed at the article title many a time. If a more apt title could be thought up, moving it might be a good idea. <a href="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" class="image" title="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/5/58/Icons-flag-scotland.png" alt="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png" width="16" height="11" longdesc="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" /></a> <b><span style="background-color: #008000"><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen"><font color="#FFFFFF">Canæn</font></a></span></b> <a href="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" class="image" title="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/5/58/Icons-flag-scotland.png" alt="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png" width="16" height="11" longdesc="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" /></a> 07:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't been around much though I see the AG talk page has not changed much...however the article itself has improved somewhat...though it has a way to go. Again - it stylistically conflicts with my approach and I find it hard to edit bits...plus anything I've ever edited has been reverted anyway (so not sure I will be doing much besides occasionally countering certain BS on the talk page)....still in the article itself there is need for some more background/context as well as a better feeling for the chronology and specific actions taken by the CUP (incl how they implemented the Genocide and how it differed in different geographic areas and over time...ie. how the Armenian populations were differently affected and experienced the genocide differently) etc. Anyway, mostly I just wanted to say hello back to you...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 20:53, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I need your help with User:Calgacus/David I.. I'm very unhappy with it, mostly because it is too long and I can't figure the best way to include the "Davidian reforms".

<p>Isn't the Latin form of Jog/Wla's name "Jagello"? Where have you got "Jagailo"? Could you give its supposed etymology in/to Latin? And again, isn't it "Jagello", as I have read years and years ago, and which it seems to be in Italian here, at least. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 02:05, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(your answer was: from the styles given in the examples in Jogaila#As_monarch_of_Lithuania_before_religious_conversion)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ah, the excerpts are victims of fluctuating writing in those decades. That source seems to have only one Latin excerpt of Jagello's letters, although there must have been plenty of them in various archives. I would not be surprised if monks have written the name in a different way in each different pergament, and sometimes in two different ways in one and same pergament.<br />
However, are you refuting that the <i>established</i> Latin version of the name was "Jagello", which apparently became standard in Latin in the following couple of centuries, and has left its formulation actually in several Roman languahes (now that I went through several of them): French, Spanish, Italian, Romanian; as well as neighboring Czech and Hungarian, apparently. All those write it today "Jagell...", without -i-; and totally consistent with each other, which makes me think that it was the established Latin version before any of those other languages standardized their writing (as such "foreign" name has easiest come to each of those's writing through how late medieval Latin documents wrote it).<br />
It will not be feasible to float around several Latin versions here, so what is your position now as to what is the Latin one, when you know the above and (hopefully) make your own survey over other languages and Latin sources that can be found.&#160;? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 10:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The authentic name in his lifetime very likely was pronounced in one way, not several; and there likely was not different versions of it for different languages; but scribes wrote it (its middle vowel) in slightly different ways, probably according to how the particular scribe had heard it. A proposition that the middle vowel(s) would have authentically been -ie- seems unlikely, because none of the excerpts show it or even anything close. The vowel appears to have been something that was easily heard or understood either -e- or -a- (could it have been -ä-?). Regarding "your" Jagailo, I am not much doubting that actually also it may have also existed in some original letter - we just seem not to have that letter's text here in our sources. And what is -ai-&#160;: it is actually something rather close with -e-, isn't it? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 10:58, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am well. How are you these days? Thank you for your comments on Jocelin. BTW, you have a few of those good articles only within a few edits of FAs.

<dd>Well, I think you should consider it. It's really no big deal after the nomination, esp. for a user with your good character. All it means is you can do a few extra things. Like I said, I believe that the growing section of articles we happen to work on a lot need a user with admin abilities. To mention nothing else, there are the Pictish and Strathclyde kings you believe should be renamed. Anyways, yes. Malcolm III is one of the articles you should prolly consider being your next FA. And yes, I too have a bunch of articles (esp. the ones I did when I first started wiki) that badly need revisiting; I'm thinking here of the mormaer and Galloway articles. SitHMA also needs reworked on some minor points of content and on citations, though it's already an FA. I nominated Jocelin for FA btw; had to so it now because I'm going away on December 12, and thus after that point won't be able to address any issues that may or may not be brought up.

<p>Hey Angus,</p>
<p>Orhan Pamuk said that he never used the phrase "Turks killed Armenians." on a Turkish television(CNNTURK). Armenian genocide is an historical article and should not have to refer to present day talks. Kanal D - HaberYazar Orhan Pamuk "30 bin Kürt öldürüldü" sözü için merak edilen açıklamayı ... gibi "Biz şu kadar Ermeni öldürdük" demedim, soykırım sözcüğünü kullanmadım. ... www.kanald.com.tr/haber/guncel/2005.10.16/orhan.shtml</p>
<p>In English, Pamuk says "I did not say we killed that amount of Armeninas, I did not use the word genocide" as a translation of " "Biz şu kadar Ermeni öldürdük" demedim, soykırım sözcüğünü kullanmadım." demedim means "not say", and "öldürdük" means "kill". "kullanmadım" means "did not use" and "soykırım" means "genocide".</p>

<p>I don't think it is a good idea to create 2 articles- which would basically duplicate another, especially just so we can insert some words in a language spoken by less than 0.1% of the population.

<li>That's an incorrect and rather disingenuous summary of the situation, and I refer you to the talk page. Frankly, I'm not that fussed whether or not the Gaelic is there, but I'm not prepared to see the triumph of legal fictions over reality, nor to allow you to grind your anti-Gaelic axe against the will of the wiki community just because they have less will and persistence than yourself.

<li>His version says "The Royal Bank of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: Banca Rìoghail na h-Alba[1]) is an Edinburgh-based company founded in 1727. The organisation has grown into the banking and insurance holding company known as The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS Group)." This is not true as the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC still exists as a fully owned subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. It is factually incorrect to state this. My version restored the truth, and Calgus is only reverting so he can keep his Gaelic in the first line, rather than the second para which was suggested by someone else. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 21:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would put the RBSG first, as this is the company quoted on the LSE, the lead in the infobox and logo, and the ultimate holding company, so a slight amendment to:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (LSE: RBS) is a banking and insurance holding company based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Today the it is the largest banking and insurance group in Scotland, the second largest in the UK and Europe, and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. Its shares have a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange.<br />
<br />
The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC is the group's Scottish clearing bank and the second oldest bank in Scotland after the Bank of Scotland. The registered head office of the group and the clearing bank is located at St Andrew Square. In 2005, Queen Elizabeth II opened the bank's new head office building in Gogarburn, Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It is a fact he has been blocked for incivility twice (although I understand the Tony's block was somewhat disputed). Nonetheless both of those cases are relativly recent - certainly more recent than many diffs he mentions in his RfC. Are you suggesting we should disregard all instances of disputed behaviour older then few months (weeks?)? This block is just one of many examples of a continuing trend - ArbCom comment and his RfC are much older, variou threads on ANI or mediations are both older and newer; trend is clear. PS.

<p>Thanks for your comment, but I have to refuse. After it's been pointed out to me that casting absurd accusations here and there is absolutely acceptable in Wikipedia, I finally decided to follow the same rule that has been applied by the others for more than a year now. If others can, then why not me? If Ghirla, Renata, M.K., Irpen, Juraune and other nationalists are allowed to accuse me of a zillion of things over and over again, without posting a single piece of evidence, then why am I not allowed to do the very same thing? Who cares for evidence in Wikipedia, after all... Also, I don't think Durova, who started her first contact ever with me with a series of unfounded accusations and offences, would be the best person to judge my case - whatever it is. But, as I said, thanks for your attention. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 23:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, generally you were right to remove the names, but this only makes my point more obvious: various people have accused me of absurd things in the last 3 months or so, posting such hate letters in public, going as far as to blame me for their own failures, equating me with a Nazi, calling my parents commies and so on. All with names and in length. Yet, when after all this time I finally lost my temper as well, it is me who is moderated. Where were all the admins for the last year, when Ghirla continued his slander against me? Where were you when Renata accused me of hatred towards her nation and nazism even though it was a complete absurd? Where were you all back then? <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 10:25, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no need for you to waste your time on me as I'm pretty much a lost case now. Perhaps it's because of Christmas, but I'm afraid what's been done to me cannot be undone. I've been waiting for some sort of an apology for ages, I've been waiting for the people who frequently offend me in Wikipedia to change their ways - to no avail. Now I lost all hope and I don't believe there's anything that could be done. Sorry, but after so much time I'd have trouble with assuming good faith on the side of a person who - so far - has never shown it. And that's the basic prerequisite of a successful mediation, isn't it. In short, I've seen it before: Ghirlandajo is threatened this way or another, so he steps back for a week or a month, but then his old ways return. And usually I'm among the first people to be targeted (along with Piotrus). Anyway, all the best in the new year and merry Christmas. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 11:21, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Angus, I can see nothing wrong with my post from 23 November - is it bad to point out who has done most of the work? It is Dr. Dan and M.K who have turned this exchange into a contest of sarcasm; I find persecution of Halibutt, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_8bec.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">168-most active editor</a> of this project, by two users whose input into this project has been rather smaller - but who succeeded in forcing him into extended wikiholidays - a very negative outcome.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 10:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'd think that if a user have written a good part of the article, which has just been recognized as a GA, and a relevant thread <i>already</i> created by the GA reviewer, the editors involved deserve some 'back-slapping' - after all, we don't get payed, so a few compliments from others are all we can count for, and the article's talk page is a good place to see how others appreciate one's work. Thus I am not suprized that after Halibutt has spend days expanding the article to a GA status, and then he gets a load of sarcasm and PAs instead of thanks, he takes wikiholidays... the question is, is this what we want? Because looking at Talk:Jogaila I am under the impression that unfortunatly, some are quite happy with what they achieved. PS. Building on what I and Halibutt said: if you have time to do a little mediation and such, perhaps you could also try talking to the other editors involved and ask them to stop harassing Halibutt and lessen the load of sarcasm in their posts - this would go a long way towards helping everyone. Thanks, --<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 11:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! You recently reverted my change on <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roeland_Raes_31e3.html" title="Roeland Raes">Roeland Raes</a>. The link to the change is [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roeland_Raes&amp;diff=96536490&amp;oldid=96418692" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roeland_Raes&amp;diff=96536490&amp;oldid=96418692" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] here. I removed the "Anti-semetic persons" category from this article, because the article states: <i>"Critics accuse Raes of Holocaust revisionism and being an antisemite."</i> It seems to me that placing him under the category of anti-semitic people is a bit hasty and unduly prejudicial, given that only his critics call him that. Perhaps if it was proven or self-described, it would be acceptable, but I don't think labeling of this sort is proper just based on an accusation.</p>
<p>Anyway, please adhere to <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>, which states: "</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not simply revert changes that are made as part of a dispute. Be respectful to other editors, their contributions and their points of view.</li>
<li>Do not revert good faith edits. In other words, try to consider the editor "on the other end." If what one is attempting is a positive contribution to Wikipedia, a revert of those contributions is inappropriate unless, and only unless, you as an editor possess firm, substantive, and objective proof to the contrary. Mere disagreement is not such proof. See also Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith.</li>
<li>Generally there are misconceptions that problematic sections of an article or recent changes are the reasons for reverting or deletion. If they contain valid information, these texts should simply be edited and improved accordingly. Reverting is not a decision which should be taken lightly."</li>
</ol>

<dd>There's a print citation describing Raes as an antisemite, and a court case where he's charged with <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negationism.html" title="Negationism">negationism</a> (and not <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism.html" title="Historical revisionism">historical revisionism</a> as the article claims).

If you'd prefer to classify him as a holocaust denier, I have no objection to the change; indeed I'd prefer that. You said that "[i]f he's only accused of being an anti-semite by critics, he can't really have the cat of "anti-semite" because it's not proven". This is mistaken. If the criticisms are attributable to reliable sources, then we can, and probably should, have him so categorised.

<p>Angus, you may not have known it, but only admins are supposed to close deletion discussions that aren't obvious keeps. It may seem helpful to judge consensus and close them, but an admin still has to go through and check the consensus, then actually delete the article in question. Full guidelines are at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process#Non-administrators_closing_discussions</a>. You're welcome to close clear keeps under those guidelines, and that would be very helpful. Thanks.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your comment: I know you added some original material there, but the core of the article looks to have been cribbed. Would you have a minute to paraphrase it? Thanks a million! Angus McLellan (Talk) 21:59, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My reply: I did add some info, but not the 'cribbed section'. This info is from <a href="http://www.mansfieldtraquair.org.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.mansfieldtraquair.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.mansfieldtraquair.org.uk</a> and I suspect this was added by the Mansfield Traqair Trust who own this website! I'm reluctant to reedit their entry and material as they are the experts .... <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarena_sez_759d.html" title="User:Carena sez">carena</a> 19:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
