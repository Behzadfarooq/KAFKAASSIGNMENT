<p>The current name of the church was adopted in 1955 — hitherto it had been known as "The Church of England in Canada." The church acquired its current French-language name in 1989. Prior to this, General Synod had adopted "l'Église Episcopale du Canada" in 1977 and amended the canons to reflect this in 1983 <sup id="_ref-handbookmultiple_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbookmultiple" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The Anglican Church of Canada is a Province of the Anglican Communion.<sup id="_ref-prov_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prov" title="">[1]</a></sup> A matter of some confusion for Anglicans elsewhere in the world is that while the Anglican Church of Canada is a "province" of the Anglican Communion, the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_Province_of_Canada_3626.html" title="Ecclesiastical Province of Canada">Ecclesiastical Province of Canada</a> is merely one of four such <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical provinces</a> of the Anglican Church of Canada. The confusing issue of nomenclature is further confused by the fact that the Canadian confederation deems its ten constituent elements to be civil <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Canada_bc70.html" title="Provinces of Canada">provinces</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been attempts by splinter groups to incorporate under very similar names. Corporations Canada, the agency of the federal government which has jurisdiction over federally incorporated companies, ruled on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> that a group of dissident Anglicans may not use the name "Anglican Communion in Canada", holding that in Canada the term "Anglican Communion" is associated only with the Anglican Church of Canada, being the Canadian denomination which belongs to that international body.

<p>The secular history of Canada depicts Bishop Strachan as an ally of the landed gentry of the so-called <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Compact_3778.html" title="Family Compact">Family Compact</a> of <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Canada_49b4.html" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a>, opposed to the political aspirations of farmers and bourgeoisie for <a href="../../../r/e/s/Responsible_government.html" title="Responsible government">responsible government</a>. Nonetheless, Strachan played considerable part in promoting education, as founder of Kings College (now the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>) and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Trinity_College_0f3d.html" title="University of Trinity College">Trinity College</a>. The <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy_reserves.html" title="Clergy reserves">Clergy reserves</a>, land that had been reserved for use by the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">clergy</a>, became a major issue in the mid-19th century. Anglicans argued that the land was meant for their exclusive use, while other Protestant denominations demanded that it be divided among them.</p>
<p>In Upper Canada, leading dissenters such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> minister <a href="../../../e/g/e/Egerton_Ryerson_e608.html" title="Egerton Ryerson">Egerton Ryerson</a> — in due course a minister of education in the government of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> — agitated against establishment. Following the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Canada_Rebellion_4c15.html" title="Upper Canada Rebellion">Upper Canada Rebellion</a>, the creation of the united <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Canada_746e.html" title="Province of Canada">Province of Canada</a>, and the implementation of responsible government in the 1840s, the unpopularity of the Anglican-dominated <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Compact_3778.html" title="Family Compact">Family Compact</a> made establishment a moot point. The Church was <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disestablishmentarianism.html" title="Disestablishmentarianism">disestablished</a> in Nova Scotia in 1850 and Upper Canada in 1854. By the time of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_confederation.html" title="Canadian confederation">Confederation</a> in 1867, the Church of England was disestablished throughout <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_North_America_0dc2.html" title="British North America">British North America</a>.</p>

<p>Until the 1830s, the Anglican church in Canada was synonymous with the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>: bishops were appointed and priests supplied by the church in England, and funding for the church came from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Parliament_877c.html" title="British Parliament">British Parliament</a>. The first Canadian <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod.html" title="Synod">synods</a> were established in the 1850s, giving the Canadian church a degree of self-government.

<p>As the new Canadian nation expanded after <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Confederation_dbec.html" title="Canadian Confederation">confederation</a> in 1867, so too did the Anglican Church. After the establishment of the first <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical province</a> — that of <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_Province_of_Canada_3626.html" title="Ecclesiastical Province of Canada">Canada</a> in 1860 — others followed. The first was the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_Province_of_Rupert%27s_Land_cc91.html" title="Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land">Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land</a>, created in 1875 to encompass Anglican dioceses outside what were then the boundaries of Canada: present-day Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec, the western provinces, and the Territories. In the forty years between self-government in 1861 and 1900, sixteen of the presently existing dioceses were created, as numbers blossomed with accelerating immigration from England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>
<p>During this time, the Anglican Church assumed de facto administrative responsibility in the far-flung wilderness of Canada and British North America. The church was contracted by colonial officials and the Canadian government to administer <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_residential_school_system.html" title="Canadian residential school system">residential schools</a> for the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples.html" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a> of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Nations_0096.html" title="First Nations">First Nations</a> - a decision which would come back to haunt it much later. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to, amongst other things, assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language. At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nisga%27a.html" title="Nisga'a">Nisga'a</a> of northern <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>).</p>
<p>Despite this growth in both the size and role of the church, progress was undermined by internal conflict over <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchmanship.html" title="Churchmanship">churchmanship</a>. This was manifested in the creation of competing theological schools, a refusal on behalf of bishops of one ecclesiastical party to ordain those of the other, and - in the most extreme cases - schism. This latter phenomenon was particularly virulent in Western Canada, culminating in the high profile defection of Edward Cridge, the Dean of the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_British_Columbia_c27d.html" title="Diocese of British Columbia">Diocese of [British] Columbia</a>, to the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Episcopal_Church_1cf1.html" title="Reformed Episcopal Church">Reformed Episcopal Church</a>.</p>

<p>Expansion evolved into a general complacency as the twentieth century progressed. During the early part of this period, the ACC reinforced its traditional role as the establishment church, although influences from the home-grown Protestant <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_gospel.html" title="Social gospel">social gospel</a> movement, and the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_socialism.html" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</a> of elements in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> increasingly were felt. This influence would eventually result in the creation of what would come to be known as the Primate's World Relief and Development Fund, in 1958.</p>
<p>By the middle of the century, pressure to reform the structures of the church were being felt. The name of the church was changed in 1955 from "The Church of England in Canada" to the "Anglican Church of Canada," and a major revision of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> was undertaken in 1962 - the first in over forty years. Despite these rather tepid changes, the church was still perceived as complacent and disengaged - a view emphasized by the title of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Berton_ca87.html" title="Pierre Berton">Pierre Berton</a>'s best-selling analysis of the denomination, <i>The Comfortable Pew</i>, published in 1965.</p>
<p>Change became more rapid towards the close of the 1960s, as mainline churches like the Anglicans began to see the first wave of evaporation from the pews. Ecumenical relationships were intensified, with a view to <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_communion.html" title="Full communion">full communion</a>. While negotiations with the largest Protestant denomination, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Canada_9aa4.html" title="United Church of Canada">United Church of Canada</a>, faltered in the early 1970s, the Anglican Church did achieve full communion with the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_Canada_72c0.html" title="Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada">Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada</a> as the century drew to a close. New liturgical resources were introduced, which would culminate in the publication of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Alternative_Services_aaa5.html" title="Book of Alternative Services">Book of Alternative Services</a> in 1985. Agitation for the ordination of women led to their inclusion in 1976 as deacons, priests, and - eventually - bishops. And social and cultural change led to the church's decision to marry <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> couples, endorse certain forms of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a>, and moves towards greater inclusion of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">gay and lesbian</a> people in the life of the church.</p>

<p>The Primate of the ACC — originally the "Primate of All Canada" in echo of the titles of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York in England and to distinguish the national church from the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_Province_of_Canada_3626.html" title="Ecclesiastical Province of Canada">Ecclesiastical Province of Canada</a> (the former territory of Lower Canada, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland) — is elected by General Synod from among the diocesan bishops. Primates hold the ex officio rank of archbishop; in 1931 the General Synod approved a recommendation that a fixed primatial <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_See_dd2c.html" title="Episcopal See">See</a> (as of the Archbishop of Canterbury) be established<sup id="_ref-handbookmultiple_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbookmultiple" title="">[3]</a></sup> and in 1955 it was recommended that "a small See [be created] in the vicinity of Ottawa to which the Dioceses of The Arctic, Moosonee, Keewatin and Yukon would be attached, forming a fifth Province." However, General Synod rejected the proposal in 1959 and in 1969 "the Canon on the Primacy was amended to require the Primate to maintain an office at the national headquarters of the Church, with a pastoral relationship to the whole Church, but no fixed Primatial See"<sup id="_ref-handbookmultiple_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-handbookmultiple" title="">[3]</a></sup> as with Presiding Bishops of the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_of_the_USA_eec5.html" title="Episcopal Church of the USA">Episcopal Church of the USA</a> and unlike Primates of England, Australia and elsewhere. In consequence, Primates of the Anglican Church of Canada are not diocesan bishops and generally do not carry out ordinary episcopal functions; they originally held office for life but in recent years they have retired by the age of 70.</p>

<p>In 1918 and 1962 the ACC produced successive authoritative Canadian Prayer Books, substantially based on the 1662 English <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> (BCP); both were conservative revisions consisting largely of minor editorial emendations of archaic diction. In 1985 the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Alternative_Services_aaa5.html" title="Book of Alternative Services">Book of Alternative Services</a> (BAS) was issued, officially not designated to supersede but to be used alongside the 1962 Prayer Book. It is a more thoroughgoing modernising of Canadian Anglican liturgies, containing considerable borrowings from Lutheran, Church of England, American Episcopalian and liberal Roman Catholic service books; it was received with general enthusiasm and in practice has largely supplanted the Book of Common Prayer, although the BCP remains the official Liturgy of the Church in Canada. A French translation, <i>Le Recueil des Prières de la Communauté Chrétienne</i>, was published in 1967. The increasing preference for the BAS among parishes and clergy has been countered by the founding of the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer_Book_Society_of_Canada_6ac9.html" title="Prayer Book Society of Canada">Prayer Book Society of Canada</a>, which strives to promote the use of the BCP. The tension between adherents of the BCP and advocates of the BAS has contributed to a sense of disaffection within the Church on the part of liturgical traditionalists. At the same time, there have been increasing calls for revision of the prayer books, perhaps involving the production of a single book encompassing elements from both resources. Even those who use the BAS have cited various shortcomings, and as it ages and newer liturgies are produced elsewhere in the Communion, a desire has been expressed for its revision.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymnody.html" title="Hymnody">Hymnody</a> is an important aspect of worship in Anglicanism, and the ACC is no different. There is no one hymnal required to be used, although the ACC has produced four successive authorised versions since 1908. The most recent, <i>Common Praise</i>, was published in 1998. Anglican <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plainsong.html" title="Plainsong">plainsong</a> is represented in the new hymnal, as well as in the older <i>Canadian Psalter</i>, published in 1963. Notable Canadian Anglican hymnists include Derek Holman, Gordon Light, Herbert O'Driscoll, and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healey_Willan_6d0b.html" title="Healey Willan">Healey Willan</a>.</p>
<p>Like most churches of the Anglican Communion, the ACC was beset by intense conflict over the <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritualism.html" title="Ritualism">ritualism</a> controversies of the latter nineteenth century, leading in some extreme cases to schism. Throughout much of the twentieth century, parishes - and, to a certain extent, dioceses or regions - were more or less divided between <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_church.html" title="High church">high church</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Catholic_1507.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a>), <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_church.html" title="Low church">low church</a> (evangelical), and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_church.html" title="Broad church">broad church</a> (middle-of-the-road). Many of these designations have become muted with time, as the passions which fired the debate have cooled and most parishes have found a happy medium or accommodation.</p>

<p>As is the case in churches directly influenced by <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> ethos and theology, the ACC tends to reflect the dominant social and cultural strains of the nation in which it finds itself. For most of its history, the ACC embodied the conservative, colonial outlook of its mostly British-descended parishioners and of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English-Canadian_b7bc.html" title="English-Canadian">English Canada</a> as a whole. In the post-World War II period, as the character of Canada changed, so too did the attitudes of people in the pews, and by extension, the church.</p>

<p>In recent years the ACC has been a leading force for reform within the Anglican Communion. In the 1970s, Primate <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Scott_1315.html" title="Edward Scott">Ted Scott</a> argued at the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambeth_Conference_0b82.html" title="Lambeth Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> in favour of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination_of_women.html" title="Ordination of women">women's ordination</a>. The ACC ordained its first female priest in 1976, and its first female bishop in 1993. Many parishes, particularly in the west and even more particularly on aboriginal reserves, were already served by women deacons and allowing them to be ordained priests simply regularized a situation which had long pertained and permitted the full sacerdotal ministry to be brought to parishes they served. Nonetheless, this reform — in concert with such moves as allowing the remarriage of divorced persons — caused strains among more conservative parishes, both Anglo-Catholic and evangelical. In the early 1970s, some members of the ACC left to join dissident Anglican groups such as the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Catholic_Church_of_Canada_3dd4.html" title="Anglican Catholic Church of Canada">Anglican Catholic Church of Canada</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, in 2002, the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_New_Westminster_0523.html" title="Diocese of New Westminster">Diocese of New Westminster</a> (located in the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lower_Mainland_5a62.html" title="Lower Mainland">southwest corner</a> of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>) voted to permit the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions">blessing of same-sex unions</a> by parishes requesting authorization to do so<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup>. This action was condemned by some Canadian Anglicans and some provinces of the Communion. Several conservative national Anglican churches, notably the Churches of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Uganda_af18.html" title="Anglican Church of Uganda">Uganda</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Nigeria_9f45.html" title="Anglican Church of Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, have declared themselves out of communion with the ACC as a result of their disquiet with the ACC's perceived excessive inclusivity with respect to female and gay clergy and laity and in particular over the blessing of same-sex unions in New Westminster. Following the submission of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Report_a36e.html" title="Windsor Report">Windsor Report</a>'s recommendations, Bishop <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ingham_6d12.html" title="Michael Ingham">Michael Ingham</a> of New Westminster agreed "neither to encourage nor to initiate" same-sex blessings in additional parishes, but stopped short of declaring a moratorium on those occurring in parishes already licensed to perform them<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 1992 an Anglican priest, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Ferry_1456.html" title="James Ferry">James Ferry</a>, was brought before a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops%27_Court_f180.html" title="Bishops' Court">Bishops' Court</a> for being in a same-sex relationship. Ferry was stripped of his licence to preach and "inhibited" from practising other Anglican clerical functions. Ferry left the church and joined the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Community_Church_of_Toronto_3df2.html" title="Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto">Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto</a>; in 1998, Ferry was partially reinstated. (In 2006 Archbishop Terence Finlay, who had presided over the proceedings against Ferry, was himself disciplined by his successor as bishop of Toronto for assisting in a same-sex wedding in a Toronto <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Canada_9aa4.html" title="United Church of Canada">United Church</a>, saying, "I think our church has waited a long time and has discussed this issue over and over and in this particular situation, time just run out for me." <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>To date, the ACC has resolved neither the question of ordaining non-celibate gay and lesbian clergy nor the question of blessing same-sex unions. Thus far blessing of same-sex unions has been permitted only in seven parishes in the Diocese of New Westminster.</p>
<p>Primate's Theological Commission produced a report examining whether or not such blessings were a matter of doctrine (<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Michael_Report_ccf6.html" title="St. Michael Report">St. Michael Report</a>). The issue will again come before General Synod in 2007.</p>

<p>During the 19th century the federal Crown delegated the operation of Indian residential schools to the ACC and Roman Catholic religious orders (with some minimal involvement by the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches of Canada as well). In the 1980s numerous <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tort.html" title="Tort">tort claims</a> were brought by former students of such schools against both the Crown and church organizations in respect of abuse by sexually disordered church personnel in such institutions and to a lesser extent in respect of a perception that such schools had been insensitive to issues of preservation of aboriginal culture and identity.</p>
<p>The claims were ultimately comprehensively settled but the damage to the morale of the ACC has yet to be entirely resolved: the Diocese of Cariboo was obliged to declare bankruptcy and was liquidated — its current manifestation is as "the Anglican parishes of the central interior," with episcopal oversight by an assistant bishop to the metropolitan Archbishop of the Province of British Columbia and the Yukon. (Its now-unofficial cathedral of St Paul in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamloops.html" title="Kamloops">Kamloops</a> continues to be deemed a cathedral, its rector being styled "very reverend," as a dean. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup> ). The <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Qu%27Appelle_0887.html" title="Diocese of Qu'Appelle">Diocese of Qu'Appelle</a> and the General Synod of the ACC were in considerable danger of the same fate until settlement of the claims was reached on a national basis. Archbishop <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Peers_b36d.html" title="Michael Peers">Michael Peers</a> took a major role on behalf of the ACC with respect to reaching a settlement with the federal Crown, which was the defendant of the first instance and which counter-claimed against the ACC and Roman Catholic religious orders. He offered the ACC's apology to aboriginal people and delayed his retirement until 2004 when his successor could come to the primacy with the issue also retired.</p>
<p>In January of 2007 the Church announced the appointment of the Rt. Rev.
