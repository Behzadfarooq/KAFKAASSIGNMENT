<p>Born to a deeply religious family in St. Louis, Angela began singing in church and though she was a very talented vocalist, had no intentions of a career in music; instead going to college at <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_University_25e8.html" title="Howard University">Howard University</a> as a architecture major. All that changed in 1976, when she was inspired to start a music career after finding backing to record a demo and promptly changing her major to music education. Upon completing the demo project, she tried shopping it to various record labels with no success until she met record industry veteran, Wayne K. Garfield (co-writer of "The Glow Of Love" by Luther Vandross and "All For You" by Janet Jackson) a friend of her roommate in Washington, D.C., Atty. Louise West. Garfield contacted New York City deejay, Gary Byrd, (who had been writing with Stevie Wonder) and recommended Winbush for the job opening in Wonder's female backing trio, Wonderlove. Becoming Wonder's protege', she learned a great deal about writing and arranging songs. Within a year, she formed a bond with singer<a href="../../../r/e/n/Rene_Moore_66d0.html" title="Rene Moore">Rene Moore</a>, whom she had met at Howard. The two became a couple and also began writing songs together. Forming Rene &amp; Angela in 1980, the duo released their self-titled debut album which included the singles "Everything We Do" and "Do You Love Me". Between <i>Rene &amp; Angela</i> and 1983's <i>Rise</i>, the duo scored charted singles with "I Love You More", "Imaginary Playmates", "Banging the Boogie" and their top twenty R&amp;B ballad, "My First Love", which was the first song to give Rene &amp; Angela more notice in the R&amp;B community where the song eventually reached number twelve on the R&amp;B chart.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Winbush_4957.html" title="Edit section: A Street Called Desire and meeting Ron Isley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>A Street Called Desire</i> and meeting Ron Isley</span></h3>
<p>During Rene &amp; Angela's early years, they were asked to produce songs for <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Jackson_4116.html" title="Janet Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>'s 1982 self-titled debut album, <i><a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Jackson_%28album%29_f516.html" title="Janet Jackson (album)">Janet Jackson</a></i>. One of the songs, "<a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Love_02c5.html" title="Young Love">Young Love</a>", became Jackson's first top ten R&amp;B hit reaching number six on the chart. They also wrote exclusively for <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Mills_18c8.html" title="Stephanie Mills">Stephanie Mills</a>, with whom would forge a close friendship with Winbush. Mills' 1985 classic, "<a href="../../../i/_/h/I_Have_Learned_to_Respect_the_Power_of_Love_e438.html" title="I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love">I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love</a>", gave Mills her first-ever #1 R&amp;B single. Winbush would later write another Mills number one R&amp;B hit with "Something in the Way You Make Me Feel". Between that, Rene &amp; Angela decided to branch out and find a bigger fan base signing with <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Records_6082.html" title="Mercury Records">Mercury Records</a> in 1984, they released their breakthrough album, <i>A Street Called Desire</i> the following year. Among the hit singles included on the album was their first R&amp;B number one with the dance single, "Save Your Love (For #1)", which included guest vocals from <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapper.html" title="Rapper">rapper</a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurtis_Blow_8b05.html" title="Kurtis Blow">Kurtis Blow</a>, making it besides <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaka_Khan_bcef.html" title="Chaka Khan">Chaka Khan</a>'s "<a href="../../../i/_/f/I_Feel_For_You_d4ee.html" title="I Feel For You">I Feel For You</a>", one of the first songs to prominently featured a rapper. Other hit singles included "I'll Be Good", the mostly Winbush-led "Your Smile" was another number one hit while the subsequent "You Don't Have to Cry", hit number two in the beginning of 1986. Eventually <i>A Street Called Desire</i> sold over a million copies going <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">platinum</a> but on the brink of their biggest album, tensions between Winbush and Moore had grown and by the end of the album's promotion, the duo split both personally and professionally. Moore would continue to find success as a songwriter, most notably for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, but he would never again find success as a singer as Winbush was often the main draw of their singles.</p>
<p>In 1987, Winbush was introduced to future husband <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Isley_76b2.html" title="Ronald Isley">Ronald Isley</a>, lead singer of the influential <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Isley_Brothers_bbcb.html" title="The Isley Brothers">Isley Brothers</a> after <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Medina_dcd4.html" title="Benny Medina">Benny Medina</a> had agreed to ask Winbush to be involved with the Isleys' next record after Isley had proposed plans to work with Winbush. Producing, writing and arranging the Isleys' <i><a href="../../../s/m/o/Smooth_Sailin%27_8cd3.html" title="Smooth Sailin'">Smooth Sailin'</a></i> album, Winbush helped the group, now including just Ronald and <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_Isley_f5be.html" title="Rudolph Isley">Rudolph</a> (eldest brother <a href="../../../o/27/k/O%27Kelly_Isley%2C_Jr._9f63.html" title="O'Kelly Isley, Jr.">O'Kelly</a> had passed away in 1986), score a top 10 R&amp;B hit with the title track.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Winbush_4957.html" title="Edit section: Sharp and subsequent follow-ups">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Sharp</i> and subsequent follow-ups</span></h3>
<p>In turn, Isley opted to manage Winbush and he helped in the process of releasing her debut solo album, <i>Sharp</i>, which was also released in 1987. The album included the huge hit, "Angel", which stayed at number one on the R&amp;B chart for two weeks in 1987 and showcasing her five and a half octave range. Other hits include the dance track, "Run to Me", "C'est Toi (It's You)" and the Ron Isley duet, "Hello Beloved". In 1989, Winbush released her follow-up to <i>Sharp</i> with <i>It's the Real Thing</i>. The title track reached number two on the R&amp;B chart while subsequent hits "No More Tears" and "Lay Your Troubles Down" continued Winbush's top 40 success on the R&amp;B charts where she was now a fixture on despite failed attempts to cross her over to pop audiences. On June 26, 1993 Winbush and longtime manager/collaborator/lover Ronald Isley, who is thirteen years Angela's senior, married. A year later Winbush released her third self-titled solo album, which included the huge R&amp;B hit, "Treat U Rite". Produced by <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuckii_Booker_ec85.html" title="Chuckii Booker">Chuckii Booker</a>, the song peaked at number six on the R&amp;B chart making it Winbush's ninth top ten R&amp;B hit altogether in her career. In 1996, Winbush was featured on the Isley Brothers' hit "Floatin' On Your Love", which was essentially a duet between Winbush and Ron Isley. The song was later remixed by <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean__Puffy__Combs_da90.html" title="Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs">Sean "Puffy" Combs</a> and featured guest vocals from <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lil%27_Kim_1e2c.html" title="Lil' Kim">Lil' Kim</a> and the group <a href="../../../1/1/2/112_%28band%29.html" title="112 (band)">112</a> in backgrounds. The video for it showcased Winbush serenading Isley's Mr. Biggs character. Winbush continued to collaborate with the Isley Brothers until 2001's <i><a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_%28album%29.html" title="Eternal (album)">Eternal</a></i>, where afterwards, their marriage had cooled off. In 2002, Winbush and Isley quietly divorced. In 2003, Winbush made news when it was found out she was diagnosed with <a href="../../../o/v/a/Ovarian_cancer.html" title="Ovarian cancer">ovarian cancer</a>. Eventually after a successful surgery, the cancer was in remission and Winbush returned to perform on the road.</p>

<p>Since starting out with Rene &amp; Angela, Winbush has played an influence on various R&amp;B and hip-hop acts. In the latter genre, Winbush has heard her music being sampled by acts such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Notorious_B.I.G._15bd.html" title="The Notorious B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a> (who featured her and <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Z_fefb.html" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> on his Rene &amp; Angela-sampled "I Love You More" for the song "I Love the Dough"), <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxy_Brown_6b9f.html" title="Foxy Brown">Foxy Brown</a> (who sampled her "I'll Be Good" for her 1997 top ten hit, "I'll Be") and singer <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avant.html" title="Avant">Avant</a> re-recorded the Rene &amp; Angela ballad, "My First Love", with singer Keke Wyatt in 2000. In appreciation during Avant's performance of the song on <a href="../../../b/e/t/BET_6534.html" title="BET">BET</a>'s <i><a href="../../../1/0/6/106_%26_Park_0e8b.html" title="106 &amp; Park">106 &amp; Park</a></i>, in 2001, Winbush surprised the audience by singing alongside Avant on the song. As a singer, Winbush influenced the likes of <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syleena_Johnson_3618.html" title="Syleena Johnson">Syleena Johnson</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chante_Moore_47ab.html" title="Chante Moore">Chante Moore</a>. Winbush and former partner Rene Moore also shared the distinction for being one of the first R&amp;B acts to prominently feature a rap act in a R&amp;B song sharing that distinction with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaka_Khan_bcef.html" title="Chaka Khan">Chaka Khan</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a> band <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameo_%28band%29.html" title="Cameo (band)">Cameo</a>. Winbush also carries the distinction of being one of the few female artists to find success as a songwriter, arranger, producer and session musician (Winbush also is an avid musician playing <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyboards.html" title="Keyboards">keyboards</a>).</p>

<p>During a 2006 interview on the Christian TV show, Gospel of Music, hosted by Jeff Majors, Winbush disclosed that she'd overcome Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer after 6 months of chemotherapy in 2003. Her undying faith in God also got her through having a cyst (benign) removed from her breast, the ending of her marriage to Isley in divorce, and struggles with depression.</p>
