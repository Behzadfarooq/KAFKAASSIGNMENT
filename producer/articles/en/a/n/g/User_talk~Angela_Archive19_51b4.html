<p>What script are you using to revert vandalism. WP has had a couple fairly big attacks in the last couple of days with a user replacing pages with an image. Do you have a script that I could use that would revert all pages with the said image / edit summary quickly, we had aprox a 400 edit vandalbot in the span of 5 min and a bout would be very very useful.

<dd>I'm not using any script. AngBot is just a really old thing that one worked on the Chinese Wikipedia. It was using the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pywikipedia" class="extiw" title="m:Pywikipedia">pywikipedia</a> framework, but it probably doesn't work with this version of MediaWiki. I've lost all details of how it ever worked, but you could try contacting <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> who designed it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 05:59, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a question about the rules around entries in the&#160;?References? and/or&#160;?External Links? section of an article. In the case of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natasha_Demkina_9971.html" title="Natasha Demkina">Natasha Demkina</a> article, there are many references to the same csicop.org website that goes against Natasha, but no links that support her. There are several websites that provide a critique of the CSICOP/CSMMH investigation on the csicop.org site which I would like to have included as references to provide counterpoint to the CSICOP claims.</p>

<dd>Thanks Angela. I was hoping there might be a hard and fast rule that outlined what a "personal website or blog" was, versus a site hosted by a "reputable and verifiable" entity, such as a university. Sounds like I'll just have to go through the Wiki process to find out.</dd>

<dd>In case you're interested, I added the link and a detailed explanation of why it is a valid entry..

<dd>As an aside, the particular poster who disagrees with me has a personal stake in keeping the critics of the investigation out of sight, so much so that he not only insults and attacks those that disagree with him (including two editors who tried to bring NPOV to the article), but accuses almost everyone (including Wikipedia) of Libel, and has made threats to publish negative articles against Wikipedia. Evidently he sent private messages to one of the editors that contained insults and threats. A very volatile individual. That's actually how I found your name; some advice to one of the editors who was receiving the threatening private emails was to contact you or Jimbo. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithTyler_3881.html#Natasha_Demkina" title="User talk:KeithTyler">User_talk:KeithTyler#Natasha_Demkina</a> Thanks for the advice! <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> 20:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Concurrent changes and some censorship on the pages for Rotary International in all langages</span></h2>
<p>Good morning, I used to write to the French moderator, I now I write you.</p>
<p>I am NOT really a Rotary Club fan. I introduced since one month some criticism to Rotary International structure and actions. What I notice, which is very strange, is that some similar and parallel reactions on the different languages of the Wikipedia related to Rotary International (negative) changes I added, happened about at the same time. I had the strong attack in EN on the Rotary by a Turkish wikipedian who was announcing on his personal page (some mistake I suppose) that he was a Rotarian. I had wrappings in French, in Spanish, in Swedish, etc. (NL, FR, EN, SV, DA).</p>
<p>For example, I introduced Augusto Pinochet as a Rotarian (honorary) and it was about at the same time either withdrawed, either flooded in a full list of Rotarians(now happening in FR as it happened in EN). Some logos were withdrawed or moved, and more of all, before my arrival for that criticism I introduced, I noted that the text was always the same, presenting Rotary international with same words in about all langages.</p>
<p>It is actually again the same on the Indonesian version, as it was in English in january. I was mailed about "Wikipedia fiddling". I do not translate that expression (French speaking, I am Belgian), but I supposed that it is some use of Wikipedia for propaganda.</p>
<p>I have a question to you&#160;: is the use of an RFC on that subject appropriate to ask to the community to expand the facts on the Rotary pages and avoid fiddling&#160;? I am not sure to understand the use of an RFC. Thank you for your answer. For example, I would ask if the use of the Rotary logo (which was in some langages withdrawed or moved from left to right) can be restored. In some langages, it disappeared. Same for Paul Harris pictures. For me the use of Paul Harris pictures, even with criticism, is compliant to the 'fair use'.</p>
<p>My name is Pierre Larcin, my id's on NL, EN and FR are PierreLarcin3 PierreLarcin2 and PierreLarcin1. my mail is pierre.larcin@ifrance.com. Have a good week-end. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 03:48, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>I'm Raj Nair, currently a sysop with <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> Wikipedia. In past few months Malayalam wikipedia community has witnessed growth in participation level in Wiki and more awareness among malayalam speaking people about wiki. We have been running campaigns to promote Wikipedia through blogs and public forums/groups, through out our programs there were requests for a Wikisource domain in Malayalam. I've made a request for new domain <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Language_domain_requests#ml.wikisource.org_.28Malayalam.29" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Language_domain_requests">here</a>. Recently votings were concluded and requests are now considered official. There was already a long waiting for Wikisource domain among malayalam speakers, before it kills community enthusiasm we would like to have wikisource domain for malayalam. I tried to contact wikimedia admins in IRC, so that I could request them to speed up the process. Unfortunately that didn't worked. I request you on behalf of Malayalam wikipedia community to take earliest action to allot wikisource domain for malayalam.

<dd>Because if the bot actually deletes something that means it's an administrator... last I checked sysop bit set accounts can go right on deleting while they are blocked.

<p>I know that you have already been bothered several times with this question and that the general answer to the question is that the other Wikipedias should design and introduce themselves the rules. I understand that this is motivated by the differences in cultures and by the fact that different stages of social development of Wikipedia projects require different arrangements. However, there are certain rules that are not questioned at all (GFDL licence for the Wikipedia text content for instance). My question concerns something that in my opinion is a general set of rules applicable to all the pedia projects, but has not been stated explicitely on the Polish Wikipedia. Namely, there are three content introduction rules on the English Wikipedia: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Do the general principles behind the three rules hold on other Wikipedia projects? <a href="../../../a/l/x/User%7EAlx-pl_31dc.html" title="User:Alx-pl"><font color="#055505">alx-pl</font></a> <a href="../../../a/l/x/User_talk%7EAlx-pl_8835.html" title="User talk:Alx-pl"><font color="#128812">D</font></a> 16:12, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I think these principles do hold true on all the projects, or should do. However, they are open to interpretation, especially the verifiability one. For example, it's only fairly recently that the English Wikipedia has started enforcing this through the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Cite sources</a> policy. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> one comes from the fact that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a> and original research wouldn't fit in with that.

<p>Hello Angie. Something truly weird has happened to the Sesotho (st) Wikipedia. Have you any idea whom (or what) is using IP 88.106.224.231? Entire articles, User pages, and even the Main Page were seemingly blanked on the 10 of March. Weren't these users watching their user pages, or was the st Wikiped even more dead than I had initially thought?<br />
Although I would love it if you would, I won't explicitly ask you to respond on my talk page because I'm afraid user EssJay might again construe this as "repeated personal attacks" and block my IP for another 24 hours. However, if I don't see a message from you on my talk page within the next few hours I'll unilaterally revert the changes on the Wikiped. <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyXoas_1e32.html" title="User:ZyXoas">User:ZyXoas</a> 20:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>I had recently done a great deal of contributing and editing to the topic of breast implants here on wikipedia. This is an area I'm familiar with as a Physician and FDA investigator for silicone-gel implants. Someone named "JGLAW" is high-jacking the content which was pretty reflective of both the US &amp; world literature on the topic (which I know and have to inform patients on almost daily) into a fringe political area which has largely been dismissed by the medical community. There are some concerns which should be highlighted, but it's turned into a personal cause for her (apparently she had gel implants prior and is now a crusader against them) ensure that a distorted and sensational overview is preserved.</p>
<p>I noticed you had reverted one of her edits today which is why I've approached you like this. She's staked out a position that seems will not compromise for what is the mainstream view. Do you have advice?</p>

<p>Thanks with the Sesotho wikiped. To tell you the truth, I now realise that I've actually forgotten how to make reverts (I doubt it's because I'm not logged in). I don't know where I got that IP from - maybe it was a wiki bug (I've seen worse), or perhaps it's simply proof that I need to stop going to sleep at 2 in the morning!

<dd>I have nothing to do with the vandal channel. As I already suggested, if you want your own channel, it is very simply to make a new one.

<dd>You do not understand. According to Lilo I need to talk to you as wikipedia foundation owns the channel (again according to Lilo). Fennc gave away my channel to essjay. I started that channel for my bot.</dd>
<dd>The code does not allow me to do that easily. In order to do as you suggest Id need to register 15+ channels and move the access list as well as instruct tens of people to join the new channel.</dd>
<dd>I could spend a week rewriting the bots for exeptios for en but that would make the bot lag and use a decent amount extra cpu.</dd>

<dd>Can't you do a simple search and replace for the channel names? You don't need to register channels to use them. A lot of other people are using the bots in the current channel, so it isn't fair just to expect them to move. I don't know what the issue is with you using the channel, but I suggest you try to sort this out with the people using it, or just go to a different channel. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:39, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whats not fair is the ownership of my channel handed over to Essjay as after all I spent weeks organising the channel and creating the bot running there. People in the channel are using pgkbot which is heavly based on my bot.</dd>
<dd>My bot operates on these channels:
<ul>

</dd>
<dd>I am not suggesting people move, on the contrary I prefer people stay. pgkbot was always active on #wikipedia-en-vandlism2 before I and my bot was banned off of the channel. It only acted as a backup bot.</dd>
<dd>Essjay is the law on #wikipedia-en-vandalism and he isnt cooperating nor does he need to as he was given the ownership of my channel during the swithch from #en.wikipedia.vandalism to #wikipedia-en-vandalism</dd>
<dd>I came here because I cant sort this out with essjay as he absurdly banned me from the channel and removed my access</dd>

<p>Hello, I'm an active member and an admin on a maturing Wikipedia. I came to ask for advice with a problem that started to occur in this phase of our growth. I'm not very active on en:, so I don't know how you solve it here. I need rather a personal advice than a wiki-scope advice with this.</p>
<p>We don't get much vandalism so far and it's been easy to cope with so far. Recently, another kind of vandalism started to take place - it's a registered editor including POV and non-encyclopedic info. Most of us, active members including me are not interested in the topic (history) and don't interfere with the content added. The others are not bold enough just to delete it. We have repeatedly pointed out "What Wikipedia is not" guidelines, but he seems to ignore them stating Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia (and he can add whatever he wants). This person has not been rude, but he's been repeatedly ignorant of the guidelines. This may an oversimplification of our situation. Should we just block him? Or lose our time again discussing where he won't take consensus or guidelines into consideration? He's likely to return as a sockpuppet or anonymous editor (he's thought to have done that before). There seem to more instances of a case similiar to this one. Thanks for any advice. ~~<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelix84_a51c.html" title="User:Helix84">helix84</a> 23:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there someone who could mediate with him? I'd suggest trying to teach him what he should be doing before just blocking him, but if he's set on adding POV then it might not help. Perhaps people on that wiki need to be forceful about removing bad edits, even in topics they're not interested in. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>

<dd>We do not have a formal process for <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">mediation</a> but there's a lot of discussion. I need to say it's mostly distracting others from work than solving anything, because after repeated explanation, these users fail to comply with basic principles like NPOV and encyclopedic content and want to discuss them instead. Thus, wikipedians either lose time discussing or ignore the problem when it's not in their scope of interest. It's easy to say that we "need to be forceful...", but hard to practice, as wiki is a voluntary activity. The problem is there are too little people to complain and the majority won't understand the topic deeply enough to judge it. One solution I see is to insist strongly on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> but even then, interpretations and POV compilations are possible (and occur in this specific case). Moreover, verifiability will be difficult to enforce when majority of our countent is good but un supported by a trustworthy source. And someone discussing guidelines permanently seems like a doubtful reason to block. But then, we don't have much experience with blocking. ~~<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelix84_a51c.html" title="User:Helix84">helix84</a> 14:42, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I intended to draw a distinction between GFDL (which guarantees the content can never be made unfree, in the sense that anyone can copy it) from the potential that wikipedia.org might eventually become a "pay" site. As far as I know, the board has no intention of ever turning wikipedia.org into a pay site but I don't know if there is anything in the by-laws that would prevent it. I was hoping you could clarify that it is at least the board's current intent to keep wikipedia.org permanently free (even though I'm not sure there can be any real guarantee about this). -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 05:18, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I may not be submitting this request correctly; indeed, you may not be the right person to contact, but I'm a little frustrated and lost within the wikiworld.</p>
<p>When I began contributing to wikipedia my username was [something else], essentially a contraction of my real name. I eventually decided that this was undesireable for several reasons, and I requested to have my user name changed to "jayintheusa". This was done recently, but despite my requests, the old user page still exists and I don't know how to kill it off. Worse, that unloved page is the top hit on Google for [this name], followed closely by my request to change user names.</p>
<p>And now, I suppose this page will Googled too; building more and more [old name] content on Google, which is precisely what i'm trying to get rid off!</p>

<p>Hi Angela, I'm finally convinced that Francs2000 had the right idea. I'm sick of the carping, sniping and lack of appreciation for trying to maintain some kind of dependable standard at RfA.

<dd>I really hope you'll reconsider. I know you and I haven't always agreed but I value your judgement and I think Wikipedians, on the whole, do as well.

<p>Hi Angela, there has been a suggestion raised in the user group of SHARP - the Society for the History of Authorship, Readership,and Publishing, about the possibility of having a Wiki for scholars to post complete articles and books for criticisn, so by-passing the usual print route. Nothing we do now permits this, of course, but I am wondering if this this has been raised before. Maybe its something the Foundation could do.

<p>Respected Madam,</p>
<p>This is with reference to the current <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikipedia-logo.png_6a5c.html" title="Image:Wikipedia-logo.png">Wikipedia Logo</a>. The leftmost jigsaw piece along the equator of the globe in the image has text written in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>. However the way it appears in the logo, it seems that it was created on a software that did not have Indic Language Support.

<dd>I completely support this. That character has been a joke for too long. It's going to be very hard to make it change everywhere, but we may as well update the official copy as soon as possible. One of the quiz questions I wrote for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimania.html" title="Wikimania">Wikimania</a> was related to that backwards character. I was surprised how few people knew about it.

<p><b>Hi Angela</b></p>
<p>OR if you could make me admin on Pashto Wikipedia, then as you have explained, it is quite easy.</p>
<p>well find a proper solution to this.</p>
<p>One thing else i wanna tell you is that The text that says (Wikipedia, the Free encyclopedia) is not translated right in Pashto wikipedia.</p>
<p>The right translation would be پښتو ويکيپېډيا، يو وړيا پوهنغونډ، if the word free means not have to pay money for the use of its contents. But if the word free means independent here then the right translation would be پښتو ويکيپېډيا، يو خپلواک پوهنغونډ.</p>
<p>well i had to mention this cause the existing moto under the logo is not translated in correct Pashto.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Angela. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a> page, to which <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiasari.html" title="Wikiasari">Wikiasari</a> currently redirects, says "Wikiasari was a project run by Wales which attempted to create a copyleft search engine. The Wikiasari project used to be called Wikia." This strongly insinuates that Wikiasari is dead. However, the <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Search" class="extiw" title="wikia:Search">Search Wikia</a> still exists. As a matter of fact, I have recently been updating some redirects there to fix broken links to a Wikia: namespace which is now the Search: namespace. Sadly, the Wikiasari software seems to have disappeared from SourceForge. I like the idea of a search engine whose database can be freely created/updated. Please tell me this project hasn't been abandoned? Is the Wikiasari source code available somewhere? Thanks. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charm.html" title="Charm">Charm</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Charm_7a11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Charm">©</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharm_dc16.html" title="User talk:Charm">†</a> 08:02, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The search engine doesn't exist at all and it was never on sourceforge (there was a blank page there in case it was ever finished and got that far, but it didn't). That <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:search" class="extiw" title="wikia:search">Wikia:search</a> link is just a wiki about search engines with old junk about "wikiasari" (a made up name that was never really used) that should be deleted now. Neither the project nor the software exist, and I don't believe they ever will since this it wasn't a sensible approach to creating a search engine/directory/whatever. Try <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_bookmarking.html" title="Social bookmarking">social bookmarking</a> instead since that's closer to what Wikiasari should have been than any actual search engine. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 08:34, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for the response. Perhaps all traces of it are lost; however, at some point in time actual software did exist. Jimmy Wales wrote it himself, originally (July 2001) calling it 3apes, added a lot of URLs to it, started a Yahoo! Groups list for it, then migrated it into the original "Wikia" effective March 2, 2004. <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Search" class="extiw" title="wikia:Search">Wikia:Search</a> indicates that (as of December 27, 2004) there were 300,367 sites in the database. The software, or a front end to it anyway, was written in PHP based on the links on the Wikia that apparently used to interface with the database. There are also pages at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Search:Search:Working" class="extiw" title="wikia:Search:Search:Working">Wikia:Search:Search:Working</a> and <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Search:User:Angela/Pre-launch_thoughts" class="extiw" title="wikia:Search:User:Angela/Pre-launch_thoughts">Wikia:Search:User:Angela/Pre-launch thoughts</a> indicating that work on the software (a Beta version) was under way.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm not completely ready to give up on this project yet. I wish I knew what ever happened to the beta software and the database, if there is any other information you could possibly share. Also, I would appreciate if you would consider sharing the <a href="http://lists.wikia.com/mailman/admin/search-l" class="external text" title="http://lists.wikia.com/mailman/admin/search-l" rel="nofollow">admin password</a> to the mailing list with me. If so, please let me know so we can work out a secure channel. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">Sannse</a> has made me a sysop on the Wikia.</p>

<dd>3apes was a different site with different software. I don't really know anythingg about that. It was sut down when "wikiasari" came along, though might not have actually been taken offline completely. You'd need to ask Jimmy if anything exists from that since it predates my involvement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only reason there were 300,367 sites in wikiasari is becasue all links from Wikipedia were imported to it. There were very few other URLs.</dd>

<dd>You could also try contacting <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonr_1347.html" title="User:Jasonr">Jasonr</a> about what happened to the beta software and the database, but I doubt it's a useful starting point to anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why would you need the admin password to the mailing list? It isn't in use for anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that the broken wiki at search.wikia.com is going to be removed to become an actual <i>about</i> search rather than containing historical info about this broken software. I asked Jason to archive it months ago but that hasn't been done yet.</dd>

<p>Thank you again for responding, although I must say I find your responses rather discouraging; especially your calling it "old junk" and stating that the Wikia "is going to be removed" as a matter of pre-determined fact, which has not been announced anywhere on the Search Wikia to give others who may be watching it (although obviously not contributing) an opportunity to say "Wait, I don't want this to be removed."</p>
<p>My intention was to clean up the existing Wikia, then try to generate discussion about its future. My inquiries about the software and database are to ensure they are available <i>in case</i> the consensus decision is to put it to some sort of use. I don't presume to know ahead-of-time what any consensus would be -- I'm just trying to "keep the options open", and arrange for the software and database to be preserved while they still exist, if it's not already too late, until a community decision is reached regarding what to do with them.</p>
<p>I'm not aware what Wikia's policies are regarding removal of an individual Wikia (such as minimum number of active users, minimum edits/month, notice-of-pending-removal requirements, and so on); I would have to go to Wikia's Help and look around, which I am not going to do tonight because I require sleep. I guess my next step will be to try to make copies of whatever I can very soon, before it's archived by Jason and no longer available. Then I will try to clean it up the best I can so it's at least internally coherent, then see if I can generate some interest. I'll do as much as I can until either I get tired of it, or Wikia takes it away, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>I guess as one final task before I go to bed, I will create some sort of announcement on the Search Wikia of a possible pending removal.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time, I hope you aren't 100% angry at me for "wasting" some of it -- maybe at least only 95% angry? &#160;;)</p>
<p>By the way, the interest in the admin password for the mailing list was the same as my interest in cleaning up the Wikia -- setting things up to possibly start being <i>used</i> again. If you prefer not to share it with me, that is okay; I will just either use the mailing list with it's current settings, or go on using whatever other resources there are without it.</p>
<p>Thanks again. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charm.html" title="Charm">Charm</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Charm_7a11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Charm">©</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharm_dc16.html" title="User talk:Charm">†</a> 09:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That wiki isn't what was wikiasari. That was just a wiki about the project, which doesn't exist anymore. The actual URLs were in a completely different software, that wasn't related to the wiki, and was never finished. I don't know what it is you're trying to hang on to on the wiki, but it seems largely irrelvant to anything useful. If you want the content of the database (not the wiki), get a dump of the links in Wikipedia, since that's largely all it ever was. The search wiki is about <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search.html" title="Search">search</a>, not about some old dead project. No one was ever involved in it, so there's no community to tell about the fact a wiki relating to that prject is being archived. You seem to be confusing that wiki with wikiasari. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 09:45, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But the <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Search" class="extiw" title="wikia:Search">Search Wikia</a> <i>is</i> about the old dead project. Maybe you don't want it to be, and maybe it won't be for long, but as of right now that is exactly what that Wikia is about.

<p>Someone wrote to OTRS asking for permission to use our logos, apparently for a CD-ROM version of Wikipedia. Do we have any sort of policy on that? I'm assuming that the answer is "no," though perhaps, like project Gutenberg, we would find it worthwhile to let people use our identity when distributing unaltered copies of our stuff. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 16:26, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela. I am Sebastian, -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rain_Man_6a91.html" title="User:The Rain Man">The Rain Man</a>, from Germany. Doing hard work for the German Wikipedia, I see my Ideals and moral attitudes being crashed. Here are things going on, that hurt elementary principles of working together on a growing project. At the moment, I am facing several administrators doing anything to destroy an article I have written as fast as they can, including to break several rules applying for deletion. The thing here is, that we have an organized system of administrators who tend that strongly to deletionism, that It is hard to say if one can still call it just deletionism. Among these German Sysops, I have seen only deletionists so far. They seem to take control over the pages in a way that is incredible. They created a logo called "Adminpedia" that tells "We eliminate the knowledge of mankind - yours to. Relevance is relative". They rule. No Inclusionist can become administrators here. Hardly anybody dares to speak against their actions. In the case of the page I have worked out, it goes so far, that already a non-privilleged user I know, wrote me via email that he likes the page and my work, but he would rather speak against it at the talk about deletion. Because he is afraid to get some kind of difficulties. And yesterday, a new Wikipedia-Member called <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Brandy123" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Brandy123" rel="nofollow">Brandy123</a> spoke for the article in the talk. Today she posted, that she was logged for some time. As the opponent part has a lack of reasonable arguments, they claim missing neutrally. But before I begann to work out the article, I knew critics could come out especially with that issue, because of my personal background. So I wrote the article in an absolute neutral version. And I am able to do that, despite they have to say something diffrent to reach their goal. Of course I told that in the talk, but they Ignore nearby all pro-arguments anyway. It is a farce. As the talk started on saturday, I begann to bring up my arguments, and of course, to answer their critics. Some mixed statements and some pro-statments from new members were done. The discussion really got going. I made several offers for a cooperation; for example to join a review lead by some experts on that special subject. I am just for no Information being deleted, because all Information contained is neccessarry to see through that matter. And I am for nothing to be falsified or overweighted. The article contains pictures they don't accept. Though I see them justified to illustrate the meanings, I always agreed to accept alternative ones, if presented by someone. But of course no one did or said he would do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, that talk lasting for two days now has become very long. Today I clarified that the step to initialize the deletion process was a clear violation of the rules in that form, and that it must be invalid. I showed up the two violations. They just continued to vote down the article repeating the same empty phrases, revealing again that they have't even read the article or not more than the introduction. Some, of course administrators, already say it has to be deleted - now. Ignoring the rule, that every page has to be on that talk for at least seven days. Nobody here can do anything against that game. We need a hero for us, to be on our side. And if you just wrote a short english comment in the deletion talk, just as a user, if you think the topic is interesting enough to be worth an own page. That would help. If you are interestet about the topic of the page to be deleted and in what was going on here, here is a link to Jimbo Wales' User talk. There I presented the case on saturday evening: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Hello_from_Germany" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Hello_from_Germany" rel="nofollow">Topic 115 - Hello from Germany</a> There you find links to several pages to see what's going on.</p>
<p>I guess, these German administrators are clever in positioning themselves as brilliant community-workers and presenting they were doing things very correct. And they hold together. That's what makes them so important here. They do a lot of work. But in my view, they do the wrong thing. If you have any questions to me on that matter, of course I'll answer you as soon as I get the message. And I hope you will not get a too bad impression of Germany. Actually it is a beautiful country. Thank you for reading this, and kindest regards from Munich!

<p>Thanks for answering. The situation here has changed, because a professor has offered his help. It is still not clear, if the article will stay, but it seems likely. Probably, it will be shortened to a third. The thing here is, our administrators only listen to certain people. Beyond, they don't respect anything, even not the rules. They respect that professor, and, of course, they would respect you. So you could remember them, that administrators should encourage and advise other members instead of trampling on them. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rain_Man_6a91.html" title="User:The Rain Man">The Rain Man</a> 16:59, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela, As you know it's impossible to control the content of local wikis due to language barrier but I beleive if some blatant malicious moves are found we should react. I would like to inform you about the missuse of one wikipedia - Albanian. Even though my knowledge of Albanian is minimal I have noticed many factual errors on this wikipedia. The article about the city of "Uroševac/Ferizaj" (named Urosevac on English wikipedia) on that Wikipedia is named "Ferizaj" only without mentioning name Urosevac in article. I have edited their article and put Serbian name of town into brackets so it was "<b>Ferizaj</b> (Urosevac)....". And now the problem - I was banned immediately and my edit was reverted. I beleive there is no place for someone's ill natured political complexes on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Let's see Brussels article in French and Dutch wikipedias:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruxelles (Brussel en néerlandais, Brüssel en allemand, Brussels en anglais) .......</li>
<li>Brussel (Frans: Bruxelles – Duits: Brüssel – Engels: Brussels) .....</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can`t articles on dual named cities on Kosovo have the same level of neutrality and tolerance?</p>
<p>I expect you to react on this case as noone else can control admins who ban users that are trying to make NPOV edits behind the local languages</p>

<p>It seems it was a 24h ban so I will try to add that content once more to see if it will repeat.

<dd>OK I have edited like I said and it was reverted in matter of minutes but then I tried to talk with the user who reverted me. He says Albanian wikipedia is Albanian only and that Serbian name doesn`t have a meaning in Albanian language and that I should read historical books on Albanian tolerance but that's not the issue here. There is another user who stated in English that article should have both names like I proposed but after that they continued to discuss this matter in Albanian. Well at least I was not banned this time.<a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_c557.html" title="User:Avala">Avala</a> 10:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I noticed that you deal with renaming the user pages and I would ask you if you can help me (or advise me). Namely, I'm the user that was formerly known as <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">Bitola</a>, but, I decided to change my user name and created a new account <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatriX_fee2.html" title="User:MatriX">MatriX</a>. I didn't know until now that I can make a request for username change, so I'm asking if you can help me (if it is possible at all) to add the contributions that I've done under <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">user:Bitola</a> to the new account. Also, I would like my previous account to be deleted. Please do that if you can or advise me what should I do. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatriX_fee2.html" title="User:MatriX">MatriX</a> 15:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't rename you to something that already exists and I can't merge edits between two accounts.

<dd>Then I guess we have no other option than deleting the new account <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatriX_fee2.html" title="User:MatriX">MatriX</a> (anyway I have very little contributions under that account and I also have a copy of all relevant data) and renaming the old one <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">Bitola</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatriX_fee2.html" title="User:MatriX">MatriX</a>. I hope you will be able to do that. (The last resort would be to rename <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">Bitola</a> to a completely new user name, for example Matriks and delete <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatriX_fee2.html" title="User:MatriX">MatriX</a>, but, if it is possible, I would prefer the first option).

<p>Hi Angela, since you're a bureaucrat, would you like to change my name into "Steinbach"? Just a matter of consistency: I have entirely too many user names on different Wikipedias.

<p>Hello. Sorry to bother you - I know you're always busy. When I try to register on the st WP on my phone I get a form saying that I need to type what I see in a certain picture; however, I can't see a picture. When I try to register on Wikitionary I get a similar form only this time it says that it can't show the image since my cookies are disabled. This is obviously false since I need cookies to log onto this WP.

<dd>I've made you an en.wiktionary account as well. You can apply for adminship at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/requests_for_permissions" class="extiw" title="meta:requests_for_permissions">meta:requests for permissions</a> (though not on en since they have their own procedures) and then translate the messages linked from <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllmessages_6f04.html" title="Special:Allmessages">Special:Allmessages</a> on the relevant wiki. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 00:54, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hello. Me again. I know that for adminship I need to go to Request for Permissions and go through a bunch of procedures, but I'd rather not (I'm sure that by now you know my predicament). I started a local RfA page at <a href="../../../../st/b/a/_/Wikipedia%7EBa_kopang_Bolaodi_7206.html" class="extiw" title="st:Wikipedia:Ba_kopang_Bolaodi">st:Wikipedia:Ba kopang Bolaodi</a> (I basically have to invent new terminology for an entire Wikipedia!) Is it absolutely impossible for you to unilaterally grant me adminship (bolaodi - the power to direct) immediately? Do I <i>have</i> to jump through hoops for a no-brainer? <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 13:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not jumping through hoops. Requests are made there for a reason - so we have a public record of who was made an admin and why, and so we have a list of all RfA pages. It's just a case of copying the template and editing one page. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 04:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Right. If I were to try and edit a large page like that no my phone... I would get permanently banned, since it would delete<i>everything</i> on the page (have a look @ my edit history - I mostly advise other users...)<br />
How's this:<br />
I request sysop access on the <i>Sesotho Wikipedia</i>:</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!!! Now, to the drawing board! I fear that if I translate everything to Sesotho it would make it even more moribund - but it <i>has</i> to be done, eventually. I realised yesterday that it would be easier to translate the <i>Simplified</i> English Wikipedia system messages since they are less idiomatic and that's the biggest problem in translation.

<p>I have been stalked by some "editors" and since I asked for the account ot be deleted (and was assured it had been) the account has been used to make edits which are nothing to do with me - in my user history the edits April 20th and 23rd are NOT by me. Yesterday someone, mysetrisouly asked for my user page to be unprotected - why would that be - except, of course, that they had previosuly been involved in vandalsim to my user page <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">user: Deskana</a> but let off by a group of his editing mates. I wish the account permanently deleted and removed please. How do I do it? I don;t want to use it but, more importantly, I don;t want anyone else to be able to use it and that's what has been happening. Robsteadman 19:25, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey! I was making a joke about the vandalising! You <i>did</i> check my edit history, right? I spent a couple of hours translating some system messages, thus the Wikipedia looks <i>a little different</i>... If you (for some arcane reason) still think I shouldn't be an admin then I won't fight you - I don't want to have to be @ your mercy. Have a cup of <a href="../../../t/e/a/WP%7ETEA_9830.html" title="WP:TEA">WP:TEA</a> and think about it; then go "ha ha, I almost thought you were serious, for a second!".

<p>Just a little character reference for Zyxoas; I've had good interactions with him, and I checked <a href="../../../../st/c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zyxoas_5802.html" class="extiw" title="st:Special:Contributions/Zyxoas">his contribs at st:</a> and they do all seem to be legit (I don't know Sesotho but it does really look like all he was doing was translating). I understand that joking about vandalizing a little-monitored Wiki is a bit like joking about bombs at airport security, but maybe his sentence of de-sysopping can be reduced to time served? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 07:26, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela! While going through my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=rights&amp;user=Nichalp&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=rights&amp;user=Nichalp&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">logs</a>, I came across this: <i>00:10, October 29, 2005 Nichalp set rights for "User:User:Sfoskett" (+sysop)</i> When I sysopped him with the above string, it didn't give me an error saying that the user did not exist.</p>
<p>What I'm concerned about is if another user creates a username such as "<i>User:Sfoskett</i>", will he get autosysopped? PS. Please de-sysop the account nevertheless.

<p>Hi, I'm still on my first contributtion to Wikipedia and I need some help with some copyright tag selection, please. The article under construction can be found at "Skaggs Family". There are three categories of image sources there and I think I've only decoded one tag so far; and it doesn't seem appropriate for what I'm trying to do. Taking this case first: I have a physical letter from the publisher of a report granting me permission to put 4 images on Wikipedia. It seems, however, that the {copyright} tag, which appears appropriate for this category, doesn't enable me to implement this permission(???)</p>
<p>The other sources fall into websites and newpapers. The websites are from Safeways, a Skaggs Health Center site that acknowledges the Skaggs couple who set up the Center, and a site that covers the history of grocery stores, called groceteria. I have contacted the latter one to gain permission to use 3 images from there.</p>
<p>The images from newspapers involve one set of two from the early 1900s and one from the LA Times in 1988. Please help me find the the appropriate tags for the websites and newspaper sources and also please help me understand why I can't use the copyrighted material when I hold a letter giving permission to use the 4 images in Wikipedia only. My user name is Don Nielson but I'm new to this world so hope that lets you reach me.

<p>Angela, This continues an inquiry that you recently kindly answered about my use of images in an account of the Skaggs family. The source of several of the pictures, which had allowed use on Wikipedia, has not allowed them for unrestricted use so I have deleted the links in the text and will removed them altogether if you can please tell me how that is done. Second I have two categories remaining. First, those taken from a single source on the web, groceteria.com. The owner of that site claims he has no authority to grant unrestricted use since he got them from a wide variety of unknown sources. Finally, the old (1915-19)newspaper images should be okay but what is the correct tag? Finally, it seems that, unless otherwise noted, newspaper images should be useable since I can't find any restrictions in the newspaper I have? The date is 1988. Are their any tags appropriate to newspapers? Sorry to be so dense. This is about over. Thanks, &lt;user talk: Don Nielson&gt;</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>

<p>I would like to add the image that appears there to our $100 laptop article, but I have not found it on the OLPC website. Does that mean it was only given to MacWorld.com? If not, can you help me with the license?

<p>There is currently a discussion in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Birth.E2.80.93death" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Birth–death</a> regarding a proposal to use en-dashes (–) in intervals, such as dates and page numbers (e.g.: 1933–1951). You have previously expressed a preference, in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dashes%29_f4c2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dashes)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dashes)</a>, for hyphens over dashes, but did not there explain your reasoning for that preference. One of the main objections to the use of en-dashes was that they were less easy to insert and cluttered the text, because at the time it required a &amp;ndash; HTML entity. This is no longer the case, as the Unicode character – can be inserted from the bottom symbol "Insert:" box and that character does not clutter the text when editing an article. Another objection was that hyphens were much more common and therefore the standard that should be retained. If you would be so kind as to clarify your preference, to provide your considered opinion on this matter, and possibly contribute more to this discussion, it would be much appreciated. - <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> 22:34, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Specifically, this user claims that documents proving the <i>bona fides</i> of an entity calling itself the Office of International Treasury Control (OITC) "were sent to en-info@wikimedia.org which is the parent of Wikipedia."

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I don't know if you remember me from a couple years ago, but I wanted to stop by and say hi. When I first came to wikipedia 3 or 4 years ago, you were the most helpful wikipedian I encountered. I was in High School at the time and was probably one of the more annoying users you've had to deal with (I always bugged you over IRC, asked for adminship, and always switched names and did other similarly irritating things). I apologize for that. I think my effect on Tim was more severe.</p>
<p>However, I left the Wikipedia 2 years ago to pursue my own internet endeavors. During the last 2 years, a lot has happened in my life. As you know, I have Asperger's Syndrome. In June of 2004, I started <a href="http://wrongplanet.net" class="external text" title="http://wrongplanet.net" rel="nofollow">Wrong Planet</a>, my own website for Asperger's Syndrome, which quickly became the largest online community for individuals with Asperger's and Autism.</p>
<p>Since the start of the site, I've appeared on Good Morning America, Fox News, and was recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/17/AR2005121700899.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/17/AR2005121700899.html" rel="nofollow">featured by the Washington Post</a> in December. This site is constantly growing and has recently started to become a very large community. I feel very happy to be able to touch so many people's lives.</p>
<p>In the late summer of 2004, I also became an official Gentoo Linux Developer, and helped code for that project. This position gave me full CVS read/write access to the Gentoo portage tree. I quickly realized how foolish I had been to want administrator access so vehemently as the power and prestige of a wikipedia administrator pales in comparison to that of a Gentoo Developer. What's ironic is that I never set out to become a developer with the Gentoo foundation. I just started contributing and was selected by another developer to join the team. In addition, once I became a developer I realized that I didn't care about "power" anymore. I just cared about having fun working on a collaborative project.</p>
<p>I'm now a Computer Science major at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Mason_University_3218.html" title="George Mason University">George Mason University</a>. This summer, I was hired by <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a> to work as a QA programmer for Core services at AOL HQ.</p>
<p>Anyway, the success of Wrong Planet has led me to start a wide variety of other web ventures, which includes <a href="http://tvWiki.tv" class="external text" title="http://tvWiki.tv" rel="nofollow">tvWiki.tv</a>, a site that gets 1500 unique visitors a day despite the fact that it was created only 2 months ago. I noticed that you've also become an internet entrepreneur and I think that's really awesome!</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd like to hear back from you to see how you're doing. I noticed you have moved to Australia with Tim. I'd like to congratulate you both on getting together. I also would like to make sure that everything is OK with Tim and me and you and me.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I noticed that your Italian user page, though globally comprehensible, has several errors which prevent a full understanding of some sentences. Thus, to make you forgive me for the stupid question I asked a few days ago&#160;;), I offer myself to improve the translation. I can't figure out what some parts, which I have reported here in bold and with a final question mark, were intended to say, though. If you tell me what the intended meaning was, in English, I'll translate it back into Italian. For the rest, I think the page can be reworded as follow (of course some links will not work here, but they will do on the Italian Wikipedia):</p>

I hope this won't bother you. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGennaro_Prota_b0f2.html" title="User:Gennaro Prota"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">Gennaro Prota</span></a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGennaro_Prota_0c38.html" title="User talk:Gennaro Prota"><sup style="color: #006400;">(talk)</sup></a> 00:49, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela. Since you commented on the <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">Deny recognition proposal</a>, this is to notify you that a formal poll has been opened concerning it. If it is accepted, it will be be used as a launching pad to amend other policies such as the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>; that page itself will be marked as historical, not policy. Feel free to reread the proposal and place your vote. // [<small><a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">admin</a></small>] <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathoschild_s_ab89.html" title="User:Pathoschild/s">Pathoschild</a> (<sup><i><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPathoschild_s_8ed0.html" title="User talk:Pathoschild/s">talk</a></i></sup>/<sub><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pathoschild" class="extiw" title="m:User:Pathoschild">map</a></sub>) 07:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>I think Ko project Wikibooks needs its own prefix in Korean. The prefix in Korean is <b>위키책</b>: '위키' is a transcription of 'Wiki', and 'books' is translated into Korean '책'. Would you please arrange for changing?</p>
<p>I've been recently confronted with a upload problem. A lot of screenshots are uploaded on the Ko Wikibooks (see <a href="http://ko.wikibooks.org/wiki/%ED%8A%B9%EC%88%98%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5:Newimages" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikibooks.org/wiki/%ED%8A%B9%EC%88%98%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5:Newimages" rel="nofollow">here</a>). It's not clear that they belong to the category free-game-screenshot. I've managed the user should add the tag Ko 'Template:Game-screenshot'. -- <a href="http://ko.wikibooks.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90:%EC%95%84%ED%9D%94" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikibooks.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90:%EC%95%84%ED%9D%94" rel="nofollow">아흔(A-heun)</a> 09:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I can't change this. You need to find a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/developer" class="extiw" title="m:developer">developer</a> to do it. Ading a request in <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/" class="extiw" title="mediazilla:">MediaZilla:</a> is the best way to do that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
