I've got down to the <i>Canada</i> heading, but will stop for tonight. Best way to get me to remember to carry on is just to edit my talk page again, that will alert me). No need to explain why; just go <i>BOING!</i> or something, just seeing my <i>messagess</i> thing will remind me. It's a very interesting article. I may bring it to the attention of my friend who's into TV history. I had no idea that there was a man who links Armchair Theatre, Dr Who and The Avengers, so it's all good stuff. --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 00:38, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello Paul. I do fervently apologise - it's late in the evening and I'm touchy at the moment for reasons which are nothing to do with you. I've always admired your Doctor Who work and have been comparing and contrasting 'calls' you've made on Newman - such as whether to emphasise the role of Kenneth Adam rather than Hugh Greene in bringing Newman over to the BBC, for example. I'd like to investigate how <i>The War Game</i> ended up in <i>The Wednesday Play</i> at some stage, as I'm sure it started out as a documentary commission. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Kilburn_521e.html" title="User:Matthew Kilburn">Matthew Kilburn</a> 01:36, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added my source for the denial comment on his talk page, so you can check it out. It's not an original source so it's not ideal. It seems to me it was either reported from a source posted on their messageboards (couldn't be bothered to look) or direct from his agency. When i first posted that denial, i did think it necessitated a reference, since the polly thing wans't widely reported anyway. So, what now? Is that fansite a good enough source even though it's so vague? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 18:39, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angmering,</p>
<p>I noticed you list your expertise as being British television. I was wondering if you could weigh in on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Singing_Detective_0d02.html" title="The Singing Detective">The Singing Detective</a></i>: what needs expansion, what's missing, etc...any pointers, any additions you'd like to make. I've mentioned some specifics on the talk page already. Thanks, by the by, for fixing the "miniseries" vs. "serials" thing. Downright decent of you. Cheers! <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYossarian_a081.html" title="User:Yossarian"><span style="color:black"><b>Yossarian</b></span></a> <a href="../../../s/o/v/Image%7ESoviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG_ed0a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/3/3f/Soviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG/30px-Soviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG" alt="" width="30" height="15" longdesc="../../../s/o/v/Image%7ESoviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG_ed0a.html" /></a> 08:51, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Singing Detective</i> is definitely one of my all-time favourites (if not <i>the</i> favourite), too. I had watched it for the first time about a year ago, and when I went to Wikipedia to find out more, I was shocked to find there was no article. Not being one to question opportunity, I created it myself, and have been sort of fostering it along since.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I recently watched it with the commentary tracks, and got a fair bit of information (I have some notes somewhere), but the stuff that pertained to the series as a whole really only got discussed for the first few episodes (though I didn't get a chance to see 5 and 6 with commentary, so that may be wrong). Anyway, I just need to find a day to sit down and give the article it my full attention. I have no doubt we could get it up to featured status without too much work. It definitely deserves it! My only hard source has, so far, been the DVD, and I don't think any of my local libraries have anything specifically about Potter or the show, so I shall have to do a fair bit of digging on the web. By the way, do you know of any other Wikipedians who might want to pitch in?

<p>Hello Angmering,</p>
<p>You've probably noticed my (probably foolhardy) attempt to resolve the edit war on the Andy Murray page regarding fansites. The protagonists do not look about to resolve it among themselves, so I'd appreciate it if you and other regular editors could express your views on this part of the page, so that we can stop the war going forward, or at least block a protagonist who persists in it. Please come to the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Andrew_Murray_%28tennis_player%29#Call_for_a_consensus_on_the_fansites_list" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Andrew_Murray_%28tennis_player%29#Call_for_a_consensus_on_the_fansites_list" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>The questions I've put are:</p>
<p>Please can I have the opinions of those who regularly edit this site:</p>
<p>1.Should there be a list of fansites?</p>
<p>2.Should it be ordered</p>

<dd>Thanks for your kind reply. I think the articles you've got to FA are quite decent really, a lot of insightful info, but the only gripe I have is with inline citations, which is now an FA requirement.

<dd>Well for a young wikipedian it's a brilliant article, even a veteran! I think it would reach good article status easy. Given some work, it could easily reach the new FA standards, and I hope it does as I'm a Cushing fan. After the 2 week review period (nobody has even commented yet, which is quite unfortunate) has expired, I intend putting the Quatermass articles up also. I hope you don't find this offensive or anything, I think all the old FA's by anyone should be put up for review really. I could put them all up at once, but I don' think it would be fair towards the collective people who have helped them towards what I would deem a good article state. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 00:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All the old articles are commendable you've worked towards FA and you should be proud of them indeed. To use book refs as inline citations, try www.print.google.com - you type in what you want then you can preview several pages from several books. Time is the prime opponent, all articles could be spruced up given free time on one's hands. I certainly wish I had the time to do so. Try some of the more recent FA's for examples on how to freshen them really, like <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween</a> for example. Old FA's should have automatic reviews in reality, especially if wiki wants to retain an overall standard across the board. If 1984 loses FA, try a peer review, edit a little, then nominate it as a good article. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 23:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't peter crouch's goal/appearance for England count be 13(10) instead of 12(8) following the game official game with Greece since he scored two goals? <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXioyux_1386.html" title="User:Xioyux">Xioyux</a> 15:59, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angmering. You are right that BBC America edits out content for commercials. It is one of the banes of my existence. But, in the case of this show we get the opportunity to see it uncut by ordering it thru our 'On Demand' feature and I have been taping the episodes to share with friends from this. My viewings of the episode show that Gene and Sam have a bet of ten pounds and a huge can of Watney's Red Barrel (sorry I know that there is a specific term for this but I can't remember it at the moment) that Gene's intuition about who the killer is is wrong. Sam seems to lose the bet on three occasions but is proven right in the end. At the end of the episode they are both holding a hammer and chisel, because it take two to open this huge can, and the camera freeze frames on the bringing the hammers down as they cut to the credits. First I am not doubting your edit, but, I think one of two things has happened; either I missed something, and I am always happy to go back and learn the errors of my ways, or the person who put the edit in originally got the Watney's Red Barrel mixed up with Red Rum. A third, remote, possibility is that there are totally different scenes filmed for the UK broadcasts versus the overseas, but I think that this is very remote. Do you have the episode on tape or DVD? Can you or someone you know rewatch it and then leave me a message about where in the episode (like the running time where it happens or the scenes just before or after) the horse race in question is mentioned so that I can go back and find out what I missed or, if my viewing was correct go ahead and re-edit the section in question. I have seen you name in many sections of wikipedia and respect your editing so I hope that we can work out this conundrum together. I won't have a chance to rewatch the episode until this weekend so if you get to it first I'll just say thanks for any help that you can give.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 18:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, thank you so much. It all comes flooding back to me. That speech was in both the edited and unedited version. I do have to say that it is such a small reference that I feel that it is not quite notable (in the next ep the mention of Roger Whitaker is a larger plot point in its way!), but that is just my opinion and I hope that you won't take offense at my mentioning it, and apologize if you do. I had been waiting for Dr Who to get a mention in <i>LoM</i> and it finally happened in episode five that aired last night. It is amazing to think that, with the action taking place in '73, that Tom Baker's Doctor has not hit the small screen yet! I have been following UK TV since the showings of <i>The Avengers</i> and <i>The Prisoner</i> on US TV in the 60's. But it was <i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</i> that cemented my admiration and I have seen as much as I can ever since. I am luckiest to have made it to the age of DVD's because I am getting to not just rewatch, but own, shows and series that I would never have thought that I was going to get to see again just a decade ago. I think that the DVD format has made some of shows look better than they did on their original transmission. Thanks again and I will look forward to seeing your contributions to wikip in the future.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 21:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope that I didn't sound like I wanted to take it out because I am fine with leaving it in. It has been great fun seeing events (just think today it is unlikely that any horse would race as many years as Red Rum did when there is more money to be made in stud fees), music, clothes etc. of my teenage years treated like they happened in the stone age and I am warning the 20 and 30 year olds that I am turning on to this show that this will happen to them one day. Well it will if there are writers and directors and actors etc. as creative as those on this show around.

<dd>Hi again. You may have noticed that Phennphawcks moved the edit about the Grand National and Red Rum to episode four today. This helped clear up a confusion in our previous messages in that all of my original comments were about episode three and the scene that you quoted was actually in episode four. Well, Friday's are when we get a chance to see and record the unedited episodes of this series and today was episode five (the one about the football and its growing hooliganism). Thus, I had the opportunity to go back over the episodes in question. Episode three unfolds as I discussed above with no mention of horse racing. But I did get a chance to relearn that the huge can of Watney's was called a party seven. I went through episode four slowly and with a finetooth comb (er... ear anyway) and there is only one mention of Red Rum. At the 31 minute mark, while Gene is giving Sam a bollocking about how he fell into a honey trap, he says that if Sam doesn't play the game that "You'll be out of here in the time it takes to say Red Bloody Rum". At no point is there a mention of a sweepstake nor is there any attempt to swap tickets. The scene outside the meat locker contains the following exchange: Sam "How's that little animal in your stomach" Gene "You know I do believe that he's sleeping". This refers to the previous scene where Gene describes his feelings about taking backhanders from Warren. Now episode five does contain a sweepstakes bet but it is on the Man United versus Man City match and Gene says that he has Man City by two nil.</dd>

<dd>Now we still have three episodes to go here and the events in question may show up in one of them. But, with the research that I have done today I am going to move our comments to the discussion page for the show so that other wikipedians can chime in and try to help us solve this question. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 19:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One last note Angmering. In case you haven't already seen it user And I has straightened out the situation regarding the scenes in question. It is a total drag that I am not getting to see all of this well done series, but I hope that they will show up on DVD one day. Thanks again for the time that you put in reading all of this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 00:52, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I didn't mean to so rudely revert your removal of the link to the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_on_Mars_a50d.html" title="Life on Mars">Life on Mars</a> trailer on YouTube. I just installed the Wikipedia popups tool and it got away from me... Anyway, as it is promotional material, I don't think the Life on Mars trailer on YouTube is a copyright violation, nor do I think there is a problem linking to it. If you know where the trailer resides on the BBC site, we can link to it directly there, otherwise I think the YouTube version is useful and should stay. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 03:29, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
