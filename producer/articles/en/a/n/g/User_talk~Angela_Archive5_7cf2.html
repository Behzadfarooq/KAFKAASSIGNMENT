<p>The basis of the truce was that I agreed to refrain from adding more, as long as you (or whoever) stopped deleting. I stopped (at the end of January) until the deletions started again. The VfD process means nothing to me since it is necessarily biased towards the deletionists. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 07:15, 2003 Nov 17 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reference to January was for the entries relating to dates in the month of January. I'm not making any work for anybody; if you didn't enjoy deleting articles you wouldn't be doing it. There is no ambiguity involved when nobody else has adopted the format that I am using. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 07:27, 2003 Nov 17 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Respect is a two way street. Imposing the tyranny of the majority that comes out of VfD is <b>totally</b> disrespectful. Everybody accepts that there are things that need to be deleted, but that is not the way do go about it without irritating people. My primary position in the matter of deletions is that the benefit of the doubt should favour keeping, and that anything to be deleted must fall within strictly defined categories. To me there is more to this argument than just the narrow issue of the dates. Alternative ways of doing things should be perfectly acceptable, and my inclination is to seek solutions that accomodate alternatives, whether I am on the majority side or not. Had my approach to the dates entailed a genuine and immediate ambiguity I would have been most willing to seek accomodation. My immediate interest in the matter of dates is to restore the ones which were already written. (All of January plus scattered dates in the rest of the year) I have no present intention to add any significant number of new dates.</p>
<p>Please be advised that there are other areas where our mutual co-operation might be more easily forthcoming, notably regarding transfers to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 08:02, 2003 Nov 17 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message about moving pages. I can only plead that it was late at night and I forgot the "move this page" feature existed.</p>
<p>You also asked why I'm making these moves. They are all disambiguation pages. My thinking was that it would aid the reader's understanding (and my own) if an article like <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> were even more explicitly titled as <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="English (disambiguation)">English (disambiguation)</a>. The footnote is nice but a title is hard to miss. I was also thinking that it would help creators of links to more easily discover that they were linking to a disambiguation page when they probably want to link directly to one of the sub-pages. However, I've since found out that the query that populates the "Disambiguation pages with links" page won't find those links so it will make the maintenance harder, not easier. Looks like I'll be reverting those pages. I guess we live and learn.

<p>I'm glad that our edit war has calmed. I too must apologize if any of my comments seemed personally offensive.</p>
<p>My thoughts about transfers to Wiktionary do link to my ideas about deletion. I want to approach that problem constructively. As I said before, before something is deleted it should fall into a clearly defined category. The two most evident categories are nonsense written without any glimmer of good faith such as infantile comments, alphabet soup and insults, and obvious typos in an article title. There are other classes possible, but they require more thought.</p>
<p>One general class of articles to be considered is articles that belong in another member project of the Wikimedia family. These will likely have valuable information, but the contributor has just put it in the wrong place. That group has a number of number of possible sub-classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>dictionary type entries; (they belong in Wiktionary)</li>
<li>foreign language entries: )they belong in the Wiktionary for the relevant language)</li>
<li>entire quoted books; (they belong in Wikibooks)</li>
<li>memorials; (they belong in what is now the 9/11 Memorial, which could be expanded to cover forgetable victims of other disasters)</li>
</ol>
<p>One observation that I have about the current listing of things to be transferred to Wiktionary is that it is somewhat useless where it is. A person that devotes his entire Wiki time to work on Wiktionary may not see it and may not even know that it's there. To solve this I would propose a Transwiki: namespace on all projects. I first thought of using the word "Transfer" for this, but decided that a coined word would avoid any possible ambiguities. Currently <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thou.html" title="Thou">Thou</a> is the first entry on <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThings_to_be_moved_to_Wiktionary_db91.html" title="Wikipedia:Things to be moved to Wiktionary">Wikipedia:Things to be moved to Wiktionary</a>. To deal with this I would create an article in Wiktionary called [[Transwiki:Thou]] to which everything that is now in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thou.html" title="Thou">Thou</a> could be copied as is. A Wiktionarian who is looking for something to do could then work at co-ordinating that article with what really should be on Wiktionary according to Wiktionary rules. Once that is done the Transwiki article could be deleted.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this? <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 20:09, 2003 Nov 17 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that the Transwiki idea <b>has</b> to go to the mailing list, but it should. The main reason for that is publicity. I see it as a concept with broad application, not just for moving material from Wikipedia to Wiktionary but between any two projects. For this to work well the same namespace name should be used in all projects. It's always good to get other opinions anyway. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 21:47, 2003 Nov 17 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, you said "The Vandal link on your user page is dead." - it in't actually dead, it's just that it is a sysop-only link, which is probably a bit out of order really. It links to a deleted page, which only sysops can see. The entire content of the page was "Se also: Frognerparken, the famous park in this district. User:Angela is vandalising the page, so I cannot link myself." I shall try to find a different link; I've been accused of being a vandal more than once!&#160;:) Angela 06:43, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for implementing the "Angela plan" on the "AKFD". My interpretation on the other titles with the expanded AKFD in them, now all redirects, is that there were two people who had a serious desire to retain them (Martin and Olivier), and the rest wanted them gone. I'd do it myself, but ...I nominated them. It would be good to have them all behind us, but I leave it to your judgment. == <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 14:46, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

   * AIDS Kills Fags Dead (slogan) (redirect page)
   * AIDS Kills Fags Dead (redirect page)
   * AIDS kills fags dead (redirect page)
   * AIDS Kills Fags Dead slogan (redirect page)

<p>Angela, did you think that I was vandalising the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> page? Do you really believe that England is ranked 1st, by area?

That England is the 76th largest nation by area.</p>
<p>While I was fixing the other tad of an anomaly, that England is not ranked 1st by population, but 21st (same hallowed source, so must be true) you had done a revert on the first edit. 82.133.114.121</p>

<p>Hi Angela. I was wondering if we could rename that image to something like "Sagittaria.jpg" so it would not be confusing to anyone again. I agree it's a nice picture.

<dd>interresting point about containing the copyvio text in the history. While it makes sense for an article such as this one, there is a problem when someone posts some copyrighted content to an already existing page. I think that in the future wikipedia'll have to decide whether it wants the ability to delete specific edits from the article history (of course only for this purpose), or whether the copyvio in the history is acceptable. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 20:06, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

You will note that in my previous comments I did not mention any names at all except Cunc, but was aware of the blocking and unblocking even before your effort in that list. Your admission of guilt is interesting. The fiction that you were blocking solely to maintain the peace is not tenable.

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>I have a great deal of information that I could put into the Wikipedia about coins (and other topics as well, I suppose) but I'm wondering just how much detail Wikipedia wants.

I did not understand that you had kept an all caps version.

<p>two things.

So please don't misinterpret me as suspecting you as the archtype of whatever opposition there might be to what I've been saying. While I may have been engaging (the subject is of some small import to me) I am perfectly happy with what you have said and done regarding the subject. I wish the link wern't deleted, but hey, only one guy voted against it. I'm only hoping that I can complain enough after the fact to have a positive impact on the powers that be (I'm not 100% on how such things work, being new here). Second, (and fairly unrelated) why is the search not working tonight? That kinda sucks. Is there as area you can direct me to the pertains to wiki resouce problems, improvements, needs etc?

<p>What is the proper way for Wikipedia to credit the original source of an article? There is an article that began as a verbatim copy of another Internet source (a public domain text based on a book out of copyright), and even though there is no legal infringement, out of fairness it should be credited.</p>
<p>My first cut at giving credit is at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philipp_Melanchthon_bc4d.html#References" title="Philipp Melanchthon">Philipp_Melanchthon#References</a>.</p>
<p>OK, the 2nd problem (detailed explanation lost in a merge) is that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> is almost verbatim ripped off from a copyright source <a href="http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-english-bible-history/martin-luther.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-english-bible-history/martin-luther.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It's more obvious in the original but still evident today.</p>
<p>You mention the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_243b.html" title="1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> as an out-of-copyright possible source for both articles. Is there an easy way for me to check this in the future? I did a Google search (my typical plagiarism detector) and didn't find that source. Also, the version I found at 1911 <a href="http://68.1911encyclopedia.org/L/LU/LUTHER_MARTIN.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://68.1911encyclopedia.org/L/LU/LUTHER_MARTIN.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> didn't match at all.

<p>Hi Angela, I'm afraid I accidentially reverted <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a> before I realised it had been protected. I think however it would have been better to have protected it to the version before <a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloquence.html" title="Eloquence">Eloquence</a> deleted the <i>disputed</i> tag and re-inserted stuff that had been removed with agreement by everyone else weeks ago. It is rather unfair to everyone else that Eloquence's highjacked version, with text deleted weeks ago which he reinserted, and with images that there was over 90% agreement to delete but which he inserted, and minus the agreed <i>disputed</i> tag, should be the one left on the page. An earlier one should have been the one reverted to. Best wishes. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:47, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, Angela, sincere apologies on the protected reversion. But I <i>do</i> think it is wrong that weeks of work by various people, a vote on what to keep in and take out, a rewrite by <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">User:Adam Carr</a> and a 99.9% agreed <i>disputed</i> tag are all effectively binned as yet again Eloquence's <i>highly</i> POV version is now left as the official wikipedia version, unable to be corrected by anyone. I had no interest in fighting with Erik but when I found him trying to intimidate a non-sysop so much that the non-sysop contacted me to say that he didn't want to stay on the page for fear of what Erik as a sysop might do to him (Erik having already driven away another utterly honourable and genuine user from the MT page) and finding that Erik was, <i>again</i>, bulldozing his way through many people's hard work to force his POV stuff back on the page again, I had had enough. As to the three reversion rule, having abused his powers Erik showed no interest in following <i>that</i> power too, which to be honest I didn't know about. But I am not criticising you and am glad that you protected the page. I just think a better solution would have been to go back to the point before the edit war, to the version that reflected what the community wanted, not just one sysop forcing his views and frightening those who disagree with him away. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 23:59, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening, Angela. I am trying to clean up the Brunswick/Braunschweig pages. The content of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunswick%2C_Germany_9ad6.html" title="Brunswick, Germany">Brunswick, Germany</a> properly should be moved to either <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a> or (my preference) <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig%2C_Germany_07f6.html" title="Braunschweig, Germany">Braunschweig, Germany</a>. Unfortunately, both those pages are redirects to Brunswick and the redirects themselves have been edited. I'm running up against the inability to move pages because of an irrelevant edit history at the destination. I was hoping you could advise me how to get around this problem. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 03:10, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your prompt response. I reviewed the discussion at VfD and on the several talk pages, but I came to a strong conclusion that "Brunswick" has fallen out of use when referring to the city (or region) in Germany. Delirium argues that Brunswick is the more common name but offers no evidence. Sandman used the results of a google search to make the same point, but his search pulled many irrelevant hits. The correct count for an exact-phrase google search is only 3,640 for "Brunswick Germany", many of which are in genealogical records dating back to the 11th century and many more of which are putting the phrase in brackets or parentheses as a secondary usage. An exact-phrase google search on "Braunschweig Germany" finds 208,000 hits. (I deliberately used Germany rather than Deutschland to filter the hits to english-language sites. Further evidence: While the Rand McNally World Atlas includes "Brunswick, Germany" in its index, the entry is <i>see Braunschweig</i>. I also rely on my personal experience. In 3 years living in Germany, I never heard it referred to as Brunswick, even by the other expatriates. In the 13 years since, I've never heard it referred to as Brunswick. Even the Wall Street Journal uses "Braunschweig". Several others (Wik, Robert MerkelI don't know what else it will take to make the case.<br />
Or are you just suggesting that I should allow them some time to rebut my findings before making the change? If so, is the discussion on <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrunswick_9486.html" title="Talk:Brunswick">Talk:Brunswick</a> sufficient or, now that it's a VfD topic, does the discussion have to be duplicated at VfD? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 03:50, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought a listing on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_for_deletion_c5f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists for deletion">Wikipedia:Lists for deletion</a> was what you had in mind with your suggestion to start a new vote on the issue, made over at Talk:Lists of postal and zip codes of the world/Delete, so that's what I did. <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_disputes_over_articles_150c.html" title="Wikipedia:Current disputes over articles">Wikipedia:Current disputes over articles</a> seems like a fair enough alternative starting point, though this seems more about deletion policy and lists than about disputes over an individual article.

<p>Dear Angela, i protected my page because we had a porn freak yesterday and i lost the patience for reverting. Very amusing. Its unprotected now but if the same thing happens (God, i hope not!) i'll follow your advice. Thanks for the pointer about the Village Pump question, i confess i had forgotten all about it. By the way, i have to tell you that i enjoyed immensely your user page and the deletion quotes. Since i'm not involved in this things its always good to catch up. Your user page is, i believe, the right place to do it&#160;:) Cheers, <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel Victoria</a> 10:54, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I never noticed you had left a message (or is it computer generated). Anyway your user page is nice - your talk page is better. I am learning to use Wikipedia (sadly I learn from using rather then reading.) I have started to love this place. I wish the world worked the wiki way (share.)</p>
<p>Since Christmas breaks are around corner I will be doing my workout on wikipedia. I already have a list of books I will borrow from the Library. But exams first.</p>
<p>Yes, I have a few questions and it is very frustrating to go about without answers.</p>
<p>First, there always is content I just can not go about without thinking of deleting. Arrrgh... people are so dim witted (like me). What do I do? - I have a sort of idea about this. I post my disapproval at talk:article and wait for someone to respond OR I find out who did the last stupid edit, and tell that person (politely) I am considering removing your part.</p>
<p>This is an Edit: I just read your user page. I think you are as confused about deletion as me.</p>
<p>Second, how do I tell myself it is OK not working for wikipedia full time. I feel bad about not being able to do much (in part cause I do not know much).</p>
<p>Third, I submit an article to Wikipedia. Next minute I go to a website xyz and submit the article to them. xyz says, the content you submit will be property of xyz (I do not care.) So what happens to the content? Is it copyleft cause I submitted it to Wikipedia first or is it Copyright?!!!</p>
<p>Fourth, Someone removed a change I made. Now I do not know what to do. If I make that change again what guarantees the change will not be undone. In my view it was important. Now what?</p>
<p>This too is an Edit: I just read your user page. I think you are as confused about deletion as me.</p>
<p>Finally English is not my mother tongue so I invariably make mistakes. I leave it to others to find mistakes and make corrections. Is there some way I can collaborate with someone who would review an article only for the grammar and spellings just after I post it. -I have a stupid Idea. Just after writing an article in the comments line I write 'Kindly check for Grammar'. Someone might be tempted to make amends. Problem is, I will always have this image of 'I make errors'.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me know there is someone I can ask. I will read the articles you suggested. My idea of following wikipedia convention is trying to follow the layout of some other good related article. I will read the conventions page pretty soon.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I know you decided to avoid the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a> article. However there remains a dispute, at this stage one user versus every one else who has commented. I am seeking <i>independent</i> opinions on whether</p>

<p>I respect your independence totally. I have in the last few days asked Daniel, Ed Poor and others to comment. Your views as a totally dispassionate obversver would be most welcomed.

<p>It is hardly fair to assume that I would attack anyone who provides constructive criticism of the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a> article. The problem is that no constructive criticism has come forth ever since Adam stopped contributing to the article because of rabid MT apologists. I've tried being nice, I've tried peace offers and compromises. If you have any suggestions on how to work with people who offer no logical arguments but only insulting rhetoric and who call for blanket removal of valuable information, then please make them. Otherwise people should be grateful that I'm willing to deal with this kind of crap in order to preserve NPOV. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 02:29, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may have missed a VfD on it, but even if so, should not the article be undeleted, and at worst replaced by a redirect that would still carry the history? (It has disappeared from the user contribs of User:203.5.110.252 and (i think) of myself.)</p>

<p>Several days ago you joined the discussion of whether <i>Brunswick</i> or <i>Braunschweig</i> should be the home of the article on the German city.

Quite a bit of fact-finding has occurred since then, but the decision appears to have reached an impasse.

<p>Thanks for helping out with my double-user problem. That was fast help! I was reading up on requesting deletes, and tried to make my way back to the page... The redirect is a nice solution. I also requested that the "bad" Joek be deleted. If for some reason deleting a user is messy or not worth the effort, I think the redirect should keep others from getting confused. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeK_ad83.html" title="User:JoeK">User:JoeK</a></p>
<p>Angela, please go ahead and delete User:Joek. You make a good point about having aliases to avoid confusion. It makes me wonder whether it's a good idea to even have case-sensitive names, given the opportunities for spoofing, mischief, and collisions (e.g. I really had no idea whether there was already a 'joek' user when I created my own id). Anyhow, as long as I'm a newbie user I don't see any point in cluttering up the user name space.

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Do you have an idea as to how hard or easy it is to use the Wikipedia open source software to create a related project? Can you refer me to others who have done as much so I can consult with them?</p>
<p>Which of Wikipedia's devolopers might be inclined to help us along on this project?</p>
<p>It looks like Wikipedia general body is going to reject my proposed Free Energy Project at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>After reviewing the various reasons given, I can see why it would probably be best to form a separate location to host this project.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to far more specific content (more comprehensive than Wikipedia seems to allow)</li>
<li>We need to be able to post some speculation (identifying it as such) for the sake of spurring productive brainstorming and inventing</li>
<li>We can't afford to have people not familiar with the field sabotaging our hard work by indiscriminate deleting and harrassing such as I've experienced at Wikipedia.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would also like to have an editorial review process built in prior to changes going live, though people could have access to the proposed changes if they are curious. It would remove some of the anarchy that is found at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The thought that some nincompoop could indiscriminately wipe out something I've written with great effort of time and concentration is a bit much for me. I don't have the time to watch over my work like a hawk to ensure it is not warped and twisted beyond recognition. I'm sure others will feel the same way.</p>
<p>I see a hybrid of the open editing at Wikipedia, along with the editorial review of open-site.org as being the best combination.</p>
<p>Your assistance in directing me to the proper resources and people would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>hi</p>
<p>No I did not see the question. I looked at the log, but you all talked so much that it already was wiped from the memory (usually, the night holds in the log&#160;:-)). The logo was made by Guillaume. Yeah, it is quite colorful to say the least&#160;:-). I wonder how long it will last&#160;:-). As for your question, well, I think that if he did it, it was precisely for it to be kept, protected from deletion, as sort of a proof. I think it was for fairness. I think he perhaps also did it with the feeling that the page would be protected in his subpage, because I don't think it is usual that a user sub page is deleted with the user asking or at least agreement. I believe the page should be blanked definitly, but not deleted unless he agrees with. When I go away, I will expect my subpages not to be deleted, because what I put in them is important to me. It is especially as he is, afaik, not a sysop, so can't retrieve deleted pages. If it is deleted, and he comes back and put it in votes for undeletion, it will perhaps also again make undesirable noise. Just my opinion. Anthère</p>
<p>Hi again Angel</p>
<p>I tried to explain again why it is troubling me that we delete user sub pages. I understand very well that you may consider bad, that people move questionnable pages to their user page, but why did not you say it then, rather than now that Louis won't speak up&#160;? Either it is acceptable or it is not. But I do not think it should be yes for some people and no for others. It should be globally decided, not judge on a case by case basis. Why do you say it is not "really" part of his space&#160;? Technically it is. It is also hidden and no one can see it. It can even be blanked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it becomes common practice to delete other people subpages, in particular when they can't speak for them, then there is no more user space, and we could quietly occupy other people space. Do you want that&#160;?</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is fine by me, but it is policy on user page you are changing here.</p>
<p>I put you in my press release dear Angel&#160;! Did you read it&#160;? Do you like it&#160;?&#160;:-) Anthère</p>
<hr />
<p>very pretty Christmas flowers Angel&#160;:-) Anthère</p>

<p>I fail to understand your preoccupation with the article that is currently a subpage of my user page. You and several others have on an ongoing basis disregarded process and insisted upon removing this content, first from the encyclopedia, and now from user: space where we are supposed to be able to keep material relevant to the project. And while I will concede that the subject is only marginally encyclopedic (though it is more encyclopedic than many other articles that we have chosen to keep in the main namespace), it is certainly relevant to the *project*.</p>
<p>There are plenty of more controversial and less relevant topics that are present on user subpages. In the entire history of the project, I know of none that have been deleted other than those removed at the behest of their creator.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that there has been no substantive discussion of Mav's outing of the user in question, the veracity of his statements, and the fairness of his making them. That there has instead been nothing but discussions of procedural matters regarding deletion and undeletion of my article is deeply troubling to me. These events, and the actions of you and those who throng to your side, have reduced my sense of pride in the project more than you can know.</p>
<p>I would like an explaination from you as to why you think Mav's actions were appropriate, and what exactly it is about my article that makes you want to censor it.</p>

<dd>If I have issues with the page, then surely I will have those same issues wherever it is placed&#160;? whether in the main namespace or in your user space. It makes no difference. I still think it is wrong for it to be here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't doubt it is more relevant, more encyclopedic, or less controversial than a lot of pages here but that is not the point. The point is that I <i>do</i> think it was unfair for mav to have outed Craig and it was more wrong for you to try to insert this information into Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want a discussion of the outing, why didn't you try to bring that up in a normal way rather than adding to the problem by creating this page? Are you actually against the outing? I see this page as being in absolute support of it. You seem to think that my desired deletion is in some way against you, rather than against the outing, which you assume everyone supports. This is not the case. If mav's comments could be removed, I would request that, but they can't&#160;? they are on the mailing list. This article, however, <i>could</i> be removed, and I can't understand why you are averse to that if, as you claim, you believe the outing was wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think mav's actions were wrong, and I think this article is supporting those actions, which is why I would rather it were deleted.

Angela, it's <i>over.</i> Once someone is outed, they're outed. It's done. You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Mav outed him and that's that. He can't take it back or undo the damage. The mailing list posts get indexed on Google just like everything else, c.f. <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008050.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008050.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008050.html</a>. It's in google. It's in google's cache. There is nothing anyone can do to out him more than he already is outed, and so my actions did him no further harm.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but this page, in my mind, makes it worse. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>That said, if either Hubley or EofT had asked me to remove the material, I would have obliged. He/they haven't, and I think it would take a rather large stretch of the imagination to believe that he hasn't seen it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's quite likely he hasn?t seen it. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Where was your condemnation of Mav when this broke in the first place? There was never any censure by anyone. You didn't say a thing! Nothing! You just obliquely supported deletion of the article (once it was created) without stating a single genuine reason, just bromides about process and procedure.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere. There was no point. It was too late. I couldn't do anything about that, whereas I can attempt to do something about this. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why did I create the article rather than some carefully worded mailing list post? First of all, the mailing list is not the community. It is supposed to be, mainly, a forum for involving Jimbo in discussions. This is not a matter for Jimbo, IMO, it is a matter for the community. I believe the mailing list is vastly overused (witness the recent posts to it about trivialities like whether to include "Halloween" on the 2002 year article) and try to move discussions away from it whenever possible. Participation in the mailing list is not representative of the community as a whole. Discussions there become circular and are poorly indexed once complete.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You could have made a discussion without adding to the outing and bringing to that outing to a new audience (ie- those who do not read the mailing lists). A</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think Mav's actions are wrong, and it absolutely boggles my mind that there has been zero discussion about the wrongness of those actions nor the policy we should have to guide us in the future. How could you have missed the point of the article? I specifically referred to Mav's outing in it and had a link to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_outing.html" title="Fair outing">fair outing</a>. It's hardly a subtle piece of prose. The rest was just biographical boilerplate. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouis_Kyu_Won_Ryu_cc3e.html" title="User:Louis Kyu Won Ryu">Louis Kyu Won Ryu</a> 00:14, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree it was wrong. I just don't think keeping this page on view expresses that. I feel it supports it because it adds to that outing. Why can the page not be deleted and replaced with a discussion on the rights or wrongs of outings of users?

Make a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_outing.html" title="Fair outing">fair outing</a> article. Remove the 142 reference from the Hubley article so it's just about him. If you disagree with what Mav did, tell him on his talk page. Start a policy discussion on the meta or the pump or the talk page. Anywhere. No one besides me has said anything thus far and I'm not here to talk to myself. I took the first step.

<p>I have a difficult time finding words in this discussion about "outting". I am against it and have much sympathy for your opinion. However, I see problems being an unbiased information source and ignoring facts. If George W. Bush is a cross-dresser and he is "outted" by a close confidant or distant photographer, it needs to be reported. No one has suggested hiding Roosevelt's disability, Kennedy's womanizing, or Hoover's inclinations despite the fact that all chose not to reveal them to the general public. The "outting" is wrong, but the "out" and the how is a fact to be reported. That said... I have a strong interest in privacy and can see what you are trying to support and strengthen. I will most times support you, I just don't on this. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">Texture</a> 00:44, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but this isn't about someone famous is it? It is about a Wikipedia user. What is wrong about wanting to protect others within the Wikipedia community? If someone "outed" me and created an article on who I was in real life, I would hope that in my absence people would vote to delete that. Perhaps people feel differently because the person concerned is supposedly banned, but I feel this makes it worse as he can not come here to defend himself as any edits he makes are reverted on sight by many people. Also, this does <i>not</i> need to reported, as you claim. If that were the case, wouldn't it be necessary to report the real name of every Wikipedia user? There is no benefit to doing this, only harm. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 00:53, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am split over this topic. I am strongly for individual privacy and anonymity. I would not want to be "outted" for simply privacy reasons. However, I am split because I support both privacy and free press. I want privacy but not at the cost of a controlled media that cannot report known facts. I even have issues with not reporting adult rape victims whose claims may be false and intending harm, although I support that one since the alternative is unacceptable. I see nothing wrong with wanting to protect others in the community and I commend you for it. This is not an issue of revealing the real name of each user. I don't agree that this specific user is not "famous". This person is a celebrity in their postings, contributions, and banning. The very definition is in significant public actions done, revealed, and consequences paid. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Had this person not created public interest and conflict of note, the page would not exist. Even the anonymity is in question. The article indicated that the person admitted to authorship of that user's postings. I would provide more but I cannot access the subpage at this time.</dd>

<dd>If I provide conflict or notable contribution and am both "outted" and banned then do the following: 1)take action against the one who "outted" me for the misdeed 2)build me a page and provide a neutral accounting of all facts to the same level as any celebrity listed in this encyclopedia. If you take both actions I will feel protected and justifiably served. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">Texture</a> 01:36, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the matter of Mav's outing of Hubley is adequately addressed, and the appropriate policy discussions occur, then once everything is all settled, and the ongoing discussion placed in some accessible location, then I'll request the deletion of the subpage myself.</p>
<p>My current thinking is that if the subpage is deleted against my wishes, I will rehost it off the wiki and place a link to it from my user page. I have a web server that is crawled pretty regularly by google where I can put it where it will remain regardless of what anyone here decides. That is my current thinking, and I'll freely admit that I have arrived at that point out of anger. I may change my mind. Unfortunately, your listing on VfD has polarized my thinking and I am at present just as upset about what I see as censorship of my ideas as I am about Mav's initial actions that started this whole thing.</p>

<dd>Hello, the decision you took over the sub page is a good one imho&#160;:-). I am not sure if that will make much of a difference, but small steps by small steps is good&#160;:-) Anthère</dd>

<p>Angela, could you please remove one of the EagleAndChild.jpg images I uploaded a little while ago. Uploaded two by mistake. Keep the last one loaded pls. TIA. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 00:06, Dec 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I note that your user page links to your subpage on wikistress. Should you be linking to the meta page instead? Do you mind other folks editing the subpage? I think I'd have a few things to say after dealing with Michael's (clears throat) contributions from 5 different IPs tonight. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 03:47, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's one of those judgement calls we all make in different ways. As long as you're not emotionally involved, it's not an issue of right or wrong IMHO. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 06:03, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, You added the following sentence to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_control.html" title="Social control">social control</a>: "These are usually enforced more regularly than informal social control and those that do not abide by these guidelines are usually punished directly". This does not strike me intuitively as a true statement and I wonder what authority you might find for it. It is a commonplace that formal rules are often ignored while informal rules are defined by their inforcement, i.e. an uninforced formal rule simply doesn't exist. I also question the redirects you made from formal and informal social control, both of which could easily support well written articles. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:29, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
