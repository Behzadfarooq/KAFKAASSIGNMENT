<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_Botello_63ee.html" title="Edit section: Life and work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life and work</span></h2>
<p>Angel Botello was born in the small town of <i>Cangas de Morrazo</i> in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galicia_%28Spain%29_67cb.html" title="Galicia (Spain)">Galicia</a>, in the northwestern region of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Botello was one of six children (four girls and two boys) of Angel Botello Suárez, a businessman in the fish canning industry and Bonis Barros del Amo. In the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> and, after the bankruptcy of the family business, Angel Botello moved to <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux%2C_France_71fe.html" title="Bordeaux, France">Bordeaux, France</a> with his family and lived there until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>. While in France, Botello's mother wanted that Angel became a farmer but he wanted to be and architect. In France, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> is considered a <i>beau art</i> rather than a science and students must take art courses. Botello and his younger brother Manuel studied during four years at the <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_des_Beaux-Arts_180b.html" title="École des Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a> where they graduated with honors and excelled in <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawing.html" title="Drawing">drawing</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_%28person%29.html" title="Model (person)">modeling</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, Botello returned to Spain where he applied and was accepted with a scholarship at the <i>School of Art of the San Fernando Academy</i> in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>. The few paintings that remain of the young Botello's work in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and Spain reflect and immediate break from his strictly academic training to the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionist.html" title="Impressionist">impressionist</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-impressionist.html" title="Post-impressionist">post-impressionist</a> concepts and techniques that shaped his development.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> started in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, which made him leave his studies and join the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republican</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> as a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartographer.html" title="Cartographer">cartographer</a>. He fought in the Spanish Civil War together with his brother Manuel, who died in the war field. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, the Spanish Civil War ended with a victory of General <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> and impossibilited to stay in Spain, Botello eventually returned to France to meet with his family who was in a <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee_camp.html" title="Refugee camp">refugee camp</a>. The Botello family decided to leave Europe and move to the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Republic_1b44.html" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> where he was warmly received. The community of Dominican artists included him as one of their own and many of the paintings created at this time were presented at the "<i>Latin American Art Exposition</i>" at the Riverside Museum in 1940.</p>
<p>During that year, the Botello family traveled to <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> where they stayed for eight months. Upon their return to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santo_Domingo_2539.html" title="Santo Domingo">Santo Domingo</a>, his paintings were noted by the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peruvian</a> ambassador there who invited Botello to show them in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port-au-Prince_3644.html" title="Port-au-Prince">Port-au-Prince</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiti.html" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> in 1944. After his arriving to Haiti, Botello met <i>Christiane Auguste</i> who became his wife and artistic manager. After his marriage with Christiane, Botello changed his artistic plans to move to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to met with the greatest Mexican artist <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Rivera_0b3c.html" title="Diego Rivera">Diego Rivera</a> and stayed in Haiti. Botello became increasingly recognized and critically acclaimed. His Haitian landscapes and figure studies are considered to be some of his best works. In Haiti, Botello developed his artistic career of woodworking and he's considered the father of the Haitian wood carvings and taught Haitian artists about it.</p>
<p>For ten years, the Botello family lived in Haiti until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> when they moved to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico_38f5.html" title="San Juan, Puerto Rico">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>, where they would reside permanently. By this time, he already had gained international recognition in the world of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_arts.html" title="Plastic arts">plastic arts</a>.</p>

<p>After the Botello family leaved Haiti and arrived to <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> in 1953, they opened their first <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery.html" title="Art gallery">art gallery</a> at the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribe_Hilton_Hotel_b05e.html" title="Caribe Hilton Hotel">Caribe Hilton Hotel</a>. Later, they established a second art gallery at <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_San_Juan_cdf5.html" title="Old San Juan">Old San Juan</a>. Botello stated that the light and bright colors of the tropics opened a new world for him and stimulated his creativity. From the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, his work became more personal as it was enriched by his new favorite theme: his three children. The deep love that he felt for his children and his family is reflected in his later paintings and sculptures.</p>
<p>In 1959, Botello traveled to <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravenna%2C_Italy_2c1a.html" title="Ravenna, Italy">Ravenna, Italy</a> to learn about the mosaic technique and produced some of them but quickly abandoned this technique, convinced that he mastered it.</p>
<p>In the 1960's, Botello became interested in printmaking after an art dealer reproduced some of his paintings using this techniques. Botello refused to sign these reproductions because he was not consulted and not worked personally on the final production of the prints. For that reason, Botello traveled to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_France_1fae.html" title="Paris, France">Paris, France</a> and learned about the printmaking techniques. He became a master in printmaking and graphic design. Some of his best printmaking works are his linocuts, lithograps and serigraphs.</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1980's, Botello started a double artistic career in painting and sculpture.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Angel Botello was diagnosed with <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> and knowing that his life was in danger, them accelerated his artistic production pace and never surrendered to his <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illness.html" title="Illness">illness</a>. In the last year of his life, at age 73, Botello produced the incredible amount of 22 bronze sculptures in great format.</p>
<p>The 33 years that Botello lived in Puerto Rico is considered the most prolific period in his artistic career, in terms of the quality of his paintings and sculptures and the quantity of artwork produced and art mediums used. This artistic period of Botello in Puerto Rico has a strong <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figurative.html" title="Figurative">figurative</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealism</a> influence and is the period that most recognition produced to the artist. This period is know in Puerto Rico as the <i><b>"Botellian Style"</b></i> and is recognized by his <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caricature.html" title="Caricature">caricature</a> figures, especially girls.</p>
<p>Angel Botello died in San Juan, Puerto Rico on November 11, 1986 leaving behind an impressive legacy of <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_paintings.html" title="Oil paintings">oil paintings</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithographs.html" title="Lithographs">lithographs</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linocut.html" title="Linocut">linocuts</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen-printing.html" title="Screen-printing">serigraphs</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_sculpture.html" title="Bronze sculpture">bronze sculptures</a>.
