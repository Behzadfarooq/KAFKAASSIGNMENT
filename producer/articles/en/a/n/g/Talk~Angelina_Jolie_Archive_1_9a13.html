<h2><span class="mw-headline">Funeral Director?</span></h2>
<p>Did she really dream of becomming a funeral director? I looked in the history, but it wasn't vandalism, it looked like a valid edit. Growing up with actors as parents, you'd think she'd want to be an actress. And then she attended a theater school when she was 11--not exactly the best training to become a funeral director. Whhat is the source of this factoid?</p>
<p>If it's valid, we should insert <i>why</i> she wanted to be a funeral director. Otherwise, it sounds bogus (like it does now). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 17:47, Sep 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I've heard her say that too. Can't remember where, some arbitrary interview. Like what skidoo said, it might have been something she just "said" during her goth phase, but she definately did claim that as a child she wanted to be a funeral director. <a href="../../../p/o/i/User%7EPoisonouslizzie_1ba3.html" title="User:Poisonouslizzie">Poisonouslizzie</a> 00:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm Jake. I'm not a registered user, but I thought I would try to help you guys out on this topic. She mentions it in a July 5, 2001 Rolling Stone cover story, even showing her test booklet to the interviewer. The cover of the magazine showed Jolie lying in green grass with her abdominal cross tattoo mostly visible. So, yeah, is it true that she wanted to be a funeral director. Here's the link to the story in Rolling Stone's online archive: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5938014" class="external free" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5938014" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5938014</a> Hope that helps.</p>

<dd>Good work. I've added the link.

<p>(Jake again) Thanks for letting me know that 23skidoo. I have to admit that I'm finding Wikipedia rather addicting and validating! There is something very powerful in being able to add to this incredible public resource and see what you've done instantly.</p>

<dd>Nice job Jake! You should register an account if you plan to start any new articles btw, as of last month only registered users can do that. But registering is quick and simple.

Actually the chariters were the same but there was a second chariter for chinese (traditional or simplified).

Just a minor observation: The article states her new tattoo ("N11° 33' etc.) represents "the locations where she adopted" her children. Since Jolie hasn't commented on it, this is total speculation; the tattoo could also represent their birth locations for example. It think it should be rephrased. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 01:36, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">quotes</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the quotes because 1. the quote given was not cited. 2. the better place for quotes would be <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">wikiquote</a>. 3. the link cited was likely the source of the quote and its copyright did not allow us to copy them. 4. wikipedia is not a collection of links. The best thing to do would be to find a public domain source of quotes, create a wikiquote article with them, and then come back and link the wikiquote article from here. If you could do that, I would love it because I, personally, love some of the things she says. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 20:09, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really. <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> is for <i>"the Progress of Science and useful Arts"</i>. And in order to claim fair use <i>"... one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new."</i> While we are able to claim that we are adding something new to the world by working on this project, we must tread lightly on this matter. Using a picture because she looks much sexier in it surely has no interest in furthering science. If there was no possible way to find a pic that was free, then we might have a claim to fair use. That aside, I try to consider the spirit of this project as furthering the end goal. For instance, while the Wikipedia is obviously not 100% factual, more good editors than bad means that we are approaching truth all the time. In the same way by replacing fair use pictures with PD pics and by replacing PD pics with freely licensed pics, we are approaching a freely licensed encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 23:01, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is for a nonprofit cause, though. Wikipedia is simply displaying the picture, not charging money for people to see it. It is equivalent to hanging the picture on one's wall.<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJarlaxleArtemis_f75f.html" title="User:JarlaxleArtemis">→ <font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">Jarlaxle</font><font color="gold">Artemis</font></font></a> 23:59, 22 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>fair use does not mean that non-profit orgs can use whatever they want it means that you can use it to further science and useful arts. not wanting to get off topic but, while you would prob get away with hanging a picture on your wall, that does not make it legal to do so and you are surely not protected by the fair use clause, esp when your "wall" is visable to the entire world over the internet. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 05:44, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Page has been restored to a photo that is not copy vio (cburnett put it back to this photo and i reverted that photo to one that was legal.) if you click on that link at the bottom of the edit page, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Project:Copyrights</a>, you will see that <i>It is our goal to be able to freely redistribute as much of Wikipedia's material as possible, so original images and sound files licensed under the GFDL or in the public domain are greatly preferred to copyrighted media files used under fair use.</i> Also, i don't belive that fair use applys here. for these reasons (and that the pic was never properly cited) I ask that we quit changeing this pic until we find one of equal or greater freeness. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 19:37, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dunno. It looks like she has a black eye to me. I think a better image can be found by making a fair use screen capture from one of her movies. I'm willing to go through the effort. Alternately, the cover of her book could be used.<a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:20, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current picture is a bit too overtly sexual in my opinion. The point of it is clearly to make her look sexy, which is fine in some contexts of course but we are trying to present a serious encyclopaedia article about a serious actress. Maybe we could have that picture further down the page (alongside the FHM material), but the top one really ought to be something more sober I feel. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 01:54, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I went ahead and made the switch. I think a headshot is a better choice for lead image anyway because you get a better look at the person, as opposed to a full- or partial-body shot as was the case with the magazine cover. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:24, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gay Icon Project</span></h2>
<p>In my effort to merge the now-deleted list from the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_icon.html" title="Gay icon">Gay icon</a> to the Gay icons category, I have added this page to the category. I engaged in this effort as a "human script", adding everyone from the list to the category, bypassing the fact-checking stage. That is what I am relying on you to do.

<p>Hey, whatever. I have seen maids in my country who are a million times prettier than this Angelina Jolie... thing.</p>

<dd>Hey - to each their own, but it's a matter of public record that she usually tops magazine polls in these categories, so her marketing team doesn't really have much say in those matters. Her good works with the UN will remain long after her looks begin to fade, and I think she knows this. Personally I expect her to retire from acting to go full-time into humanitarian work one of these days, although as she herself has said the money she makes from movies has made it possible for her to do her work, so one compliments the other. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I know everyone has their own taste, and I personally find Angelina Jolie to be the most beautiful woman I have ever seen; but I think it is worth mentioning that, as the article says, she has been voted in the most beautiful women list of many magazines, and has been named 'First Perfect Woman' by Vogue Magazine. And I think it's fairly safe to say that, as far as taste goes, it doesn't get much better than Vogue. Yanington</li>

<p>Well, as an actor, Angelina's looks are an important part in her career. Sadly the entertainment industry is very superficial and appearances play a significant part in the work an actor recieves; it's just part of the trade. So I personally feel that her beauty (or lack of it, according to some) is a tolerable subject. In my opinion, Angelina is the most gorgeous woman I've ever had the pleasure to lay eyes on; but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so obviously not everyone is going to agree with me. There's no need to start an argument about it. However, I would like to ask those of you who don't think Miss Jolie is beautiful: what actresses <i>do</i> you find attractive? I'm not trying to fuel a possible spat, I'm just curious. Thanks in advance. 04:48, 6 April 2006 (UTC) Lola</p>

<dd>Well, personally I do feel she's one of the loveliest women I've ever laid eyes on (though it's a tossup with Audrey Hepburn!). But the claim is very subjective and unless it were sourced by a very broadly-distributed survey I'd be against including it in the article. In any case, the article has pictures of her; the readers can see how beautiful she is on their own. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 16:27, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Personally, I think it’s rather ridiculous to reference “beauty” in the first sentence of the article.

<dd>Why? Don't we have to justify the inclusion of the article on grounds of notability? What could be better justification than the widespread belief that Angelina Jolie is very beautiful?

<p>Part of what a continually updated encyclopedia like Wikipedia does is we include current events.

But once it's in major newspapers it becomes notable. I certainly do not support the deletion of the tattoos section so I put that back (and what was with that edit summary "Can't you see I'm not proud of these tattoos"?

<dd>This is actually not true. You can only maintain dual citizenship with a few countries. I am a British citizen living in Canada and will be able to have dual British and Canadian citizenship.

<dd>The fact Angelina didn't request the Cambodian citizenship means that, in the eyes of the US, it would only be honorary, so that's why she's expected to remain an American citizen.

<dd>Actually, the recent addition of photos of Jolie in many of her major roles bother me. WP's fair use policy says that we can only use copyrighted images if we have a need to. We already had enough images of Jolie; where is the <i>need</i> to show what she looked like in Hackers, Girl Interrupted, and Tomb Raider? I say we should remove the images of her specific roles. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 20:34, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>She is an actress by trade, so therefore I think there is an obligation to have at least one image of her from a movie role. Fair use isn't really a case of "only if we need to" it's more a case of using images with purpose. IMO the images did serve a purpose but I agree that there were too many. I suggest keeping either the Girl Interrupted image (as this was her Oscar-award role) or the Tomb Raider image (as her best-known role). We don't need the one from Hackers. If necessary we can lose the image of the book cover, or one of the extraneous shots of her standing against a wall. I hope we can keep the one with Maddox because it's cute, though a shot of her with her other children and/or Pitt might be better.<a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I strongly object. Most featured articles about actors (<a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Fonda_b169.html" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, <a href="../../../u/m/a/Uma_Thurman_a4ed.html" title="Uma Thurman">Uma Thurman</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, etc.) include more than one screencap to illustrate his or her career. Some featured artiles about movies have even more than a dozen screencaps, therefore this WP policy shouldn't be taken this literally, especially since WP policy also states that pictures increase the quality of an article.
<dl>
<dd>I agree that there is definitely a contradiction between different Wikipedia policies (a matter for debate in another forum). For example <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> also states that articles shouldn't become photo galleries. So the question is how many images must be added before it becomes a photo gallery? I still stand by my agreement that there are too many images, although if push came to shove I'd rather see more images taken from her films than from publicity shots ... except that as established as images were removed as copyvio in recent months, it's easier to justify press and publicity shots as fair use. With Wikipedia tightening the rules on uses of images, it's becoming harder to find images that are allowed by the increasingly draconian rules. Note, for example, that despite Jolie being an international model we are not allowed (by Wikipedia policy, not guidelines) to upload magazine cover images. It's tempting sometimes to just go without images altogether.<a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Editing out these pictures does nothing but hurt the overall quality of this article. Of course movie images benefit an article about an actor - they elucidate past career steps and illustrate former roles; the main reason for an actor's celebrity - therefore there is a certain "need" to use them. As stated above it is common practise in many featured articles to use serveral movie screen shots to exemplify the topic at hand. Since these articles went through the featured article approval process, using these kind of images is obviously tolerated and lies within the general understanding of WP policy. The pictures should be put back. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 23:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Shouldn't someone tell her about this,I mean what she did was wrong right,one day he's supposed to be the son of one of the most famous women of all (besides Oprah,Rowling and Britney) the next day he doesn't know if he will be adopted at all. Current sources state that he's still at the orphanage awaiting adoption.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you really want to discuss this sort of thing here, feel free. Just remember that to do so in the article itself without citing reputable sources and using personal language violates Wikipedia's NPOV guidelines. And don't tell me she's any different than any of the other people who adopt -- you can't adopt everyone. What, for example, is your proof that "she wanted Zahara more". I know people who have adopted children from out of country -- hell, I've written newspaper articles on this very subject. And there are so many factors involved it's not even funny. Again, unless there is a reputable source (forget tabloids) to provide detail, for all we know there was a lack of compatibility with the Russian boy, or the orphanage made unreasonable demands or (and this happens all the time) the government just said "No." <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Snake</span></h2>
<p>I do not know if Jolie owned a pet rat snake or a pet rattlesnake. There's been a number of changes back and forth on the page today, however, changing between the two. I hope people know that it is entirely possible she owns a rat snake as this is a real type of snake. Also, imdb's page, although notoriously unreliable, states that she has a pet rat snake, NOT a rattlesnake. A google search seemed to indicate a lot of sites think she has a rat snake but they may all be using this very article as their source. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 17:56, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I can't find any reference beyond IMDb and Wiki-mirrors to Jolie ever owning a snake - rat or rattle. Closest I could find was an article on womensfirst.co.uk in which Jolie states she spent time with a bunch of snakes to become comfortable with them before shooting the scene.

<dd>Well, thank you for being so polite about it, Midas Touch, but since astrology websites like that are, as they so often say, for entertainment purposes only, I think it's clear that they cannot be considered serious resource tools. I have nothing against your interest, and wish you the best of luck with it, but wikipedia is intended as a serious encyclopedia. We do not publish things simply because they are popular. Also, astrology is not just "not a mainstream science" but is not any kind of science at all, since it lacks a methodology for experimental testing and falsification. Therefore, astrology is a belief system or philosophy. Maybe you could include your link on the page for <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a>, under its modern popular uses.

<p>I totally disagree with the idea that because Jolie's lips appear to be natural, there should be no statement about them on the page. I'm sure there are many people who, like myself, came to the Angelina Jolie page for the express purpose of finding out if her lips are real or not, and were sadly disappointed to find no mention of them whatsoever. This is an encyclopedia, so people use it to find answers to their curiosity about given subjects. I think it's Wikipedia's duty to answer this oft-asked question and present some evidence.

<dd>Well, if we can find a reputable third party source that has addressed the issue, we could quote <i>them</i>, but for us to say "they're real" is original research, which is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not allowed</a> at Wikipedia. If you can find a website that addresses the evidence - and more importantly, addresses the controversy, ie., why it's worthy of inclusion on wikipedia - then we can include it. We can't simply dump it on the article, though. We must show why it's noteworthy to be included, which means we need a quote from some other source saying something like "Angelina Jolie's lips have been the subject of much rumor and controversy."

I need to be sold on what would make it encyclopaedic. Let's use an example from someone else. Let's say <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicole Smith</a> was claiming her breasts were natural, but a newspaper printed that they were not, and Smith sued the newspaper. That would lend notability to the discussion. If someone wants to go hunting, I'm sure there's an interview quote around somewhere in which Jolie either states her lips are natural or she states that they aren't... <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Her Hispanic appearance vs. pale appearance of her parents</span></h2>
<p>Before reading this article I always thought she was of hispanic descent. She has always looked very Hispanic, although she has died her hair blonde in several movies and it hid this somewhat. As she has aged recently she looked more hispanic. But I read here and looked at her parents. First <a href="http://www.blick.ch/showbiz/artikel30474" class="external text" title="http://www.blick.ch/showbiz/artikel30474" rel="nofollow">her mother vs. beside her</a> and it's hard to see any resemblance. Her father basically looks so pale his skin is red. Both parents have brown to very light colored hair. Angie has black hair and very dark skin. Her eyes are more slanted and her nose is different. So I wonder about that. I'd like the article to explain this. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 12:46, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously they are incorrect, as (as stated in the article) her roots are Iroquois, Czech, and French. It's the Iroquois that makes her look slightly Hispanic. I've been a fan of her's for years and I've never thought of her as Hispanic. Another "false Hispanic" is <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carla_Gugino_cabd.html" title="Carla Gugino">Carla Gugino</a> -- who even played an Hispanic in the Spy Kids films, but who is in fact Italian and I believe Irish. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:28, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for "ex-patriate" I agree if a source can be found I have no objection to the category being reinstated, although to specify UK would be inaccurate because Jolie also lives in Cambodia, Malibu, and (if the latest rumors are correct) might be about to set up shop in Namibia.

<dd>I think it was rather pointless to delete/merge the Maddox article, since it will just pop up again pretty soon. The Shiloh article has been deleted several times now, but as of this moment it exists again. Maddox, just like her two other children, are actually notable on their own by considerable parts of the general public (both US and worldwide) and Maddox in particular is probably going to be a star a few years from now - some might even argue he already is. Whether you like it or not, Jolie’s three children are more famous than the majority of people described in this encyclopedia and the fact that new articles about her children are being created constantly just shows the apparent interest for them. Therefore I would suggest to allow short articles for Jolie's children which refer to the Angelina Jolie article - otherwise moderators will just be forced to delete newly created articles every other week (or day lately).

First of all, the IMDb link should definitaly be at the top, "Angelina Jolie Pictures" has to be removed, totally pointless IMHO. Then, if there is a sentiment that recent news stories should be linked (there is obviously), it's probably a reasonable idea to include the blog JustJared.com, since it offers the most up to date info about Jolie on the net right now. Plus the two biggest worldwide fansites SoulieJolie.com and WutheringJolie.com should possibly be included as well. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 02:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is JustJared a Jolie-specific site or just a blog that happens to mention her a lot? If it's the latter, I wouldn't be in favor of including it. We should stick to Jolie-specific sites. Agreed regarding IMDb (in fact I'll fix that right now). If the other fansites aren't included, perhaps they should be <i>however</i> I'd recommend checking the Wikipolicy on that. I've seen some major fansite links removed from other articles as they didn't match up with the policy or whatever.

<dd>That might be worth considering when we decide what links to use. I'd rather use a link that features legitimate news coverage of the baby pictures than one giving coverage to paparazzi who forced a couple to flee to Africa in order to find a little privacy. (Though as an aside I'm surprised the two went to Namibia, considering the king of Cambodia made Jolie an honorary citizen of that country and probably could have done an even better job of keeping the press out than Namibia did. Then again, Namibia will probably make a mint from the extra publicity.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 07:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What in blue blazes are you <i>talking</i> about? Jolie has arguably done more for charitable causes than any other Hollywood actress of her generation. She is the Goodwill Ambassador for the UNHCR - do you think they hand that out for nothing but a pretty face? She has not only talked the talk, she has walked the walk. Somehow I get the feeling, whoever you are, that even if you gave every cent you earn for the rest of your life to charity, you won't match Jolie's contributions to helping the needy. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 06:57, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, right... All she cares about is getting her face on another tv show or magazine... and if you believe otherwise then you've just bought the hype... Open your eyes!

<dd>Please sign your comments otherwise it's <i>really</i> hard to take you seriously. It's quite easy to troll behind the wall of anonymity. As with everything else on Wikipedia, if you can find a reputable source that suggests Angelina Jolie is a rip-off artist or an anti-Christ (I suppose next you'll be saying <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audrey_Hepburn_bca7.html" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> had similar motives when she literally killed herself for UNICEF), please feel free to add this to the article, but bear in mind that anything less than an air-tight, verifiable source (no yellow journalistic tabloids or paranoid-delusional websites) won't last 2 minutes. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:13, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Geez...she's adopting ANOTHER one?! I added the "Fourth Child" info to her page (with appopriate source) <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikramsidhu_c629.html" title="User:Vikramsidhu">Vikramsidhu</a> 01:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is very misleading. As long as she hasn't adopted again, there shouldn't be an entire section for a child that is hypothetical at the moment. This info could very well be put into the trivia section anyway, especially since the "next week" part seems to appear solely in the source mentioned which is very suspicious.. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 09:06, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmmm...well you might be right. But a) I don't think she'd make such a HUGE statement if she wasn't going to go through with the adoption, b) the source is very credible (considering CNN has already been playing parts of the interview and a full transcript has been leaked), and c) "next week" seems reasonable because its hard to say "Oh I'm going to adopt a kid on June XX" -- a week seems to give the sense of yes, it will be done immediately, but it's not pinpoint exact either. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikramsidhu_c629.html" title="User:Vikramsidhu">Vikramsidhu</a> 12:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reading other reports about this CNN interview (<a href="http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,1205441,00.html" class="external free" title="http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,1205441,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,1205441,00.html</a>), I certainly don't get the feeling that an adoption is imminent, this "next week" remark is included nowhere (it definitely would be mentioned, if she actually said it). Therefore I still suggest to delete the entire section unless you can offer a transcript with her implying that she is about to adopt another child in the next few days. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 16:45, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a new editor, and I just added the picture of Angelina Jolie, age 12.

<dd>Hey IO... welcome to Wikipedia! &#160;:) I'm not too big an image contributor myself, so I don't know the processes for dealing with images and copyright. Maybe <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wp%7Eimages.html" title="Wp:images">Wp:images</a> would be a good place to start. The image you provided has a copyright warning tag on it, which means it's going to be auto-deleted by a bot in 7 days if the appropriate information showing we have a right to use the image isn't found. Good luck, and ask me if you need any more help. &#160;:) Oh, and by the way, you can add a signature to your talk page comments by typing ~~~~.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cat Creep</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the following categories for the following reasons. Discuss as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adoptive parents: Not notable. Millions of people adopt. Jolie is notable because she's Jolie, not because she adopts.</li>
<li>Children of famous people: Really, what's the point? How vague is it possible to be? This would lump Jolie in with Uday Hussein. I don't think I've ever seen a more useless, information-free category on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>College dropouts: The article says she did not choose to complete her studies. "College dropout" implies a person who couldn't make the grades, ie., a failure at college. Like it or not, that <i>is</i> what it implies. I call structural bias, unless a source is provided that Jolie left college due to poor grades.</li>
<li>Worst Actress Razzie nominees: I don't see a source in the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also make a case that "multiracial entertainers" is also a pointless category that conveys very little information, but I've probably already bitten off as much as I can chew. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 11:11, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Myspace</span></h2>
<p>Does Angelina Jolie have an official MySpace profile? If so it should be an external link. 69.232.110.28 20:43, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even if she had one, why would it be noteworthy here? How could we prove that it was Jolie who was actually running it, rather than an imposter a la <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_Blue_e2c5.html" title="Perfect Blue">Perfect Blue</a>? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 22:13, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If she has an official MySpace profile it would be worth having it as an external link. But it would have to be verified by her or her people: for example, if she has an official website, and on this website a link is provided to her official myspace page, etc., it can be considered legitimate. Rock bands do this for instance. 69.232.110.28 22:32, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There are so many...69.232.110.28 12:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think any of this serves any purpose unless you can find some sort of proof that Jolie actually is a MySpace subscriber. I have a hard time believing anyone as rich as Jolie would even want to use MySpace, when they can hire a professional web designer to make their own webpage. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 16:48, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Shiloh's notable engough to have her own Tussauds waxwork (and is described by Tussauds as ""already an iconic figure in world popular culture"), is she notable enough to have her own article? 86.134.40.13 19:41, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have always believed that all of her children are notable enough to have their own articles, since a good part of the general public could identify them on pictures or assign their names to her mother. New articles for them are created and then deleted on a regular basis anyway. There have been debates about this in the past and the majority doesn't want seperate articles apparently. Articles for the children would also shorten this article which would be recommendable. -- <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnemyOfTheState_fedd.html" title="User:EnemyOfTheState">EnemyOfTheState</a> 21:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
