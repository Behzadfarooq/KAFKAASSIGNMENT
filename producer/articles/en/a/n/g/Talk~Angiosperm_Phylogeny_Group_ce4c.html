<p>It is just for to be based on chloroplast genes that the main reason which this classification shall be <b>rejected</b> because it analyses the plastid genome (thus an <b>allogenome</b>), a <a href="../../../c/y/a/Cyanobacteria.html" title="Cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, a co-evolutional being, a symbiont, and not the <b>plant genome</b> <i>per se</i> (by itself); and <b>regarded</b> <b>chaotic</b> (since it makes changes so radically, that soon, will be better that we use only the common names rather than scientific names)(see also <a href="../../../p/h/y/Talk%7EPhyloCode_c237.html#PhyloCode_and_nomenclatural_chaos" title="Talk:PhyloCode">Talk:PhyloCode#PhyloCode and nomenclatural chaos</a>), <b>anti-Linnaean</b> (since it uses Cladistics, that is, does not fit in Linnaean taxonomic categories)(see <a href="../../../c/l/a/Talk%7ECladistics_5656.html#Cladistics_as_method_not_compatible_with_Linnaean_Taxonomy" title="Talk:Cladistics">talk:Cladistics#Cladistics as method not compatible with Linnaean Taxonomy</a>) and <b>anti-Taxonomic</b> (since it is corrosive to major taxon, like Family).<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 18:11, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The study of genome of the chloroplast has been disturbed for the fact of this genome it is <b>uniparentally inherited</b> and this on the one hand technically facilitates the analysis on the other hand it changes the phylogeny inference, consisting of paraphylogeny.

<p>It is concluded that: after all these confused factors for the genetic research that this no doubt it should be subordinated to the morphological research, that is a field of the solid knowledge and not subject to "jack-in-the-box factors" (surprise factor) as the already mentioned. APG provoked an unprecedented crisis in the history of the Taxonomy when giving priority for the genetic research and relegating to second plan the morphological research. Kubitzki system has been making something very different having a balance between the two research types and it is for that reason that should be considered better. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 12:49, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So does this mean that you will accept the Kubitzki system of classification for Malvales, and Malvaceae in particular? (BTW I need to point out that the APG itself is not provoking any kind of "unprecedented crisis" as it is simply pulling together the research being done by many different researchers at many different institutions, who are all getting much the same results with regard to plant phylogeny, using many different kinds of methodology, and <i>which are generally supported by morphological, anatomical, biogeographical, and other non-DNA characters</i>.) <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 13:43, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>MrDarwin, I tend to accept the classification of Malvales sensu Kubitzki. As the crisis provoked by APG, it is enough to give a glance in its radical changes that it proposed (with enormous quantity of genera removal) and that will probably continue proposing (nothing guarantees that APG III will not substitute APG II and so on).<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 14:27, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Berton, I see you have restored the text "In practice, not all DNA data is created equal. Fortunately the DNA most plentifully present in plants, that of chloroplasts proved to be very informative. Actually this is not plant DNA, but prokaryote DNA." I removed this because it reads like a non sequitur, doesn't add anything informative and seems to be injecting a point of view. Plenty of information on chloroplasts and their DNA can be found in the linked <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroplast.html" title="Chloroplast">chloroplast</a> article. The nature of chloroplast DNA is irrelevant to this article, since chloroplasts and their DNA have been integral parts of the plant genome for the entire history of plant evolution. If you think the commentary is both relevant and necessary to this article (which is about the APG, not about construction of molecular phylogenies using chloroplast DNA), I would suggest rewording it to better express how and why you think this text is relevant <i>to this article</i>, while keeping a NPOV (for example, can you provide a published reference that criticizes the APG for their use of chloroplast DNA to construct phylogenies?). In other words, any criticisms of the methods and conclusions of the APG should not be your own, but I think published criticisms are fair game. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:18, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>MrDarwin, I understand your position (you want the best redaction for this article, without provoking controversies with point of views non proven), however, I was not who wrote these phrases, just found important to conserve them because they show where the classification preconized by APG is based (thence your relevance).The cloroplast genome is not a plant genome, therefore it is called allogenome (allo means: from other) although plastids have been integral parts of the plant in the entire history of plant evolution (as endosymbionts), it is the same that to consider the bacteria genome of the human gut flora (also a symbiont) as human genome, that is so obvious that I don't need to mention sources.<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 11:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may be "obvious", but it's also wrong. The chloroplast is a cell organelle of endosymbiotic origin, and its genome is passed to offspring in much the same was as plant nuclear DNA (except for being uniparentally inherited), while the human gut flora are independently reproducing organisms. One should recognise that the cpDNA tree may not correctly represent the relationships of nuclear DNA, due to the effects of hybridisation and introgression, but to same that it's the same as the human gut flora is nonsense. [S.R. Hinsley]
<dl>
<dd>I agree (it was just an analogy), but I conserve the essential: cp genome is not plant genome, and this is not phylogeny, but paraphylogeny. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 11:22, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have rewritten slightly to (I hope) make things a bit clearer. As I said previously, any <i>published</i> criticisms or commentary on the APG II methodology or conclusions are fair game to reference, but unreferenced commentary is inserting a POV. I left in the reference to phylogenies being based on chloroplast DNA (which links to the <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroplast.html" title="Chloroplast">chloroplast</a> article) but the rest is superfluous. Any comments on or criticisms of the use of chloroplast DNA in constructing phylogenies, evidence of chloroplasts not evolving in perfect parallel with the nuclear genome in plants, and/or references to chloroplast DNA producing incorrect or misleading phylogenies, should go under the <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroplast.html" title="Chloroplast">chloroplast</a> entry, where more information on chloroplast DNA is needed anyway. Perhaps a separate entry on constructing molecular phylogenies in general would be useful, and that could go into the pros and cons of using various kinds of DNA. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:02, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And now Brya has reinserted the text "In practice, not all DNA data is equally useful. Fortunately the DNA most plentifully present in plants, that of <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroplast.html" title="Chloroplast">chloroplasts</a> proved to be very informative. Actually this is not plant DNA, but prokaryote DNA." This particular article is not about chloroplast DNA, it's about the APG. I would suggest that commentary on, or criticism of, chloroplast DNA and its usefulness in constructing phylogenies belongs in an article on chloroplasts, on chloroplast DNA, or on molecular phylogenies, rather than here. Brya (or Berton), if this information is so important <i>to this article</i>, please SAY WHY. The text as written reads awkwardly and as a non sequitur. So please say WHY (preferably with references) "not all DNA data is equally useful", and please say WHY "this is not plant DNA, but prokaryote DNA" is significant. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:23, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Berton, that is your POV and does not seem to be shared by the majority of botanists. There is a broad consensus among systematic botanists that chloroplast DNA is suitable (with some caveats) for reconstruction of angiosperm phylogeny, and I think there is also a pretty broad consensus that the phylogenies presented by the APG are getting close to the real phylogenetic relationships of extant angiosperms. Of course translating a phylogeny, however accurate, to a classification system, and applying a nomenclature to that system, are quite another matter--but that doesn't seem to be the part you are objecting to. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 18:07, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>MrDarwin, we must to have critical sense, why is not most missed, that I should also, the phylogeny must to reproduce more exactly possible (without any error) the evolution and not the co-evolution and thus it should not be a paraphylogeny instead of phylogeny. I already said that classifications are merely suggestions, but as the APG System is entirely based on allogenome research, a great error and therefore it should be rejected.<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 18:42, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I haven't made my own position clear. I am not proposing that Wikipedia "accept" or "adopt" the APG II system, but neither do I think it can be "rejected": all of those are POV's and I am disturbed by statements I have seen in various articles that Wikipedia has "adopted" the APG II system. In my opinion, all Wikipedia can do is describe the APG and what the APG was proposing. There are other classification systems in existence and I don't think Wikipedia can or should pick and choose one of them as more valid than the others (although it can acknowledge whether one system or another has been accepted or rejected by consensus of systematic botanists, which point I don't think APG II has reached quite yet, in part because this field is in rapid flux and <i>any</i> system is going to be out of date almost as soon as it is published). But that's all putting that cart in front of the horse: this article is not about the APG II system and whether it should be accepted or rejected; it is about the APG, who they are, what they published, and what they did. But I might note that the reason you are giving for rejecting this system (that it is a "paraphylogeny") is not a reason most systematic botanists would give for rejecting it. That is <i>your</i> opinion, and as such does not belong in the article. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 20:08, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this article is about the APG, and you could argue that it should not include information on the APG system, or how this came about. This would lead to separate entries on both APG I and APG II, with various links. Basically I am not against that, although I am not volunteering.</dd>
<dd>The information on the genes used, and where these genes occur, is relevant because people tend to buy into the propaganda of "DNA is the code of life and by looking at the DNA we will know all" or something along those lines. The genes used are so important because it makes it clear that the differences in DNA sequences are not genetically expressed. The genes function perfectly and identically regardless of DNA sequence.</dd>
<dd>I disagree with Berton that APG would lose in value because these are not 'real' plant genes. Basically, chloroplast DNA is just one more source of information, to be evaluated in its own right. As it happens it is a very good source of information (at higher levels), regardless of the style of the APG group in classifying. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 21:58, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the most part I'm satisfied with Brya's latest changes; I may do some minor cleanup &amp; editing but don't expect to have much time in the next few days so the changes may stand as is. Although Brya is correct that the Cronquist system was not "almost entirely" based on morphology (calling it "myth" is a bit strong, I think), I would contend that Cronquist, following on the heels of virtually every preceding major classification system, relied <i>primarily</i> on morphological (under which heading I include anatomical) characters, with chemical and other characters playing a much smaller role. Cronquist's reliance on morphology (and anatomy), combined with his non-cladistic approach, led him to recognize numerous paraphyletic or polyphyletic groups (e.g., Loganiaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Liliaceae, and virtually every order) but that discussion probably belongs under the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronquist_system.html" title="Cronquist system">Cronquist system</a> article. The important part here is simply that the APG and other recent classifications are using a completely new kind of data unavailable to previous researchers. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 17:58, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've deleted the following text inserted by Brya:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes overly popularized propaganda claims that APG uses "genetic evidence" or "genetic research", but this is blatant nonsense. A difference in DNA sequence is only usable to determine evolutionary relationships if this difference is not genetically expressed. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">Genetics</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genomics.html" title="Genomics">genomics</a> are quite different fields from plant systematics.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm really not quite certain what the point of this is, what it's trying to say, or what its relevance is to this article. Maybe it would make more sense with less hyperbole and re-written to make the point more clear. I would certainly want to see documentation of the claim that "a difference in DNA sequence is only usable to determine evolutionary relationships if this difference is not genetically expressed", a claim I believe is overly broad. Discussion (and critique) of molecular techniques is probably best under the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecular_systematics.html" title="Molecular systematics">molecular systematics</a> article, which can be referenced here. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 23:34, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this bit has a point, which is that all through Wikipedia there are references to "genetic research has shown that" or "genetic data have proven that" when referring to molecular systematics. After finding such a claim newly inserted in the <i>Tiliaceae</i> entry I tried to discourage this widespread practice by inserting the said paragraph.</dd>
<dd>I will admit this has only marginal usefulness for the APG lemma itself, as it expounds a negative, and this never is good.</dd>
<dd>As to "a difference in DNA sequence is only usable to determine evolutionary relationships if this difference is not genetically expressed", a rigorous discussion and documention of this axiom would be going rather far. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 08:01, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Either I'm misunderstanding you, or I am missing something very fundamental about molecular systematics (which I will admit is not my specialty). But there is no need for a rigorous discussion, please just point me to a reference or a website that will provide the information or at least clarify your claim. I have been combing the literature, and haven't been able to verify it. On the contrary, rbcL and ITS sequences are two commonly-used examples in which differences in nucleotide sequences are expressed as differences in amino acid sequences. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 17:49, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Differences in ITS nucleotide sequences are *not* expressed as differences in amino acid sequences. ITS is not translated to protein. It is part of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (nrRNA) array; the transcribed RNA genes (5.8S, 18S, 28S) are incorporated into ribosomes, and the spacers (ITS1, ITS2, ETS, IGS) are presumably disposed of in some fashion.</dd>

<dd>I wonder if Byra means phenotypically expressed. Anyway, it seems to be wrong. There are several properties which mean a locus is better for taxonomic studies, such as ease of sequencing (which is one reason why cpDNA, mtDNA and nrDNA are popular), and an appropriate level of variability. Neutral changes are better, as traits under selection are vulnerable to convergence, but that doesn't make the data invalid for taxonomic purposes anyone more so than morphological traits that are under selection would be invalid. In at least one way protein coding sequences are better - they are more easily aligned, so there is less risk of errors resulting from mistakes in alignment. S.R.

<dd>I would have thought <i>rbcL</i> is a perfect example. Across the plant realm, there have been I don't know how many different sequences of the gene registered. This results in a fairly limited number of different amino acid sequences. Looking at the working of RuBisCO how many different ways are there that this enzyme functions? That is, how many differences in measurable genetic properties of the plant? All in all, compared to the many differences in DNA-sequences that exist there is practically no effect in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">genetics</a>. RuBisCO will do what it always does.</dd>

<dd>If a nucleotide difference results in a substitution of one amino acid for another, then that difference is being expressed. Does that amino acid affect the functioning of the protein? Maybe, maybe not (I could dig for an example, but I think I've made my point, and in the meantime you've not exactly bent over backwards to support your own statements even when asked!). But it looks like we're working under two different definitions of the word "expressed". The bottom line is that molecular systematics does not rely solely on silent mutations. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 23:43, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, you made your point. Indeed, my phrase "A difference in DNA sequence is only usable to determine evolutionary relationships if this difference is not genetically expressed." is an overstatement. The fact that a difference in sequence is expressed, either in amino acid sequence or in genetic properties does not disqualify it <i>per se</i> from being phylogenetically usable. On the whole there is a gradient of the relationship between DNA sequence and "phylogenetic usefulness", and few absolutes pertain. However, on the whole molecular systematics will deal mostly (but indeed not quite exclusively) on silent mutations. This will be even more true in the case of APG, which uses just the three genes (at least in APG I). Three genes which code for proteins that are extremely well conserved, allowing for only a very low degree of variation (certainly well below what is statitically significant). Which of course is just why these three genes have proved useful for the purposes to which APG has put them. How about the text:</dd>

<dd>"Sometimes overly popularized propaganda claims that APG uses "genetic evidence" or "genetic research", but this is not correct.

<dd>I still don't see why this needs to be included at all, maybe because "overly popularized propaganda claims" is pushing all my POV buttons, especially without citation of any such claims. I agree that it's important to explain which genes were used and why (e.g., the fact that they are slowly-evolving, i.e., highly conserved and show relatively little variation, and even less expressed variation, is precisely why they are useful for deep phylogenies; a phylogeny of species within a genus will use genes that show much more variation, including phenotypically expressed differences) but anything beyond that starts to sound like critique rather than description or explanation. As I said to Berton much earlier in this discussion, <i>published</i> critiques of the APG methodology or conclusions are fair game--go for it. But the article should not reflect the editor's opinions. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 18:38, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason I feel this needs to be included is the widespread usage throughout wikipedia of "APG = genetics". This needs to be combatted somehow. Probably by this time this misconception is rooted so firmly that it can no longer be eradicated, but it needs to be discouraged from growing further. How about:</dd>
<dd>"Claims that APG is using "genetic evidence" or "genetic research" are not correct. A difference in DNA sequence as used here has no perceptable consequences in the genetic properties of the plant. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">Genetics</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genomics.html" title="Genomics">genomics</a> are quite different fields from plant systematics.

<dl>
<dd>I don't see why the claims are incorrect. They are imprecise, and "DNA sequence data" or "molecular data" are more precise alternatives (though "molecular data" could be taken to be referring to the metabolonome, particularly those secondary metabolites produced by particular plants), but isn't DNA sequence data a subset of genetic data? On could argue that for a general audience "genetic" is better. "Genetic (DNA sequence) data", anyone?</dd>

<dd>I've not seen any articles equating APG with "genetics" but I don't doubt there are some out there. Of course anybody reading such an article can click on the link to the APG article for more (and hopefully accurate) information. I agree that referring to "molecular phylogenies" or "molecular data" (with appropriate links for further information) is preferable but I think that for the majority of Wikipedia users, differentiating between "genetics" and "genomics" is splitting hairs. I do agree that all articles should contain factual information, and any erroneous or misleading information should be corrected. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 14:39, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article currently reads, "The system is based on two chloroplast genes and one gene coding for ribosomes. This selection of genes from cell organelles is significant; zoological taxonomy similarly uses genes of mitochondria. The genome of cell organelles is separated somewhat from the nuclear genome, both chloroplasts and mitochondria having their own DNA, actually prokaryote DNA. The sequence of nucleotides is subject to a different rate of change compared to nuclear DNA." This appears to be refer to APG (2003)'s substantial reliance on the research of Solstis et al, 2000 (Angiosperm phylogeny inferred from 18S rDNA, rbcL, and atpB sequences. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 133: 381–461). However this is by no means the only form of analysis that APG (2003) uses - the article refers to 4-, 5-, 7- and 11-gene analyses, and even some morphological analyses, e.g. Doyle &amp; Endress, 2000 (Morphological phylogenetic analysis of basal angiosperms: comparison and combination International Journal of Plant Sciences 161 (6 Suppl.): S121–S153). The form of words we currently have therefore seems misleading. However this seems to be a surprisingly convtroversial article, and it's not my area of expertise, so I am raising the issue here rather than changing the page immediately; what do other editors think?.</p>
<p>BTW, à propos earlier discussion, it is not "urban myth" but the APG (2003) article that refers to, "...the then widely used modern classifications (e.g. Cronquist, 1981; Thorne, 1992; Takhtajan, 1997)" as being "based on selected similarities and differences in morphology rather than cladistic analysis of larger data sets involving DNA sequences or other forms of systematic data" (p. 400). I think we should go back to describing Cronquist as "Principally based on morphology", as <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">user:MrDarwin</a> suggests above; this would help the less specialist reader understand why APG is so different from the traditional systems which still predominate in field and garden guides.</p>
