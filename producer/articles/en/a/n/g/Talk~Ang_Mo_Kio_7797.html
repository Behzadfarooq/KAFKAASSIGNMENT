<p>Is “Ang Mo Kio” originated from “red hairy man” or rambutans, bin-jau or perhaps tomato&#160;? According to media corps radio, they said,</p>
<p>The words 'Ang Mo Kio' mean 'red-haired man's bridge' in the Hokkien dialect. The story o f how the Ang Mo Kio area was named, was passed down from the old local village-folk to the present occupants of Ang Mio Kio New Town. The bridge refers to one or two bridges** located in the area during Singapore's era under colonial rule. It was the British who apparently built these bridges during the bygone colonial days. When Ang Mo Kio was transformed from a forested kampong into an HDB-flatted new town in the 1970s, the authorities decided to keep the phonetics of the name 'Ang Mo Kio', but altered the Chinese characters slightly, so that it would read 'large and prosperous bridge', instead of 'red-haired man's bridge' - sources from Google at <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:5qcCRYw9g3QJ:www.newsradio.com.sg/ssi/did_you_know/documents/DYKAMK.doc+&amp;hl=en" class="external free" title="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:5qcCRYw9g3QJ:www.newsradio.com.sg/ssi/did_you_know/documents/DYKAMK.doc+&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:5qcCRYw9g3QJ:www.newsradio.com.sg/ssi/did_you_know/documents/DYKAMK.doc+&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the sources for the above needed some urgent correction: Actually before the concrete town of Ang Mo Kio existed, our family lived in the kampong (village) and nearly everyone in our kampong have some rambutan trees (“rambutan” is a local exotic red hairy fruit). Many of our kampong old folks who lived in “Ang-mo Dan-Our” (meaning in our Hokkien dialect - village behind/shaded by the rambutan trees) would every morning bring our vegetable and fruits to sell in the marketplace ( known as “Ang Mo Dan khek” – or meaning “rambutan market” in the Hokkien dialect). Besides rambutans we also sell certain vegetables know as “kio”( in Hokkien) which is a local vegetable known as “bin-jau”(Malay). Tomato is not that common and usually imported from elsewhere. Ang Mo Kio is not related with tomatoes.</p>
<p>“Ang-mo-Dan kheh” is exactly located at the 61/4 milestone of Thomson Road. The place where our old school (Sin Khiew Public primary school was founded by the villagers on the old opera stage building) and old temple stood (now demolished) was just next to the market which had a few provision shops, several coffee-shops, a confectionery, some road side dwellings and a Chinese (sinseh’s) pharmacy. The place was later re-located, re-built and re-named “Venus avenue” before when it was decided to demolish it completely. Now it is now just empty State land as a results of the land acquisition laws. That was the story of the kampong of Ang-mo-Dan Khek. Before our little kampong (Ang-mo-Dan Our) was leveled by bulldozers and taken over by the landowners “Messrs United Oversea land Limited” for development, our kampong folks were lucky to be compensated for moving out.. We lived and farmed in the place for as long as we can remember even before the Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>Our family’s attap house was simply numbered as “No:198 Thomson Road” and later they re-named it no. 126-A Lorong Kukus. The old hardened un-named stony kampong roads were later named as Lorong Puntong and Lorong Kukus. It was never fully paved except for a small length nearest the main Thomson road. The road names were created to facilitate for the postman who delivered the letters. Our address with such funny numbers as “No.198 off 6¼ milestone Thomson Road” was misleading and hard to find for the poor postman. Besides it was far away from the main motor trunk road or the old Thomson Road! When the landowners “Messrs United Overseas Land Limited” wanted to take over the old <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kampong.html" title="Kampong">kampong</a> place, they had it surveyed and recorded. Perhaps it was to facilitate the legal matters that a surveyor map and legal documents were drawn up for the purpose. The old map was labeled “Mukim XV111 of Ang Mo Kio” which is found in the surveyors archives of the Government of Singapore. I have a copy, and this old name definitely preceded the creation of the New Town of Ang Mio Kio!</p>
<p>It was assumed incorrectly that the name of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Ang_Mo_Kio_0602.html" title="Ang Mo Kio">Ang Mo Kio</a> refer to the bridge at 7th milestone of Thomson Road (which is found at the junction Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Thomson Road). Were those people who drawn the Map thinking of the rambutans or the Ang Mo &lt;red hairy or Englishman&gt; bridge? You tell me! The old bridge was built to cross over the Kilang river which catches the overflow water from the old Kilang reservoir. (the old Kilang Reservoir was re-named named as the Peirce</p>
<p>Reservoir i.e. named after Robert Peirce, the municipal engineer of Singapore in 1901-). It was locally known as the “Or kio” which means the “black bridge” in Hokkien. As far as I can recall It was never known as the “Ang Kio" or "Ang Mo Kio”. Ang Mo Kio became a common name after the new town of AMK was built. Moreover I understand it was just another unnamed PWD &lt;Public Works Dept&gt; bridge.</p>
<p>However I think that name (Ang Mo Kio) is unrelated to the bridges** mentioned herein but more likely to the people who lived in the kampongs and their exotic “rambutan” (rambutan is pronounced Ang-mo tan!). The area upon which the present New Town of Ang Mo Kio stands was previously known as “Kou-teu kio” meaning the Ninth Bridge in Hokkien.</p>
<p>In the early 60s there were many concrete bridges built by the local villagers for crossing the rivers and streams. Especially after the common use of motor vehicles upon the old stony roads, it necessitated the construction of such concrete bridges (or “kio” in Hokkien). I have the old Map showing some of the old bridges. We used to remember when the old folks known as the “charity people” known as &lt;Chou-kio cho-lor or in Hokkien meaning people helping out to build roads and bridges&gt; would come around to ask the villagers for small donations to help out.</p>
<p>Therefore I would certainly suggest that the name of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio came from the old surveyors maps under “Mukim Ang Mo Kio”. “Mukim” is an old Malay word for the district/area of Ang Mo Kio. It is likely that the origin of the name came from the several names of the villages along the Thomson road and all the bridges (“kio”) found in the area. It did not came from the only two old unnamed bridges** at the corner of AMK Ave 1 and Thomson Road junction.</p>
<p>Certainly Ang Mo Kio New town could not have its origins from the red hairy man&#160;! Well strictly speaking I rather use the mandarin pronunciation meaning "Long prosperous bridge" but it is certainly not the original meaning of the word in Hokkien.</p>
<p>A clever modern day web-site suggested the name Ang-Mo-kio as in “tomato” when simply pronounced in the local Hokkien dialect!</p>
<p>The original name probably reflects the kampongs where there were plentiful of “Ang-Mo Dan” (rambutans) Be my guess. it could well be the rambutans leaving out the "kio"! After all names of places came only when there were people who lived there. In the early beginning this was forested and opened up by the Chinese settlers who had a thriving gambier and pepper plantations in the late 19th century or around1922. <a href="http://www.wildsingapore.com/places/lpt.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.wildsingapore.com/places/lpt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildsingapore.com/places/lpt.htm</a> That also was the time when my grandfather came from China to settle in the ” Ang Mo Dtan Our” kampong. There were many pineapple plantations too. Rubber became important only after the Second World war.</p>
<p>What would anyone think is actually the origin of the name Ang Mo Kio? Think of the many fruit trees! There were plenty of the fruit trees existing long before the construction of bridges! Take a good look at the red hairy rambutan in this picture goto <a href="http://www.nutritionaustralia.org/News_in_Nutrition/Media_Releases/rambutans.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.nutritionaustralia.org/News_in_Nutrition/Media_Releases/rambutans.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritionaustralia.org/News_in_Nutrition/Media_Releases/rambutans.asp</a> It would be rediculous to suggest that our old kampongs (Ang Mo Dan-khek and Ang Mo Dan-Our ) were named after the red hairy westerners!</p>
<p>Actually the name of Ang Kio Tau,(in Hokkien meaning "head of the red bridge") were in used prior to the existence of the New town of Ang Mo Kio. There were older folks who understands that the “Ang kio Tau” refer to the place or bridges where the second milestone of Thomson Road (Near the Novena MRT)is presently located. Those bridges were referred as “Ang Kio Tau”. They were located before the old Kampong Chia Heng (also near PWD workshop). That locality is probably the beginning of Mukim Ang Mo Kio. The first mile of Thomson Road is exactly next along the old Canal which was constructed to drain the flash flood rainwater down to the sea. Further on to the beginning of Thomson Road was the area known commonly as "Pek Kio" or the "White bridge" . The Pek Kio Community Centre and the baptist churches are in the locality. There were a series of bridges named (in Hokkien) after basic colours from white to red then to black! All those bridges were built during the colonial times and the PWD &lt;Public Work Department&gt; were responsible. Of course the approval come from the engineers who could be the English engineers, but none of the bridges bear any names related to those people. Whereas in the cases of the important bridges, they all bear the names of the bridge builders or important people in the colonial administration e.g. the Elgin bridge was named after the Governor of the old colony of Singapore. see <a href="http://www.guidez.net/place=2356/topic=816/sight=2373/article=4490" class="external free" title="http://www.guidez.net/place=2356/topic=816/sight=2373/article=4490" rel="nofollow">http://www.guidez.net/place=2356/topic=816/sight=2373/article=4490</a> Therefore it leave the begging question "why don't they have name of all other small bridges?" Probably your guess is as good as any sensible person. Colonial prejudices! Before the Elgin bridge the local people have two other names for the older bridges constructed by the locals. One of them was known as the Monkey bridge! Certainly none of the responsible people were interested to take credit for those insignificant bridges.</p>
<p>The term "mukim" was certainly the Malay name for the area smaller than the district level. In Malaysia that term is still in used on the maps. For instance there is a place know as Senai in the State of Johore. On the Map it is listed as Mukim of Senai. The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the British from the Latin. For instance I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signifies the area located on the Map. Presently it is not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next alongside. Mukim XVIII was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as "Faber Gardens". This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus. The old Hokkien "kio" (meaning bridge or bridges) are often designation of the local name of the places related to the landmark such as a bridge or as in the case of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Ang_Mo_Kio_0602.html" title="Ang Mo Kio">Ang Mo Kio</a> denoting several bridges in existence.</p>
<p>In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio. It is highly possible that the name &lt;Ang Mo Kio&gt; was chosen by Town builders following the original name on the Map. It will be a great idea to use the beautiful red hairy rambutan as the new symbol of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio! see: <a href="http://www.proscitech.com.au/trop/display/rambutan.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.proscitech.com.au/trop/display/rambutan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.proscitech.com.au/trop/display/rambutan.htm</a></p>

<p>Why are those topics in their own articles and not in this one? If they do deserve their own articles, at least a summary needs to be left in the Amg Mo Kio article. What's the difference between AMK and AMK new town? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 09:19, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm...at first we had seperate articles for AMK and AMK New Town etc. Then I merged them together into subsections, but later split them up again when realising they have grown in content by now. To clarify between their differences, Ang Mo Kio as a place name has a boundary different from Ang Mo Kio New Town, the town of which borrows the name from a formarly small area, and planned and built by the HDB. Ang Mo Kio Planning Area, again, covers a much bigger area then Ang Mo Kio New Town, and was planned by the URA. Hence, the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Ang_Mo_Kio_0602.html" title="Ang Mo Kio">Ang Mo Kio</a> article can talk about Ang Mo Kio as a general geographic area, the source of its name, and the history of its development. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Ang_Mo_Kio_New_Town_a8bc.html" title="Ang Mo Kio New Town">Ang Mo Kio New Town</a> would elaborate on the town itself, describe its development and configuration, and the application of the new town planning concept. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Ang_Mo_Kio_Planning_Area_e029.html" title="Ang Mo Kio Planning Area">Ang Mo Kio Planning Area</a>, on the other hand, discusses URA's planning guidelines and initiatives for that area. Hopefully, the same could be done for all other place names in Singapore when their content gets developed over time.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:07, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interestingly, in the article on <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutzlaff_Street_b802.html" title="Gutzlaff Street">Gutzlaff Street</a> (Hong Kong), one notes: <i>Before the Second World War, the lane was known as "Red-haired Dame Street"</i> (紅毛嬌街) (i.e. Hong Mao Qiao Street). --<a href="../../../d/p/r/User%7EDpr_d663.html" title="User:Dpr">Dpr</a> 04:36, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes I have heard the name used (紅毛嬌街) before the existence of Ang Mo Kio&#160;! The reference to Hong Kong "red brothels" from <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutzlaff_Street_b802.html" title="Gutzlaff Street">Gutzlaff Street</a> is factual and correct. However it was slightly different in the fact when used before, it was <i>Ang-mo kio tau</i> meaning the <i>head</i> of the <i>Ang-mo bridge</i> which really is not the locality of the present AMK or Ang Mo Kio, but that locality as I remembered was at Kampong Chia Heng just immediately where the present Novena Church at Thomson stands. However, the actual bridge is the <i>peh kio</i> meaning the <i>White Bridge</i>&lt;in Hokkien&gt; built near the spot where <i>old Kampong Java and Peh Kio Community</i> stands, It is present a small area in the vicinity of the overhead by-pass viaduct bridge crossing (Central Expressway). It is obvious that a slight different in location is a big difference and I quite sure that the origin of AMK is not from that source, though it is older. There are some Cantonese speaking laundry people residing in the 60s at Kampong Chia Heng who used to express the name (紅毛嬌街)and they were likely aware of the brothel connections! However, I still find no other sources to connect with AMK or Ang Mo Kio! I have pondered on this fact but later dismissed it altogether due insufficient data.

<p>This is a discussion to decide whether we should specifically state that POJ is for Hokkien, and Pinyin is for Standard Mandarin in the inforbox. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ang_Mo_Kio&amp;diff=36105186&amp;oldid=36075458" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ang_Mo_Kio&amp;diff=36105186&amp;oldid=36075458" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or whether these are unnecessary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ang_Mo_Kio&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36075458" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ang_Mo_Kio&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36075458" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that it is <i>not</i> necessary because POJ is predominantly used for Hokkien, and Pinyin is predominantly used for Standard Mandarin around the world. Also, in Singapore, Pinyin is used only for Standard Mandarin. This level of details is not necessary, especially in the inforbox. Otherwise, we have to do the same for English, Malay, Tamil, eg. "English" has to change to "Standard English", etc. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 19:26, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Given my deletion of the said entries, I too disagree with their inclusion. The entries made are for the romanised <i>writtern</i> term, and not the <i>spoken</i>.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 19:31, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We cannot assume most readers already know Pinyin is for Standard Mandarin, and Pe̍h-oē-jī is for Min Nan (or specifically, the Taiwanese dialect of Min Nan) when they're reading. The picture is further complicated by the fact that Pinyin is also used by other languages; and Pe̍h-oē-jī is also used by Hakka, as well as the aboriginal languages on Taiwan.
<p>As for the need to specify it's <i>Standard Mandarin</i>, I suppose this is to acknowledge the fact that different divisions and dialects of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_language.html" title="Mandarin language">Mandarin</a> may not be mutually intelligible. The following Pinyin romanisation represent only the pronunciation in Standard Mandarin. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 19:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Singapore speaks Standard Mandarin? I am not so sure about that, for if so, we wont be getting brickbats from Mainlanders for our "low quality" brand of Mandarin.&#160;:D Meanwhile, all users have pointed out that you cannot assume readers will <i>not</i> be aware that these articles are refering to Mandarin and Hokkien respectively. We do not see you adding Mandarin etc to every single Pinyin romanisation across wikipedia, does it, so if it is as neccesary as to justify your destructive behavior, mind telling us why you are not doing it in other articles?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 05:37, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
