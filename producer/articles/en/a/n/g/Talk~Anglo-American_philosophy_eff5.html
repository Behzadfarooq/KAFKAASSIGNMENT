<dd>If you say this is "rubbish", can you explain what <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_philosophy.html" title="Continental philosophy">Continental philosophy</a> excludes?</dd>
<dd>Or is Continental philosophy also "Rubbish", in your opinion? --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 00:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Rubbish in the article:</b></p>
<p>1. The first sentence is just wrong, and for two reasons. "Anglo-American" always means both British and American (as in U.S.) philosophy, and never just the philosophy of North and Central America. Furthermore, the latter region is not English speaking. In this phrase, "Anglo-" does not mean anglophone. It shares the same prefix as anglophone, "anglo-" which means English (or more loosely British).</p>
<p>2. The second paragraph is therefore muddled, because Anglo-American philosophy simply includes all philosophy done in England - it doesn't just have things "in common" with it. If it means that Anglo-American philosophy has things in common with, say, anglophone Australian or New Zealand philosophy, then that's true - but it might as well say so.</p>
<p>3. The third paragraph relies on the false and inexplicable assumptions that continental philosophy is generally Marxist, that it was not studied in the United States for that reason, and furthermore that Marxism was not studied in the United States. None of this is true.</p>
<p>Since every part of the stub is wrong, and the subject matter it purports to treat can readily be covered by articles on British and American philosophy, I think this article is a candidate for deletion.<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a><a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></p>

<dd>Before you do that (Delete) why don't you guys just clean things up. You know, <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">User:KD Tries Again</a>, that I'm busy elsewhere (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a>), where you too are involved in an Editor's War. Can you truly be impartial? You know this Stub was edited by others. I did not put <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a> in there. Also, elsewhere I did not find <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophone.html" title="Anglophone">Anglophone</a> an appropriate usage, at least in the United States. That issue you should take up with Editor <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">User:Lucaas</a>. Also, I understand Wikipedia encourages boldness. So why don't you just conform your editing to the D. W. Hamlyn (<b>Pelican History of Western Philosophy</b>) Authority which I have pasted here. Do you understand?</dd>

<dd>Why do <i>you</i>, Ludvikus, presume to write an encyclopaedia article before you have assimilated the content of the literature to a sufficient extent that the quality of what you write meets minimum scholarly standards? I do not need to be patronised by you or your ilk (do you understand me?) and I would thank you to cease such behaviour forthwith. Frankly, while there does exist a distinction between analytic and continental philosophy, and there may even be a few (relatively unimportant) geographic 'trends', I find the almost fetishistic obsession, among certain of Wikipedia's philosophy editors, about 'genres' of philosophy to be decidedly weird, given that the conceptual depth of the majority of the articles is of a level not unlike a first year student's assignments. Professional philosophers, and indeed the content of philosophy in general, are concerned far more with concepts, arguments and ideas than with trends, styles or geographic areas. And I would like to suggest that the editorial activities around here would be best off trying to stick to the actual <i>object</i> of philosophy, and not Dadaist attempts to sketch the milieu in which it exists. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 08:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>May position is that the distinction exists, and so Wikipedia should describe it. We do not, and perhaps should not make a whole article. I would recommend that we simply search the literature and use that to make the distinction.

<p>Dear Banno, as you are aware, there is an editors war on the Philosophy page, in which you took administrive action. Whatever that's about remains to be resolved there, or elsewhere. Here we have a related issue - namely, is there a term usage such as "Anglo-American philosopy." I say there is - it is at least a geographical distinction - Great Britain and the United States. In my opinion, it describes a place where Analytic philosophy had dominated - in the college curricula. Are you questioning that? I do not understand what you are objecting to? Could you please explain? I've read your stuff - and I belive you are very familiar with Analytic philosophy, beginning, as it does, essentially with Moore and Russell. <a href="../../../y/o/u/Yours_truly%2C.html" title="Yours truly,">Yours truly,</a> --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 05:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do we really, really need an article on this?

    The philosophical movement which, in continental Europe, has been parallel to
    the analytic tradition in Britain and America goes back to Franz Brentano (1838-1917).

<dd>As a clue, think what he might have said about the distinction (which really exists, and which could no doubt be documented) between philosophers with brown eyes, and those with blue eyes. Or between tall philosophers, and those who are not tall. Or between those called 'John', and those who are not. All these are real distinctions. But the man did not say that the geographical distinction does not exist. Try and read carefully what he said, and try to think about that. You are indeed an extremely intelligent person, as you frequently suggest.

<li>Note, Gentlemen, that I have just entered the Title of Chapter 18 of said book. What the above shows is that on the continent (<a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>), there was <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenology.html" title="Phenomenology">Phenomenology</a>, and Allied <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement.html" title="Movement">movements</a>.

My omittion is due to my having to go to eat, whereas Mel is always claiming, or alleging that he has to run to teach his class. For me, Mel's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conduct.html" title="Conduct">conduct</a> (a word <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">User:Lucaas</a> despises) reminds of one several of Plato's Dialogues in which the disputent also has some need to leave. But as for me, notice how I keep coming back - stubborn persistence, right, Db, one of the 2 virtues you most admire in a man, the other being a convincing argument, right? So, Db, am I beginning to convince you of something in the Cyberspace of Wikipedia? Could you tell us what your Rational thoughts are? Also, are you having some Irrational thoughts to? Isn't this what the Editors War is all about? And how does the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Stool_Chart_3b60.html" title="Bristol Stool Chart">Bristol Stool Chart</a> fit in?

<dd>As to Ludikrus, the associative play of meaning across your sentences reminds me of someone quite young, and for that, I forgive you. As to the war, you suggest it must end, and that we must concede to mob opinion, never! How to help end it, that is another thing I do not think there is really a war, there is just an established group on here who are quite loosely connected, you give them the opportunity to reaffirm their alligences to one another, even if they do not believe in all the details of each other's positions. Just look how scrambled they are on this simple matter of Anglo-American Philosophy, one would have thought such a thing as crystal clear, but how could it be if you have to analyze everything down to the last syllable or letter and refrain from bringing it together; their meaning falls apart and becomes the same meaning a natural-language machine might try giving it.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 15:50, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lucaas: you say I lack a sense of humour. Perhaps it is because, like <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrose_Bierce_0720.html" title="Ambrose Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>, I prefer dry wines to sweet, sense to sentiment, wit to humour and clean English to slang. I don't find pompous verbosity to be at all funny. And I do not see what is clever about making references to Hegel and Marx in the fashion in which Ludvikus chooses to. Sophistry is not intelligent, it is annoying. Something, perhaps, the postmodernists have yet to learn.</dd>
<dd>Ludvikus, I do not care to speculate as to what your obsession with the 'Bristol Stool Scale' may be about, but just about every comment you make contains a reference to it. That all I have to say to you at this point in time. Oh — there is one thing. Sometimes, we construct ghostly conspiracies in our heads, when there are no corresponding referents in reality. And sometimes, these conspiracies <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foucault%27s_Pendulum_317c.html" title="Foucault's Pendulum">result in our own demise</a>.

<dd>I'm disappointed, Lucas, that you do not see the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialetic.html" title="Dialetic">dialetic</a> that's going on. But, on the other, it's not your fault, I think you just are to civil to drop to the bottom of the barrel. Look, very carefully, at who that the participants really are. There only, still, less than a handful, no more. And what the real object of discourse is. You think, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> that you are, is that it is <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. But it's not. It's gutter discourse. I'm from New York, I understand that <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>. Who is the most eloquent voice, besides yourself, of course? It's Mel Etitis, no? And where does he speak? In the background. Isn't it peculiar, Don Lucaas, say <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sancho_Panza_8c79.html" title="Sancho Panza">Sancho Panza</a>? Remember, who are the Philosophical authorities here? Is it <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thale.html" title="Thale">Thale</a>? Think back? Or do your research. Is it <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descartes.html" title="Descartes">Descartes</a>? Is it <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_J._King_ae08.html" title="Peter J. King">Peter J. King</a>? Who. It's you, Lucaas, who doesn't get. At <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a>, the concepts that move in the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtext.html" title="Subtext">subtext</a>, here, now, are the following: <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">shit</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick.html" title="Dick">dick</a>, and <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>. I would like to raise the standards of discourse. But notice how the just run away. But, Lucas, you do not see the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">power</a> play. You certainly know how to <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survive.html" title="Survive">survive</a>. And we are in a space of <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbes.html" title="Hobbes">Hobbes</a>'s <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_all_against_all.html" title="War of all against all">War of all against all</a>. So I wish <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> would come along and put his input. But instead we have these mysterious two philosophy professors at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, who Dbuckner believes in so strongly - and I might add, so does <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">User:Banno</a>. So it's clear that they too are <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> types in this.</dd>
<dd>But let's move to reality. FT2 now has come into our <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialogue.html" title="Dialogue">Dialogue</a>. And he's brought things to a head. The central concept now is this Wiki War. And if you, Lucaas, cooperate, perhaps the low-life discourse will end, and we will get back into philosophy. And I do not want to waste my time with gutter talk. But that's the only language that they understand. Think of it as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_cdc4.html" title="American Football">American Football</a> (its more vivid than European and internation socker). Ask yourself? Whose got the ball(s)? It was Banno, right? But now its FT2. So if we cooperate with FT2, we'll get the ball. Unfortunately, though, Dbuckner is not yeat <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_d940.html" title="Major League">Major League</a> material. But he's shown some signs, some hope. Whatever you may think of him, he's got the passion for philosophy, and has been around for years. And Wikipedia needs that, to protect the integrity of an article once it's reached a certain level of informativeness. I know all that because of my vast experience in the community around the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_1249.html" title="Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>.

So don't be stubborn, Lucaas, now let us help FT2 who wants to end the editors war - and that's what it's about.

<p>Well I compliment you on your editing, it has come on alot, I only noticed three typos above. It is good to see you getting your act together, now don't be stubborn, you know that the martyr always wins in the end, just after he gets his act together. So keep the ball rolling, it is not with FT2, though he can take it if he feels like it, nor is it with Banno, who is a little frazzled at the moment (you should really stop hastling him), just keep dribbling (as they say in soccer). But it is not just Mel Etitis nor Banno who are the main guys here you must also remember the double named, Lucidish and the trying, "KD Tries again", they also pull alot of the actual stunts, they're the line backers on many of the pages and don't underestimate them, don't forget either the guy with the funny name, well a number really, 2981etc. he has them all in his back pocket and can get them vote whichever way he wants. They just wait for the other to make a move then throw him the ball. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 03:23, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes you disappoint me too, all those lines with stars (*) at the beginning I thought you had given up making this kind of strange edit in talk pages. And that is why I made the last comment. Again now you are signing twice and putting some lines at various levels of indent even though no one else has put a comment in between (when editing there is a "show preview" button). As to me opening a mouth, well it is only you now that can speak, I suppose, it is coming to the end, is it? Only the martyr can speak when it comes close to the end, or at least, only he is listened to and waited on. There is no danger of me having trouble due to what I said last since it is just the state of things, both of us know that. But I do like your question about cyberspace, you think it is not real? You think when I go into the shop in "real life" they are greeting me with love and it is not that they just want the money in my pocket! "Real life", and you should know about it living in New York city, and coming from a communist state and now staying in one of the most agressive capitalist one's, maybe you were too small to notice the change but I'm sure you are not greeted with love on the subway nor in the recruitment office nor by your landlord nor in the shop.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 14:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Lucaas. You misunderstand me. You focus on the relative triviality of my punctuation. Don't you understand the meaning of an Editor's War? And do you know what a Community Ban is? Do you have any understand of what Db and Banno are doing right? Please tell us all what this is? Do you realize that your're not helful here? Talk to us about the topic on the agenda: the Editors' War and the proposed Community Ban - is it against you? Or is it against me? Now you remind me of Nelson - but he's on the side with the march larger army. By the way, I would like to hear from you, Nelson.</dd>

<p>What war? We are probably the only two reading these remarks. By war do you mean the attempted ban? But perhaps the reason you feature in that discussion of a ban is becuase you think the form of your edits is "trivial". You must remember that others have to read what you write and typos, long disjointed diatribes, etc,. seem to annoy certain people, this is what they have against you, they can point to lots of edits you do that do not conform to the usual way of talk, ie, multiple signatures (as above, one at 15:06 another at 15:16, you did not have to sign twice, you could have just put one signature and added in the extra comment above it. Also you put one comment at four levels of indent and the next at one, and added a superfluous line between them, no need for all that, it distracts and annoys people. Other than your edits of talk being too long and mutlitple etc, they have little to hold against you since insults etc. have been on both sides. Any lack of quality in your edits of article pages cannot be used to ban you since you are learning to use references and, besides, others can correct any mistakes.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 16:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, well now that you are almost editing properly I can respond. Of course you can play the role of Socrates, but that does not help on here since his way of doing philosophy is completely at odds with what happens on wiki. He always pleaded ignorance and said he knew more than others because, unlike them, he knew that he knew nothing. Now just try and say this to some of the people here when all they want is references and then they try to give other references to refute you. They read references as gospel, and try yo leave thinking out of it. Ethics is something that pervades philosophy, that is unless you make it a completely separate subject, cut-off from the other areas, then it dies or becomes just moralising. The Analytic attitude suffers from this, it divides everything into isolated abstractions, so I warn you it is quite an amoral way of philosophy, but is easy to slip into when you must always watch out for the Ps and Qs and the technicalities of forms of analytic arguments of persuasion, you find that in some it can lose any grip they have on reality and they get lost in clouds of abstractions. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 18:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I mean, the other, rather than you, or I. And I wish to put aside the defects in this view, for the moment.

<dd>So you have been reborn as Socrates, will you change it to Jesus when the argument moves on? I'm not sure if you know what I mean even if you say so. You want to know what "they" mean by it, if you let me know who "they" are maybe I can answer. The great enemy of Socrates was the Sophist. Socrates did philsophy out of love, but the Sophist did it for money, he was a paid professor of "philosophy" or of how to "win arguments and influence people". The sophist just taught how to argue (how to make it rational, etc.), ethics was a separate subject, they would teach even dangerous people how to argue and win in an argument, so long as they paid their fee to the sophist. So do you know any sophists? Do the universities teach evil minions as much as they do good ones, so long as they pay their fees? Your question then: what the Sophist meant by ethics was that it was not a matter of living in a certain way like Socrates, but was a separate subject to be studied, you could study the ethos of the people and tailor your argument so as they would agree with your proposal. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 20:18, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p>A more detailed, but still uncontroversially comprehensive, definition is that philosophy is <b>rationally critical thinking</b>, of a more or less <b>systematic kind</b> about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the <b>*conduct*</b> of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished <b>by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding</b> and by its <b>systematic nature</b>. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the <b>unargued</b> assumptions embodied in such a conception with a <b>rational and organized</b> body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any <b>theory</b> of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks <b>by argument</b> to make explicit the <b>rules</b> of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in <b>rationally systematic form</b>, the <b>rules or principles</b> involved. (Anthony Quinton).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take careful note of the Word <b>conduct</b> above. You said only your mother used that, and that your ancestors had spoken English for generations, remember? <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Socrates</a>/<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 00:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes I did, but you sometimes get carried away with specific words like conduct and schism. All I suggested was that ethics and morality were far more likely to appear in discussion of these matters. Behaviour and conduct have a more specific meaning and are more alighned perhaps with Dbuckner's kind of philosophy. He repeats himself doesn't he, a little too earnest to proclaim himself rational, is he making a feeble effort to be proud of the fact that certain emotions are missing from the world? His philosophy claims to be systematic and "rationally critical thinking". But some philosophers are systematisers others are not. Some focus on the rational, others prefer to talk about the incommensurate, the irrational. Where is the system in the philosophy of Taoism? where is the rationality in it? Why does he not just say great thinking or wonderful thinking, fantastic thinking? since he comes nowhere near telling us what rational is and it is then possible that he is just using sophist power to hope the word will sound good. Was Hamlet rational? what about Othello? Macbeth? Machiavelli? Do you think Socrates had a system and set of beliefs etc. like Dbuckner says he must have to be counted as a philosopher? But was he not the first real philosopher and had no system? <span style="font-style:italic">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 01:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I Reverted to the earliest version. It is my clean Stub now, as I had originally created it. I Reverted - it was not, Banno who Reverted. As I reverted, I assumed it was proper protocol to remove the Templates. Reading over the notes of the Talk page, and the fact that Mel use the title Anglo-American philosophy, I assumed that there was a consesus to do so. If there was a mistake, then Banno has corrected that. I had no idea that Banno objects to the very existence of the distinction. My comment on the page was merely - oh, I think I recollect now - at that time someone else removed the Templates. Oh, I see now. The Templates were removed by Lucaas then. Yes, I understand now. I believe it was Lucaas who removed the Templates, anf if so it was improper of him to do so. However, the removal of the Templates Now was by me, not Banno, and I take full responsibility for that. I think you all should take up that earlier Template Removal with Lucaas.</dd>
<dd>However, I now find it perverse that Banno should Blame me, for conduct which is clearly that of Lucaas, not mine. Banno has many years experience - I find it quite perculiar that he cannot distinguish between what I have done, and what Lucaas has done. How could an administrator of such vast experience confuse Lucaas's conduct with mine.

<dd>Further clarification, now that I think of it some more, perhaps I assumed, mistakenly, that Banno had removed the Template, when it was Lucaas. And so, I innocently thanked Banno for what Lucaas had done. At that time, I produced Mel's usage, and so I was so happy that Banno acknowledged. So now I'm disappointed that it was Lucas, and not Banno who removed the Template. So the issue now seems to me is that it is Banno who questions Mel's usage of Anglo-American philosophy. And so I find Banno's position to be perverse. Banno, what do you make of the fact that Mel used the expression? Whas he using a Neologism? Is the heading above a Neologism on Mel's part? Your position in that regard seems perverse to me. Here I think Mel is right,and you are wrong. --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 10:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look Banno, I'm not going to start learning what diff's are, analyzing dates, etc. I'm just going to tell you the policy I follow. When Templates are put on, there are all kinds of rules, and I rarely remove them. As I told you I Reverted to a clean version recently. And I cannot see me making a mistake of removing a Template inconsistent with the wishes of the Community. That policy I understand, and I abide by. Templates are removed when changes conform to the wishes of the community and Wiki policy. Such Rukes I would not violate. Furthermore, to do so deliberately, in the midst of an Editor's War where you, Banno, are out to get me, would be a stupid thing to do - and I would hope by now that you realize that I'm not stupid. Doing it by mistake? I do not see that.

Don't you understand? I don't give a shit. Furthermore, <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">User:FT2</a> explained to me what it's all about. Neither the Windows Foudation, nor Jimbo, want Editor's Wars. Can't you get this through you're head? It's your move, not mine. I have to shout this out for you? I won't, sincere Wiki disapproves of shouting.</dd>
<dd>How do we end this Editors' War? It's up to you, not up to me. I'm able and willing to end it. What shall we do? Give me your recommendations. You are the Adminstrator in charge. What do you propose? Is that clear enough for you? --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 14:50, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"I note the improvements made in this section recently but still it gives the impression that Analytic offers no critique of Hegel. It is given simply as some kind of instinctual "backlash against British Idealism". Now the move of Moore and Russell was also against pragmatism, and was not just a fresh start from nothing but also a return to Leibniz, mathematics, and rationalism. --<span style="font-style:italic">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 03:16, 28 January 2007 (UTC)"</p>

<dd>Because, Banno, <i>this</i> is the talk page that the majority Community wished deleted. Whereas the other page has been around for a long time. So if there was going to be polution, as Mel uses the term, I thought it would be best to keep it here, where it would disappear after you had deleted it. Also, I am concerned that Mel is disingenuous since cleary he has used the expression <i>Anglo-American philosophy</i>. Yet he has not expressed himself on what his wish is with regard to this page. Does he wish to delete it? Yes? Or no? Also, as you well know, we have our so-called <i>No two man</i> disruptor - so pegged by the majority, namely Lucas. I think, Banno, it's really up to you to bring peace, as it has been from the very beginning. Because you have the <i>Power</i>. It is you who determines who gets banned - or may I say Bannoed, for 48 hours, or subjected to a Community ban - or shall I say a Community Bannoed? Do you appreaciate what I'm saying to you? Or do you have to go to Administrator/Philosopher Mel to find out what to do? --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 12:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ludvikus you are getting caught up in politics, try and keep your eye on the ball, we are talking philosophy here. Banno made quiet an innocent point and didn't deserve such a skreed. You can add your comments to the page that discusses the ban. What is the <i>No two man</i> disruptor? I think he or should I say FT2 has brought peace, the only outstanding matter is the ban on you, but I don't think you will help that procedure unless you make a plea on that ban page; you should refute Dbuckner there who claims you are "wrecking havoc" which is deliberate exaggeration as is evidenced by the discussion for and against the deletion of this article page. The real wreckers here are those editors who having nothing to contribute and spend most of their energy complaining and deleting genuine stuff. However, I would be disappointed if the community ban took place since most of the editors who want one are not competent on this matter as they were involved in an edit war at the time, some were even fanning the flames, there is little sense in basing a ban on such biased crowd. --<span style="font-style:italic">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 14:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You do not listen very well. It is you who they consider to be the Second Disruptor. And you appear blind to the fact that it is I who is now trying to Make Peace - because that is the Number One priority at Wikipedia. And you are not helpful at all in this. At this point, the only disruptor left is you, Lucas. And I'm trying to get you now to play ball by Wikipedia rules. You disappoint me once again by trivializing Politics this time (which is the exercise of Power). All this <i>is</i> Politics, and <b>FT2</b> is watching everyone. And you are merely inflaming the situation now with these expressions of Your Political Opinions. It is time for you to find a way to make Peace with your Intellectual Enemies. And here, it is you now who, as Mel loves to say, is <b>Spitting in Everyone's Soup</b>. Why don't you ask Mel what that means.</dd>

<dd>Listen, spitting in everyone's soup, sounds fairly self-explanatory, do you think I need to understand it in some other way? I spat in no soup, the soup spitters are those out there who will spoil another's soup just 'cos they didn't buy the ingredients from them. As it is on your Anglo-Analytic page, it is being spat upon and alot has been expended in trying to delete a reasonably named article when only a small effort of generosity could fix it up very quickly. They get entrenched very quickly, have a tendency to mob and enjoy nothing more than setting-up and "voting" in kangeroo courts, which is some indication of what kind of interactions have been going on here on wiki philosophy over the past few years. --<span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 21:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<pre>
  "The history of philosophy is punctuated
  by revolts against the practices of previous
  philosophers and by attempts to transform 
  philosophy into a science—a discipline in 
  which universally recognized decision-
  procedures are available for testing phil-
  osophical theses.  In Descartes, in Kant, in
  Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac-
  tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil-
  osophical Investigations, one finds the same
  disgust at the spectacle of philosophers 
  quarreling endlessly over the same issues.  
  The proposed remedy for this situation 
  typically consists in adopting a new 
  method: for example, the method of  “clear
  and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’
  Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,”
  Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen-
  stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless-
  ness of traditional philosophical theses by 
  due attention to logical form, and the later
  Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point-
  lessness of these theses by diagnosing the 
  causes of their having being propounded.  
  In all of these revolts, the aim of the revo-
  lutionary is to replace opinion with knowl-
  edge, and to propose as the proper mean-
  ing of “philosophy” the accomplishment 
  of some finite task by applying a certain set
  of mythological directions.

<p>He writes nicely, no? You think he suggests philosophy has lost its way? Maybe it tries to hard to exploit the world through knowledge. At least this time you are pasting something a philosopher said and not another section from a dictionary or wikipedia. Though I recommended you not to paste lots of stuff. Anyhow, I answer to all your questions above, just look at what I said in the discussion of your ban, I was virtually the only one there suggesting that you not be banned and now you question me! Of course you are a valuable addition to discussions here and often give novel insights. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 02:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In case the decision is to use this page as a re-direct rather than delete, I have corrected the definition of the term. I honestly didn't understand the previous geographical statement (Europe without America, or something) and there's no such place as "Anglo-America". I cross my fingers and hope Lucas likes the contrast between analytic and continental which I inserted.<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 15:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></p>
<p>Well yes it is better, but the first sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anglo-American philosophy is a term designating philosophy by geographical location - as it is practiced and taught in Great Britain and the United States</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is not the whole truth, the term is also associated with cultural and lingual matters and may include parts of America other than the U.S. <b>of</b> A. Nor is "Great Britain" a good was of covering Anglo (see above). Most Canadians do speak English after all. Otherwise we would have to rename it "Anglo-U.S. philosophy" <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span></p>
<p>I disagree. As I said elsewhere, I think, Anglo-American simply designates England and America, and America in this context means the United States. The term makes no reference at all to language spoken or culture. Canadians and Australians and Jamaicans are not Anglo-American. Arguably, someone of American birth doing philosophy in Spanish in the United States is. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 18:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></p>
