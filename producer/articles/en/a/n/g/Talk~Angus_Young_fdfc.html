<p>I'm sorry, but it seems bad form to drop a name - Bon Scott - without any followup. Who the hell is he?</p>
<p>-You're commenting on a page related to AC/DC, and you don't who Bon Scott was? He was the singer for all of their albums until 1980, when he died. They're 2nd-best-selling album, <i>Highway to Hell</i> was recorded with him.</p>

<p>I have come accross what appears to be the most compelling evidence supporting Angus' year of birth as 1955. The AC/DC fan site Crabsody In Blue, has actually posted an extract of his birth certificate (as well as those for the other members of the present AC/DC line-up, and the late Bon Scott). This particular document quite clearly states "1955", and not "1959" - to view it, go to <a href="http://www.crabsodyinblue.com/acdcbirthcert.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.crabsodyinblue.com/acdcbirthcert.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.crabsodyinblue.com/acdcbirthcert.htm</a>.

<p><br />
First of all Angus Young kicks total chickens. Anywhat, he was in fact born in 1955.(1995? musta been a typo) It is true that he lied about his age to the press to help the image of the band. In fact, there is a magazine in the U.K. that celebrated his 50th birthday in 2005. Although I forget the name of this magazine because I saw it on some foreign website, I am sure you could look it up on Google and find the exact issue under Angus Young 50th birthday.</p>
<p><br />
Sadwings, I have taped Long Way To The Top AC/DC special. Read Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott by Clinton Walker, selection The Youngs page 121 and it states Angus in 1974 was 15 not 17. I was ask by ABC TV to run a music show with Clinton Walker. He wrote a great book on the Saints, Australian first Punk Band, he grew up with the members. Clinton Walker attended AC/DC with the Saints tour in 1973, in other words he nows what his talking about. I did search on net and I found 12 sites stated Angus Young was born in 1959.

<p>the list goes on Sadwings</p>
<p>And you think all those websites are correct? The 1959 DOB thing was just told to the media to play more into the Schoolboy Outfit schtick. He was actually born in '55.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>I still dispute the correct date of birth of Angus Young, as per my earlier comment - whilst it has been widely published as 31 March 1959, there is evidence that he was born in 1955. I suggest there needs to be more reseach into this, here is a couple of sources which support this argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australian radio station <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_J_376a.html" title="Triple J">Triple J</a>, did a "J-Files" program on AC/DC back in the year 2000 <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/music_specials/s1402507.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/music_specials/s1402507.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a> (which I listened to the broadcast the night it went to air) - which included a quiz. One of the questions (mulitple choice) was regarding the age difference between Angus and Bon Scott (who was born in 1946), one of the choices was 13 years (in reference to the 1959 birthdate), but the correct answer was 9 years which supports the 1955 birthdate. Furthermore, the show's presenter <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Kingsmill_fbdc.html" title="Richard Kingsmill">Richard Kingsmill</a> stated that he had contacted Albert Productions (of which the Young family are associated with) regarding his DOB, which they confirmed his year of birth to be 1955.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I also recall an interview on the Australian edition of <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a> (circa mid 1990s) where Angus stated he was about 17 when AC/DC started. Plausible if you consider (based on this age) he would have been 17 in 1973 up until the 31st of March. Also Angus stated in the same interview that he worked as an apprentice at a printing firm <i>prior</i> to joining AC/DC. I have also seen this publised in other sources, and it seems to indicate he was employed for quite some time before quitting to concentrate on a full-time career with AC/DC (which he did during 1974). It is probably true that he did leave school at age 14 (the legal school leaving age in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> at the time was 14 years 9 months) which many people persueing apprenticeships did in that era, but it was most probably early 1970 rather than during 1973.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't recall Angus stating in the documentary "It's A Long Way To The Top" that he was 14 when he joined AC/DC, but not to say that he didn't make this statement. User:Sadwings</p>
<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>I did more research on Angus Young, in 1976 he was 17 not 21.</p>
<ul>
<li>1976 - 1959 = 17</li>
<li>1976 - 1955 = 21</li>
</ul>
<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Angus was born on 31 March 1959 and left school at 14. In <i>Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott</i> by <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton_Walker_09ba.html" title="Clinton Walker">Clinton Walker</a> it does stated 14 and was born in 1959 not 1955. I remember watching Countdown Australia in 1974 and stated he was 15 on the show. Also on Long Way To Top interview, Angus did stated he enjoyed AC/DC age 14.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/i/ARIA_65c1.html" title="ARIA">ARIA</a> Hall Of Fame stated he was 14 when he joined AC/DC. Who's Who In Australia has correct information and cannot not publish false information. The artist will tell the manager and it will be pass to Who's Who In Australia.</p>
<p>I found <i>AC/DC: The Definitive History by Malcolm Dome</i> has over 200 pages error, poor grammar. Countdown is not call Aussie Countdown, it should read like this ABC TV Countdown Australia. Also the book says the Youngs arrived to Oz in the 1960s, poor grammar.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Firstly, the article lists his DOB as 1959 and then says later that this was a myth perpetuated by the band, his actual DOB being 1955. Which is it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other parts are grammatical nightmares ("which was inspired from his idol Chuck Berry"...), misplaced apostrophes and capital letters, run-on sentences. Marking for cleanup. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveWF_7508.html" title="User:DaveWF">DaveWF</a> 07:30, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Angus Young's actual DOB is in fact <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">31 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, and it is true that he has lied about his DOB/age to the press. This is why his birth date is often (erroneously) published as 31 March <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, just like in the <i>Who's Who in Australia</i> excerpt in this article.

<p>The article is right, he was born in '55. They publicy said he was born in 1959 to play more into the schoolboy outfit thing. --TMFSG</p>
<p>+++++</p>
<p>listen to the lyrics of 'Let There be Rock'</p>
<p>In the beginning, back in <i>1955</i></p>
<p>I believe it is Angus singing? No doubt talking about his birth</p>
<p>uhh, Angus doesn't doesn't sing at all, except for providing backing vocals on a few songs. He <i>was</i> born in 1955, but they're singing about when rock was invented (the release of "Maybelline" by Chuck Berry, usually called the first real rock song), not Angus's birth. He's not an egomaniac. It was Bon Scott singing</p>

<p>Angus was born in 1955. It's long been established that he lied about his age to start with, for reasons stated elsewhere on this page. Whether it was intentional or not, the claim Angus made to being 17 in 1976 also resulted in many rival guitarists on the Sydney being struck dumb by the fact that they were being outdone by a kid. Also, last year my magazine, Australian Guitar, devoted an issue to Angus' 50th birthday, which I'm not sure we'd have done if we weren't 100% positive we had the digits right. In the mag, <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoodoo_Gurus_a75a.html" title="Hoodoo Gurus">Hoodoo Gurus</a> guitarist Brad Shepherd recalls first hearing Angus play as a 14-year-old aspiring guitarist in the mid-'70s: "...he would claim to be 17, and that would f**k with my head. I'd think, 'How am I gonna get that good in three years?'"</p>
<p>And why is there no mention of Angus and Malc's big brother George Young, legendary founder of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Easybeats_827d.html" title="The Easybeats">The Easybeats</a> and, with fellow Easybeat <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Vanda_e227.html" title="Harry Vanda">Harry Vanda</a>, one of the most successful songwriter/producers Australia's ever seen?</p>

But what about his pre-<a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> history, and what he's currently doing right now with the band?

<p>This page is sad. first of all, angus also dressed in a spiderman outfit in the dave evens days. Also, didn't ACDC technically form in 1972, they played there first concert in 1973 but their was still a band in 1972. also, angus formed a short lived band called Kentucky. he was also said to have started smoking at age 8 (no bs). the first song he wrote was she's got balls. he's played with the rolling stones to. he also worked the printing for a soft core porn magazine before forming his first band. I don't recall if <a href="../../../m/u/d/Muddy_Waters_a6ef.html" title="Muddy Waters">Muddy Waters</a> was cited as one of his major influences. I would start editing this page if it wasn't 11:30pm.

<p>According to the AC/DC biography, "Let There Be Rock; The Story Of AC/DC", that I've just finished, Angus' stage spasm did start on stage in a small Australian club, but he was rolling around in pain, not as a cover-up. Then, George Young told him that it was entertaining to watch and to him to do it every night. '74 Jailbreak 06:00 23 October 2006</p>

<dd>There are two relevant stories I have read: Bon's band Fraternity supported Brian's band Geordie in the early '70s in the UK and Bon saw Brian writhing in pain on stage singing a Little Richard song. Brian was taken to hospital with appendicitus; the 2nd story is about Angus tripping on stage in '74 or '75 and George Young telling him to make it part of the act and to accentuate it. This became his 'spasm' on the floor. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_7eb1.html" title="User:Design">Design</a> 04:27, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right, those are two different things. Brian had appendicitus (sp?), Angus tripped over something and decided to make it part of the act</p>

<p>I'd like to point out that Fling Thing was originally released as a B-Side track of the "Jailbreak" single, and never released as a standalone song. AC/DC also performs Bonny, which, if listened to right after Fling Thing, is obviously different. What I'm saying is; Bonny and Fling Thing are two different songs. Sure, they slowed it down and took out the intro, but Bonny isn't Fling Thing. '74 Jailbreak 29 October 2006 1:10 EST</p>
