<p>Is that notable enough to be mentioned in the article? Many bands have mistakes in their booklets and it doesn't really deserve a mention in the article. Seems like a weak, needless stab at the band.

<p>Many interviews with Tom hint to a religous undertone to group. What are thoughts on added something to that effect to main page or trivia section? Especially since this is a "super group" and some members still belong to bands they came from. Thus, this may be a "primary" project from Tom but a religous side project for others.</p>

<p>This page needs a good clean-up. There are many inconsistencies througout the page. For example, the first paragraph says ex-Distillers bassist Ryan Sinn but not <b>ex-</b>The Offspring drummer Atom Willard like it should. There's a link to Boxcar Racer but not to blink. The first paragraph talks about a release date in May, but in the History section we say April. etc.</p>
<p>Basically I think we need to re-arrange the page a bit, what do you guys think?</p>

<dd>Atom isn't ex-The Offspring. He haven't quit the band.--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreedyredbag_765b.html" title="User:Greedyredbag">Greedy</a> 00:51, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My bad, it was reported in the news that he had left the Offspring, but a journal on the offpsring's website confirms that he didn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's right. Besides Noodles said that the a couple of weeks ago they recored "the day before" (he reported on the blog) they have recorded with Atom. So, I don't think that Atom is out of the band. He had definitely said that he will stay in the band, I think. <a href="../../../p/a/i/User%7EPainbearer_a558.html" title="User:Painbearer">Painbearer</a> 00:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>there is more than one airwave? =) i'm not going to fight this out, but i think that it should be "are", i only use is when i'm talking about one person (four tet, aphex twin) i would use is. I feel bands should be refered to was a group (they) rather than an individual. 81.170.105.24 09:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Former Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge has settled on a release date and title for the debut album by his new band Angels &amp; Airwaves — well, almost. According to a spokesperson for A&amp;A's label, Geffen Records, the record is tentatively titled <b>We Don't Need to Whisper</b> but will most definitely be in stores <b>May 16</b>.</i></p>

<p>First of all, can we get people to use proper punctuation? I, when referring to one's self, is capitalized!

<p>My friend Spenser got a hold of this album soon after it leaked and then I got it. This is honestly one of the most amazing things I've ever heard. I've been waiting a long time for this. While many may argue that they are not the best musicians, which may be true, their level of creativity and unbelievable writing skills is unsurpassed by most bands of our time. It's majestic, powerful, and hypnotic. I'm not just saying this because I'm some little tom delonge fan boy. I'm serious.</p>

<dd>Tom DeLonge knows how he'd like people to listen to We Don't Need to Whisper, the debut album from his new group, Angels and Airwaves. "I really want the room to be dark, with black light or a candle," he says. "People should have headphones on, and they should be really comfortable, maybe sitting on the floor, leaning against the bed. I spent a year and a half working on this record, trying my hardest to give people a moment of escapism. All I ask is 50 minutes of a lowered heart rate."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first single, "The Adventure," is already burning up the radio and the Internet. Lyrics like, "I want to have the same last dream again/the one where I wake up and I'm alive" is what DeLonge describes as what this record is all about. "Standing up and screaming, 'I want to be alive.'"</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>We Don't Need to Whisper—named after the first phrase DeLonge said into a microphone when sessions began, testing to see if everything was working—was recorded at his home studio in sessions that began in March 2005 and continued for about a year. The album isn't the pop-punk hard candy that fans might expect from DeLonge: it mixes guitars and electronics on the epic scale of U2 or Peter Gabriel. The album tells a story, for which DeLonge offers Cliffs Notes, beginning with the album's epic opening track, "Valkyrie Missile": "That's a weapon in the cold war that carries a nuclear weapon. It's coming to annihilate life as you know it, meaning I didn't see the breakup of my band coming, but something special and beautiful is about to happen."</dd>

<p>I believe a lot of the content in the article is highly repetitive, or that a great deal of it shouldn't even be on this page. I'm going to refer to a lot of content I believe should be removed as to not offend anyone and actually removing it without stating so in this discussion...</p>
<ul>
<li><i>DeLonge personally claims Angels &amp; Airwaves is "the best music made in decades" as well as being "much more powerful, emotional and melodic than Box Car Racer and blink put together."</i> -- This is stated in the introduction to the article, but honestly, what's the point? Everyone can gather their own concept of what the music is like and formulate their own opinions. It really doesn't say anything about the band that needs to be featured in an encyclopedia article.</li>
<li>Shouldn't all the information regarding blink-182 be placed on the blink-182 page and not the AVA page? It doesn't really have as much to do with AVA as it does blink. Or, if it needs to stay on this page, should there not be a new section in the page created specifically for that?</li>
<li>The massive quotes... why do we still need them? The album has leaked officially, and I'm sure most of us have heard it. We already know about Tom's feelings on the album, but why do we need these comments still? Has enough information not surfaced regarding the band?</li>
<li>Should the +44 stuff regarding the song release not only be on that article's page? It has much more to do with +44 than with AVA. Or, add it to a new section regarding Tom and blink-182.</li>
<li><i>In addition, on April 26th, 2006, the band performed live at London's XFM Radio studio where they performed "The Adventure," "It Hurts," and "Do It For Me Now" for the first time in Britain.</i> -- With all due respect to the person who contributed this, what's the point? The band is going to have lots of performances and lots of "firsts," what makes this one so special?</li>
<li><i>The band's Myspace released Valkyrie Missile, being slightly different from the version leaked onto the internet. The only difference was an extra guitar riff between the chorus and the second verse.</i> -- Why not just put this on the album's page?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just my opinions. A lot of the article just seems out of place, redundant, and meaningless. <a href="../../../e/n/f/User%7EEnfestid_f0de.html" title="User:Enfestid">Enfestid</a> 00:49, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Seeing as how someone already carried out my suggestions while I was away, I've been trying to understand why people are considering Angels &amp; Airwaves a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergroup_%28music%29.html" title="Supergroup (music)">supergroup</a>. Now, I like the band just as much as anyone here, but "supergroup"? I don't know about that.</p>
<p>Just read the definition on the supergroup page. Most people consider supergroups as side projects, or something that's not meant to last. If you ask me, Angels &amp; Airwaves is a new band, not a supergroup. It seems like it's something that's meant to last, and it's not meant to be some little spin-off of blink-182 like Box Car Racer was.</p>
<p>At the same time, I do comprehend the fact that all the members of the band have some other "claim to fame"... but come on, how famous are all of these guys alone? It's not a <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velvet_Revolver_010f.html" title="Velvet Revolver">Velvet Revolver</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audioslave.html" title="Audioslave">Audioslave</a> we have here. It's not even <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_Perfect_Circle_50dc.html" title="A Perfect Circle">A Perfect Circle</a>. All of the people in AVA come from bands that have had hit songs, but I don't know if it's anywhere near the same level. And another thing I think, is that if you mentioned all these names to anyone on the street, they wouldn't have a clue who any of them are.</p>
<p>Any comments on supergroup vs band? I don't want to change it again without some input here. <a href="../../../e/n/f/User%7EEnfestid_f0de.html" title="User:Enfestid">Enfestid</a> 19:13, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergroup_%28music%29.html" title="Supergroup (music)">supergroup</a> article : "the term supergroup was coined to describe music groups comprising members who had already achieved fame or respect in other groups or as individual artists". As far as I'm concerned Tom DeLonge is the only member who achieved significant fame. I'm not sure what to make of the term "respect"; surely all the members of AVA are well respected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article also states "Supergroups tend to be short-lived (often lasting only for an album or two), perhaps because of the natural conflict of egos between established stars.". While this is not true for all supergroups (for example Audioslave and A Perfect Cricle are well-established), I think it's clear that Angels And Airwaves more a Tom DeLonge project than a collaborative effort between different stars.</dd>

And the article states "the term supergroup was coined to describe music groups comprising members who had already achieved fame or respect in other groups", and I have to say blink-182, The Distillers, and The Offspring have all achieved fame more than a lot of the other so called "supergroups".</dd>

<p>Ok, so here's the bottom line. Everyone keeps adding links, official or not, to the external links. And then you get someone who comes along and deletes pretty much all of them. So can we post eligable links here that you think deserve to be on the list, and then if there isn't any complaints about it, it can be added to the actual page. And then anyone who deletes them thereafter surely deserves a bit of a slap...</p>
<p>The first contribution - www.angelsandairwaves.co.uk - first Angels and Airwaves site created (though it isn't an official site) and if you google "Angels and Airwaves", it's the second result that comes up.

<p>I just now changed the article to reflect a more encyclopedic approach. I removed numerous things, but all were removed for a reason. I removed a quote describing the band's sound, as the album has already been released, thus people can make their own conclusions as to the sound. I also moved a lot of what was said in the beginning of the article, as it's only supposed to be a short description of the band -- everything that was removed from that spot had either been stated elsewhere in the article or was moved, however. I also removed the comment about Valkyrie Missile being different on the final version, because numerous songs on the final version of the album are slightly different, and it should come as no surprise -- we heard a <i>leaked</i> version of the album's <i>advance</i>. Advances are subject to change. If you have any questions, please reply to this.

<p>Wouldn't Angels and Airwaves also be considered Progressive Rock? They sound kind of like a Prog Rock band.</p>
<p>No way!! Sounding and being are two completely different things. If you want simple, sugar-coated riffs, that's Angels and Airwaves</p>
<p>They definitely have a progressive sound and that is one of the reasons they are one of the very few current bands I like(70s and 80s rock whore here)</p>
<p>wait i dont mean to just change the prog label, but ive heard these people - theyre the furthest thing away from prog... they might have bits of a sound of prog maybe, but really, theyre not prog at all in what makes "prog" prog - long, technically advanced, complex songs... so how about getting rid of the label?</p>

<p>According to the myspace page for Angels and Airwaves, it would seem that Mark's band (+44) released a song online at midnight on Tom's birthday entitled "No It Isn't" which was clearly a song written about Tom. Among notable lyrics were "Please understand, this isn't just goodbye, this is I can't stand you". The timing of the release may have been intentional, as AVA were planning on releasing their single on Tom's birthday as well. This may have contributed to the fact that the single was delayed, and also may be an indicator of the friction that is still present between Hoppus and Delonge. This stuff might be good to add in the article. Can anyone else confirm the song, its lyrics, and its release date?</p>

<p>I very much doubt that there's been 20 million copies of "We Don't Need to Whisper" sold in the UK. Up until 2 weeks ago I hadn't even heard of them. And if there hasn't even been half a million sold in the US then it makes it even more unlikely that the UK sold that many. Is there a citation for the outlandish figure?</p>
<p><br />
They havent sold 1000000 either. Theyve gone silver in the UK which is around 60-100k. Someone really needs to change that.</p>
