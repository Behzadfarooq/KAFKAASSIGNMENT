<p>Hi Angie: It seems to me that you continue to have difficulty identifying the boundary between the encyclopedic and the unencyclopedic. We really need to address this, because if you continue to add substantial amounts of unencyclopedic material that outweighs the good that you do with the encyclopedic material. I have just removed the example of male chauvinism that you added to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauvinism.html" title="Chauvinism">Chauvinism</a>. Gaston is a secondary character in a minor movie. He does not exemplify "male chauvinism" in the general consciousness. Most people would have to look him up to find out who he is. Because of this, he does not enlarge most reader's understanding of the nature of male chauvinism and, so, does not enhance that article. Please stop adding examples to articles. Until you have a clearer understanding of what makes a fact encyclopedic, please <u>suggest</u> your examples on talk pages. That way, we can discuss them first, and you can avoid becoming a problem editor. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 10:42, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your squeak is my command. I have archived your talk page. The first archive is 'full' so I have started a second.

<p>Hi Angie: Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vega_%28character%29&amp;diff=20897933&amp;oldid=20897608" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vega_%28character%29&amp;diff=20897933&amp;oldid=20897608" rel="nofollow">creation of the Vega article</a> contravenes the policy <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. I can see how this may have seemed reasonable, since you were populating a redlink in <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_as_a_Teenage_Robot_44c7.html" title="My Life as a Teenage Robot">My Life as a Teenage Robot</a> but what you did compounds someone else's error. I have merged the character articles back into the main article. If the main article gets too big then the solution is to spin off a single article for all the characters. Fictional characters only merit their own article where the character has become highly notable in their own right or where they appear in many different works which cannot be grouped readily. Before you create your next character article, I suggest that you ask my opinion, unless you are very sure that it fits policy. Your other edits today(ish) all seem to fit policy (although I did wonder a little about the comparison of Mario with Sonic before deciding that this is an unusually close parallel). —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 22:04, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angie: InShanee reverted your restoration of the Aqualad image because that image was thought to breach copyright and the user that uploaded it would not explain its source. Because the user was doing a lot of damage it has been decided that all his images are suspect. See <a href="../../../d/v/i/User_talk%7EDvirgueza_4656.html" title="User talk:Dvirgueza">User talk:Dvirgueza</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p>I see that you are continuing to improve <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Robot_Monkey_Team_Hyperforce_Go%21_63dd.html" title="Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!">Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!</a>.</p>
<p>Your addition to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veruca_Salt_86db.html" title="Veruca Salt">Veruca Salt</a> (<i>They're also both British girls, creating the interpretation that the spoiled brat image came from London.</i>) is another of your speculations without a source. To help you understand the nature of the problem I want to ask you a sequence of questions. None of them will be rhetorical so please answer them here. The first is: do you agree that "creating the interpretation that the spoiled brat image came from London" is an opinion? —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 20:35, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. It is if you've read the script to the original movie and have heard Veruca speak. <small>[Unsigned at 22:03, 16 August 2005 by Angie Y.]</small><br />
I do not entirely understand this answer so here are some further questions.<br />
1a. My rephrased question is: do you agree that "creating the interpretation that the spoiled brat image came from London" is the expression of an opinion and not a simple statement of fact?<br />
1b. Were you suggesting that Veruca comes from London?<br />
1c. Were you suggesting that the idea of a spoilt brat came from London?<br />
I am trying to understand what you were trying to say in the article and why you think your addition was appropriate.

<p>1. Yes, I was. 2. According to the two Wonka movies, yes. Veruca became the pop culture and stereotype image of the spoiled brat. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<p>Yeah, the movies themselves. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User: Angie Y.</a></p>
<p>What evidence do you have that "Veruca became the pop culture and stereotype image of the spoiled brat."? —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 01:13, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From her behavior and vocab. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<p>I can see that her behavior and vocabulary show that she is a spoiled brat. When you say "Veruca became the pop culture and stereotype image of the spoiled brat." do you mean that she conforms to an existing pop culture and stereotype image of the spoiled brat? I read it to mean that she became the iconic image of the spoiled brat in pop culture. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 10:32, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, she did, and other character with a bratty attitude such as hers soon followed. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<p>Veruca Salt follows in a tradition of such characters. She is not the first. Dahl would have read about Violet Elizabeth Bott in the <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_William_9c78.html" title="Just William">Just William</a></i> novels as a child, for example. Similar characters were commonplace in the instructional children's novels of the nineteenth century. If you look at the list in Spolied brat you will see that they do not all derive from Veruca Salt. Consequently, if we look again at the problematic sentence that started all this: <i>They're also both British girls, creating the interpretation that the spoiled brat image came from London.</i> I find that <i>They're also both British girls</i> is an objective fact. <i>Creating the interpretation that the spoiled brat image came from London</i> is not fact, however, because not everyone (or even most people) would deduce that spoiled brats were originally Londoners. Even if something seems obvious to you, the most important thing is how it appears to other people. Do you agree that the first part is a fact and the second part an opinion? —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 18:42, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I do. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<p>Encyclopedias do not include opinions. They only include facts. You can change an opinion into a fact by saying who holds the opinion. So "Scientology is a good thing" is an opinion while "Tom Cruise thinks that Scientology is a good thing" is a fact. One of the rules of Wikipedia is that it can contain no new ideas so we must not use anything that amounts to "I think that …". You should only include opinions that have been published in books, in magazines, or on web-sites that have something to lose if they are found to be wrong. Does this help you to understand why some of your additions get deleted as "speculation" or "opinion"? —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 22:54, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angie: When you up load an image like this, you must cite its source because unsourced images are deleted. In this case, I made a search and found that the image was Copyright © 2002 Funakupo Stuffies (see <a href="http://www.funakupo.com/gallery/rika.html" class="external free" title="http://www.funakupo.com/gallery/rika.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.funakupo.com/gallery/rika.html</a>), so it will be deleted anyway. Essentially, we can only use copyright images if the image is the subject of the article (this is an over-simplification, but it will do for now). In the case of anime characters, we can use a screen shot of the character or a promotional image created by the owners of the character. You must be very careful about which images you upload and you must always state their source. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 09:51, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Theo: Can you add the following information in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrior.html" title="Warrior">warrior</a> article?:</p>
<p>Warriors in some cultures, like the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powhatan.html" title="Powhatan">Powhatan</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Indians</a>, are the chosen husbands of women, especially the daughters of emperors, kings, or chiefs.</p>

<p>Do you want to say that in some cultures women prefer their husbands to be warriors? What is your source for saying that this is true of the Powhatan? I think that the second paragraph has no place in an encyclopedia article about warriors. It is an essential part of the story of Pocohontas but it is not appropriate to explain non-fiction subjects (like <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrior.html" title="Warrior">Warrior</a>) with fictional examples. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 18:13, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://pocahontas.morenus.org/" class="external text" title="http://pocahontas.morenus.org/" rel="nofollow">The Real Pocahontas</a>, marriages were often arranged by Powhatan chiefs; the princess could become a wife to any man that her father chose personally. Most men in the tribes <i>were</i> warriors, so my last sentence is correct. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a>A</p>
<p>If most of the men were warriors, it is not significant that Pocohontas' father chose a warrior for her.

Invader Zim is awesome and your parody of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_feces.html" title="Human feces">Power Rangers</a> sounds pretty fun (anything with <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cows.html" title="Cows">giant robots</a> is fun). If you do have a page, then you might like to see mine: poisenpikmen (I relize it is spelt incorrectly... I was tired when creating my account and still haven't fixed the spelling even though it is simple to edit your pen name...). I wrote a Billy and Mandy related poem...</p>

<p>Dear Angie Y., Code: WIKI is currently experiencing huge technical difficulties, making the acts of changing the featured article - or anything else, for that matter, impossible. Please do not use this chaos to take over the site or turn it into a fanon site with articles like "Odd marries Aelita and Sissi in same day" or "XANA dies because of pie". Just a precaution - and warning. Code: WIKI will soon work again, hopefully. See you soon.</p>
<p>P.S. contact RobKohr, if possible, at robkohr@gmail.com, and ask him to reactivate Code: WIKI! Petition! <a href="../../../k/f/a/User%7EKFan_II_fe61.html" title="User:KFan II">KFan II</a> 16:20, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am just too curious to ask.... Why would you expand on the mother/father paradoxes? You do realise that these dont actually exist. If we were to entertain the notion we would then have to have the great grandfather paradox, great grandmother paradox, great great grand father paradox, etc, etc, etc. The phrase was actually coined as <b>Grandfather Paradox</b> and for this reason should be used to indicate any paradox which is the result of killing an ancestor and thus stopping your own birth. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 22:55, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angie, I write you because I saw your work in the article <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerime.html" title="Amerime">Amerime</a>. I am not the oldest member here but not the newest either...so i'll just make a suggestion and hope you can take it if you want.</p>
<p>You see, comments like "<i>(Show has Chinese things, and one character, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimiko_Tohomiko_b782.html" title="Kimiko Tohomiko">Kimiko Tohomiko</a>, is Japanese)</i>" are unnecesary since there is a link which takes you directly to the series information where you can find out why is this series concidered Amerime. Since it's a list, the only things which probably are necessary to point are weither they were created in the U.S/U.K. or in France.</p>

<p>Hi there. I was just looking at my watchlist and noticed your edits to the CL episode pages. Just wanted to say thanks for those. (I can't believe I didn't catch Sissi saying "less sexy?" in a southern twang. I ususally pick up random details like that). Anyway, just wanted to give you a thanks and a thumbs-up for your work.

<dd>NO WAY!!! <i><b>YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THE MATTHEW GÉCZY!</b></i> Either its a late April fool or I just met one of the most hardcore CL fans on the Internet! Wow, can't BELIEVE you know the guy who plays the voice of Odd! Anyway, yeah I'm a CL fan too and for the love of all that's sane I am hopelessly ADDICTED to that show. I've been monitoring the Talk Pages around here for a while and I'm getting a feel for my fellow CL editors. I see that you&#160;?ove fanfiction. So do I. I have a little bit of CL fanfic coming together in my head. I can tell you about it if you're interested. I also see that you are very involved in Code: WIKI and have your own fanfic wiki. I look forward to seeing "The Realm of Lyoko" up and running. Are you still working on it? Last three times I checked it said "This wiki has been effectively destroyed by NMW. Have a nice day." I know some good sites where you can upload fanfictions, and you can always post ours. By the way, don't let KFan II get you down. I've been watching him and he seems to one of those sketchy Stalinist types who likes to yell and torment everyone around him. He thinks I'm his friend, but I know better than to fall into that trap. I noticed that you stood up to him on his talk page and called him a bully. Good job, stand up for what's right! IGNORE THE PEER PRESSURE! Anyway, It's awesome to meet you. Look forward to talking to you some more. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 12:13, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would also like to hear your fanfiction ideas. Would you like to hear mine? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoa. You know, I've been to Lyoko Freak quite a few times and I like the site a lot. It has good images and great fanfiction. I never got into the forum, but I guess I should now that I know that the actual voice actors are there. Another whoa. I can't BELIEVE it! I accept my position on the staff and I'll check in as soon as I finish this message and add "The Realm" to my Userpage's useful links. All right, to the fanfiction.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's my basic story in a nutshell:</p>
<p>Team Lyoko defeats XANA after he escapes into the real world and attempts to instigate World War III between the United States, the Middle East and China.</p>
<p>The team grows up and go their separate ways.</p>
<p><b>Jeremie &amp; Aelita:</b> They become defense analysts for the French Military. Aelita is killed by terrorists in a bomb attack on the Ecole Militare in Paris.</p>
<p><b>Odd &amp; Ulrich:</b> They move to Odd's hometown of Florence in Italy and get a batchelor pad together. They start their own company, DR &amp; S Films where they make short movies and music videos.</p>
<p><b>Yumi:</b> Moves back to Japan and puts down roots in Tokyo where she becomes a business consultant for XANADU, a corporation that specializes in creating virtual reality universes.</p>
<p>Now, the Factory was demolished and the Supercomputer was destroyed, but XANA survived (if I explain to you how it will take up too much room) and moved into the Supercomputer Networks of the French Military Base Jeremie works at (called "Raven's Nest") and those of XANADU Corp.</p>
<p>Now, XANADU was making a virtual universe and scanner system not unlike that of Lyoko! XANA infects this program, alters it to his whims and uses the company's Scanners to unleash a crushing force of monsters on the Earth. In every industrialized nation with these scanners, monsters pour out and destroy everything in their path.</p>
<p>Within hours, our civilization is destroyed and the survivors (including Jeremie, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi) must hide in "Survival Colonies" that are the sewer systems and subways of the major cities. Jeremie becomes the Administrator (kind of like a mayor) of New Boulogne-Billancourt. Odd and Ulrich set out to find Jeremie and Yumi escapes the ruins of XANADU Corp and sets out on an epic journey across two continents to reach Jeremie.</p>
<p>Also, Odd and Ulrich saved that hair sample of Aelita's from "Just in Time" and give it to Jeremie. Aelita can be brought back to life.</p>
<p>From there they basically do what they always do: Fight XANA after locating his alternate univers (XANADU). All of the other schoolkids become Lyokons, get powers etc.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it's pretty cool. Thinking up powers for the new Lyokons is fun and ironing out chapter ideas is great as well. It's basically almost a continuation of the CL series and I draw elements from Garage Kids and other sources. Yes, I would also like to hear your ideas. Talk to you soon.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 12:38, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>NoOdd/Sissi romance? Awwww....</dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay, here are mine...</p>
<p>My first story is a <i>Code Lyoko</i> spoof of <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretty_Guardian_Sailor_Moon_a812.html" title="Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</a></i>, a Japanese series.</p>
<p><b>Aelita:</b> She is the reincarnation of the Princess of <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a>, here represented as a planet.</p>
<p><b>Yumi:</b> She is the reincarnation of the Princess of Mercury and uses the power of wind.</p>
<p><b>Sissi:</b> Sissi is the reincarnated form of the Princess of Mars, and she have hydrokinesis.</p>
<p><b>Ulrich:</b> He is the reincarnation of the Prince of Jupiter and he uses electrical power, but his attacks are not as strong as Jim's are (he too uses lightning).</p>
<p><b>Odd:</b> He is the reincarnated form off the Prince of Venus, and he controls all forms of metal and light. He has feelings for many girls but he pines for Sissi most of all.</p>
<p>I'm also working on a fanfic with a friend and fellow CL fan, called <i>Blast Into The Past</i> and a JimxSuzanne <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> romance story. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Awesome. I never knew what the heck Sailor Moon was so I probably won't understand the spoof, but it sounds great anyway and I'll be sure to read it. For my fanfic, I haven't really thought about what to do with Sissi. Obviously, she'll be a Lyokon of some sort, but she might end up being a background character. Although, that so-called OddxSissi shipping gives me an idea....</dd>

<dd>Oh, by the way I've created my account at the Realm and your wiki's main page was...um...vandalized by the AAH Vandal who keeps posting that abusive wife crap that I'm tired of reading. I'll fix that right away. We're going to need a strategy for keeping The Realm free of vandalism.

<dl>
<dd>Well, I've got a special plan for Jim. He is going to stay on the real world and command the colony's defense forces who fight XANA on the home front. (I forgot to tell you, XANA is invading the Paris underground and wiping out the survivors. New Boulogne-Billancourt is one of the three surviving colonies. Jim needs to prevent XANA from destroying the few survivors left). All right, my plan. The vandals like to take our pages, erase the text and put up their own messages, right? I was thinking we could copy-and-paste the pages we write onto Microsoft Word where they can be safe as backups. When a vandal destroys a page, we erase their message and paste the original article. That way we don't have to write the whole thing again. How does that sound? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 13:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jim is basically wearing a maroon undershirt (the collar just sticks out), and khaki trousers. Over that however he's got large pads of Kevlar and leather body-armour. Metal armour on the wrists and face complete the set. His <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_%28weapon%29.html" title="Bo (weapon)">bo staff</a> is a titanium shaft with a graphite core, making it an excellent conductor for his lightning abilities.</p>

<dd>That's great, but as far as I know (I could be wrong) I don't have blocking powers. Also, I have no idea what these pages looked like before being vandalized.

<p>Angie, Someguy just gave us two possible weapons we can use in the fight against the AAH Vandal</p>
<p>a) We could semi-protect pages to bar new editors from editing them or creating new ones.</p>
<p>b) (This is the one I'm leaning towards) move The Realm off of edit_this and onto Wikia, which is run by top Wikipedians.</p>
<p>What say you to this? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 14:23, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay. Personally, I believe it would be a good course of action to start off at Scratchpad Wiki Labs. No matter what the content of your submission is there, they accept it (Wikia can deny your request for a number of reasons)If mini-wikis on Scratchpad get a big enough following, they can be incorporated into Wikia. Since we are guranteed space on Scratchpad, I think it would be great to use them as a stepping stone.

<dd>Ah, I see. You want it to be closer to your Sailor Moon pals. Yeah, I can deal with that.

Contact your friends at wikimoon (I'm assuming you know people there, since you want TRoL on their wiki). By the way, I just looked into LyokoFreak's foum and read the Voice Actors' Room. Wow. It seemed hard to believe that I was <i>reading</i> what the very people I here every Saturday at 11:30 AM wrote. Too cool. I'm working up the nerve to be a noob on LyokoFreak.

<p>Hi Angie. Sorry that I haven't been on Wikipedia for the last three days. We had a heat wave in Connecticut and it fried my Internet cable, and then it fried my ISP server. I only got on once on an AOL dial-up connection where I couldn't do anything since it was blocked. Sorry I was gone, but I'm back and ready to talk any time.

<p>Hey! =D I'm so glad! I can't wait to put them in my favorites! Is your style like the show's style? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>About the style, it's yes and no. I definitely try to draw the characters like they do in the show. Before drawing a few official pictures I did some scratch pads of Ulrich and Yumi, and I hope you'll find them accurate. The real challenge is the eyes, and drawings where the characters are on an angle. While the characters are like the show, the backgrounds are not. I drew the Factory based off of photos of the original Renault factory found on [www.codelyoko.fr www.codelyoko.fr.]. The city's layout is similar, but the buildings will be different. There will be a bit of product placement and corporate sponsors (i.e. NOKIA, Renault, etc.). Also, when you see the drawings, try and find the cameos I put in for fun! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coming. I have the scene with Ulrich and Yumi in the graveyard done, as well as the one with Odd's cell phone floating down the river and Ulrich seeing Odd dead in front of the Factory. I'm planning to draw another picture as well, namely the front of the Weber-Scaff Inn. I'm moving down my list in order so the next picture should be...that syrup bottle blowing up in Ulrich's face. I'll draw that now, but I'll have this page in order to carry on a conversation all the while. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, you scan the picture. Then upload it into your DA gallery. Yumi's hair is slightly longer, coming to her shoulders more.

<dd>Cool. I just drew my first picture of Natsumi laughing at the kitchen table. She's a bit of a challenge, since it's hard for me to draw little kids without making them look like adults. So I just drew a BIG chair behind her to make an illusion of shortness. It worked and I think Natsumi is the most fun to draw. Also, I get how Aelita looks due to her description, but is Jeremie any different? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Now, on to XANA attacking Natsumi! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 16:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you gonna post them into your gallery? I wanna see! my gallery is <a href="http://britestarrobot.deviantart.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://britestarrobot.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I'll post them in my gallery! I can't think of anywhere else to put them. Your gallery is extremely cool, while mine is, sadly, extremely empty. That's mainly because I can't log in because of my stupid password. I filled out the form and they said I'd get an email in five minutes. An hour later it's still not there. Can you change your password once there, or do I now have to make a whole new account? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 18:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You could change your password. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>How? Is there a special key I hit or something? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 19:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah. Click the Lost Password link next to "Login". --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dd>That's what I did. DA said they would send me an email with my password, but I never got it. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 22:28, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Get a new account, then. *sad sigh* --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dd>I am very sad about all this as well Angie, particularly because I feel that this failure on my part makes me appear incompetent. At any rate, I'll use that much <i>easier</i> password you suggested. I suppose I can salvage my old username...From now on, at DA I will go by the name of <b>LyokoAddict Reborn.</b> I'll let you know as soon as that account gets up and you and Blueyedblonde can put me on your watchlists again. Some pictures should appear there in a few days (not tomorrow though. Tomorrow I'm in Boston for the day). I apologize profusely for all of this.
