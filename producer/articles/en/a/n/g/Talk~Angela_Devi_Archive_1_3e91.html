<h2><span class="mw-headline">Angela is not a natural model</span></h2>
<p>FYI: A quick look at her official site will produce evidence that she has had breast implants, since she herself refers to the fact. Therefore, I have reinserted the information to the article. -- <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 13:14, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The site says nothing about her implants. Post the exact link. -Scott</p>
<p>From her site (<a href="http://angeladevi.com/common/themes/angela2/x.asp?c=/newfindex.html&amp;hid=AD" class="external free" title="http://angeladevi.com/common/themes/angela2/x.asp?c=/newfindex.html&amp;hid=AD" rel="nofollow">http://angeladevi.com/common/themes/angela2/x.asp?c=/newfindex.html&amp;hid=AD</a>): "Reason for this is that you are about to see the first photo club of Angela in her new boobalicious boobies! That's right, what were large are now much larger! "</p>
<p>So clearly, if she was not surgically enhanced before (which I suspcet she was any way), she admits to it now -K</p>
<p>I'm not changing the page for now, but I can't find the line you quoted... Which exact photoset is this from? Also, Angela comments all the photosets on her site from a first-person perspective (since she's the one that writes them). The line you quoted is third-person. - Scott110 08:40, 3 February 2006</p>
<p>A quick look through the photosets would reveal that she does indeed comment on most of her sets herself, but not all (indeed not all are commented on at all). Also, if in doubt of her surgically improved assets, compare pictures from (<a href="http://angeladevi.com/common/themes/angela2/x.asp?afid=&amp;hid=AD&amp;t=i&amp;d=/clubs/club193" class="external free" title="http://angeladevi.com/common/themes/angela2/x.asp?afid=&amp;hid=AD&amp;t=i&amp;d=/clubs/club193" rel="nofollow">http://angeladevi.com/common/themes/angela2/x.asp?afid=&amp;hid=AD&amp;t=i&amp;d=/clubs/club193</a>) to the most recent photosets. -M</p>
<p>Hardly any concrete evidence... also you still haven't cited the exact photoset where you got the original line... - Scott110 8 February 2006</p>
<p>The photoset is Delicious Boobalicious</p>
<p>Anyone disputing her enhancement is delusional. She mentioned getting even bigger in the description on one of her video clubs and it was easy to see the difference. Also when she started.

<p>Does anyone know why her website is being removed and her photosets on Foxes are also removed? Regulus32 2 April 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't for certain, but since if you look at some of her most recent pictures, you will notice that the size of her breasts has reduced considerably. My best, fairly-well-educated guess is, she has removed her implants, and has taken down her site (or will by the end of April) because she wants to retire from modeling. Which is a great pity. -- <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 05:35, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nope, Re-did the page, Found out on her myspace this morning. Her agent did a statement. SO as it stands now, She is dead.</p>
<p>Why is there a statement stating the jews did it? I doubt she is there as there is no credible source online stating that fact. Looked for her myspace webpage and it doesnt exist as far as i know. Show her agents statement so we can know the truth.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please provide a link to a reputable source saying that the subject is dead. There are a couple of myspace pages belonging to people claiming to be her, but I cna't find any statement from an agent. Nor is there any entry in the subject's Google group, or anywhere else.

<p>She has passed away, and I'm obligated not explain the circumstances of her death. Of course you can't find any information about her or an obituary because her real name obviously isn't "Devi", and the obituary isn't out yet. How many eastern indians have the last name "Devi, wife of Shiva"? Regarding the myspace page - That is a fake pretending to be her. Angela's personal web site does not mention anything about it because her family would preferably like to keep the matter under wraps and didn't even know she had the career she had until her sudden departure. Speculate all you want, but those who knew her as a friend will miss her dearly. -N/A 15:00, 4 April 2006 (MST)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately for you, Angela herself made a statement on April 1st, announcing the shutting down of her website. See below. -<a href="../../../e/l/p/User%7EElp_gr_edf7.html" title="User:Elp gr">Elp gr</a> 22:41, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's more unfortunate for you that you think that statement was written by her. When you find out the truth you are going to feel pretty dumb. You might not ever realize this, but there are many people on the internet pretending to be her. -N/A 16:01, 4 April 2006 (MST)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism</span></h2>
<p>A number of "users" keep vandalizing these pages by posting obscenities. This leads me to believe that Angela Devi isn't actually dead; instead, I think there are two likely events: 1. Angela had an acrimonious falling out with Foxes.com, which led to all this (this, however, seems highly unlikely) 2. There is some sort of a practical joke going on, which either started after a probable termination of Angela's contract, or the Foxes.com website concerning ms. Devi was hacked. Had Devi's personal website been shut down due to her alleged death, the announcement on the frontpage would have been completely different. -<a href="../../../e/l/p/User%7EElp_gr_edf7.html" title="User:Elp gr">Elp gr</a> 20:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>She's saying the following:</p>
<p>I am saddened to say that my website www.angeladevi.com is no longer available for public viewing with exception to members who want to spend the next month downloading all of the pictures from the clubs they have purchased.</p>
<p>Due to a combination of different opinions and beliefs with Foxes and my desire to finally move on with my "real" life that I had always dreamed about, we have decided to call it quits in regards to my website.</p>
<p>I encourage all members who have purchased clubs to download all of the pictures because the site will be taken offline indefinitely on April 30th of this year.</p>
<p>I really want to thank you all for the support over the years. Everyone at Free Ones has been great to me from Day 1. I'll be spending more time here now and will keep in touch with you all.</p>
<p>Thanks and I love you all.</p>
<p>XOXO Angela Devi</p>

<p>In simple words: No, Angela Devi did NOT die. Yes, the death announcement was a fake; a joke of particularly poor taste. As for the vandalism that has been going on here... Heh. -<a href="../../../e/l/p/User%7EElp_gr_edf7.html" title="User:Elp gr">Elp gr</a> 22:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In even more simple words: The above statement is someone obviously doing a very poor job at pretending to be Angela. Why don't you contact the person who wrote the statement and tell them to give it up. -N/A 16:05, 4 April 2006 (MST)</dd>

<dd>You lose at your own game. The moderators of the FreeOnes.com bulletin board do authenticate and verify the messages posted by the various models, so we know that, if something is posted under the username of a model (in this case, Angela Devi), it's her and not someone posing as her. Besides: 1. There are NO NEWS of an Angela Devi Tracy having been found dead. Nada. Zip. 2. Angela Devi, BEFORE rumors of her death started spreading, announced that her website was closing due to differences with Foxes.com (an elegant way of saying "we could no longer cooperate normally"). And the webpage MYSTERIOUSLY "acquired" the death announcement about an hour or so ago... AFTER we've been pointed to Angela's original thread on FreeOnes.com (and, FYI, she's posted even today) and people started to pay no attention to the rumors of her passing away.

yo this is crazy somebody needs to get to the bottom of this....the great death(alleged) of angela devi and the mystery that followed next on court tv</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"From Angela's photographer and webmaster: To all of Angela's fans and Internet friends. I am so very sad to say that Angela has passed away. I don't wish to go into details at this time.</p>
<p>I photographed Angela for over seven years -- first on Foxes and then for her web site. She was much more than just a model to me -- she was a true and kind friend. Angela would call me almost every day to say hello to see how I was doing. She helped me on almost all of my photo shoots -- never asking for pay -- just wanted to help. She wouldn't let anyone else do this either. When another model would offer, Angela would make sure that I only brought her instead.</p>
<p>Angela told me that she was proud of her web site. You, her fans, helped Angela over the years with your support. I miss Angela very much and it is very difficult to even talk about her passing. I will never forget my good friend, Angela.</p>
<p>Please ignore any rumors you might see on other web sites about Angela. I have not posted anything on any web site other than here. If you see posts by individuals claiming to be Angela, agents of Angela, and etc., these posts are very likely posts of sick people wishing some kind of attention. Our good friend, Angela Devi, has passed away -- may she rest in peace.</p>
<p>All ordering and general viewing on the AngelaDevi.com web site is no longer possible. Only members who have ordered photo clubs in the past may access the photo clubs they have ordered. Members have until April 30, 2006 to view and download the photo clubs they have paid for. After this date the AngelaDevi.com web site will be removed from the Internet." April 4 2006 - 22:49PST</p>
<p>Sorry but without definitive proof i just cant believe that she passed away. If she has passed away then there are certain people who are using her account at freeones.com to post bogus messages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What is the website that the text above came from? What is the name of the photographer who wrote it? Until we get some verifiable proof we cannot include the assertion that she died. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 06:26, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Dutch Angela Fan, April 5 - That text came from AngelaDevi.com. It was also emailed to me by Foxes.com when I made an inquiry about Angela the day before that text appeared. But to make things more mysterious, that text disappeared again today. Now only the statement that the site is going to close end of the month remains.</p>

 ANGELA DEVI-04/05/2006
</pre>
<pre>
 I have emailed Woody who is the photographer and owner
 of foxes.com and I can only pray he responds. Woody has
 responded to my email and my questions concerning Angela
 Devi, and to my surprise he did respond. I pray I'm dreaming
 about Angela been found dead. He created AngelaDevi.com along
 with Angela. Angela was his first model to have her own web-
 site with foxes. To me Angela made foxes.com what it is today.
 You have to work your butt off in the modeling business and
 Angela dam sure did that. Angela has the beautiful looks and
 a body that I wish I had. Somehow I to have searched and called
 around the Scotsdale,AZ media( Angela grew up in Phoenix)but 
 lived in Scotsdale, AZ. Angela is her first name-Devi is her
 middle name we never have ever heard what her last name is. 
 Her trademark is "Angela Devi" Angela did her photo shoot
 for march-2006 which was "Private Nurse"if she has truly died
 then I suspect "foul play" To read Angela Devi was found dead
 in her residence/apartment would mean a police investigation
 and her body would be with a medical examiner for autopsy.If
 this is true-then I feel for Angela Parents and siblings.But
 not knowing if her death is real is crazy. I asked Woody to
 please shine the light on what happend to Angela because it
 is the money of her fans that made Angela Divi who she is.I
 met her twice, and I love her style and her charm,Angela is
 very funny and a joker of laughs, and even more beautiful in
 person.I can only pray along with the rest of you that maybe
 her death is not true( god I hope so)but until I hear from
 Woody or find some true facts I will hold my breath.
</pre>
<pre>
 I will keep Woody personal email address private and hope
 he will respond to my email.I believe Woody to be an honest
 man. Angela pictures aren't on foxes.com only her photo to
 foxes main entrance shows. I think a tribute to Angela should
 be made if Angela truly is no longer on earth,and Woody/foxes
 should have a tribute page to the woman that put foxes on the
 map.
</pre>
<pre>
 Let me tell you this Angela,Myself, and Woody all talked
 about internet sites that use Angela name or claim to be
 her on their webpages.This was just a year ago.Woody wanted
 to sue alot of the sites known to be fake and using Angela
 name and so called writings. I remember Angela stating that
 she would never share her personal business with any website
 other than hers,and the fact that rumor mill always has printed
 that she was leaving foxes and hated working for Woody-that is
 why I don't belive Angela would post anything on this site or
 other sites. I saw back then what she was going through,so
 I just don't believe she would post anything here.
</pre>
<pre>
 I hope Woody will respond. I lost sleep last night after
 seeing her website and what was written on it. It hurt me
 to my heart and soul. I have called and have tried to find
 more light on this but I can't get any answers,from News
 media sources in the Scotsdale area and Phoenix area.
 Angela parents are indian and so am I. Our buriel cultures
 are very different and I wouldn't be surprised if Angela is
 really deceased that her body be sent back to India for---
 creamation. Normaly the body is burned right after death occurs.
 So I'm not looking for an obituary,but then again her family
 may give Angela an american buriel. My tears have not stop
 flowing-as I pray Angela is alive and well.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Investigation by FreeOnes.com forum moderator</span></h2>
<p>One of the moderators of the FreeOnes.com moderators, eddie62 decided to look into this matter after the controversy here with N/A. N/A provided the forum moderator with Angela's real name (it seems that it is <i>not</i> Angela Devi or Angela Tracy - those seem to be stage names) and eddie62 contacted the company that owns Foxes.com: <a href="http://board.freeones.com/forumdisplay.php?f=5" class="external text" title="http://board.freeones.com/forumdisplay.php?f=5" rel="nofollow">FreeOnes.com thread regarding the whole issue</a>. The company confirmed Angela's passing. Now, why were we led to be wary of people posting that she died here on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>1. Anonymous/unregistered posters.</p>
<p>2. The entry had been vandalized (some people even found the opportunity to post obscenities about Angela).</p>
<p>3. There were postings both before <i>and</i> after March 30, by a FreeOnes.com forum account that belonged to Angela Devi and was among the ones that were <i>confirmed</i> as legit and not fake. Who was using it after March 30?</p>
<p>Anyhow, I want to say that someone's death is <i>NOT</i> something people should be playing with. Knowingly spreading false rumors that someone did or did not die is among the lamest things I know of. After the dust settles, I'll update the entry accordingly. -<a href="../../../e/l/p/User%7EElp_gr_edf7.html" title="User:Elp gr">Elp gr</a> 01:53, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to add to this. I agree entirely that we need to wait for some concrete evidence of Angela's passing. However, for what it's worth I received the following email from 'Joe' at Softwood.com after I emailed foxes to ask what was going on with Angela's website. Here is the text of the message:</p>
<p>== <i>From AngelaDevi.com Webmaster</i></p>
<p><i>To all of Angela's fans and Internet friends. We are so very sad to say that on March 30, 2006 Angela passed away. Our prayers go to her. We do not wish to go into details about Angela's passing. We miss Angela very much -- she was a wonderful friend</i>.</p>
<p><i>Please ignore any rumors you might see on other web sites about Angela. We have not posted anything on any web site other than right here. If you see posts by people claiming to be Angela, agents of Angela, friends of Angela, etc., these posts are very likely posts of sick people wishing some kind of attention. Our good friend, Angela Devi, has passed away -- may she rest in peace.</i> ==</p>
<p>However, somehow I just have a weird feeling about this. Like most of you, I would have expected some sort of official statement by now. If she really died on 30 March, it's been a week now. Guess we'll find out the truth eventually. Vortex44</p>

Yes it really sounds strange,because if she was found dead
in her apartment the police would still have to be called,
even if the person died of natural causes along with paramedics.
I don't know how popular Angela is in her personal life,but
in Scotsdale,AZ and Phoenix, AZ New's Media no one had a
clue as to who she was or is. Only one person heard her name
but no info on her death or if she is dead. So I guess only
time will tell. I hope in my heart she is truly alive, and
if not then who or what took her life, and why if she is
deceased why her family will not disclose what happend,because
they "DID KNOW" about her website and what type of work she
did. I hope and pray that closure for her fans and friends
will come soon. I don't consider myself her fan-I consider
myself her friend and it was a pleasure to meet her and talk
to her in person along with Woody. For now I have tried every
thing. I too will just have to wait and pray that "WHAT IS IN
THE DARK-SHALL COME TO THE LIGHT"!!

<p>So has anyone got any more info about Angela. Not trying to speculate, but something just doesn't fit right here. Foxes is behaving as if nothing has happened. Lucia Tovar (One of Angelas Friends) has a special sale on her website, as if life is completely normal. Surely if our beloved Angela had just died you would expect some kind of reaction. It's been 9 days now. Any info anyone? 'Vortex44'.</p>

<dd>I agree with Vortex44 - I would expect the people at Foxes.com to post even just a few words on their website.

<p>I dont get it. Why would her photographer post the message on her website that she had died and then remove all of it other than the fact that her site is closing less than a day later? At a minimum he should have said that due to her passing her website is being closed. To just pull the entire statement is totally irresponsible. His credibility just goes completely out the window by doing this. If she is indeed dead he has disrespected her, all of her fans, and his customer base by playing games like this. If she's not dead then this is the worst attempt at backing out of the industry that Ive ever seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My best guess is it was removed because of the nonsense and speculation being spouted by some people on here, Freeones and other sites. So much for facts. The webmaster/photographer of Foxes posted what I considered to be a heartfelt, sincere notice to Angela's fans. Yet this one single post spawned all sorts of speculation questioning Foxes' integrity/motives, Angela's passing, and even such ridiculous unfounded allegations as Foxes trying to defame Angela. As has been been mentioned, this is an encyclopedia -- not a rumor mill for conspiracy theorists to further their gossip agenda. In my opinion, I suspect that Foxes removed the notice they posted simply because the web pollution of speculative posts from the above-mentioned conspiracy theorists is what truly was/is disrespecting Angela's memory. Take that for what it's worth. And no, before some of you claim otherwise, I am not an employee of the company. - RP</dd>

<p>It's been confirmed that "Angela Devi" and "Angela Tracy" were her stage names. Its possible that "Angela Devi" has passed on, however the person still lives and is pursuing other things WITHOUT the Internet.</p>
<p>Wherever and whomever you <i>really</i> are, I wish you the best in life, and death.</p>
<hr />
<p>That closed FreeOnes-posting has been mentioned and discussed already many days ago, just read this page. This is a really strange case. If Angela -whatever her real name- died, then why is there no statement on Foxes.com? Why has the 'death part' of the statement AngelaDevi.com been cut out shortly after its release? This only *feeds* speculation, it doesn't stop speculation as Will suggests. I think fans and customers have the right to know what happened to their idol / supplier of the product 'Angela'. Those people liked her or at least gave her an income. How can you just leave those people with questions? How can friend Lucia Tovar go on like nothing happened? If Angela *is* alive, which I truly hope but not expect anymore, why is there no reaction from her to stop all the speculations? The only thing I can think of (yes, speculation, but the people who know the truth can stop that easily if they don't like it) in the case she's alive, is that this is a plan to step out of the modeling business. But it would be with so much disrespect for the fans. Although I only know her from the site and the chat sessions, I can not imagine her being like that. Death is too serious to lie about. It's even too serious to keep silent about. - Dutch AngelaFan, April 12th</p>

<p>I have now received a second email from 'Joe' at softwood.com. It reads as follows:</p>
<p><i>Sorry we had already made an announcement on AngelaDevi.com and were accused by many for starting rumors about Angela because of failed business arrangements.</i></p>

<p>I hate to say it, but I have a horrible feeling that Angela really has passed on. Personally I had great admiration for Angela and I feel I have lost a friend. Sure would like to know the truth! Vortex44</p>
<dl>
<dd>From where I sit, you have clearly been given their thoughts and confirmation on Angela's passing. It's entirely up to you if you wish to believe them or not. You asked -- the person named Joe confirmed this for you. But I for one certainly do not fault them for yanking their notice (which very clearly sounded full of grief and was tough to even post for them) to avoid the nonsense that followed upon their posting it. People seem to forget that Angela was obviously their friend too, and they too should be entitled to grieve without the utter rubbish they received. As such, I'm betting that being accepted, or proving anything, to a bunch of oversexed teenagers and one handed typists at places like Freeones (if not teenagers, many sure sound like they are) making false accusations about them -- and disrespecting Angela's memory in the process -- isn't exactly on top of their priority list. I know it would not be on top of mine, that's for sure. ETA: Vortex: the above was not in any way meant as a direct post towards you. It is merely an observation, and my opinion, as to what led to the removal of the Foxes notice. Simply put, I can see their point.</dd>

<p>Point taken! Thanks. Guess I should consider myself lucky they replied to my enquiry. Amended. Vortex44</p>

Guys, She's definately gone. She was found by her best friend on the morning of April 2nd 2006 in her garage. Apparently she committed suicide by hanging although there has been nothing official in the local press as yet. I for one miss her already.</p>

<dd>The problem with this entire talk page is, most of the people saying that Angela Devi is dead are anonymous posters, which doesn't really help matters. Also, we may be confusing what is meant by the word "dead" in this case. Perhaps, it means that the real woman who was going under the stagename of "Angela Devi" is really, physically, medically dead -- or it means that the <i>character</i> who was going by the stagename "Angela Devi" is no longer in existence ("dead to the world"). I for one would like to get to bottom of this whole thing, since Angela was one of my favorite models. I was pleased when she got her own spinoff site from Foxes.com, and she thoroughly deserved it. -- <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 09:49, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im sorry but i for one dont believe she would commit suicide and you also have the dates of her death not lining up. One source says March 30th and another states April 2nd. Wow this has the makings of a full blown conspiracy. I would like further proof as to the allegation of a suicide. She seems like the type of person who wouldnt do that sort of thing. This really bothers and troubles me alot.</p>
<p><br />
For what it's worth mentioning, Foxes has now replaced Angela's picture on its Home Page with another model. Looks like they're coming pretty close, if not all together, of eradicating her presence on their Web Server.</p>
<p>As Will said, it is unlikely we will ever hear the official word. For me, this is a living nightmare come true (see one of my other posts).</p>
<p>I'm so sad about this ... I know I should believe that Angela is happier now and vest my faith in this, but guys ... this hurts something really bad ...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moving forward</span></h2>
<p>I sat down to write that this may be an unverifiable situation. But instead I sent an email to the webmaster. Though practically anyone can hack a page to put up a false notice, few hackers would bother to respond to an email. I asked about the rumor and quickly got a response from the webmaster at SoftWood.com, who asked me not to use his name. The webmaster denied that there is any hoax, and re-affirmed that the subject died on March 30, 2006.</p>
<p>I think it may be unlikely that we will ever see a newspaper report on this. If all the details of the stories are true, the family may wish to have no publicity about the matter. Given the entirety of the situation, I think that the proper way to proceed is to note that Angela Devi died in 2006, and to also attribute this information to her webmaster.</p>
<p>This is an encyclopedia, not a newspaper. We don't try to "scoop" anyone. It is more important that we are accurate than timely. Nonetheless, I am convinced that there is sufficient information about this matter to move forward with noting her passing, despite the lack of what we regard as reliable, verifiable sources.</p>
<p>Lastly, let me note that I am not a fan of the Angela Devi. This page ended up on my watchlist because I fixed some vandalism that had spread across a couple of articles. However, from what the fans here and elsewhere say she apparently had an appealing personality that is already missed. Her death at a young age is a tragedy. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 07:31, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Will, I know you are looking for closure on this, as this is an Enyclopedia ... but I beg that you please allow this to be posted in the Angela Devi Discussion, as it comes from my heart ... and it truly allows closure for me. Maybe I might say something that someone else wants to say as well.</p>
<p>First of all Will, thanks for your due dilligence. Your efforts are appreciated. I've been holding off forever on commenting here. This has been such a tortuous 2 weeks.</p>
<p><br />
If sometimes a few of us, seemed a little too un-willing to accept what seems now to be the truth, please understand. We kept hitting on this issue, because "WE" are broken to pieces about what happened. (by the way, I'm a little in tears as I write this). And to be honest, there aren't a whole lot of places out there on the Web, that will host an intelligent, professional forum with which to discuss this very tragic, painful event concerning Angela. We appreciate the haven that the Encyclopedia has provided. I mean that Will; thanks!!</p>
<p>There are a few of us out there that are still in literal shock, horror, disbelief, denial and general disarray. No, we're not family with Angela, like as in blood, but that in no way makes less the BIG TIME PAIN we feel. When the girl of many a man's dreams, is suddenly sucked away, in such a HORRIBLE WAY, accopmanied in a dizzying cocktail of confusion, what else can be expected???</p>
<p>Will, you are right when you say "she had an appealing personality" ... she constituted the stuff that makes up a young man's dreams. She was the girl, that could make every day, a better day, just by the will of her magnetic wit, smile and charm (yes, that lovely smile!!). For me, she had an an amazing impact, let me tell you: She had alot to do with me pulling out of a deep personal funk that I was in a couple of years ago. She made me belive that indeed every new day, is a better day. I KID YOU NOT!!</p>
<p>And she will always have a positive impact on me, for I will never, ever forget her. I always wondered if Angela knew the positive impacts she had on people. Angela, I tell you: Your life was not in vain!!</p>
<p>But, it's indeed a sad irony, that when I first became aware of her and was coming out of my funk, I was singing to myself that song Alive Again by the Jazz/Rock group Chicago. Now, 2.5 years later, and Angela is not with us.</p>
<p>I cried tears back then in shedding my pain ...</p>
<p>Now, I cry tears again ...</p>
<p>If anybody knows anything about that song, then you might know what I mean. I EMailed one of the angeladevi.com EMail addresses, to mention that I didn't like the photo shoot she did with the gun, especially the freebie pciture. I wasn't one of those to complain about the usages of guns, rather I just mentioned that the freebie picture scared me badly. In the EMail, I mentioned that "long live Eric Clapton, Terry Kath, and LONG LIVE Angela Devi". I also expressed how that freebie photo was my worst nightmare.</p>
<p>I didn't know to EMail Softwood.com, so I don't know if anyone read it.</p>
<p>Oh my god!!</p>
<p>Angela??</p>
<p>She just wanted to have 2 kids, to be a loving mom, wife ... to be a CPA ... and that she loved to talk, to laugh ... to talk with anyone who was different, no matter whom it was ... to help others .. to eat healthy, work out, connect the mind, body and soul ... to just live and love life ... along with a few cookies here and there ... in a nut-shell ...</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>We all miss you Angela ... we're so sorry you were in so much pain that you couldn't continue on ... if any of us had known,</p>
<p>we would have helped you dear, we would have!!! Know that ... you helped me so much!!</p>
<p>We miss you very, very much .... and we all love you very much!! We mean that!!</p>
<p>How we wish we could hear you laugh and smile again!!</p>
<p>This hurts so bad ... God it hurts ... this will hurt, for a long, long time ...</p>
<p>God please bless our little Angel, named Angela ... she was the best!!</p>
<p>We all pray for her very deeply!!</p>
<p>Oh my Lord, my Dear Lord ... omg!! On this Good Friday, of 2006!!</p>

Well stated. I couldn't agree more with the sentiments voiced above. I too have been holding out in expressing my own feelings and impressions about this tragic situation. In fact, I have NEVER posted at any website on any subject before and just can't get over how this has affected me. My gut told me early on that this story was true, but like many admirers I wanted to hold on to some hope. I've been scouring the internet for days now (minus e-mailing faceless unknown individuals) and while there hasn't been any "official" documentation, my personal feeling is that Angela is gone. I truly hope that reliable information can at some point be relayed, preferably at a site such as this, because I personally still feel a need to know what happened. I thank the webmasters of Wikipedia for their dilligence and any continued efforts in clarifying the facts. Aside from echoing the sadness and sense of loss stated above I would just like to say that for me, Angela's personality seemed to magically transcend the photographic image and I won't ever forget the genuine warmth and inner beauty captured in her smile. Sincerest condolences to family and friends. Angela, you will truly be missed.14:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Since I signed up above as in "In Tears", maybe I should just go by that as a moniker ... because in reality, the rest of my life I will from time to time be shedding a tear for Angela. There's no doubt about that. I just won't be able to forget her. She had an ultimate impact on you, me and many others. Dare I say (me being the music lover I am), that to Clapton what Hendrix's and Duane Allman's passings were, Angela is to me???</p>
<p>Anyways. my friend, thanks for sharing in your words, what easily could summarize my thoughts and feelings. If my posting was cause for yours, then I am honored to have done so. You sound like the intelligent, thoughtful fan, that I bet Angela would have cherished.</p>
<p>Like you, I'd like to see a hard statement about Angela, but it would be selfish and naive of me to expect that this will filter out in any concrete way any time soon, maybe never. Let's think about it: If we're that distraught ourselves, then what to expect of her closest associates, friends and family members?? They need time and space magnitude orders over us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we're feeling it too friend ...no one can say we're not. Not more than an hour passes when I don't think about her.</p>
<p>She was just that special ... period.</p>
<p>Little Angela ...</p>

 Angela Devi 04/14/2006
</pre>
<pre>
 Woody never has a problem with stating that he is
 the webmater of AngelaDevi.com and never let anyone
 send any emails concerning Angela Devi. Woody is the
 only webmaster of Angela Devi and does not allow for
 others to speak for him and his company/business-Foxes.
 So once again let's just leave it alone and allow time
 to try to begin to heal alot of broken hearts and disbelief.
 I myself cannot say that I knew Angela on a very personal
 level,but I can truly talk about Woody and foxes.com but
 I will leave it alone. I wish her passing was known
 only because it may help someone else. Angela was and
 will always be a beautiful woman,but in my own opinion
 her real life was no fairytale. I think her death and yes
 she is gone. I heard from Payton who is now a former foxes
 model. Payton was and will always be Angela best friend.She
 is the best friend that found Angela deceased.Foxes models
 have a good chance of being sued by Angela family and fired
 by Foxes if they make any statements surrounding how Angela
 died. Woody is having a very hard time dealing with Angela
 death that I do believe. But Angela did her photo spread
 for April and I wonder if at anytime he will release them.

 Rest In Peace Angela Until We See You
 Again!! Free! I am Free! No Longer
 Bound! No More Chains Holding Me!
 It's Just A Blessing!!!!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reworking of Article</span></h2>
<p>I have tried to rework the article to incorporate all known facts and opinions surrounding the issue of whether or not Angela Devi is truly dead. The one thing that we know for sure is that she has retired from modeling, and her website will no longer exist come April 30, 2006. I personally cannot come to a final conclusion on whether she truly is dead or not, so I tried my best to leave the article as agnostic and as open-ended as I could. I shall continue to monitor developments and revise the article accordingly. I hope I can count on my fellow Wikipedians not to go medieval on this article's ass&#160;:) Thank you for your maturity and forebearance at this difficult and confusing time for all fans of this lovely woman. -- <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 07:54, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand that this matter isn't clear at all, and if there is not a consensus on tihs we can remove the fact of her death.

<dd>I'm sorry, but you are going to have to explain to me why original research cannot be included in an encyclopaedia, which is supposed to be a comprehensive collection of information and knowledge? That attitude is confusing to me. Are you expressing your own personal opinion on this matter, Will, or is this some sort of unwritten rule that you are enforcing? Or is it Official Wikipedia Policy? An explanation by someone who knows would be gratefully accepted. (And, by the way, I know of no other place where this sort of information would really be appropriate, or even generate this sort of interest.)

<p>I agree with Jalabi99, I thought the whole idea of this encyclopedia was for all to put in what research they have done and what facts they have to offer. Agreed, no speculation, but it would not hurt to hear peoples efforts at trying to uncover the truth behind this mystery. And it is a mystery!

<p>I haven't found anything reliable to suggest whether or not Angela Devi (or the person behind that stage name) is still alive or not. It's been three weeks since she apparently died and yet no reliable news source has noted her death? The notice of her death (and then its removal) strikes me as very odd. Her real name is Angela Dhingra she live in North Scottdale Arizona.</p>

<p>If you look very closely at the postings made by Angela Devi at Freeones it seems that Angela was posting a lot of messages on the board after her alleged death on 03/30/2006, some even show that she was posting at 12:24AM, on 04/03/2006. If someone was using her account to make these posts, then they went to great lengths to try to act like her, you would figure that if it was an impostor using her account, that they would post simply one message about the end of Angeladevi.com and then leave it at that, why would this impostor then make comments about hockey teams and their favorite beer, etc...?

<p>Something I do want to mention ... know that it's fairly well documented that her MySpace Account was hacked. She herself mentioned this, correct?</p>
<p>Anyways, is the following a sign of a hack?? The text on the MySpace page says that she moved out to Arizona for Financial, Scholastic exigencies. One would get a sense from the wording, that she had moved more recently to AZ from NY, than what her page (angeladevi.com:about??) always stated or implied?? Which was to the effect of 17 years or so?? Someone remember this better than I?? Knowing me, I'm sure I've loused it up ... someone help out please.

<p>As I've said before, we may never have reliable sources for the fate of Ms. Devi. Whether the person or just the personna died is difficult to establish. I think that as an encyclopedia we want to have as little information here as possible. That may seem contradictory, but our most important mission is verifiability. There is isn't much that is verifiable about this subject using reliable sources.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Here's what I can work out</span></h2>
<p>There is something fishy going on.</p>
<p>Here's what I can work out.</p>
<p>The Angela Devi that posted on freeones.com is either:</p>
<p><br />
a) The real Angela Devi, or</p>
<p>b) Someone from Softwood, simply promoting the Angela Devi persona</p>
<p><br />
This person seemed, from the threads, to know lots about when new picture sets would be out and so on so I think it isn't anyone else being malicious but either a) or b).</p>
<p>Come on, have you heard her speak on one of her vids? Does that sound like a girl that could talk online and in depth on Hockey and Beer? It is important to not believe the hype on what the internet says the girl is like. I personally don't beleive she was studying. I mean, every male in the class would fail their exams! And girls in pictures can't always be 21 years old all the time. But anyway, I suppose it *could* still be her over there on freeones.com.</p>
<p>I've noticed that over time on the freeones board, "she" has dropped the association with www.foxes.com in her sig and only has www.angeladevi.com in her sig.</p>
<p>I reckon the model had a fallout with foxes.com (or to be more correct, Softwood Inc.). She may only have agreed to do shoots for www.angeladevi.com but not for www.foxes.com.</p>
<p>This indication (of the dropped portion of the sig) (from about 15th Feb 2006) could be the start of a wind down for Angela. This could be where she winds down her association with Softwood. She winds down her association with foxes.com and plans at this point to wind down her involvement with angeladevi.com.</p>
<p>Various plans are drawn up at Softwood Inc - btw, did you know that before glamour porn, Softwood used to write software for the Amiga? When the Amiga started to wane, they had a go at writing software for the PC.</p>
<p>Anyway, various plans are drawn up at Softwood on how to wind down the angeladevi.com website. With the "fallout", it is clear that Softwood own the www.angeladevi.com domain and business and would not give it up. Angela has decided that she has made enough money out of the business and wants to perhaps return to a normal life.</p>
<p><br />
I believe that two ideas were floating around at Softwood:</p>
<p>a) Have Angela wind it down saying that she wanted to move on and "follow her dreams"</p>
<p>b) Make out she died. After all, Angela Devi is fictitious and the character belonged to Softwood, so why couldn't they?</p>
<p><br />
The next thing that happened was a complete cock-up - both ideas somehow got executed at the same time. This kind of stuff can happen in businesses.</p>
<p>It happened and now Softwood Inc, having accidentally published it [her death] on the angeladevi.com website have had to backtrack with another story posted here <a href="http://board.freeones.com/showthread.php?t=71947" class="external free" title="http://board.freeones.com/showthread.php?t=71947" rel="nofollow">http://board.freeones.com/showthread.php?t=71947</a> where the Angela Devi login was used by someone else <b>after</b> her "death". And in this thread, the login is used by someone else again trying to spin a coverup yarn.</p>
<p>Softwood must have actually been hoping that this story will be accepted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile they carry on with plan a), which continues:</p>
<p><br />
1) Have Angela wind it down saying that she wanted to move on and "follow her dreams"</p>
<p>2) Close access to new joiners and browsers to www.angeladevi.com</p>
<p>3) Allow members 30 days to finish downloading</p>
<p>4) Remove all pictures of "Angela Devi" from Foxes.com</p>
<p>5) Remove domain from the Internet.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>These all sound like steps of some agreement between "Angela" and Softwood, to remove all images of her from the Internet.</p>
<p>So guess what, I don't think she is dead.</p>
<p>I don't buy assertions that out of respect for the family, they can't reveal any details of her and how she "died". They never respected her family when they put up and maintained the website for so long.</p>
<p>Angela Devi has been a successful business where a disagreement, or an agreement, has caused the business to be wound up. They just cocked up on how they would do it, given the soap-opera emotions they knew that we would have with the girl.</p>
<p>Angela Devi is dead. But I don't think the model is. You can come out now.</p>

Well ... in response to the gentleman above who is questioning whether it is reasonable to believe that Anglea could (have been) be a serious hockey fan, I would mention that in one of her videos, "Posing Practice", her voice was punctuated with emotion when talking of the 2001 World Series between the Diamondbacks and the Yankees. It was just a little "aside" comment she had mentioned in the video. Furthermore, I do remember in several of the written text(s) accompanying several of her videos, her alluding to sporting events of one type or another.</p>
<p>Who knows?? I guess on a casual level, that you'd think a girl of her stature, background might not know much about hockey. After all, hockey here in the States, especially in Arizona, is not exactly the hippest sport around .... I say that with much chagrin though, as I myself am an avid player of the sport. On the other hand, Angela seemed like the enthusiastic type, who could easily get behind a team, regardless of the sport. Conjecture on my part?? Yes, but it seemed that way to me ....</p>
<p>Concerning her studies, well now ... I would venture that if Angela was (is) studying to be an Accountant like she said she was, then you'd expcect that she did (does) dress fairly conservatively for class, right??!! Wouldn't you think so?? In fact, I do remember a Photo Shoot she did "Wild Thing" (I believe that was the title) in which she mentioned how she played out 2 vastly different themes in her life. One, the theme on her Web Site, the other, the Conservatively dressed, studious type, in the school computer lab, library etc ... The only thing I do wonder about is, with her picture in so many different places on the Web that many a young man may frequent, didn't any of her classmates notice that the girl in his class looks "very" similar to the girl he saw at Web Site so and so?? Now that I'm thinking about it ... this is just one more example that surely leads one to conclude that "Angela Devi" probablly wasn't her real name, for if she was to use that as her name in class??? ... just think about that!! Wouldn't that have made for some interesting moments?? "Ha, Ha", as Angela would often say! (a little levity here folks).</p>
<p>Lastly, again it's conjecture on my part, but at least to me, it seemed like Angela's personality was well suited to be an Accountant. Just a thought ...</p>
<p>On a personal note, it's still very disheartening to not have heard a more emphatic, public statement from those in the know. The pullback on her former Web Site was/is NOT very assuring, and thus I wouldn't necessarily fault anyone who believes she is still alive. I do have a real problem though envisioning that Angela (Shinali??) would actually have followed through on a big scam on her supposed death. <i><b>If there is a cover-up</b></i>, then I believe that it was portrayed not by her, but by her associates, because of some things beyond her control. I don't believe she's that type of person. That would be a God awful thing to do. I still believe she's (was) a wonderful person.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I've done some general rewording and cleanup on the article in an effort to get it looking a bit more encyclopedic. Among other things, I removed the reference to the "Angela Tracy" alias since I was unable to find any evidence of it. The only other place (besides sites that copied the Wikipedia entry) that I could find that mentioned the alias was IMDB, but it didn't have any further information. It's possible that even that reference originally came from here. I also removed the claim that the name "Angela Devi" is derived from her first and middle names. It doesn't seem that anyone is entirely sure what her real name is. Constructive criticism is always appreciated. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadratic_e732.html" title="User:Quadratic">quadratic</a> 04:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm the one who added the Angela Tracy alias. She used it in low budget flick called "3 Strikes". You can find that on www.imdb.com. And I can also verify this because I saw the film a couple years back and saw her, but wasn't sure because of the different name listed. <a href="../../../s/i/a/User%7ESiamus_3923.html" title="User:Siamus">siamus</a> 10:40, 4 May 2006 (EST)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Conversations with a porn star about love, sex, life and death...</span></h2>
<p>For the record... a personal insight into the "real" Angela Devi... I can go either way on the subject of whether or not the girl who called herself Angela Devi is alive or not but I have some information to share that should clear up some misconceptions (but may also raise new questions). Having known Angela for several years (she tried to get me to call her Shanali, but I never could get the hang of it) I certainly wouldn't put it past her to have faked a "death announcement" to facilitate the removal of her web site and her return to private life. On the other hand, there was a sadness in her I could see had the potential of pushing her over the edge if she lost someone very close to her or if she found herself in a very desperate situation. I don't know for certain. If she's dead then I feel OK about adding my own knowledge of this rather special girl for the record. If she's alive and well and living a new life then I'm sure she won't mind me giving out these details because that means she's hopefully living out her dreams (of true love and motherhood).</p>
<p>The details I add here are based on what I gathered during countless phone conversations with Angela over a period of about five or six years. We never actually met. We found each other, believe it or not, on a singles web site. Of course, at first I was very skeptical that it was really Angela. I thought it was just some girl using her pictures. After we exchanged email addresses she just kept sending me pictures from her web site. Hundreds of them. Day after day. Still unconvinced that it was really Angela I stated my doubts in a couple of emails. Angela's response was to ask for my phone number! Our phone conversations began and the person on the other end of the phone grabbed my attention - much more so than the images of the naked woman that supposedly were her. Whoever it was on the other end of the line, I didn't care. If this was a girl pretending to be a porn star it soon became unimportant. Yes, "Angela" would mention sexual things but that wasn't the main part of the conversation. That was in passing only. The main topic was relationships. We were developing a strange kind of friendship. Angela maintained that the photos she sent were really her and after some time my doubts subsided a little. Never once did she ask me to join the AngelaDevi.com site, which I half anticipated was the initial reason she contacted me IF she was indeed the real girl. We talked regularly and we kept each other up to date on each other's lives. I got to know that she was born in New York, lived for a while in Arizona and now lived in Maryland. She travelled extensively to shoot for her web site, often to Arizona. I had a sneaking suspicion that she was confused by the fact that I never expressed much interest in seeing her web site. Angela regularly sent me new pictures in any case. Then one day she was so proud of one video that she'd made that she wanted me to watch it. I thought she would at last ask me to join, but no... she sent me her own personal username and password to access the site so I could view it. This was what convinced me that it was the real Angela Devi who I'd been communicating with. The person on the phone was definitely the same, crazy, loud, bubbly girl on the video. Angela's mannerisms, laughter, favorite cheeky words and mode of speech are very distinct. I would say, impossible to fake. Anyone who has seen an Angela Devi video will probably agree.</p>
<p>The one opportunity Angela and I had to meet was in Hollywood in 2003 I think it was. She called me on my cell phone to say she was in town and on the Sunset Strip with some friends. I was already out there drinking with a friend myself but I had plans to meet up with another girl that evening so I couldn't meet up with Angela. She held that over my head for ages after that, alluding to the idea that I was just avoiding her on purpose. It's true that she invited me out to her place In Maryland on many occasions but I never felt like it was a good idea for some reason. Maybe I was intimidated but I mainly felt it would be an awkward situation spending time in a porn star's home. However, we continued to speak on the phone because at the time Angela was keen to set me up on dates with one of her girlfriends (which also didn't happen by the way).</p>
<p>My impression of Angela was that she was "a little girl lost". She was muddling through life, like everyone else, and wondering what everything meant. She kept busy with her photo shoots for her web site - apparently posting new galleries almost every week. She also told me that she worked in a Baltimore hospital, which always seemed very odd to me. However, I knew that the girl on the phone was the girl on the video, so I have no reason to doubt that was true. Angela often spoke about her close family who visited her frequently. She was very loyal to her parents and her brother, a policeman who was injured in a shooting during the time I was in contact with Angela. Angela also loved her three huge Rottweilers and she had a small group of friends with kids who would do normal things like barbecuing and watching the game on TV. Angela attached a great deal of importance to this support system of hers. Despite the vociferous disapproval of her mother for what Angela did for a living, Angela seemed to have found a balance in her life that was only missing one thing... her one true love and children of her own. She was seeing several people in the few years we spoke. One particular guy, a wealthy doctor with whom she was enamored, had asked her point-blank to give up the business but Angela didn't do as he requested. This guy flew Angela out to his place for weekends and sent her gifts which seemed to make her very happy. Despite the attention from rich and powerful men, she seems to have had some money problems from time to time. From what Angela told me, she had a lot of issues with trusting men but she really wanted a family of her own. She regretted having lost the baby in her first and only pregnancy. I think she was afraid she would be unable to bear a child in future and she often contemplated the issue of adoption. She poured out a lot of her feelings to me, a total stranger with a British accent. I think it was the accent that made her confide in me. The conversations often felt like confessionals or therapy sessions.</p>
<p>My contact with Angela eventually became less frequent and completely ceased about two years ago. At the time she was dating a younger guy that she was seemingly very happy with, although she seemed unsure if it was going to become anything long term. She talked to me at length and on several occasions regarding the issue of whether or not she would be able to continue in the porn business (which she absolutely loved) once she got into a serious relationship.</p>
<p>Angela spoke often about a dark period in her life and about the guy who got her into the business in the first place by sending some nude pictures of her into some publication or website (don't know which). A few years back there was (according to Angela) a big legal battle and public controversy between the two of them which degenerated into accusations that Angela had aborted a pregancy simply to get some kind of revenge on this guy, her partner at the time. Angela's side of the story was that she had a miscarriage and while she was dealing with that in hospital this guy cheated on her with one of her friends. Again, according to Angela, the guy was a drug addict and was involved in a lot of shady dealings in the area where both of them lived (Baltimore, Maryland... NOT Arizona, by the way). As the legal battle over the rights to the profits that Angela made continued through the courts, this guy was (according to Angela) shot and killed in some incident possibly related to some crime. I remember Angela calling me to tell me about the guy's death. She was shocked and upset. Despite all the hell that he put her through, Angela still had feelings for him. Interestingly, she did speculate about whether this guy had possibly faked his own death to avoid some trouble with other gangsters. The way the conversations would turn definitely made me feel there was some truth to her stories. However, although Angela said that the story was grist for the tabloid gossip columns in Maryland I could never find any reference to her legal battles or the gossip surrounding her miscarriage. Another odd episode was her involvement with some film project with "The Rock" in which she claimed to play have played the "love interest". She came out to Hollywood (where I live) on a few occasions and told me about her interactions with the famous ex-wrestler turned actor. Again, I never saw the project surface and couldn't help but wonder about the veracity of this story too.</p>
<p>My hope is that Angela is living the life she always wanted. Maybe she has a child now.</p>
<p>One last piece of information. If she is alive and well she still owes me $600. I sent it to her in her real name and I know for a fact that she picked it up at a Western Union in Baltimore. She assured me that she'd pay the money back within a week or two but never did. After a while I called her cell phone and left a few messages on her voicemail but she never returned my calls. Last time I called was probably a year ago or more. I haven't bothered to try the number again until now but it's disconnected as you'd expect. Some things certainly didn't add up with Angela, but I do know that she was (or is) a sweetheart with a good soul and that there was a real girl behind the facade. $600 is a small price to pay for what must have amounted to days of thought-provoking conversations about love, sex, life and death with a porn star. I begrudge her nothing and wish her all the best wherever she is.</p>

<dd>Much of what she told you may well be true, Simon, but I find it odd that she mentioned a policeman brother who got shot. I knew her personally, and know for a fact that that just isn't true. Makes you wonder. Anyway, may she rest in peace. AX.</dd>

<p>Response from Simon Holden:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, AX... I simply reported what I remember Angela telling me on the phone. If she doesn't have a brother in the Baltimore police then I've no idea why she would have told me that or why she would have apparently been so upset about it. Maybe she was trying out her acting talents, who knows? Personally, I think people should be careful about taking ANY information at face value. Your claim to know her "personally" is rather vague and unsubstantiated by any detail - as is your apparent conviction that the girl is, in fact, deceased. Maybe you can enlighten the people who are here searching for information as to the truth in the reports of her death. The recurring excuse "respect for the family" should not preclude the reporting of the manner and circumstances of a person's death. People die everyday, the famous, the infamous and the obscure alike. People die and it gets reported on TV and in newspapers. Why would the purported death of Angela Devi be any different? I view this as suspicious and I tend to believe that it is a fabricated story. People who come forward with vague claims of insider knowledge, yet without any detail as to the nature of their personal connection, only raises my suspicions more.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>JB, I understand this is one of your pet Wikipedia projects but it seems to me that the "discussion" posts shouldn't have the restrictions (regarding being verifiable and/or from other reliable sources) that make sense in the other areas. It seems like this is a gathering place for fragments and opinions which might coalesce into something meaningful if given chance. To label what I have contributed here as "original research" is stretching it. By all means "hearsay" or "gossip" but nothing happens in the world without it being interpreted by the people involved. When those people report their experiences, are they invalid unless filtered through the New York Times or Newsweek? I'm just curious about your standard of verification here and whether you really want to discourage the free contribution of first-hand reports.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simon (North Hollywood) email:nowis@sbcglobal.net</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's understandable, Simon. Part of the difficulty with disclosing too many details is that I don't want to be identified by people close to Angela as someone who's out on Wikipedia discussing her death. That would become a personal difficulty. And the reason I know it's for real is because I know people who went to the funeral and have spoken to them -- and the funeral very much involved the family, not anyone from Foxes.com. At the end of the day, there's nothing so suspicious about all this. It isn't unusual for a porn star to die -- happens with alarming frequency, especially by suicide. There's people all over the web disclosing her real name (which they shouldn't be doing, but oh well) and vouching for her death. They can't all be conspiring to cover up a mere contract dispute with Foxes. If they were all conspiring to let her live a life of peaceful, marital bliss, why would they state her name so openly? AX.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>AX, while I don't believe this is necessarily the case, isn't it possible that at least a few of those folks out there in Web Land, who are using her real name in the name of her death, are just those who happened to find out her real name from the few written sources that originally stated it, and heaven forbid ... are just saying she died, because they have a 50% chance of being right (dead/alive -&gt;50% chance either way)? Idiots ofcourse ...</p>
<p>Ofcourse, on the other hand, as you said, there are a number of people who have stated their affirmations that she indeed passed away along with her real name, so must all of those posts be all lies and fabrications??</p>
<p>Sigh ... this is all very disheartening, in every imaginable way. Unlike you and Simon, who were privileged to know a fine person as Angela, for the rest of her genuinely caring fan base, we are just left to construct weakly educated Decision Trees of what-if scenarios that at best leave us with a 51% chance of having any better clue as to the fate of our beloved Angela than if we had never conjectured in the first place. Darn ...</p>
<p>I could say, that if she did pass away, then why can't her family and Foxes just say some public statement out loud and clear for all to see?? Am I being that naive in asking so???</p>
<p>Now, this might hurt a bit to say, but I have to wonder out loud, espcially given that there was the infamous pullback on her web site, I've yet to see this thought thought anywhere stated, and that we've been groping amd meandering for a while on this for over a month and a half. (I say this very humbly ... but please prepare yourselves, as this may come across with a smack of temerity.)</p>
<p><i>But if she did pass away, and if it was a suicide, could it be that there is no such official statement because HER FAMILY blames all her fans for helping to construct the birds nest that helped to formulate the life she found not to be so happy?? And if so, they don't feel we deserve any statement, PERIOD????????????????????????</i></p>
<p>Ok, I asked it ... just wondering ...</p>
<p>In regards to original research, I hope that I've not rubbed heads against the boundaries of acceptable discussion and what is not. For me, and like most others, we are complete outsiders to the truth, so we can't speak with any assertions that can be argued under the umbrella of veracity. We only have questions, because we really care about Angela, and we are at lost what to think outside of our own sorrow and pain. Where else can we talk with such passioned, sincerity about this ... MySpace?? Gimme a break ... And who knows, as Simon stated above, maybe these questions, thoughts might lead to an opinion that can be verified so as to ascertain correctly in the quest of truth. At the same time, I understand the pursuit of an Enyclopedia; so no original research, as it needs to be verified by other sources so that ultimately a concensus amongst the informed can be obtained.</p>
<p>I should stop now ... I've said enough and I don't want to be a bore.</p>
<p>Signed, In Tears</p>

<dd>I feel for you, Tears. But on your question of why her family doesn't just come out and issue a statement: come on, you've gotta know some Indian families. This kind of thing is considered a shameful secret in Asian immigrant communities, not something to issue press releases about. That's the single biggest thing that will ever keep the details from emerging -- I'm not even sure they were aware of what all she was up to on the Net. AX.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ax, I have to tell you something. Actually, I knew that because of the Indian/Asian Cultures, this was reason enough for them not to make public comment.</p>
<p>I just didn't want to say that right off the bat, because in some weird way, I was afraid someone might think I'm stereotyping Indian Culture. And admittedly, maybe in some selfish manner, I just wish they could make a statement nevertheless. I am quite well aware of Chinese Culture, which I'd venture would view this in a somewhat similar manner.</p>
<p>A personal aside here. I remember referring an Indian friend of mine to her site in Fall of 2003 after I became aware of her, so impressed I was of her. The next time he saw me, he had the sternest look on his face, and gave me an earful over a lunch.</p>

<dd>I would respectfully disagree with you in one point: India is an amazingly diverse country, with almost every religious tradition in the world contained within. There are Indians who are Catholics, after all, and as such, they DO have funerals and burials. It would be more correct to say that <i>Hindus</i> usually have cremations. And it does matter that they are US citizens or are resident in the US, because they may decide to accept and follow the traditions of the US as well as (or instead of) the traditions of their country of ancestry. - <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 17:10, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A.D., you've got your terms mixed up. Hindus don't normally bury, but they do have funerals. A funeral has nothing to do with whether you're cremated or buried. It's just a (typically religious) coming-together of the deceased's loved ones as a final mark of respect. If a cremation isn't a form of funeral, then what is it? AX.</dd>

<p>Close To The Truth?</p>
<p>Its amazing the Illusions we create. Before the sad end to her life, my impression of Angela Devi was of a 26 year old happy and incredibly beautiful woman with the world (and men) at her feet, living in wealthy Scottsdale, making a fortune through her website and with ambitions to become an accountant/corporate P.A later in life.</p>
<p>The reality it would appear, is of a deeply unhappy &amp; confused woman of 30 with financial problems who until December of 2005, worked in a strip joint and was hopelesly in love with a married man of dubious character to the extent that she took her own life to end the pain.</p>
<p>I'm not judging, God knows I adored her but as in many cases, Truth is stranger than fiction.</p>
